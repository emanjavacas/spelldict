COn&sideringe with my+self (louinge Reader) many and sundrye times, how yt nothinge is so desired, so acceptable, or so necessarye in the time of daungerous infirmities, and pearel of bodely helth, as to preserue those yt are free of sicknes fro~ the violence of the same, and to restore the sicke, weake, and languishing paciente vnto his former estate and pristinate healthe, which thyng is performed by the noble and excellente knowledge of Phisicke: and again, howe that this Arte is exercised, yea of famous and learned men, which with out any great profit to the pacient, or worship to ye minister, because their medicines are negligently prepared: thought it my part, by this my trauail and expenses, somwhat to serue herein thy necessity.
Wherfor, haue caused this precious treasure to be translated into oure vsuall, and natiue language, that like as all men are subiecte to sicknes: so in likewise all men may by this occasion learne the way vnto helth.
And because thauthor (whose name spare to manifest, for feare of inuious detracters) do in many places of this his work, send the Reader vnto Philippe Vlstadius Brunsvvick: therfore will with expedition (if this my labors shall be thankfullye accepted,) also publishe them, sparing neither laboure, diligence, or charges for to bringe them bothe to their perfection, and also thy necessarye vse.
As touchinge the excellencye of the preparinge medicines, the vtilitie springinge therof, and the argumente of the worke, because it is exactlye sette oute by the author in the preface folowing, wil leaue to trouble the further herein.
The preface of the author to the Reader. Of the inuention of liquors and oyles destilled. Of the scope and end of this booke.
Whereof more also shalbe spoken about the end of the Preface. The praise of them that can be content to make commo~ the best and most effectuous medicins they haue. How much the dressing and maner of preparans auaileth in euery thing.
THe Art of destillatio~ (whiche they call Chymia, Alchimia, Alkimia, Chemia Suidas calleth it, and Alchemia) hath inuented many profitable things for ma~s life, and in Phisicke also certain meruelous thinges, and praise worthy, if a man prepare them righte and diligentlye.
For the lacke of knowledge, Couetousnes or negligence of Phisitions and commun Apothecaries is the cause why many such preparations are set litle by: and worthily, if you respect that which they prepare: vnworthely, if ye marke the Art it selfe, whiche certes is most excellent and most profitable: which semeth to be the cause why it lay hid so long, and began to come in vre very late.
Some ascribe vnto Hierom of Brunsvvick, which about .lxx. yeares past practised Phisick at Argentyn, the originall of getting out waters, as they cal them, and liquors and oyles out of simple medicines by the strengthe of fire: but they are much deceiued, for this Arte was not inuented by him, but wryten in our Dutch tung and first set out by him.
In mine opinion this inuencion is so au~cient as the inuencion of the very Chymia, which suppose was celebrated first and put in wryting by men that vsed the Punicall or els the Arabicke tonge, a litle after the age of the Grecian Phisicions, Of those speake that writ almooste the latest, as Aetius, Oribasius, Actuarius, Psellus.
In certain libraries in Italy euen at this day, are there extant certain wrytinges of Chymia by certain late Grecians, namely a certain Philosopher called Stephan: al so a boke intituled of the chaunging of metals, which co~munlye are called Chymia, or Arcymia.
There is also a boke to be had of Alchymia made by Auicenna vnto Assis a Philosopher.
Geber (the Nepheu of canne not tell what great Mahomet) who is celebrated as a captain and prince of this science, what age he liued in can not easily say.
Although iudge him not to haue bene the first in uentor of this Art, but one that broughte it to lighte and renouned it.
This man in his worke intitled Summae perfectionis, discoursinge excellentlye and disputinge manye things of destillacion generallye, writeth that diuers maners of destilling are knowne almost of all men, euen as an auncient inuencio~, yea in his time also, no new thing.
Certain late wryters declare the wrytinges of Alchymia not only of Albertus Magnus, S. Thomas, Rhaza, and Auicenna, Arabik Phisitions, but also of Aristotle, Plato and Salomon, at the least wise mention to be made by the~ of it: to whome geue small credence, not that thincke this studye to be the newer, but certes that it was ether vnknown to these philosophers or mentioned in no place.
Some there be that expound feetly and wittily al the feinings of the Poets, and chieflye that of the golden fleece, sought by the Argonautae, vnto the multiplying of Golde or Art of enterchaunging of metalles.
Some also ascende higher, and make the first men by and by after the beginnidg of the world, authors therof.
Some simplely make it most auncient, and affirme that no certainty is to be had of the first inue~ters.
At Padvvay in Italy in our time was found a most auncient monument, namely an erthen pot, hauing written vpon it this Hexasticon.
Plutoni sacrum munus ne attingite fures, Ignotum est vobis hoc quod in vrna latet.
Nanque elementa graui clausit digesta labore, Vase sub hoc modico, Maximus Olibius: Adsit foecundo custos sibi copia cornu, Ne praetium tanti depereat laticis.
This sacred to God Pluto (theues) ware that ye touch not, Vnknown is it to you all, this that is hid in a pot.
For the elements hath ishut vp digested with much pain, In this smal vessel the great Olibius certaine.
Plenty with thy fruteful horn as a gard be thou present, Least the price pearish of this liquor most excellent.
Within this pot was an other litle pot with the inscription of these verses.
Abite hinc pessimi fures Vos quid voltis cum vostris oculis emissitiis? Abite hi~c vostro cu~ Mercurio petasato caduceato{que} Maximus maximo donum Plotoni hoc sacru~ facit Away fro~ he~ce ye mighty theues, trudge els wher go by, What seke ye with your spying eies, why do ye por pry Hens with your hatted Mercury, and with his rod also.
This gift is sacred by the greatst vnto the greatest Ploto.
Again, within this little pot was found a light yet burning betwene two Phials, the one of Gould, the other of Siluer, ful of a certain mooste pure liquor, by the vertue wherof they beleue that this lighte had burnte manye a yeare, as did noote in their collections and gatherings of old auncient inscriptio~s or Poesies Petrus Appianus and Bartholom eus Amantius Hermolaus Barbarus also in his Corollarium or addicion vpon Dioscorides made mention of this same thing, wheras he entreateth of waters in co~mun.
There is also (saith he) a heauenlye water, or rather diuine of the Chymistes, whiche boothe Democritus and Mercury Trimegistus knewe: callinge it sometimes a deuine water, somtimes a Seythicall liquor, somtimes pneuma, that is, spirit of the nature of the firmament, and of fift essens or substance of things: wherof potable gold, and that philosophers stone much spoken of, but not yet fond, consisteth.
Hereupon also is the name geuen vnto the art calling it Psammurgicall, and misticall, and Annophysiall and holy, and greatest: as thoughe it had certaine secreate letters, and such as it should be conueniente to kepe and restrein the profane commun people from.
This kinde of liquor, as suppose, dothe the Epigram signifye of late found within the field of Padua nie vnto the village called Atesta, made vpon earthen or bricke mettal, and therfore frail, and broken vnwares by the handes of a man of the country digging the ground in the same place.
The reme~+brance wherof least it should pearish we haue added hereunto the very wordes.
Therfore it appeareth that the study of this Art was of moste antiquitie amongste the Barbarus nacions, but deriued vnto the Romains and Grekes somwhat late, ne+ther before perauenture that the Romains obteined the dominion of a great part of the worlde: or if sooner yet couertly reteined emongst a very fewe.
Cicendulae shine in the night (saith Cardane) teach vs that a liquor may be made that may shine in the dark.
It is made certes by the putrifying of those things that haue most erceding bright+nes, light perspicuitie.
dout not but it is possible to be made, wherof and how, am vncertain.
But these things are almost besides our matter, sauing that it mighte seme vtterly that the way to sublimate destil, as they term it, hath had his original of the Chimists, continued also alwais wt their art: was opened vnto the me~ of our parte of the world the~ first, whe~ as ye world being made known bi+thimpery of the Romains, sundry kinds of spices also diners medicins vnknown befor to the men of Europe, to the Grekes Latins also, began to be brought in: and afterward also more, what time as the Mauritans me~ learned in the Arabik tung doctrin, possessed a great part of Spain, wherby certain bokes of learned me~ cam vnto vs: amongst the latter sort, as think, the works of one Bulca+sis Benaberazeris who in the place wher he intreteth of the preparation of medicins, teacheth also of many things to be sublimated destilled.
About the age of the same ma~ almost, think Iohannes Mesue was famous, who~ we read to haue liued about ye yere of our Lord.
But be me~cioneth none other destild waters the~ of Roses Wormwod.
The vsa of metalli things sublimated is far more auncient, at the leaste wise touching the tradition or tretises of authors, like wise is the vse of oyls that are made by descension or downwarde as in Rasis Aetius.
certain ma~ (whose name spare to rehers,) writ of late that these maner of destilled liquors wer not vnknown to the latter Greke writers, vsing this argument, that destilled liquors are sometimes named in the writings works of Actuarius, And in dede he nameth in so~e places Rhodostagma, as in his Iulep against ye cogh: a litle folowing in an other Iulep intybostagma.
But wt these words is signified nothing els the~ a simple syrup of Roses or Endiue.
Sieth .ii. sextars of the iuice of Roses yt nails wherof are take~ away, one sertar of hony skimming it til the .iiii. part be consumed.
Ye a litle before also he describeth Hydrorosatu~ rosed water, that also far differing fro~ a destiled liquor, or water destild for it consisteth of .iiii. pounds of Roses the nailes take~ away .v. sextaries of water: ii. sextaries of hony.
The Arabians also or their expositors, when they speake of the water of any plant, they vnderstand the decoctio~ of it in water: and likewise Nicolas Myrepsus that writte in Greke of the compositions of medicines, whome it appeareth to be a verye late wryter, by the barbarous woordes that he vseth very oft: wherin maruel this, that no me~tion is made by him of waters or oyles prepared in Chymistical instruments.
Only the oyl Capnistum or smoked, that is destilled by descention, doth he describe, as Aetius also.
Moreouer, the thinges that the Chimistes make may comprehend in .ii. kindes for the moste parte, that they be ether liquors or Massy things, the liquors againe are ether watery or oyly: and these ether aiery or fiery.
The Massy things, are ether such as rest in the bottom: or such as are caried vpwarde: and that .ii. waies, ether as pure bodies and substauces, as they which they cal sublimated, quick siluer. &c. or Sout for the remedies of the eies wyth Phisicions.
There be also other artificial manner of preparings, wherwith the purest and most effectual parte in medicines is drawne out, and as it were the forme is separated from the matter.
And although am not greatly trauailed nether in the Chymistical nor in the other manner of preparings, but by the way haue got the kuowledge of certain thinges, partly by mine own experience in some things, partlye of myfrends: yet what so euer and how much so euer this is, wil communicat it with the studions of Phisick: not as though entend to teach perfectly and absolutely the very Art of destilling and preparing of other things, but as it were wryting vnto such as now already are not all voyde and withoute knowledge of these things, hauing ether experimented them selues or red other mens wrytings.
For haue nothing so exrelle~t or secrete, but couet it might ge abrode to the publik and common profit, and although in smal wealth, yet haue ben euer of nature ready to communicate and make any man priuye of any cunning had, which som referre vnto simplicitie or childishnes, other some better to the liberalitie of my disposition.
There be some that do vtterly cloke and kepe secrete their things, and that diuers kinde of men: some for Ambicion, that they maye haue wherewith to excell and pas other menne: some also for couetousnes, to get gayne thereby: other thorowe the ignoraunce of the aunciente wryters, as thoughe there were not put in wrytinge ether the same or far better by men of antiquitie, whiche now are despised of many, and a folish and vnsaciable lust is ther alwais to find out new things.
Ther wantes not such as think, great and effectual medicins shuld be kepte secrete for this cause, least vncunning men, as many practicioners be, without al reason almost, and al learnynge, might abuse them, and conuert those thinges whiche are inuented for the helth of me~, to their destruction.
To such wold answer, As no kind of euil ought to be committed for this intent that any good thing might follow therof: so that which is good ought not to be left vndone, leaste som euil might ensue, for the world shal neuer be without them that wil abuse good things and profitable inuencions.
But good men, simplely suche good thinges as they haue, they make them common, and wil not stick nor cese to do so because they feare, that certain leud persons may do hurt therby.
But wil leaue of this disputation, thye do protest sincerely as thinck withal my hart, that couet by my example to stur vp learned and good Physions, that laying apart al Ambition, Couetousnes, Ignorance, Enuy, if they can bring any excellent thinge vnto our profession, that they wold do it gentlely and publikely.
As for the vnlearned certes, they in ministring not only these great and effectual medicines, of whiche sorte we shal put diuers in wrytinge heare, but meates also and most common drinkes, out of time, do hasard and brynge mens liues manye times to diseases and deathe: and it is well known that Hippocrates writ how our Ptisan ministred not in due time, was the cause of death to a certaine man sick of the Pleurisy.
These therfore ought to be lefte partly to their ignorance, partly to their leude malapartnes.
But they that haue nede of the Physicion are to be admonished to do that in Phisicke, that all men are wont to do in al other Artes: that is, to chuse good Physicions, and learned, and such as exercise and practise this Art by their profession, both with reaso~s, as a part of Philosophy and also in the very actions and doinges of cures.
The preparing therfor (as say) is of the greatest moment and weight in euerye matter.
In Rhetorik vtterans, gesture, and pronunciation more almost moue the mindes of the hearers, then the very argument that is handled.
Hereupo~ it cometh that things put in meter and in numbers, do delite so greatly: which if a man vtter in proos, they shalbe taken for cold, dnl and solishe.
Hereof cometh it that one beinge asked the question what was the chiefest thinge in an orator, answered pronunciation: what was the next and the third: the same.
Shewes and plaies, that thei delite the hearers and behol+ders so greatly, it is much more long of the form and maner of their forniture and preparance then of the matter plaied or shewed.
In like maner in the verye thinges and workes, the forme, the fashion, figure, maner, aswel of nature as of Art, finally a certain preparation is more marked and commended then the matter.
Likewise in physsk, the conninge to prepare thinges aright, and the descression to minister them aptly, haue the greatest moment and skil moste.
Nether is it of greater force what thou ministrest, then in what maner.
And althoughe there be manye circircumstances to be considered, that thou maist exhibit the medicin aright, yet the maner, and the preparing is with in the medicine, and is at it were the form therof and part the other circumstaunces are withoute it, as time, place, and such things as are to be considred about the sickman.
But letting pas other waies of dressing and preparing at this prese~t, we wil onli touch those, bi the which al the ver+tue and faculti or operation is separated from the substa~ce of the medicins, so that ye more liquid and moyst, the more pure and subtil part of euery remedy or medicin, maye be bad seuered and drawn out from the grose and erthy part: whether it be gathered into a liquor drawn out of the sam remedy or medicin or into an other certaine ertarnall. &c. which the barbarous wryter Arnold calleth Eruirtuare to outuerteuat, or Excorporare, to outcorporate.
Furthermore, if sumthings shal seme to be written somwhat curiously or double diligently, ye must consider that suthe pertain not to the Physicions of the common people and pore fooke, but to such as abound more with riches and ease, haue plenty of seruants, or such as remain in Prynces or Kings courts: or also to Philosophers, that busilye searche out the meruelous mutacion and vertues of natural thinges, and in them delite them selues.
To conclude, let no man maruel that so great and longe commendacions and praises are added to certain medicines, as vnto the Quintessences as they call them, to Aqua vities, made and that vnto some meruelous vertues are attributed, as to sharpen the wit and memory, to co~serue the senses and youth.
When as euen by the auncient Grekes Latins also we read such effects and operacions to be ascribed to Triacle and other preseruatiues and compositions, specially by the Arabians vnto diuers things, yea euen of Galen also vnto Triacle.
Ther be som that wil not auow, and whose credit leaue to the authors, whose names write euery where.
But it is said before alreadye, that we wryt all these thinges for the learned and discreate men, which for the most part shall iudge more easily how much credit is to be geuen to euery thinge.
Althoughe in verye many it is not sufficient to be furnished with learning and iudgement, excepte experience and practise be ioyned also therwith.

[Figure: [leaf motif] VVhat Destillation is, and of diuers formes and kyndes.
DESTILLATION not distillatio~ (as lerned x] doe write) is the drawyng forthe of a thinner and purer hu+mor out of a iuise, by the force of heate: Siluius.
Destillation by ascentio~ or going vpwarde, is when the vapours or fume is caried vp and be there gathered together into wa+ter so droppe doune: The same authour.
Moist thinges put into a body (for so do they cal the bigger xx] vessell, from whence the vapur is lifted vp) by the force of heate are extenuated into a vapour, whiche gathered together by the coldenes of the head or other thing, into water, is receiued for the most part, by a chanel or gutter made in ye brinks of the head, and so dropeth doune and destilleth by the noos (for so do they communly term that part of the head, very neer resembling ma~s noos, both in fashion and in vse) into some vessell sette vnder for the purpose, men call it a receiuer or a vrinall: Siluius.
Certain like things natur hath wrought, both in exhalatio~s aboue in the aire, specially the~ xxx] that be moist, and also in reumes destilling from the head both of men certain other beastes, vnto the lower partes.
Therfore of a plant or any other substaunce ordeined to be destilled: what part of it is most meet to be extenuated and fynet (that is the purest parte, the lightest, the thinnest, the moistest, and the most superficial parte next vnto the vttermost partes of the body) being first of all fyned by the force of heet, is lifted vp: next suche other partes as in puernes cum nie to the first and last suche a moysture of the thinges as is more grosse that held together the earthly partes, a certain x] fatnes and oylines, by a stronger force of the fyre, is seperated, and take~ vp hoolly: which once clean drawn forthe, the body remaineth dissolued and brought into asshes.
Oute of all maner of plantes therfor, and beastes: Yea out of al partes of them bothe, a certain raw waterishnes, and as it were a fleumatick and excrementall parte, is first drawen oute: then cumyth forth that whiche is better disgested and more pure: last of all an oylines: whiche also euen oute of the very bones xx] may be gotte~, and not only out of massy partes: sauing that certain partes ar of so scleuder and thin substance, ye they yelde vp almost all their moister strength at the first.
Morouer, all this drawing oute of humors, is done with heet.
For that kinde of Destillation, that is done by a shred of wullen cloth, (they cal it a filter) or by grauel, a raw earthen vessell, a vessell of iuye trie (Plinie, thinke, writes of the wode that is called Smilax, how it willet sype through water mixt with wyne, and xxx] kiep the wyne still: which once proued found it trewe) but this is no destillation in deed, except vnto suche as speake improprely.
For that which is proprely called destilation is done by heet: and that from the sonne, or of fyre, corruption and rot tennes: By the sonne, as certain men haue inue~ted, to draw of flowres a kind of water, very nere to them selues in smell and other pleasaunt qualities.
By fyre, that is, by flame that come of aere and of aereall bodies: or els by burning cooles, that are made of earth or earthly bodies enkindled, x] destillation is made, ether by no other thing betwixt, or by the meanes of hoat water, or also by the vapour and feume of the same, by fine sand or dros of metall polished and made plaine.
Morouer the flame it selfe, aswell as the coole, is diuers, not onely in respect of that it is great and little, but also of the woode whether it bee rotten and doated, or sound, stinking, or wel smelling: grene or drie.
Besides this it is a great matter what bignes the furnace be of, what fashion, xx] what ioyning together.
Also the coole of smothered and half burnd wode, giueth a certain strong sauour, and a quality far vnlyke to the thinges destilled: as we see it doeth to thinges boyled and otherwyse prepared therwith.
Therefor let the cooles be all fired, and halfbrent, that the ill sauour be expired before that the thing to be destilled be committed vnto them: specially if it be receiued into the body: for in suche thinges as ar to be vsed without, it forceth lesse, al this saith Syluius. xxx] In the destillation of wyne the foure elementes ascende vp in their order: the lightest, subtilst, and hoatest first, that is, the fire: secondarily the aire: thirdly water: the earth remaineth in bottome: and lykewyse iudge in the destillation of vineger. x] In more grosse earthly thinges, yet moyst also, whiche besides the watery partes, haue also some grose and such as may be made thicke as in the teares that run out of tries or gu~mes, in ioyces, in rosin and in hony, that which is more watery is caried vp first, the airy partes next, the firy last of al, ye earthy partes remain in the bottome: and if the fier be any thyng bigg they ar burnt.
In metalles, the same ar resolued into vapours, and congeled together, sticke to the lembeck, the coloure chaunged into whyt, as quick syluer, arsnike. &c. Saltpeter. &c.
The nature of fyre is to deminishe (as Cardane xx] saith) ether by breaking drye thinges into peces, as when it bringeth grauell into dust: or by melting, as metalles: or by separating the subtill and pure partes as in destillations.
It chaunceth in destillations notwithstanding, that a thing shall both be extenuated and mixt with an other, when as they ar done with a moyste heat, not with fyre.
This is doon sumtyme by setting the vessels in hoat water: whiche is called Balneum xxx] Mariae.
The best kinde of destillation next vnto this, is in hors dong.
Then by asshes: the best in this kynde, is by the superfluous refuse of oliues, after the oyle is prest forth, for it being a hoat moyst matter, will reteyne his heat very long, yea a great meany of monethes: and so muche the lo~ger then the kurnels of grapes, because the substance of the oliues is thicker fatter.
But none x] of thies wayes is able to melt metalles, but they must nedes haue fyer.
Albeit as the most vehement and feruent destillation is done by fyre: so is it vnmiet for mixture and true attenuation, or fyning: and the way by asshes is almost lyke vnto it. for if a man will put thinges destilled by fyre vnto their own dregges and mixt them together, he shall perceiue the quantity for quantity, heuier then they were afore, and dryer also.
Therfor fyre doth not truely attenuat and lessen in dede, but that nature whiche digesteth mixeth the hoole substa~ce.
Wherfor through their puritie, al ioyne xx] together in one, and the thing mixt, is made thicker: notwithstanding that is composed and made of the most subtill and the purest partes.
Therfor in naturall digestion and siething, whiche to melt the hardest thinges, hath also the force of fyre, and the strength of soft and easye bath in extenuating and lesning the same: the more grosse and massy partes on broken into peces, whiche can not be brought to pas with fyre.
The heat of the first degree, whiche is moderate, as of hors dong, and Balneum Mariae, is called the heat of digestion, resolution, putrefaction, maceration, and of circulation, wherof wee shall xxx] speake more in place conuenient.

Brunsvvicke Suche co~mune things as ar put into a rose still, to be destilled, it is best not to put myche in at once, least they that be nethermost be dryed away and burnt, those that lie aboue remai+nyng xx] yet almost hoole, and as they were put in.

chapter, saith thus: when per+ceiued in the commun waters that ar destilled out of plantes by fyre, nether the smell nor the taste remaine, but many times the contrary (for the water of wormwode perceyued to be x] sweet, of Mint and Basill, came water rather stinknyge then well smellyng: whereby well perceiued that the water alone had not the same vertues that the hoole herbe had) began carefully to muse, and to consult also with those that of suche waters ar called communly chymici, by what deuise bothe the smell and the tast might be preserued in thies waters, that is founde in the hoole herbe.
It were longe to wryte all the ways, whiche proued to finde oute thies thinges: yet xx] one will touche, whiche semeth to me to be the best and the easiest waye.
That is by the vapoure and smoke of hoat water, in a double vessell. &c. Syluius.
Waters destilled, reteyne and kiepe still the vertues of the simples wheroute they be drawne: sauing that they ar more pure stronge, the oftener they be destilled, whiche wee proue in the water of wyne, for the most part, very seldome in other thinges.
The vertues of licore destilled, some doo alter xxx] and chaunge ether by smering the head of the still with some matter, as hony, Ladanum and suche like, or els by putting it in ye nose of the stil, which serueth for the most parte, to the grace of the smel: for thei bind muske, cloues, Caphura and such like x] in bundels, and put them in the top of the nose, that the licore passing thorow thies matters, may get a swiet sauour.
If so be it yt fyre maketh al thinges hoat and drye: all waters gotten by destillation, ought to be hoat and drye.
Nether dothe the watery substance disproue this, for when as brenning water is suche, it doth both bren and mightly make hoat and dry mens bodies.

And this maner is called of the philosophers, to sette Starres in the skye. xxx] Therfor men be wont to axe whether these wa+ters reteyne and kiep their owne propre vertues and strength.
Wee once saide, whyles wee entreated of the euill maner of curing, that they are no strengthes nor vertues, because they are destitute of sauour and taste.
For water of wormwode, nether smelleth like wormwode, nor is bitter yea that is more wonder, it is sumwhat swiete.
Yet burning water (to speake nothing of Rose water) well declareth that ther is a certaine vertue and efficacie in waters.
For if you will say it is suche because of fyre: how commeth it to pas that none x] other water is like it? for this doth marueilously make hoate, dryeth, perceth, hath a sharp smell, burneth.
It is plain therfore now, that there is strength and vertues in waters: but not in al waters, nor equall with that they be drawn oute of. for what things soeuer haue a thinne substaunce ioyned with colde, gyue a water not vnlyke to the~ selues, as the Rose.
They that haue a thin and hoat substance, giue a lyke water, but burning withall, as wyne and certain metals.
Suche as haue a grosse and hoat substance, giue an vnlyke xx] water and an euill, as wormwod.
Such as haue grosse and colde, they giue vnlyke, but not euill, as the Gourde.
According to this reason, suche strengthes of waters as ar receiued with soft fyre ar easy to be learned.
for suche as require a vehemenr fyre, doo all vehemently drye, for the most parte also, make hoate.
But me thinkes thies thinges would be more diligently considered and weyed.
First, wher he xxx] saieth that wormwode water is not bitter: it is trew, if a man destill it negligently as the co~mun apothecaries ar wont, in leaden limbeckes.
but destill it in Balneo Mariae, and see whether it shall lacke his smell and tast, or no.
Yea, it shall retain boeth, and that effectuously, not only this herbe, but also any other plant whatsoeuer it be, hauing any sauoure or taste: if it be dried and weikte or stiept in wyne a few dayes, then destilled in Balneo Mariae or by asshes gentely, as shall shewe further within.
Now when certain thinges haue x] great plentie of their smel, and that so strong that it vanisheth not of a long space, whiche cummeth bycause the force of smelling is digested equally into the hoole of them: it is no wonder, if in the same vesselles some waters bee destilled lyke vnto their plantes, as of Roses, whiche as Theophrastus wryteth, doo reteine their sauour very long: other sum be vnlyke to their plantes. for suche waters as haue their vertue and force in the vttermost and superficial partes, they fume xx] out easyly, as of wormwode, whose smell may be iudged to bee in the same place where his bitter taste is conteined: whiche wee fynde to be only in the vtter and superficiall parte.
For if thou separate the barke from the stalke or the braunches, thou shalt fynde that whiche is within to be vnsauery or vnswiete.
Therfor this difference is not to be required of the grossenes or puritie of partes, although thinke it also to be of some force: but rather of this, that the strength of any thing xxx] is ether distributed equally through ye hoole pla~t, or els more nie to the midest or vtter parte of the same.
am surely of that mynde with Raimunde Lullus, that water of the same qualitie may be goten oute of any plant whatsoeuer it bee, of colde plantes, colde water: of hoat, hoat: of dry, dry: of moyst, moyste.
But will not graunte that the same vertue remaineth, except lyke sauour, or like taste or bothe, (as in smelling thinges (be left.

It were good if euery water once destilled, were powred again, yea or the thyrde tyme vpon his own dreggees beaten, and to be suffred to putrify two or thre dais, and so to be destilled again: or rather, not vpo~ his own dregges that remain, but vpon other like herbes of the same kynde, and to putrifie in a circulatory or a blynde limbeck, and to be destil+led: [Figure: Brunsvvick xx] as reme~ber me make mention therof.
In certain, ye first destillation is sufficient, as in Roses.

Men say that in Tartaria, water of milke destilled maketh men dronke.
But euery water, not an element (that is alone without any mixture) but lyquor or iuyce mixt and compounded, being oft destilled may doo the same: for it x] wareth hoat, is fyned and made more pure, and receiueth more the force offyre.
Wherupon burning water being oft destilled, is brought to suche sharpnes that it can not bee dronke.
Also a lyquor or other thing be destilled, the thicker it is, the more it semeth to conceiue heate and fyre, if it be oft destilled.
It is manifest (saith Cardane) that a water may be made whiche shall inco~tenent breake the stone in the bladdar, if it be put in by a squirt or syring. xx] for whan as two thinges ar necessary, bothe that it breake the stone, and that it hurt not the bladdar, the maner and matier wil performe the first: for we shall receiue the last vapors of the asshes of scorpions, or of persily of Macedonia, or of the precious stone called Tecolittius, or of the stones of crabes. for so may a water be made, to breake also the red marble.
Moreouer, that it shall not hurt the bladder, is brought thus to pas, if the mattier out of which the water is taken be voyde xxx] of all saltnes.

Of Balneum Mariae generally, and of those destillations that be done by vapors of hoat xxx] water and in horse dong.
HOat water or els ye vapour of the same, send les strength into the thing that is to be destilled, then other fyre alone or els suche other dry meanes as are me~cioned before.
for yt cause as Galen saith Diploma, that is, a double vessell (the Apothecaries as the men that still lyquors also, cal it Balneum Mariae) melteth, heateth, seatheth those thinges whose strengthes the violence of fyre wil not dispers nor separate: so, suche thinges as be tender and ge~tle, x] if we will haue them hoal, we must destill them in hoat water, or els in the vapour fume therof.
Whiche although men thinck they be not so durable, they be yet les altered from their nature, as is manifest by their former smell.
[Figure: You must haue a fornace of this sor, vpon the whiche you shall set a great brasen vessel ful of water, xx] in that brasen vessel set litle vessels in a circle as many as it wil receiue, in the botome, of the which ves+sels the thinges that you will destill, must be put.
Other builde ye fornace otherwise as though it were a xxx] toure, and in the sydes thereof they put long earthen vessels: in their broad bottoms sta~ding inward, they conteine the thinges that they will destill the mouth without as though it wer a bottell being couered, in the which ye vapour caried vp by his open bely gathered together, and by the long mouth of the same droppeth down.
[Figure: But why remayneth not the smell of certain floures in the waters but in Iasmin, x] and ye floures of Cariophillum, and the water commeth forthe wtoute sauour? the reason is declared otherwher: bycause yt vnto so sclender and thinne substaunce, no substancial and thick parte is ioyned.
Ther xx] for in thies it shall do well, if vnto the leaues of herbes voyde of smell being put by course vnto a thicker mattier, but not suche as wil burn, a smell be ioyned, and then destilled: and this is ye onely hope to get forth the smell, when as suche thinges as are infused and put in waters doo not giue again their smel, but putrify: Cardan.
It ap+peareth without doubt that those floures shoulde be destilled in Balneo Mariae, or in vessels of glas xxx] in the vapor of hoat water.
Balneum Mariae may be hansomly made hoate with a great pype of copper set in the midst, in the bottome wherof is a grate for ye ashes to auoyde at: men call it communly a stowe harry.
Vpon that pype, do they make a couer of copper wt a small pype comming out a shore, to cary and conuey the smoke out at a window or some hoale.
(So doo they also make warme house flors nowe a dayes to bathe in.)
The co~moditie of this pipe is then x] chiefly when a ma~ list to vse many stillatories put+ting the~ in a rou~d circle E, a ten or twelue at once, to spare time, labour and cost.

The herbes yt be to be destilled in a bathe or otherwise, some doo pun them, and let the~ remaine so a whyle, (perauenture for certain dayes) befor they still them, thinking to haue more plenty of water xxx] therby: if they woulde doo it in closed vessels, specially in a hoat place, it wer well: but the most apothecaries and other, that sieke most for lucre gayne therby, leue it in cold places in open cofers, till the herbes lose theyr smell, and bee corrupted with a moyst and gros aire.
Some there be that put some sande also in the water of Balneum Mariae, to thintent the heat mai be the greater and more vehement: as Mathaeol{us} of Sena in ye water that is called aqua philosophica against the frensh pocks.
And he affirmeth that x] in such a kind of destillation there may be gotten a double water, the first, more thin and waterye, the other more read.
The water of Balneum Mariae oughte to be no hoater, then that a man may suffer his finger in it: Brunsuicensis.
Vlstadius prescribeth the destillation of a certaine kinde of aqua vitae in Balneo Mariae, to be done with so slow a fire, that a man may tell one, two, three, vntil seauen, before a drop fall. xx] Of such things as pertain to the commun wai of Balneum Mariae, you shall reade more with in where we make mention of aqua Camphorae out of Bulcasis, and of Rose water out of the same.
This waye of destillation in Balneo Mariae, is vsed also to the rectifying (as they terme it) of oyles, to draw and purge the fleame from them, for only the waters and nothing els may be lifted vp and drawn out by the heat of the bath, the oyle remaining stil in the bottome. xxx] When as perceiued that waters, as they ar accustomed commonly to be destilled out of pla~ts, they kiep nether their taste nor the same smell: began carefully to think apon the matter and to try many waies, yt might finde a meanes how to preserue and kiep in the waters the same qualities.
It shold be lo~g to reherse al the wayes yt proued.
Onli one wil touch, which semed to me to be the best and ye easyest.
That is this, to work on this wise in a double vessell, after the manner that Galen woulde all oyntmentes to he made, x] but so that the bottom [Figure: of that vessel wherin the herbe is conteined B, do not touch the water that boyleth in the bigger D, but that it wax hoat with nothinge els then the fuming moysture lifted vp from the same. xx] for by the meanes of yt soft heate, vapors are drawn out of the hoal substance of the herb, which are turned into such water that reteineth and kepeth the strengths of euery part of the herbe, and that dothe manifestlye appeare, aswell by the smel as by the taste.
Albeit things destilled in this wise, although thei xxx] kiep more perfectly the strengthes and qualities of the plants (as the former smell, yet for asmuche as they be corruptuous, they can not be long kept: Syluius.
The chief vse of dong, or as som term it, a hors belly, is such: that the mater which is to be destilled in a glasen vessell set in the dong maye be prepared by the heat therof, as we shall declare more at large in his place, wher we shall make mentio~ of putrifactio~ and rotting.
It is possible notwith+standing for destillation to be brought to pas in x] same, if ether pouerty or ani other impediment be that a man can not haue fire.
Of this kinde of destillation see more within, wheras we entreate of the prepation, to destill.
The heate of hors donge (because of the lime that is mixt therwith) Brunsvvick supposeth to excede in the middle degree, the heat of Balneum Mariae.
If you desire to haue a water destilled of the fleshe of any beast, you shall strangle the beast, yt it bleed not in any wise, then take away al the fat xx] and shred the fleshe in small pieces, and so destill it in hors do~g (or with a soft fire) least the waters stink, or sauour of brentnes, which is wont easelye to chaunce: wherefore it is best to destill them twise.
The parts of beast or excrements, as blud, the liuer, the lights, eggs, gall, and oxe dong, oughte to be destilled in hors dong, with vessels not very close stopt (but hony and milk a man may stop the~ close) least the water stink.
But if it chaunce to xxx] stink euen thus ordred, then let it be destylled again in Balneo Mariae, specially the water of excre me~ts of oxen whose first destillatio~ is scarse fou~d without stench: Brunsvvick.
It wold frame better if a man put to a litle curtsy of salt in the putrifying or destilling of dong, that they maye corrupte the lesse.

[Figure: OF Worme wode water Iohannes Mesuae hath made mencion: and of it and of Rooses only, as the Munks that writ apon Mesuae haue noted, that it is xx] to be supposed, ther is a cer+tain excellent vertue aboue other in thies .ii. destilled liquors, if they be rightlye prepared: but as commun apothecaries maketh them the wormwode water lacketh all odour and tast, as is said before.
If so be it anye man desire to haue this liquor moore strong, let him stiep the wormwood xxx] dry in win, and destill it in Balneo Mariae, or if yet stro~ger, in ashes.
But such as be destilled first stiept in any liquor, the waters of thies now ar not simple but compound: of the which we shal write hereafter seuerally.

The water destilled of the swiete blacke and freshe Cheries, is maruelously co~mended of Remaclus F. of Lymburg: Assone (saith he) as it shalbe powred into the mouth of one sick of the falling euill alredy taken with ye fit (the potion of it is .iiii. drammes or moor) by by he reuiueth refreshed, neither is he any moor drawen together with any cramp, til in the ordinary x] tyme, as it is the custome of it, after a fewe daies an other fit come vpon him: whiche when it chaunceth, it must be powred in again: for it letteth, taketh away and healeth the fit.
Take one of the vessels for Rose water, that is called baten (that is a bely) fill it with the sticks or cips of pynappull tree whiche hath great and brood leaues, and let it be filled.
Siluius taketh it so as though the roose water should be poured to the chips of the pynappull tree, but me thinkes yt xx] the vessell of rose water is simply named heer for a cucurbita or bely, that it may be a certayn repeti+cion of the same whiche he had spoken before, and let it be couered with a vessell hauing a nose: then put the bely into a brasen vessell ful of water ouer the fyre, till it begin to boyl: for an oyll shall destill (and yet they denye that oyll may be lifted vp by the heat of water) subtill of a good odour, whiche is called water of Camphora.
Or if ye list destill it xxx] in a fornace of rosewater, the same way that it is destilled.
But Belluensis sayth that water of Camphora according to the Arabians (saith he) is a water that runneth out of the tre that bryngeth the Camphora: which as his tree also is of a hoot nature in third degree: so Camphora it self is cold: Monachi in Mesuae.

It is better made with water then without: better also by fire of cooles then of x] wood: wherfore of the iiii. waies whyche be withoute water wyth flaming woode: without water with coles: with water flaming wood: with water and fire of cooles: the first is the worst, and yeildeth xx] a water of the least smell: the second is better then it: the third then the second: but the fourth is best of all.
And will here describe thee third (whiche is made with water and woode flaming, as it is in vse wt the kinges of Aharach.
A. Thou shalt make therfore in a large house by a wall a litle berchile so doth he cal the vessel that is filled with water the bottom and sides shalbe of leede, so wel closed, that it leek not in anye place.
Then make meete a xxx] couering vnto this vessell of glas or glased earth, and make two or three round hooles in it moore or les, according to the largnesse of the vessels, and as you desire to ether muche or little water D, then make a pot of bras like to the pot made in Balneo Mariae, which thou shalt set vpo~ the fornaice, so that the Berchile aboue the furnaice be lower in situacion then the potte, (so that it maye conduite the heate of the fyre of the Berchyle, to the pott: but mee thinkes thies woordes dooe ether redounde or be depraued.)
Thou shalt also x] make a chimney by the whiche the smooke maye auoyde hoolly out of the hous, that it hurt not the rosewater.
Afterward fil a pot with water, which may be in a well (a great vessell) made by the pot lyke a well in a bathe.
Then kindling the fyre vn+der the pot, thou shalt conuey the boyling water by a pype retching from the pot into the berchile, and fill the pot again of other could water oute of the well.
In the berchile also shalt thou make a pype, by the whiche the water when it is full may xx] run out of the hous.
Thou shalt set the cucurbites or belies (that is the stillatory vessels) in the holes of the couering of the berchile, and shalt bynd the~ rouling linnen clothes about, that they may sta~d stedfast in their hooles, and the vapour of the water go not out.
Lykewyse the heades of them shalt thou bynd with a linnen cloth.
And let thies vessels be of glas or of glased earth.
Then put in the Roses, and sette vpon euery one his couer: and set vnder the nose of euery one a phiall to receiue xxx] the rose water that runneth out: when the destillation is finished, put away the first rooses, put in freshe: thus saith Bulcasis.
Some man would maruell, that in suche a makinge of the fornace, where the fyre is not put vnder the duble vessell or berchile (as coniecture, seing he maketh the bottome and sydes of leed) but at the syde of the fornace, wherfore he should thinke it to skill anye thing, whether the fyre put vnder the pot be made of wood or cooles.
Moorouer it is knowen (saith Bulcasis in the same place) that rosewater of wyld x] roses whiche growe by their own accord without any watering, is swieter then that which is made of garden roses whiche are tilled and watered.
There is a destilled water made of thies with vs a shorter way then that before, is this wyse.
[Figure: brasen pot suche as diers vse, is set to a wall wherunto a couer made meet with hooles, wherin the be xx] lies ar put.
The pot is filled water, and a fyre is put vnder it of the croppinges of vynes or suche lyke.
But in proces of the destillation thou shalt close the mouth of the furnace til the hoat de+stillation be finished.
xxx] In steede of wood if if thou burne cooles, the water shalbe the swieter.
(Here is more reason then in the former, because the fire here is made immediatly vnder the stillatory vessels.)
The second way of destillacion with out water with fire of coles is such.
[Figure: x] MAke a square or round fornace with a couer xx] wherin shalbe set belies made of glased earthe, so that they may abide the fyre: And when the cooles are kindled, the water beginneth to destill shut the mouth of the fornace· and leaue holes open for the smoke to go out at.
Ther is an other bridgemente of the third and fourthe waye. xxx] [Figure: x] Brasen pot ful of water is set ouer a fornace, wt a couer bored through xx] so that it may receiue twoo or three belies of glas, more or les.
Put vnder fyr of the cropping of vines or cooles till the water sieth.
F. Brunsvvick saith, that the members being rubbed with the water of Sage, and so dryed by it selfe, and often dronke is good against the palsy, and also to drynke two ounces in the mornyg and at nyght, is very good, and helpeth against the Crampe, he saieth further it is good against the xxx] dafing of the head.

[Figure: x] THe water of Solanum or Morrella is good against all agewes if the sick the daye of hys fitte abstaine from all meate and drincke: xx] and when hee is in greate heate and desyreth much to drink, that he can not refrain him selfe any longer, then let be geue~ him a glas of this water.
Afterward let him be diligentlye couered and be kept in the heate by force: and he shall swete a stinking sweet.
But he must abstain from the air that is to cold, or to hot.
This water also is good for inflammations, and concussions, if a lynnen cloth be laid vpon it four fold, and when it waxeth dry to be wet again.
Also to all strokes or wou~des xxx] and other hot diseases, if they be washt therewith and a cloth dipt in it be laid vpon.
It helpeth also the liuer that is hot, and the lunges that are dried and greued with an Hecticke feuer.
Againste all these diseases it ought to be drunk with the third part of wine.

Of vessels and diuers instruments belonging to destellation. xx] WHen men name a stillatory vessell, they vnderstand the bodye of the still or the Cucurbita, which the dutch men in their language, because of the fashion of it, do cal clauam (ein kolben.)
The body or grose vessell some cal the greater vessel or Cucurbita wherin they put that whiche is to be destilled.
Syluius for this vessell compared to the limbeck or head, is xxx] somwhat like vnto a body or a mans chest.
The Arabians name it, as Bulcasis [Figure: wytnesseth, Beten Batan, that is a bellye.
It appeareth also that Atanor in ye same Bulcasis, where he prescribeth the destillation of vinegar, signifieth a Cucurbita.
(A furnaice, Athanor or a fixed instrumente Geber describeth in his booke of fornaces.
The Cucurbita some barbarously do call x] bocciam a boxe.
Of the same and fashyon the greater vessels are meete to digest and putrify: therupon when they must be destilled, the matter digested is distributed into som les Cucurbit or boxes.
The limbecke is taken, as suppose, bothe for the bodye and for the heade, but moore properlye for the heade, as saide, is the vpper vessell, that hathe a certaine similitude of the hed, in respecte of the nether, that is bigger and longar.
The same vessel (late authors call a bell and xx] a chaplet (some name it a marke or boundes, in which by the meanes of the spire the liquor is gathered by drops) other a cap: dutch me~ (ein helm) a salet or helmet.
Tubus which cometh forth of the limbeck a length turning downward, [Figure: is called a nose, a beake, simple as it is a pipe: because the thorow the holownes therof, the drops gathered together in the limbeck, which all come together xxx] in the skirte, that is in the nether folde about the lowest parte of the limbecke, running forth do drop downe into a vessell set vnderneath, which commonly is called a receiuer and a vrinall.
The nose and beake are termed of lyke figure, because this parte standeth oute, after the same manner that beakes do oute of the noses of fouls, noses of .iiii. foted beasts.
The receiuing vessel whe~ as oyles are destilled out of metals, as of Vitriol or Corporoos, wheras ther is nede of a great fire, and continuall, muste be very large: for x] els it is daunger least they breake, for the aboundance of vapors gathered together in the vessels.
Men hold an opinion that more precious oyles waters are made in large heades, then in small and more straite.
blynd limbek is that which [Figure: hath no nose nor beake, nor limbe or hembe whiche serueth for preparation and rectification or circulation, that is, perfection.
xx] Of the same kinde, there is an other fashio~ wt a limbus, which we vse when we will drawe out the fleame out of any waters or oyles in the sunne or other place, as it shall be declared in oyle of vitrial.
Suche heades as be put vpo~ [Figure: bodies not standinge vpryght, but as though they were lying, they lack the limbe folded skirt, and be lyke to commune earthen xxx] bottelles.
haue sien also twoo [Figure: heads one vpon the other, that by the nether whiche was bored through, parte of the matter might bee caried into the vpper, whiche was ioyned to the nether with nayles, least nether that is stopt with clay shold be taken awaye, when as x] newe mattier is to be powred into the grose vessell or body.
Some times the fashio~ of the [Figure: head is like to a spyre ascending vpwarde aloft, sometime edged: sometime it waxeth broode in the highest part of the head, that it may receyue the more of the vapours, xx] and gather the more water: but then for the moste part it runneth againe out of the top into the grose vessell.
Sublimation is taken of many simpely for destillation: other take it particularly to lift vp or cause to ascende vp into the limbeck by the force of fyre, the matter that is to befixed in it: as many metally thinges ar sublimated. xxx] Some ioyne glasse~ [Figure: or earthen bottels together, whiche they call horned pypes, the one wherof is set and cemented or clayed in the fyre conteyning thinges to be destilled: the tother is a prety way distaunt from x] the fier, receiuing the liquor gathered together in the neckes of them both: Syluius.
Thies instruments are called co~monly crooked: the frenchemen call them also horned.
This horned pipe [Figure: is a musicall instrument, which the Ger+maines co~monly call xx] a sack pype, Englishe men a bag pype.
It is a crooked vessell, apte to destill suche thinges as can not be made to ascende hye, or go vp far.
The receyuing vessell for the moste part is a phiall of glas wt xxx] a longe neck, in whose mouth the nose of the limbeck is put, and some times the bely therof is set in a pot or some other holowe vessell that it maye stande the stedfaster in his place, or els for the co~moditie of the thing, is set one way or other.
Vesselles for circulation as they wherin the va+pours ascende by course, and againe turned into lyquor, desce~d go dounward as we shal declare within wher we shal make mentio~ of putrificatio~ Of al thies the most excellent vessel is that which is named Hermes vessel, because he was the inue~ x] tor of it: of the figure and fashion as suppose, a Pelecan.
For lyke as paynters paynt a Peleca~ pecking his owne brest with his [Figure: bill: eue~ so this vessel as though it were eared on both sides, hath pypes that beginning at ye head, that is the vpper parte, descende in maner of a half a circle and ar bowed again and fastened as it were into the beginning of the xx] bely: whiche maner of vessell although it be hard to be gotten, deare, yet is it the best of all to circulation: but if it can not be had, we shall take a Cucurbita with a blynd limbeck without a folded skirt or els a vessell of a hooll glas, that is somwhat straiter in the midst, and out of the beginning of the bely it hath looking out a short pype, by the which liquor may be powred in and out.
We shall put the fygures of both thies within in the chapter of quintessence: xxx] and tertain other of other maner of vesselles and fornaces euery where in this worke.
The formes and fashions of vessels ar diuers, and almost without number co~monly vsed with the chymistes and destillers, Syluius.

Of the vessell called looke in Geber in his boke of chief perfection.
Albertus wryteth it a luttell, and expoundeth it a vessell appointed for sublimation: lykewyse Bulcasis.
The same willeth arsnick to bee sublimated in an earthen dyshe glased, the fashion wherof he describeth in xx] the chapter of sublimation of abhichbar dic. Aluthel (writen with th) is a limbeck whiche the Alchymistes vse in destillatious.
Of the matter for vessels of destillacion: and first against leaden and brasen vessels.
WAters destilled in Balneo Mariae, do so far pas those that are made simplye by the tire in leaden limbeckes, as golde xxx] passethyron.
For they that be made in Balneo Mariae, with large chaplets, limbeckes or heades, and somwhat great and of glas, do geue the natural sauour and taste of the herbes floures, wherout they be taken, without any noysome smel of smoke or burning, which chaunceth not al in the common leaden stilles.
For the waters that are made in them, very few and seldom, speciallye whiles they be new, are without notable lothsomnes of smoke and burntnes, whiche vnto sickmen that drincke, it is not only greuous, but also hurtfull: x] for the euill qualitie of the lead endamageth bothe the stomake, and the breaste, and all the entrailes, and likewise the qualitie of brasse whyche the learned and excellent phisitions perceiuynge, folowed the auncient men and vsed onlye decoctions.
But waters destilled accordinglye as they ought to be, that is with the sauour and tast of his plant, are not only equall in strength with decoctions, but also passe them in thys that they more delite a man, beinge more swete in taste, and also xx] clearer to the sight.
It shal be houe both good phisicions and also Apothecaries, to lay away leaden instrumentes, and prouid them the forsaid Balncum Mariae, and althoughe it shall be a little more chargeable vnto them and painefull, yet so shall they satisfy and please bothe God and man.
Such thinges as are destilled in lead, iudge them altogether to be disalowed, because of ye Cerusse and other malicious qualities of the leade, xxx] when as water also that is conueyed by pipes of leade, Galen condemneth, because it bredeth diseases in the entrails.
Moreouer the vessel altereth muche, aswell in destillacions as in thynges sodden.
Wherefore a man must take great hied in these things, that the vessels be rather earthen or glasse then of metall, and those that be of earth, yt they be of a very pure earth, and wel baked, such as be the earthen vessels of Paris, Bellonaca, England and Spain.
But glasen vessels are the best because they be more x] pure and thicker: but they be dearer will breake soner, except they be made hoat by litle and lyttle, and cold likewise, and after the same sorte be also earthen vessels, for the which cause they daube both sorts of them by little and little with claye of wisdom (as they call it) and dry them, so far as the force of the fire shall touch, yea althoughe it be to be set first in ashes, sande or dros of metals.
For those vessels that shal stand in water or in the vavapour therof nede no such defe~ce.
The cause whi xx] condemne vessels of metals, leade, yron, brasse, tin, siluer and gold, is Galens reason in euery one almost of these kindes of metals.
For if he affirme that water onlye conueied in leaden pipes dothe brede diseases of the bowels, howe muche more oughte we to feare waters destilled in a leaden limbecke or still.
Besides that no small cerusse remaineth cleauynge to the inner side of a leaden heade, as in destillinge of Vinegar is gathered, so by the force of the vehemente heate or brentnesse xxx] ascendinge vp wyth a vapour manye times also tarte, that is of sharpe and tarte plantes, whiche infecteth the verye and for the mooste part maketh them white like milcke, till that it be setled and suncke to the bottome.
Vessels of other metalles that bried other roust or canker, are so muche the more pearilous, as rouste or canker is more hurtfull thecerusse.
Vessels made of pure siluer or golde, as they be leaste hurtefull, so are they more harde to be gotten because of the coste.
Syluius. x] The best vessels be of glasse: the nexte, earthen that be glased bothe wythin and wythoute: then limbeckes of tinne, the bodyes (in destillinge of Roses) of leade.
For the strengthe of the fyre if it be moderate, it hurtes not the leade, but these bodyes of leade muste bee sette in syfted ashes, a handfull thicke, not in sande.
But copper and brasse haue two discommodities, xx] but the brasse more then the other, the fyrste they make the waters for the mooste parte, somewhat read, and fautye wyth brentnesse: the other, there is euer a certaine venemous operation in them, more then in other metalles, therfore Christophorus de Honestis, admonisheth to take hede and auoyde them: Brunsvvick.
Therfore seinge all the mooste learned Phisicions, and experyence it selfe, doe vtterlye disalowe waters destylled in vessels of leade, Brasse and other vncleane mettals, xxx] some good man shoulde do well to moue the matter to the Magistrates, that it mighte not be lawfull for Apothecaries other to prepare anye more or sell such waters partlye hurtfull, partlye vnprofitable.
Bulcasis in dede, vseth leaden bodies in destillinge of drye Roses, whiche perauenture may be graunted for such waters as ought to be vsed only wythout the body.
Some find no faulte with vessels made of pure and best yron, because no euill qualitye (as they saye) can issue thereoute into the matter or liquor: and trouth it is, that certaine x] metallye thynges as requyre to be destilled with a greate and continuall fyre, seme to haue neade of so stronge vessels.
But of this let other men iudge: wil leaue the matter to Chymistes and destillers.

Heare wyll trace oute and descrybe another manner of fournayce, the vse xxx] whereof shall be dyuers, but chiefly when as any thing is to bee destiled by a great fier, so that no meane be betwixt the fier the cucurbite or pan wherein is conteined the matter that is to be destilled: after whiche maner oyles or certaine liquors that burn the skyn and fleshe are gotten out of metals, as aqua fortis. &c.
The vse therof shalbe also to sublimation: and if a man will set a kettell in at the top vpon theyron cros, then fill it with ashes or water and put clay about it, he shall be gin what destillation he will.

Tothinte~t we may the better kepe the smell and qualities of suche thinges as are destilled, we must close diligently and ioyne together with x] clay, the head with the body, the tipe of the nose with the receiuer: they call it commonly claying.
Some vse pure clay littered with ox heare: some also temper it with lyme, except be deceiued.
Some mixt lyme and whytes of egges together, when they haue nied of haste: for then the morter wilbe hard dry by and by: some other wyse make clay of wisedome as they terme it.

For the destillation in ashes, there nedes no such mortering nor claying: albeit if a man wil prouide for the worst considering the frailnes of the vessels, speciallye where manye vessels are sette together in one fornace, it shalbe sufficient once or twise to pariet the~.
Those cucurbitas whiche they vse in Balneo Mariae, specially when many are set together, some men vse to xxx] put vppon them wollen cloth made mete for them lyke as it were hoose or cases.

FOr as much as in destillacio~ we seke ye separation of the eleme~ts either for one or mo of them, or els to thinte~t that they x] once put cleane away, we maye get the quintessens: separation truely can not be don withoute heate.
For heat vniteth and gathereth together suche thinges as be of one kinde and nature, and they that do differ and disagree it separateth to thintent this might duely be broughte to passe, both the Chymists and Phisicions haue inuented diuers meanes and waies.
They terme thys preparacion diuersly and geue it sundrye names, digestion, leauening, putrifaction or rotening.
Digestion they call it respectinge, the concoction that xx] is done in the maw, by the natural heate thereof, which bringeth to pas yt al such things as are put into it: are turned into one humor: for it is well enough known yt they which speake not very aptly nor latinly take these wordes to digest and to co~coct indifferently both in one sence.
If so be it a dri matter ioyned wt a liquor be so prepared, we shall name it wyth a more apte word, maceration, yt is steping or weking, or els infusio~, a watring moi xxx] stening.
But leauening is proprely spoken wheras a certain inward vertue, but increased or styred vp by an outward heat, commeth vnto an humor or moisture, so that a certaine co~mune and ge+nerall qualitie be mixed and spred throughout the body, with a hoat spirit, one that moueth and breadeth bubles, as it is in ye mixture of true leauen in dede knode~ with meale: also in vinegar powred vpon the earth.
And this affect is the beginning of rotennes in suche thinges as haue superfluous humor.
That which is called putrifactio~ x] or rotte~nes should differ nothing fro~ this, sauing that it is done by setting the vessell conteining the thinges to be destylled, in some corrupting and rottenyng matter: and that for none other cause, then that one and the selfe same heate continually for a certayne dayes and equally, should be conserued with litle labour and coste.
The sauour or other qualitie of ye putrifying matter, in my mynde, it is not possible it should infect the mixture that is put in a glasen cucurbita with xx] the mouth very diligently stopt, although some thinke yes.
For if the vessell be diligently stopt, it it is not possible there should chaunce any defaul.
Notwithstanding it happeneth somtimes not because of the dong or other outward cause, but bycause the matter in the vessell hath abundaunce of corrupt excrementall moisture, whiche with any outward heate doeth easely roat.
The glasen vessell it selfe howe longe tyme so euer it shal tary in the donge, it wyll bee nothing defyled, nether xxx] darkened, specially if it be of good glas, as ye Venice glasse is: for the common grene glasse will gather a certain duskishnes and as it were a skin.
Destillation that is done by rottennes, or with horse dong both alone and with lime be sprinkled and oft chaunged, or with barks watred, or other rottening thinges, how so euer it is profitable to the Chymistes and destillers many wayes, a phisition not withstanding ought not to receiue it, for a cause in rotten wod and euil smelling, thorowe the rottennes or some other cause: speciallye if the x] thinges destilled be to be ministred within the body: for to be vsed withoute the bodye, it skilleth the lesse.
Of thys kind of destillation in hors dong read before in the latter ende of those thinges whyche we writ of Balneum Mariae generally.
At thys present we shoulde entreat rather of rotening then of destillatio~.
But because of rotening also in hors donge semeth to be disalowed, if destillacion in it be reproued, it is not altogether from our purpose xx] and others, that haue declared my mynd of this matter in this place.
Putrification or rotening in hors dong wt lime is otherwise done on thys wyse, that the dong euery day or euery other daye or by longar distaunce, be sprinkled with warme water: otherwise, without sprinkling, when as the dung of it self serueth to be hot inough.
pit or hole being digd in some corner of the house, they lai one course of hors do~g about a fote thick, that is thre handbread: then an xxx] other cours of lime only one hand thicke, and so for the by course.
There is nede of thre burden for the most part of dong, as much as a porter is hable to cary.
Some put the thynges that are to bee destylled (speciallye suche as bee stiepte in wine) into a tin botel, and that they do set in vnslaki lime closed, whiche they quenche at certaine times nowe a little and then a little, with raine water.
Some mixte Oten strawe wyth the hors donge, and sprinkling it with hoat water, set in theyr vessell, x] and then couer it cleane wyth towe harde, wyth clothes or sackclothe, in some parte of the house where colde can not come at it.
Other in the broken peces of Oliues, that is, in the relickes of Oliues after they be prest, the best waye of all other, as Cardanus teacheth.
If a manne couet but a light heate, it shall be sufficiente to putte it simplye in chopte strawe.

In thies filled full of fine sand or ashes, bothe thynges maye be destilled whyche woulde shoulde be tried, and also certaine lyquors may be rectified or prepared.
&c, and by this meanes a man shall saue bothe labour and coste.

The same also may [Figure: be done very wel with balles of Cristall.

B. so yt the beames of the sunne may com vnto the vessel.
The only end of all these preparations is, that the liquor may be drawne out more easely, more abounda~tly, and more xxx] effectuously.
The time of this digestio~ doth vary according to the matter, whiche the more massy it is, the longar time dothe it requyre: newe herbes nede the lesse time, when they are stiept or weekt in wine or other liquor: for they be the tenderer, and if they shoulde be let stand long, they woulde haue a certaine hoarinesse: the same dryed muste stande a little longar: then the seedes: last of all the rotes: so that almoste double time is necessarye for them that folow to yt which goeth afore them: as to new x] herbes .iii. dayes: to dry, seuen: to sedes and most parte of spices twelue or fourtene, to rootes eight and twenty, or lesse if they be newe.
There be certaine Phisicions that bid let metals stande fortye dayes, the chymists and destillers of liquors yet longar.
Thys is also to be considered, whether the thinges brosed are straight wayes put in: for they nede much shorter tyme perauenture by the half, then those that be put in hole.
In goulding waters (as they call them) spices sometimes hole xx] are wonte to be stiepte a fewe daies in wine, then taken out and brosed, to be poured in againe and to stand yet a few dayes.
The putrification of herbes to be destilled in horsse donge, is wonte to be done almoste by the space of .xiiii. daies, but in Balneo Mariae. ii. or .iii. naturall daies.
Suche thinges require chiefly putrification, whose substance is somwhat dry, gros, thick: raw haue les nied which are contrary wyse, and ar digested xxx] and prepared by nature or the sun.
Putrification is soner done in cloudy wheather then in fayre.
To the moste parte of thinges that are prepared in hors dong, some salt is cast, as vnto beasts bloud, to flesh, to fyshe: Guainerius.
To digest, take a blynd lymbeck: if the matter be pure, as pure liquor, then take a vessell for circulation, of whiche sort the pelecan is the best: although it can skarsly be made, and not withoute great cost.
&c. x] But in digestion or putrification, the hoal vessell would be hid with hors dong or with the refuse of grapes.
To circulation the halfe of the vessell, or at the least the third part, must loke out into the free and cold aire (as also to destillation.)
Vlstadius chap .viii. wher as he teacheth at large of putrification in hors dong.
WAters destilled in Balneo Mariae, ought to be set in the sun and to bee rectified, namely in a glasen vessell, (the mouthe wherof let it be bound aboute and stopt with lether) full of the destilled water, so that the third part muste be lefte empty.
then set it in hoat sand by the space of forty daies, that all the fleme may be consumed, the third part of the vessel must xxx] be hid in the sande.
Destilled waters of hot vertue, poured first into wine or burning water, least they should hurt a man by the meanes of theyr ouer muche heat, let them stande for the space of a monthe or more if the water be hotter, in moyste sand, in a cold place.
Likewise the thirde parte of the vessell hid in the sand: or two parts of the vessell (two third partes) let them be digd in the earth in some wine celler.
Euery water if it be destilled again, specially vppon the dregs and grounds well pund and broken, it may so be rectified: x] and the more, the ofter it is destilled againe: but for the most part of waters, it is sufficiente to repete the destillation of them thrise or .iiii. times.
But you muste take heede that at euerye time the fleame be diligently remoued and separated, whiche a man shall do if he receiue by it self the firste liquor, or if burninge water be destilled, the laste liquor, which is watry. &c.
The fleame once sepated, last of all rectification by circulation (wherof is spoken now last of all, and more shalbe spoken xx] in the title of quintessens must be added.
But ye the brentnes yt is in these, may brethe out it shalbe best to kepe ope~ a while the phials wherin the liquors stande: not withstanding you muste take hede that the grace of the smell in the meane season with it much of the strengthe and vertue therof, do fume oute.
Destilled liquors of diuers sortes if a man mixte them together sometimes they become troubled and pudled like thin milke or whay, and for the moste part an olde lyquor xxx] mixt with a new troubleth it.
But you shall make them cleare and pure againe, if into three poundes, you cast six or eight drops of white vinegar very sharp: for they wil driue down the pudly matter to the bottom: Brunsvvick.
Destillacion by a Filter or a list of Wollen cloth.
DE&stillation by a filter is more in vre wt x] the Chymistes and destillers then wyth phisicions, inuented to try out the lighter, purer and more subtil part from the grosser and the dregges.
Therefore the iuyces of herbes may thus be destilled, put in some vessell, wherein a pece of wollen clothe muste be put, the broder end wherof only must be in the vessell: the narower part and that that is sharpe at the ende: ether wt one poynt, or deuided into .ii. or, iii. muste ha~g without the vessel, the vessel must lean a litle xx] towarde that side that the list hangeth on.
man maye put in also aboute the brimme some lystes of clothe, euerye one of almooste a foote longe, by the which the liquor shall be deriued and conueyed into a vessell set vnderneathe.
If you wyll destill the same iuyce or liquor agayne or the thirde tyme, in the same manner: sette the vesselles vypon a payre of stayres.
The fyrste wherein the liquor is highest, the seconde lower and so forthe, wyth listes of clothe putte in euerye vessell xxx] and hangynge oute into the nether, the laste the laste vessel onlye and lowest shall haue no listes, whiche muste onlye receiue, not yeld forthe.
The destillation by a filter is doone also in two croked vessels of glasse well clayed, the one wher of must stand higher then the other, when you wil draw precious and swiet smellinge liquors from the matter (digested firste in Balneo Mariae,) as Vlstadius maketh mencion.
To the sirrup which is made of the sower iuyce of the citron, that iuyce muste a man destill by a x] clothe, liste or filter, or elsse it will gather into a courd when it waxeth colde, and likewise ye iuyce of Lemons and Orenges.
By a liste some destill also the decoctions of herbes sod wyth a softe fyre, whiche afterwarde by little and little they sieth till it be as thicke as hony, as of the rotes of black Elleborus or beares foote.
Other thinck it sufficient only to sethe it or straine it.
Of burninge vvater or single xx] Aqua vitae, and of the strength therof, and manifold vse. BVrnynge water or Aqua vitae is drawne oute of wine, but wyth vs out of the wine lies only, speciallye of them that sell it, and by this onli almost get their liuing.
And parauenture it is neuer a whit ye worse that it is drawne oute of lies: for Lullus teacheth xxx] that it may be well destilled of corrupt wine: yea if it be destilled often, it shalbe made the more effectuall, that is to say, hotter and drier: for dregs also or lies brente, are very hot, and geue the hottest oyle, which they call oyle de Tartaro, but that burning water that is destilled out of wine, me thinkes it shalbe the swieter, and more plesaunt bothe in smell and taste, and without all brent taste: besides that more apte also for quintessens.
Burning water is called also water of sapa, of whiche oyl, mingled together soope is made, for it brenneth ye x] body.
This water is made, as lie, half or thre partes ashes, and on lime: and that is the strongest water that wil make an egge cast therin, to swim highest without or aboue the water.
Therfore the first being so made, is stronger then the second, to the vse of searing or burning of woundes.
Burning water oft destilled, is broughte into such sharpnes yt it can not be drunk.
But this is commonly known: they that sell it commo~ly xx] are wont to destil it only twise: but to the vse of glasiers for the burning in of their colors in their glasses, foure times, except be deceiued.
We declared afore, how when it is once or twise destilled in serpentins or writhen or crouked vessels or in other accustomed vessels (with pipes of brasse as big as a mans arme) may afterward be perfected in ashes, vntill all the steame be put awaye: by the which meanes it is made not only hoter and more subtil and finned, but also more pleasaunte bothe xxx] to the taste and smell.
Neither do all men vse one forme or fashion of the bodies and heades whiche they call limbeckse, to destill all for some draw the water out of wine put in a great brasen vessel, standing vpon the fire, the necke or mouthe wherof is great and broad, vpon a three fote, and vpon this necke standeth the heade of brasse also with a top like a spire steple, a thing like a paile or bucket.
D. compassing it, ful of cold water, that the large vapoure maye be thickned the soner by the head made cold, and least the water of ye wine x] should so resemble the fire.
Some vse in the stead of a necke or heade to receiue the vapoure wyth a pipe of white plate or other mettall, verye longe, writhen into manye boughtes and tourninges, like vnto the maner of serpents, (wherupon they name them co~monly serpentins) the greatest part therof standing in water.
We did see diuers fashyons of vessels set out in figures to destill burning water or aqua vitae, in Gualter Ryffius Andro Lo xx] nicerus.
Bulcasis saith wine may be destilled after the same maner, as vineger, the destillacion wher of he described.
Read within, streight after the title of destillacion in ashes.
A. goynge vprighte from the couer of the Caudron conteyning the wines or lyes, whyche pype is larger beneathe after the fashion of a figure in Geometrye called conus whiche they bowe at the top almoste wyth a streight corner, and by a bucket ful of water xxx] set somewhat hie, they directe it, but a syngle not a crouked nor wri [Figure: then cours: and so they say, shall a man haue more plenty of water.
Suche lyke lyttle instrumentes certain apothecaries do make, and call theim bladdars, for thys purpose, that if they nede x] anye certaine lyquor to the destillacion of anye herbe, they maye make it by and by.
Yea they poure water vpon it that it be the more plenteous, which ca~ not commend.
Aqua vitae is thought then to be stilled inough, that is, after it be stilled foure tymes at the leaste, and pourged from all his fleame, whan as if a xx] manne sette it a fyre, it wyll consume euery whit wyth the flame, that no token of moysture be lefte in the bottome of the vessell: or elsse, if a lynnen clothe dipte therein, and sette a fyre, it burne not the clothe, whyche is a greatter token of perfectyon, as that also, if a droppe of Oyle bee lette fall into it, it goeth to the bottome.
For Oyle is aierye, wherefore a fyrie substaunce, whereunto Aqua vitae soo ofte destylled shoulde atteyne, oughte too bee lyghter xxx] then it.
But besydes the heate, of so destylled it should also become thin and pure, more more, and when euery fire, the thicker and grosser it is, the more it burneth: contrariwise, the thinner, the lesse: that which is most thin should burn leaste of all.
By the same cause it commeth to passe, that a drop of Aqua vitae poured in the palme of a mans hand, the better it is, the soner it vanisheth awaye and is consumed.
heare that this is a laudable note of this water, if succinum amber being set on fire and put to it into a spone do burn.
is destilled twyse or thrise, you shall cut a fine sponge into pieces, so great, that on euery side they may touch the cucur bita or bodye within the vpper parte (that is in the inner circuit) the spo~g must be tied in thre or four stringes hanging withoute, when you shall set on the limbeck, so that the sponge can not fal into the bottome of the still: let the sponge be dipt in oyle oliue, and crushed out a little again, least pexauenture the oyle should fall into the pot or body of the xx] stil, and be mixt with the matter: then settinge the limbeck vpon it, shit it close with wax as is aforesaid, or with purified rosen.
By this spong the spirits shalbe best destilled, and the fleame shall not passe through, because of the oyle: by this menes shall a man do more with once destilling, then otherwise with thrise.
Notwithstandinge the limbeck must be made withoute the gutter and circle within like to a blinde limbecke, but it muste not lacke a nose.
That whiche remayneth xxx] of the lies and dregs destilled in the bottom, me~ of our time call it dead water: for it is vnsauery and stinking.
Such, that is the stinking wa+ter, whether it be yeilden of lies onlye, or also of wine, haue not tried.
For the destillation of aqua vitae or burning wa+ter, a man muste chuse the best wine, blacke, red, or white.
Black and old, yelds more plenty and al+so better water, then any other.
The fire at first must be light and soft, after more veheme~t: but you must take hede in anye wise yt the wine sethe x] not.
The water that is gotten theroute, is surnamed burning, or the soul and life of the wine: and when it is destilled twise or thrise, then they cal it flaming water: Albertus as some alledge.
Of fiue partes of lies, whe~ it is twise destilled heare, one remaineth or somwhat les.
Whan fleame is one cleane consumed, nothing is lost after in the destilling, but the hole is yeilded again.
Of .iiii. measures of wine, for the moste parte one measure of burnyng water is gathered in the first destillacion or there about according to the goodnes xx] of the wine.
Then in the next destillacion for one measure, there commeth the halfe.
In fourth, as much is yelded as you put in, for the most part if the destillacion be done accordingly.
Notwithstanding if you continue destillinge, the water shall be the more perfect, in so much that at the ninth or tenth destillacion, it shal come out most perfect, But for as much as to the repeting of destillinge so ofte: a xxx] man must bestow both more time and more coste, for the most part we are content with the third or the fourthe destillacion, and call it perfecte.
And surely it resteth much in the instrument, that the water should be perfected soner or slower.
For the vapour is more destilled and perfected in the first destillacion in a serpentin (that is in a croked and bowed pipe) the~ thrise destilled by a streight pipe.
Note further that ther diuers waters may be ga+thered in the first destillacion, wherof the firste is perfit, that is, that whiche burneth and is consumed x] with the fire, and a linnen cloth dipte therin and set on fire is not burnt.
(You shall proue therfore nowe and then, and when the water ceaseth burninge, looke what remaineth in the still, you may cast it away, as vnprofitable.
The thirde is good for nothinge, saue that it cleareth the eyes and the face, if thrise a day they be washte therin, morninge, noone and euening, but this vertue of the third water, perauenture is true, if the destillacion xx] be made with wine: but if it be with lies, as they be wonte with vs, it is not true.
More ouer the stil must not be filled aboue .ii. parts, but that the third part may remaine emptye, and that the vapoures maye haue their scoupe and romthe.
Of the strengthes and vertues of Aqua vitae, in the boke of Arnold, De Villa noua, which is written xxx] of Aqua vitae.
ARnold in his boke of Aqua vitae describeth many qualities therof both of it alone, and also mixt with other medicins after the destillacion, obseruing the order of the .xii. signes, from the head to the fete, for as he saith, a man must minister much more effectuall remedies to the head, if a man haue nede, at such time as the mone is in the ram: and likewise in the other, which thinge how true iudge it, wil not say at this time: notwithstanding this wil x] say, the better learned any man is in oure time, the les credit haue they geuen to suche perswacions as the Arabians haue broughte into phisicke.
Aqua vitae simple and alone (saithe Arnold oute of one Theoricus can not tel whome) breaketh an impostume or recours of matter bothe within the body, if it be dronke, and without, as botche, if it be annoynted therwith.
It is good for them that haue the falling sickns if they drink it.
It cureth the palsy xx] if they be anoynted therwith.
It putteth awai fracins, ring worms al spots of ye face.
If it gargild it remedieth dis+eas in ye throte called synanchen squince, the iuila faln down wt humors, also the salt fleme, the rose drop the touth ache.
It is merueylous profitable for fre~tik me~ such as be mela~choly.
It er+pelleth poyso~, The smel therof burnt, killeth flies xxx] cold creping beasts, It doth sieth flesh kepeth fishes from roating.
It draweth forth the vertues of herbes and rotes, if they be laid in it .iiii. daies (otherwise .iiii. houres) excepte onlye the Violet.
It oughte to be set vp in a glasen or siluer vessell and to be wel stopt.
There is more of it better made of old wine pure and read.
He that desyreth more concerninge the vertues of Aqua vitae, let him read that which we write aboue of ye vertues of certain liquors, which our men call golde~, x] and waters of vertues.
For they ascribe all those powers for the most part as well to Aqua vitae, as to the other, specially to simple Aqua vitae, much more to compound or Aqua composita, but chieflye to the quintessens therof.
haue sene also a certaine broken worke ascrtbed to Albertus, of the vertues of Aqua vitae.
But practicioners, ignorant of thinges and times, or els of a purpose to deceiue me~, as many as they could, haue most impudently fathered xx] many things vpon Galen, Hippocrates and Aristotle of the vertues of Aqua vitae, or burnynge water, as writen by them.
All kinde of cold passions or greues, that be curable, it helpeth in shorte space, specially diseases of the brain, sinewes and ioyntes.
Also wormes in the bellye, biles and all scabbines, if it be washt oft therwith, it healeth it.
The hurt members if they be anoynted xxx] therewith, it will restore them to their former health.
It preserueth fishe and flesh from corrupting, but before they be eaten, they must be washte with common water.
If co~mon water be poured into it, it goeth to the bottom: and likewise oyle.
The taste of it excedeth all other tastes, and the smel all other smelles.
Lullus, It comforteth the natural heat more then any other remeadye: it is most holsom for the stomake, the harte and the liuer: x] it norysheth blud, it agreeth meruelously and most with mans nature, it openeth and purgeth ye mouthes and entrances of the membres, vaines and poores of the body euery one, it auoydeth all obstructions and comforteth them.
Yea it chaungeth the assections of the minde, it taketh awaye sadnes and pensiuenes, it maketh men meri, witty and encreaseth audacitie.
Anoynte the head therwith and it helpeth it of the head ache: it killeth the wormes drunken fasting: it putteth away xx] sowning: it healeth the biles in the priuy me~bers, if they be washt therwith: it easeth them that be diseased in the stomacke, it stauncheth all runninges: it preserueth bodies from corruptinge by wormes: It auoydeth and kepeth a man fro~ gray heares.
It is good against thick hearing, poured into the eares.
Mixt with wine and dro~k, it healeth xxx] the falling sicknes.
If a man hold it longe, it taketh away diuers kinde of touth ache.
It putteth away the blemishes and whit spots in the eies, if it be poured into them: and auoydeth the running and watering of the same, if a man do but hold it in his mouth.
It letteth the leprosy a space and hideth it It helpeth rotten and materinge biles, if linnen cloutes be dipt therin and laid vpon them.
With a little decoction of parcely, it driueth away the stones in the bladder.
It maketh wome~ apt to conceiue, but anoyeth them that be greate wyth x] childe.
It cureth diuers greues, it is profitable to be laid vpon broken bones hot, with towe or with some plaster.
It slaketh the cramp in the legs, if a man anoynt them therwith.
But the most of them seme to be taken out of Lullus.
knew an old woman, that was cold and Cathectica, to be restored by a handkerchief made warm with Aqua vitae set a fire within it.
Some alledge the testimony of Constantine, of xx] the vertues of burning water.
Aqua vitae besides other things is commodious and profitable for the strangury and other diseases of the bladder, for the tertian ague and quartain also which are ioyned wyth colde humors: against the disease called the Wulfe: againste wormes: againste the sens or painefull fealinge of a mannes bodye lyke vnto biles.
It breaketh and put+teth awaye the stone in the reins, and expelleth a xxx] dead child without anye greate paine.
The issues of the bellye and fluxes, it helpeth, what so euer they be.
They say, that Aqua vitae is perfite when often measures is made one, (whiche suppose will come to passe in the thirde or fourthe destillacion).
Annoynt the heade therewith, and it healeth wormes, the scuruinesse and scabbes, pusculs and skailes.
It putteth awaye the spottes in the face and other wher.
Broken egges or egges that that lacke a shell, put them in Aqua vitae and it will sieth them.
It healpeth the numnesse of a x] mannes sences called Apoplexia, swellings, steames, tenesmum or desire to the stoole and wearynesse.
To conclude, it is good againste the bitinge of a mad dog.
It will heale any wou~d excellentlye, if it be washte therewith, and so that no euill effect shall come therafter by the meanes of the same wound.
perceiuinge Aqua vitae to be hotte and to dry, xx] did sometime mixte with it honye, whereby it was bothe swieter to dryncke and gentler profitable for the colde stomacke, speciallye in wynter.
Som mixt it with water made wt honye or rather with mede, called which with vs co~monly they make of hony co~bs. &c. Som wet figs ther in set them on fire, then eat them hot.
ma~ may also mixt any sirup therwith, one or other, according as ye disease shall requyre.
To preserue wine it be not troubled nor putrified, put to it the te~th xxx] part of Aqua vitae. in dede sulphur is far better for the same purpose, but it bewrayeth the crafte and the smell there of.
The same will alum do, but being bothe hurtfull, they are verye noysome to the health.
If wine by the meanes of the sauour of the ves+sels or taste of the grapes be corrupte and soured, poure Aqua vitae into it and it will restore it.
The same purgeth ha~ging wine that is new: also wine that is putrified and soured also: for it conuertes vineger.
To conclude it bringeth a good smel and x] tast also to any wine be it neuer so euel or corrupt and good wine also it makes it better, Albertus as some alledge.
When the wine is to be drawen into an empty vessel, most vse to put in a ball of brimston set a fyre: other vse Aqua vitae, dipping towe therein.
Wine that is made to haue anye taste or smell, out of hand in a momente, is both a curious thing for rich men cheiffy, which wil aduaunt them of ye sortes of wine: and also profitable.
For the qualities xx] of diuers remedies may be communicated by this meanes with the wine.
Herbes, sedes, or spyces whatsoeuer they be, let them be poured into Aqua vitae for the space of .xxiiii. houres for so the strength of them shalbe drawen out.
Then ye waters so affected and died, shall be mixt with a lyttle wine when ye wil drink.
How that wine is made which they calcommo~ly Hippocras, with Aqua vitae and certaine spices stiept therein, will declare when shall speake xxx] of wines.
Of the quintessens of wine shall speake within, in the title of quintessens.
Of such thinges as be destilled dry, put into any liquor.
THe thinges that be dry can not be destilled, except they be stiept in some liquor.
Of those that whiles they be new, be stiept and wet in some liquor befor thei be destilled, wil speake hereafter amongst waters x] compoundes, in the beginning.
Although the waters wherof we speake, here may be counted among the compoundes.
Dry thinges therfor first let them be broken and grounde: then let them be stiept in some liquor, wine, vineger, rain water or of the wel spring, and those ether raw or destilled, (Vineger and wine are destilled for this purpose somtimes once, sometimes ofter) or in some other destilled liquor.
They maye be stiepte also in the iuyce of som herb or plant, and that likewise ether xx] rawe, orels (that is better) destilled, Aqua vitae rectified semeth to agre best to the stieping of spyces, except we wil auoyd to much heat, wherwith the thynges destilled in them myghte be infected withall, when the liquor is drawne awaye.
Some still Cinnamon beaten with spring water poured to it, as we shall shewe amongste Oyles.
Sedes also and other spices, wheroute oyle is taken, are stiept in some of the forsaid liquors.
It is best according to my iudgement to destill all these xxx] thinges, dry thinges meane infused and poured into anything in ashes with a softe fire.
Of waters of vertues or golden waters, that are wont to be made with saudge other smelling herbes spices, set in wine, wil speke within amongst the co~pounded waters: of them that are put in burning water, emongst the composed waters of life.
It is to be considered also how long they sta~d to soke in wine: for new thinges, they yt be thin or ope~ not massy, nede les time the~ dry, grosse and thick, beaten things, the~ hole: the rotes then the x] sedes spices: they againe les then the herbs.
Read befor whe~ we gaue rules of ye preparacion of things to be destilled.
The co~mon custom is to destil the~ almost only dry, set in wine first a fewe daies, as spices smelling herbes.
But all other things also whose smel or tast what maner so euer it be we wil haue kept in the liquor destilled, they are rightly destilled by soking in wine, as taughte afore also, whereas made mention of wormwod water, of the preseruation of the vertues xx] of remedies in ye waters destilled.
And surely in those which when they are new abound wt much moisture therfore haue ye les smel, as gen+tian, astrantia, ye flour deluce, beries of iuniper other: wold more alow ye liquors of drithinges set in wine or other wher: but if ye thinges be thin or slendar, or of no sauor, or ought to coul moiste~ they should be destilled rather new.
Sometimes the time of the yeare causeth a man to take drye+thinges because of the lacke or scarsity of fresh.
Take .iiii. pounds of the fresh and new rotes or rather dry cut in small peces, of great Gentian or white Gentian, (whose rotes are moste fat, and beinge set in wine, they nether corrupte them selues nor suffer the wine to corrupt, as haue tried my self by the space of these ii· yeres) set in a couple of great glasses in a stouf+nie the fornace, or hang them if you wil, the glasses dilige~tly stopt, and put into them pure good wine, so much that the wine be .ii. fingers aboue the~: you shal euer put new wine vnto them stil, x] til the rotes wil drinke no more, and so the wine being aboue it a two fingars, as saide, let the glasses stand a moneth, and at length put the~ into .ii. cucurbitas, ye wine and the rotes destributed together, destil them in Balneo Mariae, or els in ashes with a soft fire.
Of the water of Centory les and gentian together destilled in wine, reade within amongst composed waters.
Iuniper beries also dry set in wine, geue a very good liquor swiet smellinge: but wormwode xx] (soked a few daies,) geueth a water very effectu+all and most bitter, and the more if it be destilled in ashes, which both waies haue tried.
Pelitory other fresh or dry is set in wine or vineger destilled or These thynges also sookte in burnynge water (as sayde) do communicate theyr strength wyth it: but heare it is done muche moore effectuallye, if the thynges be beaten at the beginnynge and myxte wyth the lyes of wine redye xxx] to bee destylled (for of theese rather then of wine, the men of our country draw Aqua vitae.)
So also did one teache me in counsell as a greate secreate, that Wormwode water and other maye be best made.
Pour water to dry Roses, not more the~ is sufficient to stiep them in: then put them from thence into glasen cucurbitas or leaden, and destill them by little and little.
This water shall be profitable in medicins, and also to garnishing and trimming, x] or to the smel.
Ther was a certain man put to one pound of dry Roses, ten pou~d of water and destilled Rose water indifferente good.
But thys is not done saue when a man hathe not newe to make Rose water of.
If the Roses whyche we call commonly incarnation Roses, dried moystned with the vapor of hot water be destilled, they wil geue good Rose water.
The water of the nux vomica or spueinge nut, or the iuice gotten out with fire, is like the water xx] in colour, not in smel or tast: the chiefest remedy against poyso~, Cardanus in his second buke de subtilitate.
If the poyson newly taken remain yet in the stomake, the best kind of remedies be they that prouoke much to vomit stro~gly, milke, lie, oyle, the water of the spewing nut, suppose he meaneth by the iuyce gotten out by the fire, nothinge els but the water destilled thereof.
For he nameth water that is like it in colour, not in smel nor tast, which agreeth with destilled waters.
xxx] But when as the spewing nut euery whit is most hard and dry, it apeareth that his shel must be sookt in some liquor as water, wine, vineger, Aqua vitae.
wold soke it rather in vineger, whiche by it self resisteth poyson, and is good to prouoke vomitting.
Waters destilled of new and fresh pla~ts (saith Brunsvvick) ought to be preferred, whiche if they can not be had, ether for some other cause or because they be brought out of straunge countryes only dry, as spicknarde, lauander, stichae, scoenantum, x] the hard time. &c. Thou shalt destill oute of them dry in this manner.
In the month of May euery yere before the sunne rise, when it hath not rained the hole night, the sky is fair, thou shalt gather dew out of som medow ful of diuers kind of herbes and flours, no watery ground nor wet, nor in a holow place, but rather vpon some hil, if it be possible.
Thou maist gather it thus, draw a fair linnen cloth sprede abrode vpon the grasse, til it haue dronken much of the dew, then wryng xx] it out into some vessell: and draw it again and fill it, euer wringing it out againe til thou haue gathred inough.
This dew thou shalt destil thrise in Balneum Mariae, and rectifye it also in the sunne, (that is in hot sand, for the space of: xl. daies) and kepe it a yere.
The~ what time of the yere so euer thou lakst liquor of dry herbes, do thus.
Take as many herbs as thou list dried in the shadow (the leaues being taken away and kepte apart by the~ selues) put them in a glasse, and pour vpon them xxx] thrise so much water of dewe: or at thre times, so that first thou power on so much, that the herbes be sufficie~tly ouercouered with water: and againe twis so muche.
Then set it in hors dung twoo or three daies, still it, and putrifie it againe, so that it be thrys putrified and destilled by course in order.
This water surely shalbe muche better, then if a man, as Bulcasis wryteth, to one pound of dry roses (or other herbes or floures) shall put ten pou~d of common water and destill it by and by.
certaine cunning phisicion wryteth that if water bee x] destilled out of dry thinges after this forsaid maner, sooke in dew, not thrys only destilled, but nyn tymes, it shalbe better water then if it were made of freshe and newe thinges, whiche haue muche fleame in them.
The same affirmeth that dew nyn times destilled doth drawe out the vertues out of the herbes that be put in it no les then aqua vitae.
And in the dew it selfe also there is a certaine medicinall vertue as Brunsvvick techeth in an other xx] place to be in the water therof destilled.
In the falling sicknes, if thou make a cake of meale knod with nighterly dew of saint Iohn, and bake it vnder the ashes, then giue it to the sicke to eate, thei say it wil make him hoal.
QVint essence they name to be, the chief and the heauenliest power or vertue in any plant, me xxx] tall, beast, or in the partes therof, which by ye force and puritie of the hoale substaunce, not by any elimentall or sensible qualitie (although it be not without qualities) conserueth the good health of mans body, prolongeth a mans youthe, differeth age, and putteth away all maner of diseases.
Of this first of al me~ writ Raimu~dus Lull{us}, although it wer vnknowen to al the physicians of his time, nether written of in any booke, nor tryed or gone aboute in any vse.
After him foloweth besides other Iohannes de Rupe scissa, (whome one certain x] man thinkes he flourished before Lullus, as writ afore, iudge they were both in one tyme) Hieronimus Brunsvvick, Philippus Vlstadius, and perauenture a few other whiche writ sumwhat of the same.
Sum kind therof is simple, as yt moste famous quint essence of wyne or Aqua vitae, of chelidony or selandyn, of mans bloud, of strawberys, of Antimonii. &c.
Other ar co~pounde that is whe~ certain remedies ar put to sum quint essence now perfited, yt it may draw out yt vertues of the~, wherunto xx] gold yt may be drunken, ought to be assribed.
But here springeth a doute, saith Cardane, whe+ther a man may make ye water te~perat, which thei cal quint essence: It wilbe, as shal proue, of the nature of the firmame~t, that is a most pure thin substance moueable, which by the mouing reteineth a temperat heat, very muche therof.
This thefor is of power to co~serue al strengths, topro long life.
For being most subtil, it mixith it self wt the first moistur, pearcing the massy thinges, separateth xxx] the excreme~ts, which be co~teined therin.
And because it hath much heat, it expelleth what soeuer is vncleane, and therfore restoreth the natural heat.
For age is nothinge els then a lessening and diminishing of natural heat, which is therfore diminished, because the mouinge is hindred: as saide of fire: for there is like reason of this vnto that.
Mouing is hindred, because of ye aboundance of earthy matter, because the earthe only hath very muche matter, and is destitute of all mouing.
Therfore that water being of so te~perate x] a heate, it shall nether vexe the hearte, nor noysom to the liuer: wherfore this onlye can perform the things that we haue spoken.
When burning water therfore or Aqua vitae reteininge hys purity and subtil matter: by the longe mocyon of circulacio~, hath put of and rid away his heat and sharpnes of taste and smell, it is becomed of the nature of the firmament: and then firste of all it smelleth swiet and fragantly.
For a fragra~t smel is nothing els then a sharp smell when it is moderate.
Therefore Aqua vitae, if it come once to a temperatnes, the thinnes and purity remaining stil, it must nedes be made fragra~t and swiet smelling: and if it be once fragrant, it must necessarilye be turned into the nature of the fyrmament.
There is also a water made of the flesh tyr{us} or an adder, that restoreth youthe: there is made olso of Elleborus, which sawe at my fathers.
But these vexe and vnquiet the body, and xxx] make disceitful image and likelines of youth: the firmamentall water dothe it in dede, whiche reteineth long that which a man hathe and adourneth the same.
But is the firmament more pure then the fire which is moste hot· It is surelye so: for it is next vnto the heauen, and therfore most lighte.
For by his circulacion it moderateth the heat caused in it by the starres: and after ye same manner thys water, broughte to the moste puritye by the heat of the fire, by mocion it self is coled again and obteineth a temper.
Wherefore bothe x] this and the firmamente are as it were in a meane betwene mortal thinges and immortall.
For hauing a place and temper, and also substa~ce next vnto the heauen, it can not be corrupte.
But whiles it is constreined and driuen beneath, it is couled, and so after a lo~g time it is corrupt.
Ther fore it is in a meane betwixt mortal and immortal· (of which kind the Stoikes beleue mans soule to be.)
The vertue of euery thing resteth in the quintessens xx] therof, hot, cold, moyst, and dry. &c, and the same operacion it hath, which it had afore in his mixture or with his mater, but much more swiftly, more merueilouslye manye waies.
After the destillacion vpon the lies certain times repeated, letting the water haue euer a new digestio~, eueri water ought alwaies to be circulated so longe in hors do~g or other wher, vntil it haue a most swit sauor.
Somthings it is sufficie~t to destil the~ xxx] once or twise, and then circulate them after a few daies, if any part of the earth or lies remain in the boto~ of the circulating vessel, to put it awai pouring it forth.
The quintessens of wine wyll no more burn the mouth, nether is it burning wine any more, but more subtill, and is called heauen: wherunto we say his starres is added, when as herbes of diuers qualities, and such as be excellent againste diuers sicknesses, are sokte stiept therin, as we shall shewe hereafter in Aqua vitae compounded.
To be solificate or made golde~, is x] when we procure the vertue of the sunne, that is, gold to be in it, as it is declared before, in the tretise of potable gold or gold that may be drounke.
These thinges for the most part are out of Lullus boke of quintessens.
The quintessens of any medicine hathe a thousand times the greater vertue, then it had before, whiles the thing had yet the element in it.
Hovv the quintessens of all things xx] may be drawn out, to minister them or the vertue of them, to mennes bodies: oute of the first boke of Lullus, intreatinge of quintessene.
THe quintessence of any thinge may be drawne out from it, as of wode, frutes, floures, rotes, leaues, sedes, stones, metals, fleshe, and of what spices a man will, in this sort.
Anye thinge that you wil separate the quintessence from, you shall put it into the quintessence of xxx] wine (pure and perfect as is said before) and you shal set it forth to be solified sonned in ye spring, or els in a vessel to a lighte fire, and within three houres you shall haue the quintessence of ye thing mixt with the quintessence of the wine, which shal be conuerted into such a nature as is of ye thinge that is put in, whether it be hot or cold, moyst or dry, purge or what other condicio~ or smel so euer it be of: and it shal not only haue the same operacion, but also in the same degre, yt is nether more nor les. &c.
After this he reherseth remedies one x] by one which are hot in the first degre, then in the seco~d, third fourth: likewise he maketh tables of cold, moist dry things.
Then he teacheth generally of ye degrees of remedies of ye art of mix+ting the same.
Last of all he addeth also tables rehersals according to ye second qualities, as thei term the~ all which we let passe, because we write vnto the learned phisicions, nether is it conuenient to confound the partes of sciences one with an other.
Then in ye seco~d boke for euery disease xx] (those only that be most greuous and counted co~monly almost vncurable) he teacheth what reme+dies or medicins ought to be mixt with the quintessens.
Rogerius Bacho also writ a little booke of the qualities strengthes of Aqua vitae, throughout the .xii. signes according to the diseases from the head to the fete, adding waters and medicins according to the nature of euery part and disease, for one, one, for an other, an other.
Thys booke some ascribe to Arnold de villa noua. xxx] Ihon Brasescus a man of our age moste exercysed in the misteries of the Arte of liquors, as hys writinges do testify, in a certain dialoge, the spekers whereof be Raymund Lullus and Demogor+gon, (which ye author set forth in Italian, with an other also vpon the exposicion of the bokes of Geber.
Ihon Petreius at Norinberg Prynted them both in Latin withoute the authors name) affirminge that quintessens whyche serueth for the conseruing and lengthening of mannes life, is not to be lokt for out of plants, beastes or precyous x] stones, but of only metals: he wryteth thus.
Seing it is necessarye that this medicine should be vtterly vncorruptible, and in thys thinge it ought to passe and excede al things that haue any part of the elementes in them: it muste nedes be drawn out of such a matter as is moste far from all corrupcion, and leaste subiecte to the same.
Yet thou saidst in ye boke whiche thou writst of the secrets of nature, yt it shuld be drawn out of red wine, ye same co~firmeth Iohn xx] de rupa scissa, other suppose it shuld be made of Ce+ledonie, other wold take mans blud.
Thou art not a litle deceiued, if thou think ye writinges of philosophers ought to be taken vndersta~ded according to ye bare letter, chiefly in this science, ye more clearly plainly thei speke, so much ye more darknes haue their writings, for thei haue spoke~ by similitudes ridles in ye darkest form of spech.
Senior the philosopher saith this medicine xxx] is tourned and altered from coloure to coloure, and from taste to taste, and from nature to nature: and therfore the names therof are multiplied.
Also Minois a philosopher, if a man aske (saieth he) why is it made rede before it receiued whyt: Answer, that it was twys made blacke, twys turnid into orrenge colour, and receiued twys red coloure.
Seing nowe that it receiueth twys red coloure, as red wyne and mans bloud, that is to say, after the putrifaction and in the destillation: therefore the olde menne speakinge by x] similitudes called it red wyne, mans bloud, dragons bloud, and suche lyke, &c.
little after also he putteth those signes and tokens of quintessence now perfit, whiche Io. de Rupescissa doth: that is, that al men entring into the hous may be marnei lously allured vnto it set in a corner of the hous: an other.
that all birdes that perceine that swietnes of sauoure, may flocke together vnto it set in the top of a toure: this is expounded allegorically, that by the toure, the fornace set in a corner of the xx] hous, may be vnderstanded, in. the whiche fornace a glas co~teining the matter to be decocted is put: by them that enter in to this hous, and by the byrdes yt fly vnto it, maye be signified those spirites and vapoures whiche by the vertue of heat are ca+ried vpwarde and ascende aloft by the neck of the vessell or box: whiche when they are fastened and ascende no more, it is a token (saith he) that their watery moysture is now finished and the matter swietened, and the medicine ended.
page duplicate] page duplicate] [leaf motif] Of the dravvyng out of the quint essence from wyne, out of Vlstadius and Raymund Lullus.
THou shalt take the best wyne thou canst get, what colour soeuer it be, let it be wyny rather then swiet, destill it .iiii. tymes in a lembeck, so as commonly burning water is made.
If so be it, it be ofter destilled, it shalbe the better.
To knowe when it is sufficiently destilled, you shal consider, x] if it be set on fire in any vessell (of syluer or tyn) it will consume hoally, so that no moysture remain in the vessell.
When it is therfor prepared in this wyse, let it be put into a pellicane, that is a vessell with eares or handles on ether [Figure: syde one, whiche also some call the vessell of Mercurius, by the hoal wherof in the top, the matter that is to be circulated, may be put in and out.
And when the xx] vessell is diligently claied, and cemented with stif claye, by the often going vp and downe, the water shalbee turned into true quint essence.
Then the wyne so destilled as we haue said, whan as it hath all the foure eleme~ts, yet by the oft mouing agitacton and going vp and downe, it passeth and is turned from corruptible into almost vncorruptible.
If so be it that by the often ascention and descention of destillation, the xxx] grosse from the subtill, the inpure from the pure is separated, how muche more doth it come to pas in a still where it is tossed vp downe a thousand thousand times.
By this mouing therfore, it is to be supposed, that an elementall matier is turned in to a substance voyd of all elementes and a body incorruptible, so that this quint assence is of so mu+che the further from the corruption of a body that hath parte of the elementes in it, as the heauen it selfe is more vncorruptible the~ the foure eleme~ts.
But when this circulation is many times done, x] at length let the hoal that is in the top be opened: whereas you shal know by the moste precious and swiet smell, whether any part of the .iiii. elements remain, not conuerted yet in to quint essence.
For if it be perfitly done, there will issue forth a moste fragrant and pleasant smell, so excellent that they that fele it, shal thinke them selue to be rapt from the earth into heauen, and to haue the fruicion of a certain heauenly sauoure.
This vapour if it chaunce to insinuate it selfe into some close place xx] of the hous, it shall so fill the hous full, that thou shalt thinke thou neuer feltest any thinge more swete, more pleasaunt or better smelling, a maruei lous thing to be spoken and almoste incredible.
If it be set in the top of a toure, it will allure all kynde of byrdes vnto it, that be there aboute.
But if that excellent grace of sauoure appeare not yet, then thou shalt shytte it close againe in to the Pelecane, when it is dilige~tly clayed, fet it in again to the circulating destillation, vntill the perfit xxx] quint essence it selfe appeare, or els as Raymundus in his first boke the second chapter, calles it quick Mercury.
And it hath not only that moste excellent sauour and tast, but also a certain vncorruptible nature to be occupied aboute other medicines.
And surely it hath no brentnes in the mouth as aqua vitae, nether any moysture or fleame, bycause all the earthy elementall matter is settled down to the bottome.
Hovv qvint essence may be dravven x] out more easely and with les cost, for poore mens sakes, out of the same.
[Figure: PVtt Horsse dung in great deepe vessell or in a pitte made for this purpose: and in midst of the dunge set xx] the still, full vntill two third parts of the matter to be destilled, so that the third parte remaine withoute the dung empty, that the matter may ascende descende, and so to bee turned into cleare water.
But the dung must be renued once at the least euery wieke.
The same xxx] may be done in the drose of vynes that remaine after they be prest in the wine haruest: or els in the dog daies with the sunne.
It is possible also to draw quintessens out of troubled, vnclean and corrupte wine, if it be not sower or like Vineger: For we see euen of corrupt wine, if it grewe in a good place, althoughe it be troubled and of an ill taste, yet verye good Aqua vitae maye be destylled therout.
There is also an other waye to drawe it oute without fire and labor.
Take Aqua vitae the best x] you can finde: put it in a glasse [Figure: with a longe necke, in the toppe wherof must be a hole, why the oughte to be closed and stopped with waxe prepared accordingly (as Vlstadius techeth after in the te~th chapter.)
Then let it be turned vpside downe, and with the neck let it be put into the dung, so the grosser matter shall settle and lie in the bottome of the xx] still, whiche when it shall be a longe time buryed in the dung, at length shalbe drawn out by it in the form, as it is put in.
Then shalt thou see the separacion of the pure from the impure, the subtil from the grosse: For all the groser matter shalbe about the necke of the glasse.
Therfore with a fine pen and a sharp, thou shalt bore through the wax vnto the water, when the pen knife is drawne out, the grosser matter shall run out which was setled in the necke.
When thys is xxx] cleane run oute vnto the subtil and pure matter, that is, the very quintessente, stop the hoole wyth thy finger turn the glas vpright.
So hast thou quintessence, but les precious then thother afore.
In like manner may burninge water be put in a glasen vessell, not turned, but buried vprighte in dunge for a certaine space.
After by streinynge may you separate the groser mater which is setled to the bottome, from the pure that is aboue: but this is yet les precyus.
Notwithstanding it draweth out all the vertues of the herbes, and other x] matters, wherefore it is not to be set lighte by.
There maye also other wayes be inuented, but commende wyth all my harte, vnto al men the firste waye, as the best and most excellent: it is no great labour and light cost, nether shal you repent your self ether of the one or of thother: for you shall finde a treasure wyth a greate gaine.
After thys he addeth the waye howe to drawe oute quintessence oute of newe wine, yet hot in the xx] vessell in haruest, whiche is done wythoute anye harme to the wine, whiche for shortnes sake, and because it is not touched of other authors (as far as know· except perauenture of Lullus) wil let it passe. [leaf motif] In vvhat places Vlstadius in his heauen, teacheth to drawe out diuers quint essences. xxx] HOw the quint essence of wine is drawn forth, wherin golde may be resolued to make potable Golde, or Golde to be drunke .xi. chapter.

And of the same euerye one thou shalt rede in Lullus, in his first boke of quint essence.
Quint essence of wine som cal quick Mercury, som heauen, and the key of philosophers, this (as men say) doth extract and drawe oute within the space of .iiii. hours, the vertue and strengthe of euery thing that is stiept therin.
Ihon Brasescus, by red wine, wherout quintessence xx] should be drawn, supposeth somthinge should be vnderstanded and some metally thing, as we me~cioned afore, wheras we intreated generally of quintessence.
merueilous vvater that hathe a contrary operation to Aqua vitae which may be called cold quint essence.
THe flours of samoncus elder, flours of hors houf, which groweth vppon waters hauing xxx] great leues the flour of giluu~ (otherwise flour of nenuphar, which think to be true, and so doth Rogeri{us} interpretate it) of ether of them a pound.
Purslan sede, lettis sede, of ether .iii. pou~d, (other wise half a pou~d) of the leaues of salonum nightshade .ii. sru (otherwise as muche of nighteshade as of al thother.)
Al these must be taken grene destilled .vii. times kept diep in ye erth in a glas.
This water whe~ it waxeth hot in the sun about midday, it wil make glasses, or thin wodden vessels, the images or shel of egges to flie in the aire x] (this place semeth to be corrupt depraued, or els the thing to be false.)
If a cloth be wet in it cast into ye fire, it wil lepe out of the fire without harm and what so euer is dipte in it, it will not suffer the heat of the fire.
Nether shal that cloth be hurt by fire that is moystened in this water: If Aqua vitae be sprinkled vpon it, then cast it into ye fire, or set it on fire with a candle: it wil burne but not co~sume nor waste, nether leue any sign of burntnes in ye cloth.
If so be it part of this water, when xx] the sun shineth hot, be put in a dishe or boule, and thrown into thair with a strinkle, it will make a great cloude and thicke sodenly, and mitigateth the heat of the sunne for a great space.
It stauncheth the floures of wemen: it kepeth a man from sweating: it stirreth vp the appetite: it putteth away the head ache, speciallye that cometh of a hot cause, or by the heat of the sunne.
To conclude, it hath manye and great vertues: for it xxx] is medicinable in hot causes, as Aqua vitae in cold Wherfore the vse therof is good in all agues as well hoat as burning agues: in all hoat diseases, and grieues of the eyen and head, that co~meth of heat: also againste the irkesumnes and lothsumnes of the stomack: for the diseases called Lupus, and the fistula, and the pain of the syde, the heat of the priuy members through the act of generation, and all diseases aboute thies priuy partes, what hot causes so euer thei cum of.
And after the deliueraunce of wemen, it is very proffitable if a x] cloth be dipt in it and laid vpon the wombe or mo+ther, (the preuy place) and vpon the place where the grief is, if the grief be outward: if it be inward then take some of it and mynister it by the way of a glister.
If ther be any fault in the stomack, take of it morning and euening half an egge shell full· If a mans yard be sore within, let therof be conueied in by a pype for that purpose.
Against the obstructions and stoppinges of the liuer splene and other diseases of hoat causes, wette a linnen xx] cloth therin and lay it to the diseased syde thrys a day: for it purgeth the bloud very greatly.
but you must take good hede that the cloth that is moystened therwith roole not vpon the stomack, nor cum nye it.

Of the extracting and dravvyng forth of all the vertues of Chelidonia or selandine: by the whiche example, euery man of any vnderstanding, may vse to drawe out the vertues x] also of other planetes.
Brasescus thinkes sumwhat els to be allegorically vndersta~ded, as declared before wher we entreated of quint essence generally.
Chelidonia, Sela~din (saith Vlst.) hath innumerable vertues: and the quint essence therof, which we wil teache here to get out, goeth xx] to the making of potable gold or gold that may be drunck.
Selandine when it is moste rype, take it with the herbe, routes and floures, cut it small beate it in a morter, then put it in a cucurbitam or body of a still of earth glased: when the body is ful shit it close, and clay it round aboute, then set it in now hors dung, for the space of iii. weekes.
After put it in a limbeck and destill it in Balneo Mariae, with a slow fyre, and the fleame shall auoyde out of it.
Then shall you drawe out the dregges, and xxx] when they are very fine ground vpon a marble stone, put the~ again in a cucurbita with a blynde lymbeck, and let them stand in Balneo Mariae a seuennight, or in hors dung mo daies.
Afterwarde the matter by litle and litle being couled put on a nosed limbeck, and destill it in ashes, according as in the .x. chap. of the separation of oyle from the earth, we haue spoken: and there shall issue oute a clear water conteining in it selfe aire and water.
Thou shalt separate the water from the aire in a new cucurbita by Balneo Mariae, with an easy fire: x] for the fleam shall ascende and the oyle remayne, whiche thou shalt reserue and kepe.
Then shalt thou grynde the dregges agayne vpon a marble stone, and power .iiii. partes of the fleam to one of the dregges, mixt them, and incorporate the~, and let them stande in Balneo Mariae seuen days at the last thou halt destill the~ in sand with a great fire, and the fleame shall issue oute first, then a radishe water, or rather an oyle, whiche is the element of fyre, from the whiche thou shalte separate the xx] fleame in Balneo Mariae, as is before sayde.
But the dregges that left, whiche conteyne nothinge els but earth, must bee vrged with a stronge fyre and brought vnto lyme, by the space of ten daies. (that is in a fornace of calcination or reuerberation, or a very lyme kiln, as haue taught in the tenth chap.)
Then grynd them again vpon a mar+ble stoone and sooke them in the fleame, and lette them be destilled in a limbeck, vntill you see in the matter lyttle whyte stoones lyke salt.
And xxx] this salt must againe bee dissolued with water, out of whiche you haue destilled it, and after, you shall destill it again, and againe so ofte, vntill the earth chaunce and put away from it all vncleane and earthy colour, be brought to a very whyte (to the whytnes of wax) and so it shalbe rectified earth.
The other elementes also ought to be rectified, so that euerye one bee destilled seuen tymes, powring euery time the fleam to the aire and fier, and after separating them as is afore said.
When as thou wilt do this an easier way, dissolue euery x] eleme~t with his own water by equall portio~s, &c. whiche let pas, bycause they are declared sumwhat obscurely.
There is also an other way more subtill, to reduce euery element to his perfection or quintessence, but it must be presupposed that euery element be first iustified.
Then let it be put in a vessel of circulation in hors dung or in Balneo Mariae. xxx. daies, and then destill it againe.
So shall the very body as a gros matter be chaunged into spirite or moste subtill and pure substance.
xx] Sum do it with more ease, taking foure partes of earth, and one part of one of the foure elements whiche a man wil, and by digesting, after the forsaid maner, and circulating .xxx. daies, they dooe chaunge any element into quintessence.
The matter is iudged to be sufficie~tly circulated, whan the quintessence swimmeth aboue the other matter.
Of the vertues of euery one of the liquors of Selandine.
The element of the water is good for al the diseases of the body, both hoat cold.
It tempereth xxx] also al the veines about the hart, and driueth all ve nom from the hart: it cureth al the diseases that chaunce vnto the lunges.
It purgeth the bloud, and preserueth a man from all corruption of the natural strength and power.
At once, it is good for all sicke men in what disease so euer they be.
The element of air, like vnto oyle, confirmeth and encreaseth the strength and beauty of yong persons, if they vse it sometimes with meate, for it letteth the bloud fro~ corrupting by any menes. x] It burneth vp, consumeth and expelleth all salte fleame: it taketh away melancholy and all brentnesse of cholor.
The eleme~t of fire, if so much as a wheat corn in quantity be mixt with the best wine ye can get and poured into a sick mans mouthe, yea if he be half dead, it restoreth and refresheth al the stre~gthes of the body: for it perceth vnto the hart, and maketh it warme: and expelleth all poysons and moist superfluities from the hart.
Lullus with the xx] quint essence of wine mixeth a little drop of thys oyle, to restore the~ that are about to die, and past al hope, in that within the .xx. part of an hour.
Som draw out the quint essence fro~ Selandine an other way and shorter.
They cut Selandine to+gether with the rote and flour in smal peces they wey it, pouring wel water vpon it, they sethe it til it be brought to the same weighte.
Then they pun it in a stone morter, and when the iuyce is streined out through a linnen clothe and purged xxx] from the dregges, they decoct and sieth the resttil it be ad consistenciam mell is as thick as hony.
After, they put it in a cucurbita so that it be half full, by destillacion in Balneo Mariae, they gather ye water or fieme.
Then translating the vessel into ashes, they receiue the aiery oyl, wherupon when they se an other kind of oyl swim aboue (the fyre being encresed) they set vnder an other receiuing vessel, wherin the element of fire is gathered.
Euery one of these liquors must be rectified, that it may be mete for the medicins of mans bodi, that x] is, by the repetinge the destillacion .vii. times: of the water or fleme in Balneo Mariae, so yt at euery time the cucurbita be diligentlye washed, (made cleane) from the dregges which remaine, whiche ought to be mixt wt the element of thearth, which remaineth in the bottome of the cucurbita after ye destillation of ye fiery liquor.
Likewise thou shalt rectify thair, destilling it in ashes .vii. times, mixting the dregs with thearth.
The earthy matter, in such maner xx] as is said afore in the other fashion.
To these thinges thus dressed, they attribute same vertues yt we rehersed afore, to euerye one of them: which it nedeth not to repete: onlye those thinges wherin they differ, we wil rehers.
The waterye liquor of Selandine putteth away al heats poisons out of brest.
It is good for the stoppinges of the liuer and lunges: for it consumeth ye superfiuous humors fleme: Ty co~clude, it deliuereth a ma~ within the space of .ix. daies, free fro~ all infirmities. xxx] The aierye liquor suffereth no blacke choler, no bitter, nor fleme in ye body to get ye moisture.
It encreseth blud, destributeth it into all the partes of the body by his pearcing.
Wherfore they that vse this oyle, do let blud the ofter.
If a ma~ be in ieoperdy losing of an eie, let him drop in a drop or .ii. therof euerye daye by the space of xxx. dais, it shal do him merueilus much good.
The firye liquor is muche more effectuous then the watry or aiery, helpeth where they fayle.
It conserueth the youthe, it maketh age liuelye and x] youthful, it refresheth ye hart, being receiued wt water of a kind of whete, it is saide to be elipir of life.
Moreouer ye earthy matter rectified by disso+lucio~s, coagulations ielyings: calinatio~s sub til salt of ye erth, wherwith al metals may be turned into stone, al spirits may be fixed: hauynge radicable naturall moisture.
Of this ye auncie~t philosophers made a stone which they called ye philosophers stone.
The maner to receiue for said liquors within the bodi is xx] thus.
Three drops of ye fire of Sela~dine, iii. sponeful of rosewater, put to it a litle sponeful of sanguin air is the liquor of the air) geue it to be drunken fasting, if the disease be hot, with wine: and if the man be past .xxiiii. yeres of age geue it him wt Aqua vite.
In hot agues it ought not to be taken in no wise.
Of drawing out the four elementes from Selaudine and bay leaues, reade also Io. Ganiuetus booke, whych is entituled Amicus medicorum, a xxx] frend and a louer of phisicions.
chap. Hovv quint essence is dravvn out of frutes, as Appels, Peres, plummes, Cheries, Chestnuts. &c. out of Vlstadi{us}.
WHen the is small cut and stampte in a stone morter, mixte it wyth the .x. part of common salt.
Then put it in a cucurbita with a blind limbeck, and set it in hors dung, as is said afore of mans blud. &c Oute of Floures, herbes, x] and rootes.
GAther the Plantes, when they be well ripened, in faire weather, in the spring of the mone: and when it is almost at ye ful, wash them and cut the~ very lmall: beate them in a morter of marble with the tenthe part of salt, and thou shalt sower them in a circulating vessel or blind limbek, in hors dunge for ye space of a month.
Then shalt thou destill them in xx] a nosed limbeck in Balneo Mariae, encreasyng the first fire to the third degre.
The~ take the dregges out of the cucurbita, and grineding the~ very smal poure the destilled water vpon them againe, and when they are putrified in dung again as before at the length thou shalt destil them, deminishing the fire by the half degre.
&c. as before, and when thou destillest the~ again, deminishe and lesson the fyre, yet also by ye halfe degre.
The putrefaction also must alwaies xxx] decrease by the half degre: that is to say, like as in the second digestion, it may be putrified by space of one and twenty daies, in the third .xiiii. daies, in the fourth .viii. daies.
When the fourth destilla+tion is done, put it in a circulating vessell (close aboue and beneth and large, narowe [Figure: in the midst, with a short byl holow coming out of the vpper part of the nether bely, looking vpward) and let it be digested in dung or a bath with a fire x] of the first degre, or els in sun, or in the dros of grapes, by the space of a moneth.
The water shall be so muche the more precious, ye oftener it is destilled.
And so hast quint essence: which not withstanding shalbe the more effectual if thou shalt destil the water of the herbes, seedes, or routes: and poure it again vpon his owne dreges, then digest it by the space of seuen daies, and afterwarde destill it by ashes, the very same way as it is sayd afore of selandin that euery element xx] may be had seuerally, and that rectified.
Of quint essence of mans bloud, egges, fleshe, and hony.
HOwe quint essence is gotten out of ma~s bloud, egges, and fleshe, reade Vlstadi' the xiiii. chap.
They put vnto them the tenth part of salt, wherwith they ar wel mingled, putrified and destilled and that four tymes, xxx] by cours, first the one then the other: and at length they are perfited by long circulation, vntil they come to the moste swietnes of sauoure, and pure fynnes of substance: Lullus also in his first booke the .iiii. chap. mencioneth of quint essence, but the printed bookes left out that, that salt must be added vnto it.
It semeth that salt may ryghtly be added to the destilling of moyste thinges, specially those that woulde easely corrupte, suche as chiefly the partes of beastes are.
moste precious water of Albertus magnus, as x] found it in a certain wryten booke.
Destill the bloud of a healthfull man, by a glas, as men dooe rose water.
With this, any disease of the body, if it be anoynted therewith, is made hoale, and all inwarde diseases by the drinking thereof.
small quantitie therof receiued, restoreth the~ that haue lost all their strength: it cureth the palsey effectuously, and preserueth the body from all sicknes.
All be it can nether allow the making of medicines xx] for men of mans bloud, whiche although reason and experience would moue vs vnto it, yet religio~ semeth to forbid it, namely when there is so many other medicines. &c. Nether yet do lyke the preparation of this Albertus water, if it be his, when as he wylles it to be destylled only once and simpely.
The composition that followeth hath more reason with it, whiche founde also in the same written booke.
Holy oyle or lyfe oyle (bycause it preserueth xxx] the lyfe of man) of Hevve Gordones, wherewith he cured many mooste greuous diseases: Three pounde of read bloud of a helthfull man or helthfull men of .xxv. or thyrty yeare olde, Spermaceti, the mary of neet of ether a pounde: Lette them be destilled in a lymbeck well clayed and closed, and a water shall issue oute first whyte, the next pale, the thyrde yellowe, the fourth read, and sumwhat thycke.
An oyle so destylled, when the moone encreaseth and decreaseth, therefore they name it holy.
If so be it then gyue a sycke man that hath x] loost boeth all his strengthe and speeche, three dropes with a lyttle wyne, he shall bothe speake by and by and be stronger.
If a man euerye daye drynke a drop of this oyle with a sponfull of wyn, he shall become lusty in mynde and strong in body throughoute all his membres, and shall proroge and put of age very longe, and shall be hurt with no poyson.
It cureth also fistulas, old breaches and temporall byles, if they become sumwhat drye before with the washyng of wyne. xx] Anoynt freshe woundes therewith and it healeth them in three dayes.
It cureth the fyges or blaines of the fundament without and within.
It healeth diuers diseases, the Leprosy, the Morphew, the Palsy and other, if a man fastyng drynke a droppe of it with whyte wyne.
Many boaste muche of mannes bloud sublimated, as a certayne man Bartholomevve de Montaguana, made at Padua, but surely he was ignoraunt howe to prepare it, whiche if thou wylt vse, make xxx] it on this wyse.
Take the bloud of sanguin yong me~ vsing a good diet whyles it is newly letten, and let it stande a whyle, and put away the water that swymmeth aboue, the~ with a litle salt punned chauf it a good and put it in a vessell well closed and clayed, after set it in hors dung fortie daies.
At the length destill it certaine tymes, euer powring the water againe vpon the dregs.
At the last thou shalt haue a marueilous water, which being mixt with sum zulapio (ielup as we call it) is wonderfull proffitable x] to them that haue the hecticall feuer.
It shal be ye better if after it be destilled you put it to stiep again in hors dung fortie daies.
man may also mixt other holsome medicines for the hectical persones, together with the bloud.
To draw out the foure elementes from mans bloud, read the booke of Ioh. Geniuetus called the friend of physicions.
Of mans bloud destilled simpely, read Brunsvvick, in the duche booke of destillacio~s.
He writeth xx] that this water, and the water of mans excre+mentes and ordure, if they be mixt together, will bryng to pas certain marueylous thinges.
Io. Bracescus, is of this opinion that the olde wryters woulde signify allegorically some other thing, that of metall, when they speake of mans bloud: as recited before, wher write of quint essence generally.
Vlstadius in the .x. chap. of his xxx] booke called the Heauen of philosophers, wher he teacheth how quint essence of wine is made, euery element drawne out apart by him self: And thys (sayth he) which is destilled in the seuenth time, is called mannes bloude, whiche the destillers, chieflye searche, and it is verye ayre.
In deede the liquor of the aire, whiche in the mooste parte of destilled thinges is oylye, semeth to be called by the name of mans bloude, for as much as our bodye consisteth of foure humors as elements, wherof the blud is compared x] to air, hot, moyst, somwhat &c.
But Ihon Brasescus, mans blud is a certain metally thing, so called of the color.
For the extracting and drawinge out of quint essence from honi, which goeth to making of potable gold, read Vlstadius the .xii. chap. and .xxii. whereas he prescribeth also diuers waies to gather thre maner of waters, and reherseth the vertues, wherof he spake nothinge in the .xii. chap. declared to get out only two diuers waters.
IHon Brasesc{us} in the dialog of Raimund and Demogorgon, when he had affyrmed that quint essence whiche is profitable to the preseruacion and lengethening of mannes life, can not be had of anye other thing the~ of metals only, he addeth at le~gth.
When as accordinge to the opinion of the auncient philosophers, euery metall after theyr xxx] vertue, name, coloure and proprietie are co~prehended in euery metall, as it is plainly declared, in the boke of the expositio~ of Gebrus bokes: therfore this our medicin also although it be extracted and drawn out of som one metal only, yet neuertheles it shall haue the vertue of al metals and plantes, and the vertue ouer the hole bodye of man to heale manye infirmities that be curable.
Ioan de Rupescissa speking of our radical and naturall moisture, and of quint essence vnder the name of Aqua vitae, wolde signify the same, for he x] saith that burning water doth conteine in it selfe the good vertue of all metals, and that it is not the water of the vine, but of life, because it geueth life vnto men.
He that will knowe more of thys thing and more plainly, let him read the dialoge of the same Brasescus, wherein he expoundeth Gebrus.
Of the dravving out of quint essence from Antimonia, lead, white lead out xx] of Vlstadius.
Incorporate and mingle the pouder of antimonii most finely beaten, with most sharpe vineger destilled, and let it stande til the vineger be tourned into a very red colour.
Then driue the vinegar oute, and in a cleane vessell put other destilled vinegar vppon the antimonium, and set ouer a little fyre till the vineger be colored· This shal you repete so ofte, till the vinegar will be colored xxx] no more.
So much of the vinegar as is colored, thou shalt destill it in a limbecke in ashes.
Firste the vineger it selfe will run oute, after thys thou shalt see a matter issue forthe of a thousande couloures, and thys is that quint essence whyche is called of the Philosophers.
Philosophers leade, and of some virgines milke (it differeth notwithstandinge from it, whereof shall be spoken here after, saithe Vlstadius) it is almoste like blessed oyle in coloure.
Put thys in a Pellican to be circulated for the space of fortye dayes.
It dryeth x] vp woundes, and is profitable for all woundes in steade of Balme, for it cureth all woundes easelye and quicklye: it is merueilous good for all impostumes.
Yea also quint essence is extracted and drawn oute of leade or white leade after the same manner as out of antimonio, pouringe destilled vineger vpon it, that the vineger be ouer it foure fyngers deepe: after let it be digested in dunge, as it is sayde of quint essence of hearbes and floures. xx] Then let it be destilled and fyrste ye shall see the vineger it selfe ascende vp: after that a certaine liquor like to oyle.
And thys also is called oyle of lead or quint essence of leade: and it hathe in it a certaine swietnesse lyke· as the oyle of antimonii.
It is good againste all burnynges wyth fyre and hot water, as also againste itches, as ringewormes and chollericke bladders.
But a manne muste noote, that the white lead oughte firste to bee washed often with water xxx] of Rooses, dreiuynge it by a linnen clothe. vntil none of the pouder of the white lead remain in it.
Then whe~ it is dried, reserue it to your vse.
So doth Bulcasis Ioan of Sanct Amandus vpon the Andidotarie of Io. Mesuae, wil to be done.
Of the drawing forth of quint essence out of diuers metals, as golde, siluer, lead tin, vitriol, or coproos, iron, coper, brimston, read orpment, yalow ocker, antimonio and marchata leaden, who so listeth, let him read in Lullius in his booke of quint essence.
x] The spirit or quint essence of vitriol is co~mended of certaine men against the falling sicknesse, and Apoplexia or the benumninge of the sences.
The spirit of gold against the diseases of the lyuer.
The spirit of againste the stone of the raines and bledder.
But of these and certaine other we shall speake hereafter amongste oyles of metals and otherwhere.
VVAters of life composed are proprelye called, when as certaine medicins are stieped in the veri Aqua vitae and destilled together, improperly when as they are put to after not destilled together.
Ther be also waters of vertue or golden (as they cal the~) when as the medicins stieptfirst not in Aqua vitae but in wine, but of which we wil write hereafter: xxx] certain of these haue many things commun wt those that we describe here: sauing that they are les vehement and les hoat and drye.
Sum sortes of aqua vitae are commau~ded to be made simpely, putting the medicines into aqua vitae: other into aqua vitae thrys or foure tymes destilled.
Sum there bee also to whome a certaine tyme of infusion or digestio~ is prescribed, as. daies. &c. Sum are put in punned in the beginning· other hoal, and broken after a certain daies fermentacion and stieping.
Sum are destilled on x] ly once: other twys or thrys.
And sum only in Balneo Mariae: other in Balneo Mariae once ortwys thirdly in ashes, as that which Vlsta. describeth xlvi. chap. although there is nothing elles done but infusio~ in wyne.
Aqua vitae is described to be destilled thrys, the first water wherof is called Blessed, the seco~d Aqua vitae, the third, the mother of balm.
Againe the destillatio~ of certain is repeted twys or thrys, that the water first destilled, be always powred xx] again vpon his groundes or dregges, as Vlstad. teacheth in the .xlix. and .lvi. chap.
Also sum are commaunded to be drawen out with a slow fyre in Balneo Mariae.
Other in the same with a strong fyre, as the the water described in Vlstadius. xlvi. chap.
Many tymes in the first destillacion, only freshe herbes, and freshe seedes are put with the aqua vitae: and dry swiet smelling thinges, spyces and other, also hony is added after to the water drawen out of the herbes or seedes, and then are xxx] they destilled again: afterward amber, moske and camphora put vnto it, thirdly, folding the limbeck euery fote with moyst clothes with the whytes of egges and bran together.
Concerning the matter, none almoste is composed without spices: vnto diuers also swiet smelling herbes are added: vnto some, bothe the flowers and the siedes, sumtymes also other destilled waters: Also malmsey, hony, sugar, figes.
To conclude, vnto some hoale peces of golde: suppose it to be added in vain except it be que~shed x] in the liquor.
But all thies thinges shall appeare more plain by examples.
Vlstadius described .xiiii. kindes of aqua vitae composed, whiche we let pas because of breuitie shortnes.
We reade in Vlsta. the .liii. chap. of aqua vitae, with spices and hony, &c to be destilled in Balneo Mariae, and an other lykewyse, but without hony, the .liiii. chap.
Vlstadius describeth a certain marueilous aqua vitae in the .lvi. chap.
First he bids to digest diuers freshe and new medicines, in Balneo Mariae. xiii. xx] daies, in aqua vitae powred vnto them: then to bee destilled in ashes with a slow fire.
After he addeth spyces and other dry thinges: and bids digest the~ xiiii. daies: and destill them again in Balneo Mariae.
If so be it (saith he) thou wilt haue the water yet better, put vnto it certain precious and costly powders or spyces of confections made of amber, made of mosen, made of precious stones.
&c. and a fewe ducates of the fynest xxx] gold, with halfe a pounde of sugar: and thou shalt digest it three daies in warm water of Balneo Mariae, afterwarde destill it by a filtrum or list of wollen cloth in croked glases well clayed, so that the one glas stand higher then the other.
And this (saith he) is the moste excellent Aqua vitae amo~gst all other.
An aqua vitae, whiche may be a remedy against the moste part of diseases, put rosemary, cinamo~, geloflowers, ginger, and maces, and two or three peces of gold, (whiche will bee neuer a whit the x] wors for being thus vsed) into aqua vitae, foure tymes destilled.
Vse this water .iiii. tymes destilled, morning and euenyng before slepee.
It dryueth awaye dyuers kyndes of diseases, and restoreth youthe.
What aqua vitae can dooe, wherein rosemary is stieped, see hereafter where we make mencion of oyle of rosemary.
Take three vnces of Dianthos made with sugar, put it in three poundes of wyne, three dayes, xx] or in water of wyne, destilled once for olde men, (that is, that whiche cummeth furth first, not that whiche runneth last) moreouer lette it be destilled by a Filtrum.
Sum destil it in a lymbeck, and keepe it vnto their vse.
Sum mixt the thyrd parte of Rosatae nouellae, that they may asswage the heat and dryth of the Dianthos.

These thus gathered together, take the liquors of them destilled in Balneo Mariae accordinglye, and mingle them with the best old Elseter wine, or rather wyth .iiii. poundes of Aqua vitae. vi. times destilled, put them in a stronge cucurbita of glasse, that wil hold .iiii. good ale quartes, which thou shalt claye well and let it stande in Balneo Mariae. iiii. daies.
Afterwarde, then thou shalt xxx] burne the hyacinctes, coralles, Pearles and mother of perles into pouder, as men do lim, grind them vpon marble diligently, til thou canst fele no roughnes in the pouder.
Put thys pouder into some vessell, and make it with Rose water into a liquor, what so euer remaineth sharp or rough, which is not mixt with the water, grinde it again, and wash it the second time.
man maye resolue the coralles into water when they are once pund or ground, setting them in the iuice of Berberies, which way is better the~ the other.
After this beat x] the rotes meanly, and likewise the sedes of the iuniper and paeony the herbes thou shalt cut.
Afterwarde put the herbes, rotes, and precious stones moystened and made liquid with the Rose water, into a strong glasen cucurbita, that will holde sixe great ale quartes, there about ges .vi. Dutche mooses to bee, which thinck he meaneth by Me~suras,) and pour vpon them the Aqua vitae whych is dygested wyth the destylled liquors in Balneo Mariae, and when the cucurbita is defended closed xx] round about with clay of wisdom, put it into a pit digged in a moyst place, as in som celler vnder thearth .ii. cubits diep, iiii. cubites or there aboute wide and lo~g, which thou shalt fil with hors du~g and lime strawed and laid by courses, now one lai er of the one, now an other of the other, til it be .ii. fote aboue the pit.
In the midst hereof thou shalt let the cucurbita stand for a monthe, then take the dung away by little and litile: and the matter whiche it conteineth to be destilled, thou shalt destribute xxx] it into .vi. les cucurbitas, and destil them, in Balneo Mariae, with so slow a fire, that from the falling of one drop, til the falling of an other, thou maiste tell one .ii. .iiii. till thou come at ten.
For thou must in any wise, take hede that the bath be not to hot, whe~ the destillacion is once ended, stur the dregs that be left in euery one of the cucurbitas with a sticke moderatlye, and poure the water that is drawne oute of them in againe, and destill them again with a slow fire as before.
When this destillacion is once ended, pour out all the dregs, x] and distribute the liquors, gathered in .vi. cucurbits, into .ii. cucurbits, of .iii. greate ale quartes a pece, and destill them in Balneo Marie gentlelye.
So hast thou a treasure and an incomparable remedye againste the pestilence.
The vse thereof is bothe to preserue, and also to cure prouokynge a sweete after the drinking therof.
So sone as any manne perceiueth him selfe enfected with the pestilence (so that it bee wythin xxiiii. houres that it enfecteth hym, for after that tyme there is no xx] hoope or verye lyttle of anye remeadye,) lette hym dryncke halfe an ounce of thys liquor, and lyinge vppon a bedde couered moderatelye wyth clothes, and tarye for sweate: the chamber muste be cloose from any ayre entrynge in.
Wythin an houre and a halfe or there aboute, the sweat wyll begin: whyche a manne muste suffer and abyde iii. houres at the leaste, it shall be better if they sleepe a lyttle more, or .iiii. houres, absteyninge from dryncke all the whyle, and wypinge hys xxx] face euerye foote wyth a lynnen clothe.
After remouing the clothes by litle and litle, and wiping the bodye, when the sicke is risen, let him eate sodden Barlye, or a little meale of Oates broyled, mixte wyth Vineger and Rose water or Vineger onlye, whiche shall be mixt alway with his meate also for the space of a sennyghte.
For his drincke he shall take a decoction of Barlye with raisons and Licoris, when it is wel couled, let hym dryncke as much thereof as he liste.
Let him abstein from wine .iii. or .iiii. daies: after let x] him put water to his wine.
Therefore when he hathe taken meat after swet, let a newe bedde be prepared for the sicke man, or suffer him if he be so disposed, to tarye in a chamber, but wythoute aire, for the space of .iii. or .iiii. daies.
If so be it he perceiue yet anye inwarde heate by the menes of the sweate, let him drincke the liquor destilled of coulinge thinges, as wilde Poppye, Mulberies, or Blacke beries, Endiue and Cikorye, the floures of sambucus, Eldar, or Acetosa.
And if so xx] be it, while he sweteth, the botch called authrax or bubo do rise as it chaunceth often times, then thou shalt vse theese medicines.
Cut an Onyon on the one side, make it hollowe and put triacle into it, tormentil, Dictamni diligently broken and punde, in equall partes, and put the cappe that you cut of the Onyon on agayne, fold it in moyst towe, then roaste it vnder the ashes by the space of .vi. houres, then punne it in a morter, and wrynge it throughe a lynnen clothe, puttynge xxx] Vinegar made wyth Roose water vnto it.
then lay the moyst cloth to the place, and as oft as it dryeth, moysten it again.
If a man drinke, once a moneth, halfe an vnce of this liquor and sweat vpon it, he shalbe preserued.
It is very good also, if a man hold a drop or twoo therof euery daye in his mouth in the morning.
Vlstadius in the .xlvi. chap. describeth an other aqua vitae commended both for the pestilence and for other diseases.
An aqua vitae or quint essence, whose effect is redy x] and present against poyson, specially lest by the byting or stinging of beastes, described by Matthaeolus Senensis, in his sixt booke of his commentaries vpon Dioscorides.
pound of our antidotu~ now described, (the description wherof we let pas for briefnes sake: a man may vse good triacle in the place of it, or Mithridatu~, or an other effectuall antidotum) and a pound of syrup of the barkes of citron, mixt them with fiue poundes of aqua vitae so oft destilled, till it cum to quint essence, and put xx] them in a cucurbita of glas as big againe as the thinges do occupy, (that is of .xiiii. poundes,) and when it is well clayed moue it moderatly softly so long till the antidotus be holly resolued mixt with the liquor.
So let it stand a moneth, mouing and chafing it in lyke maner twys a wieke.
The moneth being ended power out softly by litle and litle the clere water whiche is ascended aboue the antidotus whiche is sattled in the bottom, into an other vessell of glas, and reseruith very well closed.
xxx] This liquor is so effectuall, whiche haue proued by innumerable tryales, that if halfe an vnce therof be dronken with wyne, or with any co~+uenient water destilled, or els alone, it restoreth a man infected with the bytyng or stinging of any beast althoug he haue lost both his voyce and his sences, and calleth him again to the great wondering of all mem.
For the moste parte also the humors nowe infected are auoyded by vomite.
The same vertue hath it against poysons which a ma~ hath reciued in meats or drinkes.
For ye strength x] of this liquor is so subtile and effectuall, that euen in a moment and furthwith it peerceth al the vaynes of the body.
It healeth lykewyse also other many and diuers diseases as euery leerned physicion may consider by him self, chiefly it resisteth the pestilence, both by preseruing and also curing them that be infected.
Take a great ale quart of aqua vitae rectified, put therein half an vnce of cinamon .ii. or .iii. nutmegges, cloues. xx] ii. scruples, all pund, and let them stande a hooll daye: when a water is destilled thereof in a limbeck of glas, giue the sick man a sponfull ther+of.

They asscribe the same vertues euery one vnto it whiche we mencioned before in waters of vertues, xx] and .xx. seuerall vertues or ther about ar asscribed to sum one of them.
The conseruation of health, the restoring of youthe, and other, whiche also ar ascribed for yt most part to simple aqua vitae certain kynd of aqua vitae is commended in a certain booke wryten against the leper and pestilence: in the composicion whereof Fumetetrae, the les netle, the leaues of bedegnar, let them bee stieped in wyne in Balneo Mariae, a moneth: then let them be destilled, casting into them also a dram xxx] of gold beaten to pouder.
Afterward put to destilled wyn decocted and sodden with peper, that there may be equal porcions of both liquors, whiche ioyned together, and stieped eight dayes together in Balneo Mariae, must be destilled again.
He willeth a sponefull of this water to be drunke euery day for the space of a mo+neth, and the leprous places to be anoynted therwith.
They say it purgeth bloud dissolueth the congeled bloud, and chaungeth the hoole temperature of the body: and if a ma~ may beleue it, it cureth x] well nye all diseases.

Tvvo compositions of Aqua vite oute of the boke of Raimundus Lullus, x] of waters.
IN the co~posed waters of life folowing, althoughe Raymundus do not expresse whether wine or burning water ought to be put to the medicins, that they mai be destilled together, yet we haue thoughte good to rehers them in this place, because Raimundus seemeth vtterlye to wyll these medicines to be destilled in burning water, the~ in wine, as one that xx] alloweth euery where the more perfect liquors the oftest destilled.
Take the rotes of fenell, rusci, maidenheare, sperage, Rapes, parsellye, eryngii, mill of the sunne, scariolae, of euerye one like much mixt them and destill them wyth a slowe fyre.
(It appeareth that thys liquor is good to prouoke vrine, and against the stone.)
Take cloues, Nutmegs, mastik, doronicum, zedoaria, galingal, long peper, ye bark of citron, sage sambucus that is elder (perauenture it shoulde be xxx] samsuchus, that is Maioram) dill, spiknard.
Wood of Aloes, cubebe, cardamonuum, Lauendula, Mint Peniroyal, organy, calamus aromaticus, both kindes of sticas, germander, chamepytis, of euerye one like much, and a litle muske.
The vertues be all one wyth simple Aqua+vite, but farre more effectuall.
Or the same that are attributed before to other waters of life composed of many medicines.
Then foloweth a water composed of manye colde medicines, not in hys place (as it semeth) which made mencion of before x] in the colde quint essence.
Afterward is placed a most perfect Aqua vite (as he calleth it, that is, because it is composed of verye manye thinges, and that most hot.)
Take Euphorbium, Serapinu~, opopanax, pyretrum, Capers, squinanthum, spodium, bdellium, long peper, and white or blacke, cubebe, castoreum, zedoaria, of euery one equal portions, to the which thou shalt put good Mastick, and a little Amber, Saffron, and of the bone of a hartes hart.
Also take all the thinges aforsaide in xx] the composed waters, and let them be destilled with a slowe fire.
For it is a merueilous water, the mother and chief of all medicines, whose vertues are merueilous and innumerable against al colde diseases.
It is made in this wise. &c. he describeth streight way the maner of destilling biserpentins (as they call them) he addeth also other thinges which all do agree with the simple Aqua vite, in so much that suppose the boke to be corrupted by the fault of the Printer. xxx] VVhat medicines be mixt vvith Aqua vitae, without any destillation, first within the body, then without.
MAny times instrumentes, time or cost faileth a man, that those medicines, whose strength he wold haue in his aqua vitae (as though it were by a certain metempsy chosin, is a transposinge of the soules or principal vertues) he can not mixt them with it by destilation, whiche onely waye is x] the chief and best of al other to mixt thinges together, for both by disgestio~, as though it were a pre+paration in a moderat heat, first one mixture is made, then in destillation twyse as muche, first of the vapours by the least and moste pure partes of the spirites, then by dropes when they gather together into water: but circulatio~ is it that bringeth a perfectnes and absolutnes to all mixtures: and without doubt, no mixtur that men deuise or inuent, can more properly and ny imitate the naturall xx] mixture: whiche is plain by this argument taken of the ende and effect: for thinges prepared in this wyse and mixed, do les corrupt then by any other meanes, and hauing gotten a certain moste simple and moste pure substaunce that they seme to the sence, to be simple, and of an airy or a fytte substaunce, they attain vnto a certain incorruptio~ as nye as may be.
This is euide~t, loke how much any thyng shall haue the partes wherof it consisteth les exactly and throughly mixt, so muche the xxx] nerer it is to corruption: whiche first and chiefly in those bodies that are called that is thinges bred on hy in the firmame~t, moreouer in many other thinges mixed ether by nature or by arte, is easy to be vnderstanded.
But for so muche as in so diuers states of men, sum for one hinderaunce, sum for an other, thei can not alwayes folow that whiche is best, if quint essence can not be made, at the least the second or the third, or as ma+ny as may be: let the destillacions be repeted with a slow fire.
for any mixture is done better by litle x] and litle, and slowly, then sodenly and violently.
And if a man can not destill together with the aqua vitae, the medicines whose strengthe he desyreth to mixt with it: yet at the least wyse let them be broken and stiept a whyle in it: for it draweth vnto it the vertues of all thinges that are put in it.
There is a booke of Arnoldes de villa noua, or rather of Rogerius, whiche haue written, wher in is declared particularly, to what diseases and sicknesses, what medicines ought to be put to sooke xx] into aqua vitae, for euery part of the body, which he doth attribute to the twelue signes of ye zodiak.
It is well knowen in many ages hitherto, that gentian is the best preseruatiue against certaine moste greuous diseases and poysons: but sum vse to power the pouder of the same with burning wa+ter, as muche more effectual, into the throotes of beastes, whome they knowe or thinke to be hurte with poyson in their meet or drinke, or els by byting or stinging: and if gentian can not be gotten, xxx] the burning water by it selfe.
To the remedy of certain sicknesses of man, specially of the bulke or brest apomeli may be put.

They are wont to sieth the capon very long in water, that al the flesh may fal from the bones, and be destilled together with the liquor, ether by it selfe, or other precious waters put vnto it, and spices, gold, syluer and precious stones.
Sum allow the capon the more the elder he is: nether do they cut his throot, but strangle xx] chooke him: nether do they pluck of his fethers by hoot water, or skalding him, but with their hands (dry) and so when his bowels are taken out and he is cut in small pieces, they destill hym.

TAke a Wether that is all whyte and in good plyt and well lyking: cut his throot, receiue ye bloud and stur it whyle it is fresh and new a good space with a stick of red Iuniper: and euer in the sturring, cast away the clotes that is gathered of xxx] the bloud or lopperd bloud.
Then cast in the shauinges of the same Iuniper the beries of Iuniper that be red lykewyse, to the number of .xxv.
And vnto thies a litle of Agrimony, Rew, Pheu, Scabious, Veronica, commonly so called, Pimpernell, Cicory, Peny royall, of euery one a handful.
If so be it the mesure of the bloud excied thre Sextarts, then put to it .ii. vnces of Triacle, but if it be les, according the portion of the bloud, thou shalt lesson the mesure of Triacle.
They must al be pre+pared redy at hand that they may be put into the x] bloud whyle it is yet warme.
When they are all mixt, draw out a stilled liquor, whiche thou shalt kiep diligently in a glas and set it in the sun .viii. daies: for it wil endure for .xx. yeares, it is knowe~ by experience that this liquor is excellent good against the pestilence, the impostumes of the heed and the sydes or ribes, or against the diseases of ye liuer and lightes, the inflacion of the splene, corrupt bloud, ague, swellinges, tre~bling of the hart, the dropsy, vnnatural heates, il humors, and chief xx] ly aga ynst poysons and the pestilent ague.
The sick that is taken with any of the foresaid diseases shall drinke a spounful, or .iiii. or .v. droppes, and procure hym self to sweete.
THey also are to be called co~posed waters, that xxx] ar destilled of medicines composed, stiept in wyne, burning water or other liquor.
Certain co~positions of spices to restore the strengtes of the hart and the spirites, are mixt with waters of capons, drest by destillations as sayd before: also with burning waters, or rather Quint essence of wyne, against the pestilence and poysons, as we declared before.
But also purging medicines, Electuaria chiefly in the whiche Dacry dium and other vehement thinges hurtfull to the stomack are receiued, mixt with the liquors, specially with burning x] water rectified, or with wyne (perauenture also with milke and wyne, or with milck or whay alone, in hoot natures and diseases, it should dooe well) and sumtimes let stande in infusion or sooking, they are artificiously destilled, that thei may be giuen to drinck to them that are deinty or rich, or exceeding weake, or haue their stomack abhorring against other medicines: whiche Lullius also prayseth greetly, and certain practicioners of any acquaintaunce haue vsed it with prayse.
know xx] a certain man, that destilled chiesly an electuary named Hamech, that whiche is of ye iuice of Roses, and gaue to drinke vnto the weeker sort the li+quor that he receiued by it selfe: to them that were stronger, he myxt sum of the elctuary with it: and so he said he purged sick men without any grief.
With Helleborum is a water made, that restoreth youth: such one sawe my father haue.
But suche waters vex the bodies, and make a fallible image of youth.
OF potable gold, who so list he may read much in the booke of Vlstadius whiche he nameth the heauen of philosophers: in the boke of Lullus of quint essence.
That there is vertue in gold, whiche commeth of it made hot and quenched in water, that maye be an argumente, that the water wherin a wedge of iron or golde is slekt, is commended of Nicander x] against the poyson called Aconitum: for it semeth to be vnderstanded of water, wherein these mettalles shoulde be quenched, when as he nameth none other liquor.
Quench (saith he) red hat iron or the dros of iron, or red hot golde or siluer dip it in a troubled potion or drink.
Where the expositer saith: Quensh iron in water and drink it, and a litle after: quench the dros of iron in hony drinck the intinction, so calling the liquor wherein anye any thing is quenched.
Dioscorides bids to que~ch xx] in wine (as Auicenna also hath, and Aegineta, and also Aetius, who saith that a miln stone so slekt is holsom, and that the wine should be druncke hot) with these wordes: and the dros of iron, or iron it self or gold, or siluer red hot que~ched in wine, if yt liquor be dronk.
And trueli it semeth that wine is more apt to receiue ye vertue of gold, then water.
When as on a time tasted water, wherin golde was often quenched, could perceiue no quality of the sauor or the tast to be altered in it.
Again, it xxx] is credible yt burning water, specially suche as is brought vnto quint esse~ce doth draw more stre~gth of the gold the~ wine: the more if the gold be beaten into most thin plaits, most of all if it be bete~ into pouder.
But the oyl that coms of golde shall pas al these.
As for gold simplely sod, as in ye brothe of capo~s, there is no strength in it all, except a ma~s opinion ca~do any thing, as beleue withal learned men for the most part.
Of the vertues of gold, rede Auicenna in his seco~d boke.
But because ye purest is to be chose~ for medicins, wil x] bring in here Plinies words out of his.
boke a bout thend of the .iiii. chap. of ye purging of gould.
Let gold be rosted broyled with thrise as muche in weight of the clots or lu~ps of salt: and agayne wt .ii. procions of salt one of the stonecalled schiston: so it yeldeth his strength to the things burnt with it in an earthen vessel, it self remaining pure vncorrupted.
coniecture yt Plini in this place did mistake schistu~ the stone, for schistu~ an alu~: for in an other place (the.
cha.) he writeth xx] yt gold is purged with black alu~.
That kind of Alum is most excelle~t of al other, that is called schistum, yea and the reason taken of the vertues, makes more for Alum: for he saith gold is purged wt salt only and put vnto it: but Alum hathe more like effect vnto salte then the stone Schistos, wherunto the old writers ascribe none other vertue, but yt which it hath co~mun wt the Haematit (of which kind it is) that is to stop bloud.
But Alum is taken and vsed in the purging of metals: also xxx] in Aqua Forti (as they call it.)
Notwithstanding Plini may be excused, because the worde stoone is more co~mon and of larger signification with hym for he nameth both quick siluer and manye other metally things, stones, wherfor he might call the Alum Schiston by the name of Schiston.
Albeit he shoulde not haue so done, for the difference of that which is proprely called a stone Schistus.
In the same place of Plini, after the words now rehersed is put: The rest of the ashes (that is to saye, of the salt, with the which being burnt together, ye golde x] is purged: or with .ii. parts of the salt, and one of Schistum) kepte in an earthen pot, and tempred wyth water, annoynted vppon the face, it healeth the disease beginning in the chin called Lichenes, or like foul breakings out: which shalbe conueniently washt away with Beane meale.
It healeth also Fistulaes, and they that be called Hemorods.
If so be it when it is beaten Spuma be put to it, it amendeth corrupt and stinking biles and sores.
Decocted with hony and Melanthio, and annointed xx] vppon the nauell, it lightlye the bellye M. Varro saith it healeth wartes.
Here in the first woordes, the ashes kepte and annoynted no man can doute, but he speketh of ashes: but that which foloweth of decoction and annoynting, seme to be long to the gould it selfe.
But in my indgemente, ought to be red so that those wordes decocted and annoynted be referred vnto the ashes, as bothe the consequency of the text, also the maner of the medicins do requyre.
For salt is vsed of phisicio~s xxx] (Diascordes other) agai~st Lichenes, ringworms itches, against al maner of vucums, red infla~macions, tetters: and broyled or parched with hony, against running cankers. &c.
The men of our country rub children warts with salte and soute.
And alum, as Plini saith, asswageth rotten sores and biles, with fat: the frettinge cankers of biles with vineger or burnt with as much in weight of gals, with .ii. parts of salt (in which maner of pro+portion also it is mixt for to purge gold) the diseases that sprede abrode.
Moreouer by the name of x] Spuma which signifieth fome.
find nothing noted by Hermolans or Gelenius vpon this place.
But as gold is purged wt alum, so is also Misy, as the same Plini witnesseth.
That it may be purged, it is sod with leed: the same.
An other way to pourge the same, Cardanus describeth in his .vi. boke of subtilty.
Take the hony combes of a xx] swarm of yo~g bees, wherwith thou shalt mixt ambra~ grisea~, Sperma ceti.
After destil the~ in a limbek in ye bath: then grind yt mater yt is remaining vpo~ a stone, pour again vpo~ it water destilled, destill it again in ashes: This water dissolueth gold.
If the potable gold be hardned, take of it ye bignes of a pees, put it into an egge hard rosted, ye yelk take~ out: so shal it be resolued: geue xxx] the sick this to drinke: it strengtheneth by it selfe, an author whose name is not exprest.
The chymistes make a lyquor of massy gould, whiche drinke, as they say cheereth the body.
It lyketh wyse men, that to eate meat drest in vessels of gould, or with the decoctio~ wherof plaites of gould were adioyned: and to drinke wyne wherin plaites or mony of golde were quenched oftentimes, procureth vnto the hart good state, hath great force.
In the Quint essence of wyne, gould, siluer, peer x] les, and precious stones, also other metalles may be dissolued, to make potable gould.
But this resolucion of gould belongeth moore to chymistes then to physicions.
Vlstad. the .ix. chapter, and furthermore: where as who so list shall reed more of potable gould.
Wyne wherin plates of gould haue bien quenshed .xl. or .l. times, is vsed of certain in the steede of potable gould.
The same in his boke of wyn: Wyne that hath xx] gould quenshed therin (saith he) hath a great propertie in many condicions: it is made, by quenshing the plaites of gould in good wyne .iiii. or .v. tymes: let it stande to cleere, and when it is dilygently streined let it be kept, for it hath vertue to comfort the hart, and it drieth vp the superfluities of al other dregges from the bloud.
And it is able to lighten the substance of the hart and the spirit with his brigthnes, to comfort it with his massynes: and with the temperatnes therof to temper xxx] and preserue it, to purge the bloud, and with the ponderosity and weight therof to inclyne the superfluities to the partes of expulsion, and to conserue youth.
It conserueth the vertues of the prin+cipall partes in his actions, and by his temperatnes it louseth the vrine restreined.
It heeleth the falling sicknes and them that haue lost their sences, it is holsome also for lepers.
Many at this tyme riche men and princes wil haue certain parcelles of gould to be sodde with their dishes· other vse the~ in Panellis with electuaries, other in pouders: x] for in the confection of Diacameron the fyling hoth of gould and of siluer is vsed.
Sum are wont to hold a piece of gold in their mouth and to swalowe the spetle.
It is plain that siluer kept in a mans mouthe quenshed the thirst: and corrall comforteth the stomack, both holden in the mouth and ha~ged about the neck, so that it hang toward the stomack: for haue tried that it letteth the troubling therof.
Other conuert gould into a wa+ter that may be drunk, which way without doubt xx] is the best and other vse it otherwyse, accordyng to the diuers condicions of men temperame~tes.
Surely gold is a secret thing, most perfect compo+sed of an equall temperature marueylous proporcion of the elementall vertues, whereunto no mixt body may be compared.

Howe waters of herbes, floures, and rotes be destilled by descencion, that is downwarde. xxx] vvaye to destill svviete vvaters, and effectuall, oute of Flowers and Hearbes by descencion or goinge downwarde.
TAke an earthen vessell, vppon the whyche straine or spread a thin and fine linnen cloth and vpon it sprynckle Rooses, (for so the Roosecake wil proue meruelous swiet) or coueslops, or other Floures or Hearbes.
Then muste ye haue x] a lidde to couer the vessell: and aboue the bottom putte the fire.
So shalt thou destill not onlye a mooste swiet water, but also moste effectuall and most strong.
The Rose cake is wont to be laide in the sunne closed, that it maye be purged from the smoky smel, when notwithstandinge it reteineth the smell of the Roose.
Freshe Rooses laide vpon a linnen cloth strained vppon a Basin, if they take a vessell full of hoate coales, they destyll muche water and swiet xx] into the Basin.
In my minde this kinde of destillacion is commodious for all suche thynges as be colde, or oughte to coule, chieflye if they lacke smell, as the most part of binding thinges: more also, such as be cold moist to.
Yea also we shall haue much water in shorter time, with les coste by this waye, nether is there any ieoperdy that they should fume out.
But a man must geue diligente hede least the vessel laide vpon be to lyttle hotte, xxx] and least it be left vpon longer then it shoulde be, least the water taste of burning.
If .ii. vrinals be set together, the vpper full of Roses and set in the sunne (with a linnen clothe betwixte,) a moste swiet water destilleth into the nether.

Take the tender buddes of Fennel before they florish or go abrode, full of iuyce with the leaues.
Put these in a Phiall of glasse, but fyll it not vp: turne it vp side downe and put the mouth of it into xx] an other Phiall vnder it, and close it with dow, that the spirites brethe not oute.
Put the Phials in some hoole in a wall towarde the hotest southe sunne.
So within .vi. houres or there about, thou shalt haue a mooste profitable water to sharppen the sight and for blearednesse, whose goodnesse a frend of mine tryinge vppon him selfe, who also made the water his self, shewed me and made me priuy vnto it.

The bottom of this pot is put into another, put vnder it in a pit of the earth, and the ioyning of the pots is compassed wt clay cloos.
Then make they a fier about the vpper part of the pot by the space of one night (.x. houres or more.
Soo the water runneth in to the nether pot, whiche mixt with meel or breed, it killeth mys quickly that taste of it: the sooner if thou mixt a litle Litharge or whyt Leed.
Bulcasis in his x] second booke, and Syluius out of him.
Sumtimes certain waters and oyles ar made by descencion, lyke as of Roseny tries when they are burnt pitche.
But of Oyles which ar made by descention we wil speeke hereafter.
Certain are made by a middle way between a discention and ascention, as Oyll of Coperos, by a Cucurbita layd along ouerthwart vpon the syde.
Destillation in Asshes, or Sand xx] or Dros of metall beeten. &c.
Waters with a moste gentle soft heet, whiche thou shalt discerne by touching with thy hand both the asshes and also the vessels of destillacion.
And perauenture there is no difference, for the destillacion of any kind of waters, in Balneo Mariae or in Asshes, if so be it thou obserue the measure of ye fyer.
For xxx] in Balneo Mariae, the water that ye stillatory is put in, may be skalding hoot: the ashes may not be to hoot, that is when herbes, rootes, flowers or any liquors ar destilled to deriue a water of the~.
Men thinke them to be made so muche the swieter les smelling of any fyrines and brenning, being destilled in suche ashes because the thinge is doone more softly and with more leysur, so that the heed or lid be not hoot, and sumtymes betwene the falling of the drops, a ma~ may tel swiftly til he cum at fifty.
But the Oyles haue nied of a gretter fire x] and a more vehement heet (that is) a dryer: therefore although it may bee rightly doone in ashes, whatsoeuer is done in water, yet not co~trary. for oyles may be made in ashes, but none in siething water.
But this thing shalbe more euident herafter where we shall teache of Quintessence.
The destillacion by asshes is easy and redy, if an earthen or brasen vessell, diep inough, and able to receiue the Cucurbita or body of the still, be filled with fyne asshes and sifted or fyned sand, so ful xx] that the matter to be destilled which is in the vessell, may be cleen within the ashes and no part of it aboue.
This vessell full of ashes shalt thou set vpon fiue or six iron barres, which ar laid ouerthwart from one syde to an other: that is to saye .iii. sydes of the furnace being layd, they shall occupye two of them: the further syde it shall not nied, if it be done against a wall.
The foor part of this .iiii. cornerd bielding shalbe lefte open, that the fyer may be made and put vnder therat.
The length xxx] of euery syde is sufficient to be one foote long, the heigth six fingars or there aboute.
All thies shall we strengthen euery where with clay (and pieces of shelles mixt together) that the heet may the bet+ter be kept in .ii. breething hooles left in the corners.
But this maner is for vpon a soden and on+ly miet for one vessel.
In a corner of the house raised a foundacion of brick and lyme, a foote and a halfhy.
Vpon the foundacio~ or harth, x] a round fornace, with one narowe door, long and brode lyke a lytle brick (so that a hand may be put in) which is set vp when lyst to shit the fornace.
There were .iii. ventes or breethyng hooles, the height of the fornace was about .x. inches.
Aboue this fornace ther was an iron plait laid of ye same compas, of .ii. foote or more broode through the midst, about this was an edge raysed of vnburnt brick (for vnto the fornace tooke burnt brick) in a compas wyse, the heigth of two hand breed.
xx] This round place aboue the plait was filled wt asshes, in ye ashes round about was ther set about fyue stilles of glas, that at one tyme and with one fyre many waters or Oyles might be destilled together.
Rounde about the fornace was well fensed with wrought claye with verye salte water, wherewith sum Hors dounge was myxt.
This kynd of fornace is surely very co~modious, bycause it niedeth litle fier, whiche also it selfe in this forme endureth very long: that it is almoste xxx] inough to see to the fyer morning and euening.
But it must bee made only of cooles, whiche are put in to the fornace with a litle fyer shouell, only that they may be goten in at the litle dore hansum+ly: the edges of this fier shouel must be a litle turned vp, that it may holde the cooles ye better.
Ther is nied also of long iron fyershouel (as the fornace shal require) turned in at the end according to a streigth corner, and ther in the end to be sumwhat made broder, wherwith the cooles within may be x] moued and laid as a man will haue them, and put down fro~ the other fier shouel.
In this kynd of fornaces, and how soeuer they be in asshes, bothe other kindes of waters and oyles, as sayd, are rightly prepared: and chiefly such dry thinges as are infused in wyne, sumtymes stieped, the vessell being very well shyt that they may render the very same sauour and tast, as wormwood, lyke as shewed before, Gentian, Iuniper beries, and xx] spyces, the waters destilled whereof our cuntreymen name goulden. &c.
Then the destillacion of Aqua vitae is sumtimes repeted, in whiche haue obserued this, that the better parte alwayes the purest issueth out first, what so euer is flegmatyck (or deed water, as sum cal it, which is vnproffitable, hurtfull, and almoste stinking) foloweth last: whiche is well perceiued and knowen in a glas heed for the still: For whyle the purer matter, that is, the fyry and aery substance issueth, no xxx] sygn apereth in the heed of the still: but when the fleume comes once, and tokens of the water folowing by straikes appeare manifestly, as ye see them, remoue the receiuing vessel, and what so euer remaineth in the Cucurbita or bely of the stil, poure it out as good for nothing: and begin a new destillation of fresh and that must be repeted, vntil no fleume appeare any more, which chaunseth lightly in the fourth or fifthe destillation.
Afterwarde there nedeth no more destillation, but circulacion, that the liquor be rectified, as they terme x] it, and turned into heauen or quint essence.
Thinges destilled in the vapour of hot water, retein more perfitly the vertues and qualities of of plantes, but because they haue some coruption in them, they can not be kept long.
Those thinges longar which by the heat of ashes or dros of metall beaten to pouder are destilled in vessels of stone or glas, how many so euer they be, vppon a long or round fornace couered with slates or tiles which may holde the hie sandes compassed wyth xx] hie lead.
But these vessels muste be made hot by little and little not sodenly, and couled likewise be fore they be opened to the colde aire, or els they breake straight way.
Vlstadius prescribeth a certaine destillation in ashes wyth so softe a fyre, that thou maiste number one .ii. iii. betwene one drop and an other.
Anye kynde of frute thou wilte, when it is well ripe cut small and beaten, thou shalt destill it in sand with a slow fire.
Vlstadius. xxx] certaine waye to make water by and by.
WAter is made also vppn a sodein, whiles the iuice is made hot or skalding, a glasen cup is set vpon it, in the whiche the fume passeth into droppes: and the droppes gathered therupon are driuen together into water.
Thys is holsome for spottes and blemishes in the eies, and for the web, to put them awaye: speciallye if Rue be sod in white Vinegar.
Cardanus. x] Som are put resinam larigenam in a trene vessell, whose bottome must be made by a tornar as thin as is possible, so that a man may see through it, so in a hotte place the purer parte and the thinner destilleth.
Of rosaries, that is to say instruments wherwith a destilled liquor maye be gotten oute of Roses and other medicines, fyre being put vnder (for the mooste parte wythoute anye xx] meane betwixte) either of cooles, or of chippes.
FIre in destillacion dothe more procure the sauoure of adustion and brentnesse vnto the water that is to bee destilled, then do cooles or water, whiche thinge to auoide put sande in the pan in commun Rosaries: or rather see that sande be betwixte the fyre and the panne, and also aboute the pan, and that xxx] it be glased (or oyled as some call it) if it be an earthen panne: for it is made also of brasse.
The ioyning together of the pan and the lembecke thou shalt fense with clay, that is to saye with a lynnen clout perieted or closed with clay and hansumlye laid aboute it: and the receiuinge vessell with the nose of the lembecke likewise.
Some nowe a daies make theese Rosarie pans of bras, and vpon the sand they lay the hearbes that be to be destilled: and round about the pan (and within it also except be deceiued) they fill a voide space x] with water, a pipe being made for the purpose to poure them in at.
They fire vnder it ether of coles or of very short chips, because the flame of ye fire may seme to be able to do les hurt, for the water that compasseth.
But withoute all doute, all these shalbe much better destilled in glasses, or in Balneo Mariae, or in ashes.
Vineger is made white wyth destillation, as well for other vses of Chymistes and Phisycions, as also to be mixte wyth Sirrupe of Vinnegar, xx] whereuppon wyll reherse Bulcasis wordes.
Builde an Atanor like vnto that wherein Roosewater is destylled, and euer take a stillatorye vessell of glasse or of earthe glased: fyll three partes of it wyth good Vinegar, that the fourthe parte of the Vessell aboue maye be emptye, leaste when it doothe seethe the Vineger bee spilte and runne ouer.
Then couer the vessel with some Vessell vppon it, as ye knowe, hauynge a noose, as the manner is in rosewater, and make a xxx] light fire, not greate nor stronge: for if it be vehement, the Vinegar shal not become so white.
The vineger that is destilled muste be of white wyne, and verye sharpe.
So shalt thou gather a whyte and pure liquor, which thou shalt keepe in store.
destilled it once in glasen vessels in ashes, which kepe yet hitherto certaine yeares, like to Vinegar not destilled bothe in sauoure and taste, differing only in the coloure and substaunce, where in it is like to pure water to see x] to.
Bulcasis seemeth to be of this opinion, that vineger shoulde be destilled with fire or water, not in a Balneo Mariae, but in that maner that he maketh the first and second in destillinge of Rooses, that is, without water with fyre of woode or rather of cooles.
Pearles, eg shels, stone of the rains and bladder are dissolued with strong vineger, specially whe~ it is destilled or with the iuice of limo~s: so is also both kinde of corals, and they afterward xx] dried, are readily crumled: praecipitatum and sublimatum and cinabrium, and they retourne into quick siluer.
The Chymistes say metals are resolued with vinegar destilled: also wt mans vrine destilled.
The leaues of hempe tourned into meale, because they pearse the heade, make drincke which wyll make a man pleasauntlye drounke.
It seemeth water shoulde be poured to it, and when they are made dowe together, then to bee xxx] destilled: like as burninge water in a Rosarye or Rosestil, or lyke instrument where the fyer is put vnder without any men, and perauentur the destillacion should be twys or thrys repeted.
wold say the same of Ootes water, whereof lykewyse Cardanus wryteth: The Moscouites (saith he) bycause they lack wyn, vse water destilled of Ootes whiche enflameth and maketh a man drunken no les then wyne.
For Ootes being of a more gros substa~ce, it must niedes when it is destilled make hoot, becum more subtill and sharp, and draweny x] to the nature of burning water.
The lyke may be done of any drinck that maketh drunken, as Ale, Bier, Curmus and Meed, specially when it is old, and that whiche is sodde with Mill.
Hony whyle it is a destilling is wont to ryse vp and run ouer, when it is made hoot.
But this is auoyded, when a man destilleth in a co~mun Rosestill, by putting vpon it within the pan a wooden siue (made with hors hear) so that it touch the hony. xx] If ye wil destil in a Cucurbita or body of glas, mixt with it pure and well wasshed sand, make a slow fyre.
The first water is cast away, but the second is kept whiche hath a goulden colour, and a litle before the end reed.
The vse of this water is for wemen to their hear, that they may growe, be soft and yelow being moystened therwith specially in the sun.
It heeleth swelled and blered eyes, and putteth away their watery cootes and their duskishnes: xxx] it heeleth the corners of the eyes that be hurt and ful of wheales.
It heeleth notably the places that be burned, specially them that be soft and ten der, so that no skar or blemysh shall remain.
The latter water that is redish, purgeth corrupt mattier in roten byles, if thei be washed therwith, and lynnen clothes moystened therein be layde vpon them, and whe~ it hath purged them, it rayseth the fleshe also.
Of oyles of Plantes, Flowers, Herbes, Gums, Rolines, Siedes, Barkes, Woodes.
OYles whiche are made in Chymisticall vessels ether by descencion or by ascencion, sum be simple, sum compound: of thies sum are composed of many, as cer+tain xx] balmes, whiche they call artificiall: sum of few.
There be sum that may seme to be in a meen betwene simple and compound, as they where to sum medicine beeten, sum liquor is added, wherewith it is sooked and destilled togetherr, that it may ascend being caryed by it, afterward it is separated.
Also certain are made of pla~tes or their parts, Flowers, Routes, Siedes, Barkes, Rosines, Gums, Drops.
Sum of beestes, or of sum partes xxx] of them or of their excrementes.
Other of metally thinges or suche lyke as Antimonium, Leed, Am ber.
We will speeke of euery of them by thies thre latter places.
Of other kyndes of oyles which are made by any other maner, as by expression, infusion.
Lyke as oyl Benedict is destilled by sublimacio~ of hoot burning tyl stones quenshed in oyll, euen so of Ladanu~, wax, liquors, gums, rosins, boones, marowes, and other abou~ding with fat humors may oyl be goten by sublimating.
Syluius. x] An oyly nature semeth to be in al mixt thinges or co~pounded by nature whatsoeuer they be, wha~ as it is in salt also the most dry body that may be, as Cardanus wryteth.
(Ther is also in salt a fatnes, which we may maruaill at, Plin.) but in sum more, in sum les.
For it is an oyly and fat humor that is in mixt thinges, not that watery and to be dryed, but an aery which also is hoot.
Boeth kynde of elementes haue the moysture in the~ that belongeth to their kynd.
This liquor in certaine xx] thinges nature it selfe separateth, not in plantes only by iuices or liquors, the Griekes call them opús: teeres, gumes, rosins, Elaeomel: but also in deed bodies, as in fat metally thinges, brimston, quick siluer, also in diuers kyndes of pitch, Naphtha, aumber, ambra, whiche hath his name because it floweth runnethout of stones.
But most manifestly in beests, both by other partes of the~, also chiely ye fat marow, blud in the~ yt haue no blud, sum fat humor of ye natur of blud. xxx] The same is not laking vnto the excrementes, of the bely, the bladdar, sweet, hony, egges, &c. in the massy partes bothe of beestes and plantes, in all suche chiefly siemeth it to bee whiche haue thriedes or vaines manifestly, by the whiche they drawe nourisheme~t.
For vnto nourishment swiet thinges are moste of all ordeined, which by a moderat heet are tourned easely into a fatnes, yee very fat thinges them selfe are sumwhat swiet.
And the aboundaunce of fat iuice is tried found moste in those thinges which are nourished with many swiet thinges.
Notwithsta~ding fat things x] of them selues nourishe not, because they swyme aboue, nether can they be brought into an vnitie of a lump or humor in the stomack.
Nowe that iuice whiche is sumwhat fat, conteineth so muche the more oyle, as it is in the more massy or dry nature, as that which is more pure and les watery.
Thinner and lyghter woodes conuert and turne the fat iuice in to Gum or Rosyn, wherfor they haue les plenty thereof: suche as be xx] more massy and thicker heuier reteine the same, as Gnaiacum, the walnut trie, the Ash.
Moreouer the very ashes shew that Oyll is in all woodes: for the ashes of euery one haue their fatnes, whiche it leeueth in lie.
So durable is the aery fatnes and yet more the fyery, as when erth is burned, the water goeth out in vapours, the other remain, part in the ashes, parte in the Sout: although in both those also sum substau~ce of erth remaineth.
But thies thinges perteine to Philosophers. xxx] Hovv oile must be dravvn oute of spices, as Cloues, Nutmegs, Saffron, Mace, and other.
MOysting mesurably in Aqua vitae rectified circulated, any kind of spice what ye will beaten and broken somewhat grose, and when they are stiept together, at the last destil them wyth a very slowe fyre.
And when as the Aqua vitae once drawne out cleane, the oyle beginneth to still, the~ x] take the matter of ye spicesout of the cucutbita and put it in a little bag wel knit and tied wt a thred: in a pres for ye purpose pres it out, both ye iron plates of the pres wel made hot first.
The oyle pressed out so must ye destil, rectify and circulate: that the pure oyle maye be separated from the grosser matter.
The dregs afterward may be digested or putrified again with the Aqua vitae firste seperated from them (and be destilled again.)
And thys waisemeth to be the most commodious and most xx] profitable among other, Ryffius: but we haue tra~slated it as well as we mighte, somewhat darker then it shoulde be.
Hovve oile is dravvne out of vvodes and other like, as Cloues by destillacion oute of Cardan.
THe thinges beaten are put in a vessel of glasse A. are destilled wyth as easy a fire as maye xxx] be: and if it maye be, to get oute the oyle, with hot water put rounde aboute the Vessell, it shall be muche the better.
B, is set vpon the top of the vessell, and is cloosed with claye least it brethe oute, whereunto a pipe.
C. is adioyned as the fashion is: to yt an other pipe of glas x] D. is ioyned, so compassed with claye that nothinge can breethe oute.
E. whyche ye must haue alwais ful of very cold water, drawinge oute by the spigotte so much water as hath gotten any heat and putting in other water again late and newe drawne xx] oute of the well: for so.
D. is made coule, and the fumes are not brente, but passe into water or into oyle, and beinge tourned by that crooked parte of the pipe whiche stretcheth beyonde the vessell with water, fall droppinge into the vessell.
Therefore as did once see it, at the first a troubled matter runneth oute, caryinge foorthe the more subtill substaunce of the thinge: after that a more cleare water commeth oute, at the last oyle, whiche declareth the sauoure rather of a thynge xxx] burnt, then of that thinge wheroute it ranne.
In this manner the destillacion of waters also (of herbes and floures) maye be done: but that waye is far better which is by descencion downwarde &c.
F. and other precious smellinge thinges, and the water that rettineth the smelles not onlye of the owne proper matter, but also of the Musk and of other things that be put to it.
Chapter teacheth of this waye of destillinge vniuersallye: and speciallye or seuerallye of oyles of Iuniper stickes, of the yelkes of Egges, Nutmegges, and Benedicto: where throughe wyll go aboute to declare the matter moore clearelye and more shortlye.
He teacheth to make a fornace meete for this destillacion, lyke to suche a Chunney as is vsed to be made amongste the Germaines, of brickes vnbrente of a Cubit and a halfhie, on euerye xx] syde, saue the former side (whiche maye be somewhat lower, and couered with thinne tiles, to lay any thing vpon, as the iron instrumentes wherewith the fire is gouerned) in bredthe .iii. cubites euerye waye.
In the middle of thys fornaice let there be a hoole so great that a mans fote may be put in at it.
This fornace shall be meete also for an other vse, that is to seale wyth the seale of Hermes, as they call it: when the mouthe of a Glasen Cucurbita xxx] beynge put into the hoole of the fornace, the length a hande bredth, that is .iiii. fingers, and if any more about it be open, that being stopt wyth claye, assone as it is red hotte, it is nipte together with a paire of tonges likewise red hotte.
When thou wylte destyll therefore in this fornace, take a Cucurbita of the best earthe: or if not, of Coper or Latin: syll it vnto the thyrde parte wyth the matter that is to be destilled, and shitte it wyth a verye thinne iron lidde of iron plate full of lyttle x] hooles.
Then tourne it vpside downe and putte the mouthe of the Vessell into the hoole of the fornace three fingers deepe, and what so euer is open on anye side, fyll it with claye diligentlye rounde aboute, so that nothynge maye fall into thys hoole.
Beneathe in the neather parte of the hoole thou shalt sette vnder a Cucurbita of glasse (for the puttinge in and takinge oute whereof, and that thou mayste see when the hoole matter is destilled, the foore parte of the fornace muste xx] be open:) whereunto the mouth of the vpper Cucurbita must be ioyned, (but not with clay.)
Then let a fyre be made aboue aboute the vessel that co~teineth the matter on euerye syde.
But the fyre at the fyrste muste be little, and as farre of from the vessell as is possible: afterwarde by little and little to make it bigger and nearer the vessell.
Ye muste vnderstande that of euerye matter, at the fyrste water destilleth, moore or lesse accordynge to the difference of the matter.
xxx] When it hath left running, and now the oyll hath begun to destill, thou shalt empty the Cucurbita of glas that standeth vnderneth, and set it vnder aagain: and continue in encreesing the fyer, and to make it euer nerer and nerer the vessell, vntill no more oyl destille.
For then by and by the fyer must bee remoued far of that the vpper Cucurbita may be couled.
Then take away the nether that is the receiuer, and kepe the oyll.
But as said, a lytle fyer is required at the first, and is to be encreesed x] by litle and litle vntill the fourthe degree, for two causes.
First lest by the sodein exces of to muche heet all the moysture, yea the oyly moysture also be consumed, which chiefly must be taken hied of, when we couet to haue oyll of the yolkes of egges and nutmegs: for in certain other, as of Iuniper stickes, a man shal offende nothing to make a sodein and great fyer.
Then bycause the woode set on fier, perauenture would hurte the Cucurbita, burn it, breeke it, or infect the oyll with sum vnplesaunt xx] sauour.
Moreouer in simple oyll Benedict, thou shalt encrease the fyer only at the end of the destillacion: and thou maist prepare suche a place for the destillacion: Dig a pit in the earth, long, brood and diep, accordining to the measure of the pot that is to be put into it.
Let the pot bee glased, washt with water, and vpon the mouth of it let a thin iron plate be put, bored through with many holes, so that the plate be a fingar thicknes within the brim of the pot: vpon this set an other xxx] pot that conteineth the matter to be destilled, so yt the mouthes of them be ioyned together, and all well clayed, then let a fyer be made about the vpper pot, whiche shalbe hool without the pit saue ye mouth.
But this second way is not so co~modious as the first: because the water can not bee separated from the oyl: nor easely knowe~ whan the hooll matter is destilled, except it be knowen by vse and custome.
The fornace may also be made in a stiep hill: as the same Vlstadius sheweth: let that pas that be not to long.
x] Oyl of the leeues of Citrum, or Orenge, Arantia, or Limons when it is destilled, first the water is gotten out (then the oyll) and both ought to bee kept seuerally: the oyll is very swiet and good.
Take the leeues of any of the forsayd tries which so euer ye will, when they are cut beet them in a morter, and as ye destill them receiue the water: and when ye see any drop of diuers colour swym vpon the water, the receyuer being chaunged, encrees the fyer and gather xx] the oyll.
It shall smell a litle of the fyer, whiche fault shalbe amended, if ye let it stande long set in the sun.
Sum drye the forsayde leeues between twoo lynnen clothes and beete them: they put to also many odoriferous swiet smellyng thinges, as ziuet, Muske, Ambra, hoot Styrax, Ladanum, Cinamon, Benzoum: not the substaunce of them, but the fume or smoke only: for they put thies into Rose water vpon the fyer, and with the vapour of them they season the leues.
When thies are so diligently xxx] seasoned, they take Roosewater wherein certain spices ar stiept, as Cloues, Galangal, Put megges. &c. for the space of one day, and the pouder of the leues moistened therwith, they destill it it ashes with a slow fyer, till the watery liquor be separated: then they encrees the fyer and receiue the oyll, whiche is of a wonderfull pleasaunt and swiet sauour.
certain practicioner shewed me, that the oyll is separated co~modiously from herbes routes in this maner.
Put the herbes or routes in Turpentyn x] or Larigna, rosin washt (eigth or nyne tymes) till it wax whyte, and let it stande in hoote sand q. s.
Then destill them with a slow fyre, the Turpintyn shal run out first· by and by at the beginning: or if it moue but a litle, being shaken together it shal then run out hoolly, first in a colour whyte as milke, afterward yelowe.
Thou shalt perceiue by the tast whan the liquor that thou desirest beginneth to runne out: when the colour is chaunged, thou shal chau~ge also the receiuer, that xx] thou maist receiue it seuerally, for the last liquor is not so good, and is to be vsed without the body, but the first within the body.
Thies saith he, my selfe as thinke, sawe once oyll of the beries of Iuniper prepared in this wyse.
Suche destilled oyles as be to be ministred wt in the body, al must be mixt with sum liquor, wyn Meed, or Syrup with sum destilled water, or other medicine: As wee shall declare also hereafter emong the balsameles.
That vnto Oyles oyles as vnto spirites or soules, sum body ought to be added.
OYll of Saffron is prepared thus: Thy matter is digested by sprinckling Aqua vitae vpon it, and when the Aqua vitae is drawen out by destillacion, the other liquor is wrong out with a pres, as it is wryten x] afore of the generall destillacion of spyces, out of Ryffius.
Oyl of Spick, out of the Frenche booke of Furnerius.
Set the herb (the flowers rather) of Spik or Lauendar a whyle in the sun, then drawe out the water in a le~beck.
This set in the sun in summer in a very hoote place bringeth forth an oyl in the superficiall or vpper part of it, whiche beyng separated now and then fro~ the water, thou shalt reserue.
For it both smelleth moste swietly, and is xx] holsum against diuers diseases, specially such as be could: and taketh away painfull grieues.
Thou shalt stiep in a glas the flowers of Spick well rypened in as much as thou thinkest good of Oyll of swiet Almondes, in hors dong .xl. daies.
Then destill them with a slowe fyer: at last rectify them in the sun, the vessel diligently stopt.
But if there be any smell of adustion or brentnes, make .ii. or .iii. litle hooles in the couer.
So shall it remayne purged xxx] in the sun, good and odoriferous.
Fyll a glasse with the floures of Spike well ripened, shit it, and euery day put as much to it as ye can.
Do this continually for the space of .viii. dayes: then stop the vessell and putrifye it in hors donge iii. monthes.
At the length destill it a lembek with great diligence, and when the oyl is drawne oute set it in the sunne, so that thou seperat alway that is clearer and reserue it Some as soone as the matter is drawne forth from the fire (so is it in x] the frenshe boke, but thincke it shoulde be from the dong, that is the hors dong wherin it is stiept iii. monethes) set it in the Sunne, and the oyle that swimmeth aboue they remoue it awaye euerye foote.
But when the flowers haue lefte nowe yelding of oyl, wring it as hard as ye can, and the iuyce that is prest out, let it stand in the sunne in a vessel set on the one side lening that the oyl swimming aboue maye the more easilye be separated.
So shall ye haue a wonderfull well smelling oyl xx] withoute all discommoditie of adustion or brentnes: Thus far Furnerius.
The same oyle Ryffius saithe is made, as oyle of Roosemary, the floures being cut and stiept in olde wine, then destilled, so that the spirites of the lembecke be couled. &c. Reade before in the oyl of Roosemary.
Some sell this oyle of Spike commonlye and name it Balme, with tables wherin the vertues of it are described.
knewe a woman whiche receiued into her xxx] body not past a drop or. ii, yet it put her in great ieopardy: but therewith she auoyded manye wormes.
It is mixte with many thinges, chieflye for the smelles sake.
One droppe of it chafed wyth a greate quantitye of water, maketh it all swiete smellinge.
Phisicians also mixte it with Oyles and hotte oyntmentes, bothe because of the sauoure, that it maye encrease the pleasauntnesse of thinges that be somwhat swiet of them selues, and to conserue them, or els to hide and cloke an euill smell: for it ouercometh all smels, and perauenture x] a man shall not find anye liquor bothe so strong and so swiet smellinge.
It semeth that far swieter is made of Spike then of Lauender.
Take a Phiall full of the floures of Roosemary: burye it in sande (shitte with a double cerecloth, or with waxe and a couer so that it maye brethe, Atnold: wyth a double linnen, and then also wyth waxe to be closed, Hollerius:) til the middle of the vessell: and let it stande so a month or more, vntil xx] the floures be turned into water.
This water separated and set in the Sunne .x. or .xx. daies (otherwise .xl.) it will become thicke like Oyle.
It strengtheneth the harte, the braine, the sinnewes and the hoole bodye.
It putteth away the ragges of the eies and spottes of the face: it conserueth youthe.
drop of it put into balme water, goeth to the bottome like Balme.
It is good for webs and teares, (otherwise spots and other diseases) of the eien if one drop be put into the eyen, twyse xxx] or thrise at the moost.
Members sick of the palsy it heateth them for the mooste parte, and healeth them sometimes.
Fistulaes and Cancars that geue not place to other medicines, it healeth them throughlye.
Aqua vitae destilled of wine, wherin Rosemary is decocted and sod, dothe the same thinges.
would not sethe the Roosemary: for the strength of the wine and quintessence dothe fume oute in vapours: but wolde stepe them in a vessell closed, or putrifie them: then firste in Balneo Mariae, afterwarde in x] ashes pouring the water again vnto the dregges woulde destill them.
And of my minde is Ar+nold de villa noua, whiche in his booke of wine, (where he wryteth of the oyle also of Rosemarye the verye same thinges, whiche we rehersed now out of Lullius, if so be they be Lullius words.)
Of tentimes (saith he) haue tried that Aqua vitae, made of wine wherin Rosmary hath bene mollified, cureth salsfleum, scabs, cankar, and the fistula, whiche cannot be healed otherwise.
But thys xx] oyl of Rosmary is made none otherwise then the oyl of the floures of Verbascum not by destillatio~.
Oyl of Rosemarye shoulde be made of floures cropt of with the toppes of the tender buddes or bowes wherin they are sprung, pund and stiepte or putrified in veri good old wine.
They ought to be destilled with a slow fire, so the spirits of the lembek be now and the~ couled, afterwarde to be circulated, till yt all the gros matter be separated from the subtill as muche as is possible: Gualterus xxx] Ryffius.
It may be destilled, as coniecture, ether in a Cucurbita, speciallye somewhat shorte, with a limbeck: or in a croked still with a receiuer of a diuers figure and fashion, or rather in two croked stils, wherof the one maye be the receiuer, or els in brasen vessels whiche the Apothecaries call bladdars as water of Cinnamon, or burninge water.
In like manner be oyles destilled, as the same man teacheth of Vernix or Gum of Iuniper: of the floures of Spike or Lauender, of Anes sedes and many other sedes. x] The .iiii. essence or fyre, of Selandin, whyche is like a liquor of oyle. &c. how it is prepared and to what vse, read before, wher we haue entreated of quint essence.
It is possible also to draw out .ii. maner of oyles, an aiery and afyerye oute of the moste herbes and other medicines, after the same maner it is prescribed there in Selandine.
Cardanus in his second booke of subtiltie, wryteth that there be certaine poysones which slee with the only touching.
Againste these xx] (saith he) the remeady is, not to tary in anye place vntil the hand wax hot: often washing of thepartes with warme water: also the annoynting with oyle of Rue, not with the commun oyl, but that is made after the same maner that oyl of Spik and oyl of Cloues is wont to be made of them yt make painting colours.
Of oyl of the of Rue, shortlye hereafter we shall wryte out of Lullius: but that wherof Cardanus maketh xxx] mencion heare, suppose it is to bee made of Rew it self, that is of the extreme toppes of the bowes therof whiche florishe.
Of oils of siedes and fruites, OYll of Cloues did tast once in Italy wonderfull swiet and stronge: howe it should be drawen oute, we declared afore with Catdanus wordes, where we write generally of drawing out of oyles: also ano+ther x] way out of Ryffius (that is) the same waye yt ye may out of what spyce a man will, which stiept in burning water, they destill the~ till the burning water be separated, and as sone as the oyl beginneth to run, the matter taken out of the Cucurbita is prest. &c. as before it is written out of Ryffius, who describeth also particularly the vertues of this Oyll.
Oyl of Nutmegges how it may be gotten out, fee before where as we entreated generall of the xx] destillacion of Oyles by descention or dounward.
Oyl of Nutmegges and of his huske mace, is dra+wen out after the same maner as out of Cloues: Ryffius, who describeth the vertues of ether of them seuerally.
Oyll of Anis sied is drawe~ out (as out of other dry thinges whiche be in the kynd of plantes) the siedes well beeten stieped in the best wyne, then destilled by litle and litle by ascencion, so that the spirites in the Lembeck bee continually refrigerated xxx] and couled, &c. and the liquor afterward cir+culated.
The vertues of it Ryffius rekoneth, we leue them out as also of other for the most parte, where no peculiar effect or working is attributed to the waters and oyles, yea the same ar agrea+ble to this medicines also wherout they be drawen, or euer they be destilled, sauing that by destilling they are made more subtill and more effectuall or stronger operacion.
Oyles of the beries of Iuniper and of the beries of Bayes, are made one waye: that is pund, x] stiep in wyne or rain water, they are destilled the same way that burning water is, ether in a brasen bladder as the Apothecaries name it, or in suche wyse as we described oyll out of Cardan, to be goten out of woodes and cloues: or els as out of spyces, by Ryffius description.
thinke it makes no great matter, so be that the spirites which be caried about the lembeck, may be couled commodiously in it and in the noos.
The vertues of thies oyles Ryffius rekoneth xx] vp. Agyrtae or iugleres also ar wont with vs to sel oyl of Iunipers, with tables imprinted co~teining the rehersal of the vertues therof.
This emongst other heeleth them that be sick of a tercian as am infourmed.
Sum make oyll of wheet pressing it oute betwene two iron plates reed hoot: other thinke it to be nothing worth thatis made thus, and that it should be made as oyll of Iuniper, that is of the stickes of Iuniper by descencion or dounwarde. xxx] Mesue saith that wheet after it be husked is destilled in a vessell of sublimacio~, as the Philosophers oyll.
It cureth ring wormes, and ruggednes of the skin whiche springeth of drynes, it mollifieth and moysteneth, and other infections, also of the skin it remedieth them.
There might be made also of Barly and suche both by sublimacion, and also by descencion.
Oyles of Muske ben, (that is Balanus my repsica,) x] whiche Fnrnerius calleth Retraban or retraha, of moste precious smel.
Lyke as of Almondes, so shalt thou presse out an oyll of the fruites of Ben (which ar found about Genua ple~teously inough, of the same pryce almost that Almondes be) thou shalt let it stand, and put a good qua~titie of musk into it, and so in a glas well stopt, thou shalt set it in a ketle that it may seeth a whyle, then receiue the oyll by destillacion, whiche shalbe moste swiet and moste odoriferous. xx] Certain oyls of siedes vvhiche founde in a booke of Waters of Raimund Lullius.
THis oyles thought good to wryte seuerally, because doubt whether the author woulde haue them made by destillacio~ or simpely by pressing out: in euery one he addeth thies wordes and let an oyll be drawen out after the maner of the xxx] lay people.
With whiche woordes he seemeth to signify, simpely by the pressing out of the siedes in a pres, as the commun people is wont to doo, so is oyll to be gathered, specially when as he would haue it drawen out of the same dryed in the sun.
Notwithstanding it is out of all doubt, that the same thinges destilled accordingly, should bee far moore effectuall: But for destilling, the liquor wherin the siedes pund or stiept ougth to be left with them and putrification to go before.
&c. Stiep the siedes of Sponsa solis in womans x] milke forty daies and then make an oyll after the vse (maner) of the lay people.
Oyll of the siedes of Rew. Mixt the siedes of Rew pund with leued gould, and put it in vynegar a day.
Then dry it lyghtly by the sun drawe out an oyll after the maner of the lay men.
It is precious and resisteth poysons, so that they shall auoyde by vomit, if so be it a man drinke of it the second tyme, the other humors also that be infected xx] therwith shalbe ayded out: if the third tyme he shalbe cured percy, within .iii. or .iiii. daies.
All grieues of the it heeleth the~ what cause so euer it cum of, so be that the apple of the eye be vnhurt: if the eyes twyse a day be washt with this oyll and one drop be poured into the eye: for the eye shalbe made hool within .iii. or .iiii. daies.
If it be drunck fasting, it suffereth no venim to approche vnto a man that day.
If so be also a man wounded very sore and deadly, drinke therof fasting xxx] he shall escape, so be that the other care of wound and cure be had accordingly.
Also beinge druncke fastinge and putteth awaye the Gutta or drop and all scabbednes: and the dropsy sprunge of a colde cause, if it be taken but two dayes.
To conclude it stirreth vp and restoreth all sliepy and benummed members, (taken with the Palsy, being annoynted vpon.)
Ruberta (if it be right written, perauenture of the coloure he so calleth it: woulde rather reade Sperma,) that is oyle of Nasturtium (I would rather x] the seedes of Nasturtium, as in other in the same place, before and after the oyl) moystened in sharp vineger, dry it in the sunne, and drawe out the oyl after the manner of the lay people.
This mixt with Aloes oyle of bayes, cureth all scabbednes and the drop, the places beinge anoynted.
Druncken with Aloes and cooles of an elme, it healeth the Tercian and quartaine, and all breches in the body.
Soden with a ptisan and drunken, it stauncheth the bloudye flux and bindeth xx] the belly.
Sod with bran and drunken it driueth away all droppes.
Put seedes in read wine a fewe dayes, dry them, punne them and make an Oyle after the laye manner.
Thys oyle drunke fastinge, dissolueth, breaketh and expelleth the sand (and anye stone of the bladder, yea if it be finished (gathered to form of a stone) what matter so euer it bee of.
Of oyle of the beries of Iuniper, destilling first by ascencion, then by descencion as learned of my frendes.
TAke a pinte or a quarte full of the Bearies of Iuniper, when they are beaten stiepe them two daies in well springe water: then putte those beries together with the water wherin they wer sooked into a Cucurbita or bladder, as they call it, x] of Cooper, whiche thou shalt fill till there be but ii. or .iii. fingers thicke emptye: then puttynge a measurable fyre vnder, thou shalt destyll it in all poyntes like burninge water, that is by a Pipe whiche maye passe throughe a vessell full of cold water.
It will yeilde plentye of water, so that one receiuer shall not be inoughe.
At lenghte the oyle followeth, whyche muste be to runne into the water, where vppon it will swimme: thou shalt separate it, toureninge the vessell wherein xx] it is wyth a narrowe necke vpside downe, so that the water be lette runne oute, vntill a little be left whyche shall bee separated afterwarde by pouringe the oyle into an other vessell.
sextarye or pinte of bearies, as they call it in Alsatia, aboute iiii. ounces of oyle.
Other to separate the Oyle from the water, put it into a drincking glas that hathe the foote taken awaye ether by commynge with a wyer of iron redde hotte, or els by chaunce so that a little hoole in the bottome be lefte for the xxx] water passeth throughe, and when it comes to the oyle the hoole is stopte, and then the oyle maye be poured out into ye vessel wher it shalbe kept.
So~e destill it in like manner, but they moue the matter oftentimes in the stil, least it be burned.
And they say spices beaten, as Cloues and cinamon mai be rightlye destilled likewise.
Some, as heare saye, destill in a crooked vessell not of glas, but of Copper, tinned in the inside: whiche is put into a long pipe of coper, as they do for burning water.
An other waye of preparing the same by descencion x] downewarde, communicated and shewed vnto me as a secreate thing, by a certain frend who prepared and made it so his selfe.
Gather Iuniper bearies well rypened and drye in harnest or a little befoore Haruest, betwene the two Marye daies as they be appoynted in the Kalendar, in the morninge at eighte or nyne of the clocke, in greate plentye, as manye as will fill a couple of bagges, whiles it is fayre weather.
Then beinge well beaten, thou shalt putte them xx] vppon a heare clothe suche as bakers do vse, and presse them vnder a presse, and leaue them so a daye and a nighte in the presse, that the waterye iuice in the meane season maye droppe oute: whiche thou shalt keepe by it selfe in some vessell, that thou maiste vse it bothe to certain medicins with in the bodye, and also withoute for the pryckinge of partes (with some oyntmente and Aqua vitae,) speciallye the arthritical partes and ioyntes, this iuice is easelye conserued, neither is it corrupted xxx] lightlye, it is also swiete and effectuall or stronge.
Some get out the waterye humor not by a pres, but separate it in a commun fornace, (Balneo Mariae.)
The reast of the matter well dried and beaten, put it in a Cucurbita that is hable to receiue a galon, but thou shalt not fill it vp.
In it (shit with the clay of wisdome least anye thinge brethe oute) shalt thou putrify the matter, about .xxviii. daies in hors donge: or if it be winter (in Germany) nye vnto the fornace, for to putrifye it in hors donge a x] pit must be made .ii. fote depe, and dong and lime to be laide in it by course: and thou shalt sprinckle it with hot water euerye daye or euery other day.
At lengthe when the matter is putrified inough, and appeareth to bee indifferentlye liquide, thou shalt destill it.
The vessell that receiueth it let it be of the same bignesse almooste that the other is, and lette it stande vppon a rounde wreethe of strawe.
Boothe of them oughte to be of glasse and cutte with an iron wyer redde hotte.
Thou shalt xx] ioyne them together wyth a plate betwixte of metal (the best of Siluer) boored throughe with manye little hooles, whiche shall be no bigger then if they were made with a commun niedle.
The circumference vtter compasse of the plate must haue as thoughe it were a skirte or a houp, to com ouer, bothe vpwarde and downewarde, that the vesselles maye be letten into those skyrtes, therefore the fyrste Vessell, that is the vpper wherein the matter is, shalt thou ioyne wyth the Plate, xxx] and make it sure with clay (and the hooll also of the bottom shalt thou fill euery where with clay) then let down that part of the vessell by the hooll in the middle of the fornace so far, that the nether vessel also (that is) the receiuer may be put with in the nether skirt of the plate, fensed with clay.
The clay ought to be tempered with salt water flox: this) sum cal clay of wisdome.
The maner of the fornace is this: In the midst must a floor or chamber be made with a hooll, as said: aboue x] this floor about the Cucurbita is sand layd almost til the third part of the Cucurbita: aboue the sand, cooles burning, more then the third parte of the Cucurbita, nether nedeth it to put away the ashes: the rest of the Cucurbita, the fourth part perauenture, or litle les then the third part must be aboue empty and at libertie.
It so be thou feer that the vpper Cucurbita perauenture shall not be able to abide the force of the fyer, thou shalt pariet it with clay, at the least wyfe in that part that the cooles xx] are layd about: but if the fier bee encresed by litle and litle and not on a sodain, this crufting or parieting shall not niede.
The bottom or floor in the midst of ye fornace shalbe builded of slating tyles, whiche shall rest and be susteined of long barres of iron, there as the round hooll ought to be left, tyles must be and hewed compas: when the fornace is so builded, destill the matter, and first shall run out a watery liquor, wherin as soone as a drop of oyl appereth, thou chaunge the receiuer: xxx] and kepe that first liquor by it selfe.
This oyll certainly drawen out by descretion in a glas, siemeth to me to be les infected with ye faut of adustion or brentnes.
Hitherto although me thinks haue described the matter plain inough as my friend rehersed vnto me, yet wil ad sum figure, that may lay the thinge before the eyes mooste clerely: A. is the Cucurbita [Figure: conteining the beries: B. the cooles: C. the sand: D. ye plate x] full of hooles: E. the floor whereupon the sand lyeth.
F. the Cucurbita, that receiueth: G. the round wreeth of straw wherupon ye receiuer is set.
Oyll of the nuttes kernels of the pyn tree for the polishing put+ting xx] away of wrinkles in womens skinnes, is made by destillacio~ dounward, as oyll of ye wood of Iumper, Syluius.
Of oyls of gums, teeres or liquors, thickened or congeled, and rosines.
Looke before emongst the swiet waters of Furnerius, where wee haue described one which is made with one part of Mirh, and the half part of ye iuice of Roses, moste odoriferous.
Liquors thikned by nature, and gums as they call them, of a hoot and dry temperatur, that they may be prepared vnto destillacion, when they are pund, put them in a vessell wel stopt (wyn also, except be deceiued, may be a litle sprinkled vpon it) and dig it in a could and moyst place so diep as a man is hy, without putting to it any hoot matter, and it must be left a good long space: notwithstanding it should soner be resolued if thou put to x] it sum yolkes of hard rosted egs.
The gums so re+solued, yelded an oyll troubled and pudly, whiche being destilled in a crouked still (as they call it) shalbe made moore cleere and pure.
For al gums, and Caphura also, seing they contein a fat liquor and whyt, that whiche by destillacion is drawen from them, doo easely sauour of the iniury of the fyer faut of brentnes, that although they be destilled in vessels very meen, yet issueth forth a licour full of dregs, gros, brent, of an vnplesaunt xx] smell, the vse wherof doth not plees me, noo not without the body, muche les within the body: the strengthes vertues of them is not alyke.
When the matter is so resolued yu shalt straine it through a wolle~ cloth or a hear cloth, yt what so euer erthynes is in it, may be separated from the sande and dros.
After, yt whiche is streyned, thou shalt leue it again in an indifferent warm place as many daies as thou wilt: last of all destill it.
Thies maner of Oyles are verye subtill and of greate xxx] strength (whan as nature it selfe firste hathe as it were gathered the chief vertues of trees, suche as power forth any gums or teeres.)
Thies for the moste part wryteth Ryffius in his first boke of destillacion.
The same Ryffius in the treatise of the same worke of oyles prescribeth no peculiar waye to drawe out oyl of gums: but sendeth men vnto his first koke.
He describeth seuerally the vertues of oyles of Ammoniacum, Belzoum, Camphora, Clo+ues, Euphorbium, Galbanum, Ladanum, Myrh, Opopanax, Sarcocolla, Sagapenum, Stirax liquid x] Calamita.
In the only oyll of Mastick he willeth the Mastick when it is pund, to be resolued with old wyne (and to be degested) then destilled.
And the gum of Iuniper lykewyse to be resolued and stiept in wyne, because of the drynes of the substaunce therof, and afterward to be destilled.
Thou shalt water a pound of Belzoum or more groos beeten, with burning water: and in a crouked stil with a receiuer set vn+der thou shalt destill it in ashes, with a slow fyer xx] first, and afterwarde with a great fyer.
The watery liquor that runneth out ought to be kept seue+rally.
Thou shalt beete somwhat groos Styrax Calamita that whiche is full of iuice and fat, water it with the best Aqua vitae: then destill it in a crouked still as the oyll before, and kiep the water by it selfe.
This oyll excelleth with a marueilous fragra~t swiet sauour xxx] Oyll of Camphora.
Looke before in the wawater of camphora, amongste the simple waters destilled.
PVt .iiii. pounde of Turpentin Rosin or of larix in a larg croked stil or cucurbita of glas, and destilling it, get out an oyl, so that the cucurbita or croked stil be put in sand, first of al with the water shall an oyl issue x] a thin and clere oyl, secondly of the colour of gold, last a duskish and thick: take euery one of these by them selues and reserue them.
More of oyl of Turpentin, and of the preparinge of it and of the hertues thereof wryteth Ryffius, which for shortnes sake let pas.
This is chiefly tobe taken hede of, that in the destilling, it sieth not, as in hony also: for they rise and swel quickly these liquors when they are made hot: wherfor at the first the fire must be made very light scle~der xx] and encresed by litle and litle, and the lembek, according as the act requireth, must be refrigerated and couled.
Some put vnto it slate tiles groselye beaten or white flints, or sand washt and dried again, or the leues of Iuye, and a litle glas groose beaten, (such certain things are added also in the destilling of hony, that they may let this risinge kepe fro~ ouer.
woldad little peces of slates or flints wet with old oyl or som medicinable thing, as in oyl Benedict yt by the same means xxx] both the might be letted, and the vertue of the oyle incresed.
The descriptio~ folowing maketh with me, which found in a certain wryten boke.
Take pure sande, or little white and cleare flintes and put them ouer the fire in a vessell till they wax red hot, then quench them in turpentin, that they may drink wel, and that sand quenched destil it in a lembeck.
Some commend oyl of turpentin for the grief of the stone.
Also those, oyl of Turpentyn, of a pound of Turpentyn, an ounce of old tile slates, (or as Albucasis saithe, newe tile slates because they may drink the more oyle) and x] Mastik and Styrax, of ether an ounce.
The tyles made red hot are slekt in oyl: when they are que~ched and pund they are mixte with the other in a lembeck of glas.
In a cucurbita half ful of Turpintyn, put a handfull of glasse pund, and .ii. sponges of the qua~tity of .ii. fingers xx] (the number is left out) and put according to the art of Alchymistes, fire about the cucurbita, let the fire be continued .xxiiii. hours: when the first destillacion is finished, destill it again, renuing glas, the cucurbita and the sponges.
To put awai skars, or rather to asswage and mollifie them, oyl of Turpentin doth chiefli profit, except those that remain after warts.
For they that commend this oyl for the putting awaye the markes of wartes, they are deceiued.
Put Tartarum beten in a vessell (a cucurbita of glas parieted wyth claye, or an earthen cucurbita) and when it is put inalembek of glas destil it.
First of all water wil run forth, then oyl, whiche thou shalt receiue by it self encreasing the fire by little and little til it leue running.
The dutch writen boke: Certain practicioners co~mend the spirit or quintessence of Tartarum against inward impostumes kings euil.
Oiles of barkes. x] OYl of Cinnamon is made, as we declared before out of Cardanus, how oyles be drawn out of woodes and like thinges, as Cloues: where is also described the instruments.
Or els as we described out of Ryffius of the drawing out of oyls of all kinds of spices.
Cinnamo~ may be stiept about viii. daies in burninge water .vi. times destilled, and the~ be destilled, as was informed of a fre~d.
Here wil rehearse also the waye to make water (as they call it) of Cinnamon: for in the destillation xx] also hereof oyl foloweth at length, although but litle and because of the discommodity of adustion and bre~tnes, vnprofitable to be vsed within the body: but ye water is most noble most profita+ble, description wherof a certain fre~d of late se~d vnto me, on this wise.
The fornace instrume~ts must be in all poyntes suche as are vsed for burninge water: with a pipe passing through a vessel full of colde water, whyche excepte be deceyued shall be better, if it bee somewhat longe, that is of xxx] the lengthe of .v. Romain fote, what maner a one or rather longer, an other shewed vs he had seene in the destillacion of this water: but peraue~ture it shalbe les nied of such a long one, whe~ no great plenty of water is destilled.)
It maye also be destilled in a Cucurbita of glas parieted with clay, after the manner of Aqua fortis, and perauenture it wold be best that way.
Put a pound of the best Cinamon pund not sifted, in the bottome of a stil warely, least the pouder abrode or cleue to the sides, by and by pour to it a .iii. pintes of freash x] water, the couer laid vpon it a receiuer set vnderneth, make a litle fire of cooles.
The water yt runneth out first is so~what thick like oyl: but ther must be diligent hede taken that assone as it shal chaung the colour, yt the receiuer also be chau~ged.
The seco~d water runs so~what whiter: the~ chau~g it again take an other receiuer, so forth til the dregs issue out.
The water of the fourthe chaunging is most clere, which when it begins to wax yelow, streightway the couer the pipe muste be xx] take~ away because ye busines is now ended al ye vertue of the Cinnamon is drawn out.
This hole matter may be don in .iii. or .iiii. houres, but there must be a cople of me~ about this destillacion: the one to mark the alteration of the liquors, and see that the fire be no bigger then it oughte, and that the liquor run not to faste oute: The other shall see that the Vessell wyth coulde water, where through one part of the pipe passeth, be according as it shoulde be, and that the pipe be not to hotte: xxx] wherefore nowe and then chaunging the water, he shall poure in coulder oute of some Vessell by, and put linne~ clouthes dipt in could water about the pype, and about the couer lykewyse if it be too hoot.
For it skilleth much that thies partes be cou+led that both more plenty of water and also better may run out.
This water of Cinamon haue sene my self and tasted, very plesaunt and swiet in sauour and in taste.
The liquor whiche sawe was sharp, almost of the colour of milck and troubled: wherupon certain sumwhat red drops of oyll did swim, whiche were les swiet then the water, x] and smelled of adustion.
The same almost Cardanus wryteth generally, of liquors of swiet woode~ thinges as Cloues. &c.
This liquor restoreth the strength excellently: the other vertues thereof Ryffius describeth: but euery man may know the~ manifestly by the nature of cinamon it selfe.
In lyke maner is the oyll of the huske of Nutmegges whiche they call Mace, prepared, which also is described by Ryffius.
An oyll maruelous swiet smelling, wherwith xx] gloues and other certain thinges are anoynted out of Furnerius.
Thou shalt take in the moneth of May the .iii. partes of the second barkes of the tree of Almon (so is it red saieth Furnerius in the booke out of whiche he writ it, but doubted whether it ought to be vnderstanded an Elm or a Limon a kynd of Orenges) and the fatter partes of the flowers of the same tree (Les espis de la fleur qui sont grasses,) in lyke weight, dry them in the sunne.
That kind of this tree is thought best that xxx] groweth not in watery places.
To thies shalt ad the third part of the beries of Juniper newe, and destill them dounwarde, with a little fyer at the first, then greater and greater encreasing it till al the Oyll be cumd down into the receiuer, whiche should be of glas and closed with clay.
Afterward thou shalt set it in the Sun, with the mouth of the vessell open a whyle, or shit with a parchement prickt through with a fewe hooles, till the smel of adustion and brentnes brethe out.
Sum to encrees the smell, put to it Belzoum, Spick narde, x] Agallochum, the shauings of Cypres, Styrax, Am+bra,, Mosch and destill all together, repeting also the destillacion the second tyme.
Oyls of wood are all destilled by descencion (as they call it) dounward.
Of the preparing of oyll of the wood of Iuniper, xx] we shewed before out of Vlstadius, where we entreted of destillacion dounward generally.
He that desireth more, specially perteyning to the vertues, let hym serche in the duche bouke of Ryffius, who wryteth that oyll is goten out of Guaiacum also after the same maner vtterly: and also out of the wood of Rosemary.
will ad heer that found in a certain dutche booke.
The wood of Iuniper to make oyll therof ought to be cut in ye beginning of May, or haruest, whiche xxx] is grien or fresh, the barck being red.
When barck is taken of, thou shalt dry it diligently in an ouen streight after the bred is taken out, then cut in pieces with an ax, put it in a pot that hath the botom full of hooles, set hansumly in a pot vnneth it.
The vpper pot thou shalt fill with ye chips of Iuniper and also of that whyt Popler whiche they cal trembling, with a part of the whyt stones wherof lyme is made: after when thou hast fensed the couer wel with clay, put it into the nether and x] make a fyer round about it.
This oyll also made of only Iuniper, for the moste parte, is ministred without the body: for it is very vehement, and sanoureth very much of brentnes.
It defileth the skin that it can not be esely washed away.
haue tryed the vertue of it against Scabbednes and itches to be excellent.
It putteth away cold causes, and represeth the typum of the quartain.
Being anointed from the nauell of wemen to priuy xx] places and reines, strengtheneth the matrix or mother and dryeth vp the moystnes therof, and prepareth it to conception, Rogerius.
Oyll destilled of the stickes of Iuniper moste dry, in twoo earthen vesselles with the mouthes ioyned together, or also in a lembeck of glas, if it be holden in mouth, it taketh away maruelously the touth ach sprung of a could reum, lykewyse it is good against all oher grieues comming of could humors, as the griefes of the synewes, the xxx] conuulsion or cramp of the ioyntes, the palsy, and lyke, Matthaeolus.
Oyl of Iuniper (saith Mesues) helpeth the infections of the skyn, crieping diseases, the cancar, angry byles, such as in sommens legges the late wryters call the deed euill.
Fill a glased vessell with a narrowe mouthe, with the small chippes of Iuniper: ioyn a thin plate of iro~ boored full of hooles after the maner of a meell siue, to the hooll mouth: daub the same with the mouthe bothe of the saide vessell and of the lesser, x] whiche must be glased or oyled also to receiue the oyl whiche when thou hast digged in the ground, compas the other biggar whiche hathe the pieces of Iuniper, with a cleer fyer two howres: so the oyl shall destill into the les vessel: Thies wryteth Mesues as Siluius interpreteth him.
By this arte (saith he) oyl is made of the kurnelles of Pynaples to put away the wrinkles of wemens skins, of the wood Gnaiacum, and stronger of Lignum xx] sanctum for the grieues of the Spanishe disease as byles (vnto whiche oyll of Iuniper also and of Broum, and of ashe and of lyke, is holsum) and of other woodes, specially that be fat and ful of iuice as fruites beries and seedes.
The biggar vessell also may be of metall, or if it be of glas or ston, let it be well fensed all ouer with clay of wisdome, an erthen vessell because it is spongi not so cloos, when the oyll seketh to breeth out it would gyue it way: therfore let it be glased within, the nether xxx] vessell and receiuer may bee of glas, not clayedd only in the circuit but somwhat more thik, it may be also of metal: it may be at length of earth, so be that it be glased and oyled as they call it: els that most thin oyl wold run out here and there by the pores of the vessel: much les may that oyl be receiued safe in the pit within the grounde hauing the sides walled with potters earth, (which notwithstanding Mesues commaunded.)
Take this withall, that it shal not be nedeful to dig the lesser vessel within the ground, if thou canste finde a meanes x] to beare vp the cooles and woode, with some floore as it were, to compas the bigger vessell aboute with.
Oyl of ashe tre helpeth them that be sick of the splene, besides that it can do all that oyl of Iuniper can, and is made after the same maner Mesues.
That oyl anoynted vpon the left side vnder the short ribs, and drunken, deliuereth mightely the obstructions stoppings of the splene: it mollifieth also digesteth. xx] This oyl (saithe Rogerius) represseth the colde greues of the ioynts: it healeth a wound bryngeth skin where it lacketh: it deliuereth from the white morphew, and blackeneth it.
geuing cou~sel for ye helth of the cardinal Campegius sick of ye gout: praise (saith he) both the maner the vse of the fome of the decoction of lignum sanctum or of Iudicum to the place where the grief is.
But think the oyl of the same wod, destilled after ma+ner xxx] that the chymistes call by descencion, to be far more effectual, anoynting the places therewith yt swel and wher the grefe is.
They be wont also of the shauings of raw wode, sodden in some noble wine, putting vnto it old oyl, to prepare an oyntment which is very good to be annoynted vppon the places where the grefe is.
Take ye wode cut like bordes, therwt fill a new erthe~ vessell, with a couer of the same mater bord through wt litle holes: yt dilige~tly claid let an other empty erthe~ pot digd in the erth vp to the mouth, x] receiue it, ioyned wt clay vnto the vpper standing aboue vpon it by the couer, the force of the flames blasing rou~d about it: the oyl shall run down into the empty within the space of.
Whe~ it hath left boiling ope~ it thou shalt find oil swi~ming vpon the water: wherwith if thou anoynte whelks, pushes, exulceratio~s, ye swellings ofioyntes greues of finews, yu shalt procure ease that not a litle.
That water also is drunke~ morning euening, by it self or with the sirup following.

ma~ may also, as hard of a frend, destil guaiacu~ after the same way that Aqua fortis is destilled, best in an erthen vessel glased yt wil abide the fire, suche as they make at Haganoa.
This oyle is good for the fauts of ye ioynts through the frensh pocks, if it be anoynted vpo~ the places wt the best burning water.
Oyle of the wode guaiacu~, more mightilye of lygnum sanctum, is holsome for the spanish diseases biles.
certain practicio+ner xxx] told me once, yt this wod is not to be cast awai although it be decocted soden twise or thrise: for euen so also yet is the best oyl destilled of.
Take the wod of iuy dried, the beries gum also if yu maist haue it.
When they are cut in peces let the~ be put in an erthen vessel bored through in the bottom in .ii. or .iii. places: then let an other pot be set vnder it.
Set the~ in the erth, ioyne the botto~ of the vpper vnto the mouth of the nether wt clay or paste: the vpper pot must stand hollye aboue the ground.
At length make a fire on euery side, and the oyl shal destill blacke into the nether x] Vessell.
This oyle before all Oyles healeth the grefes in the ioynts of a cold cause.
The preparing of oyl of capuistu~ that is smoked because it is made by descencion, like as the oil of woods, haue rehersed it in this place out of the first boke of Aetius, where he entreateth of oyles: from whence Nicholas Alexandrin{us} also borowed it in his treatise of oyls.

The cost{us} cut in peces so~what gros, likwise ye styrax bdelliu~ mixt together, put the~ into an erthe~ vessell (a new one: Nycolas) wtout eres, ye mouth wherof yu shalt stop wt the hypne~, without yu shalt defe~ce it wt the slips of aspalath{us} or som odoriferus thing ha~somli xxx] lest any thing fal out of pot.
Then an other erthe~ vessel wtout ears wt a lo~g neck, which may re of the other vessel that conteineth the spices agreing aptly with the mouth, into whiche thou shalt put .v. sextaries of swete oyl. Afterwarde dig the ground and bury the earthen pot that holdeth the oyl vnto the neck, lest it wax red hot after with the fire that shalbe made about it: then turne ye other vessel with spices the mouth downward vpon ye hed of it, soioyn mouths of the~ both, yt thei mai be closed together most exactly.
Then close ye hole vessel rou~d about wt clay, on euery side where the mouthes are ioyned together, by by thou shalt kindle a fire putting vnder coles about ye earthen vessel, blowing.
When the fire is kindled let the spices being consumed, yt being set on fire theimai se~d out their vapor by the mouth of ye erthe~ vessell into ye oyl set vnder: For ye which cause it is called capnisto~ is smoked.

Of trevve Balm, and antibalm, that is Oyls composed by arte, whiche are vsed in steed of the true Balm both within and without the body.
BAl&samum is a word vsed almost in x] all tonges, a Syrian worde without dout: for in only Syria in one only garden did it ones growe.
Panag ye hebrew worde in the .xxvii. of Ezechiel, Dauid Kimhi after certaine doth erpound it a proper place of Iudaea: other Apharsamon, that is Balsamum.
The later wryters of the Iewes wryt Palsamon: Mycander Balsamo~ bycans of the vers.
Opobalsamon is a liquor: Car+pobalsamon a sied, whiche sum call also Casamum: xx] and they say it is swieter smelling then the liquor it selfe: Xylobalsamum, bowes or the wood.
ima+gined once that it was called Balsamum of the excellencie, bycause it was moste precious moste noble of all spyces: for Boal signifyeth lorde and maister with the Hebrewes and Sam spyce.
And in died it is reason, that as the thing it self is proper to Syria, so the etimology and interpretacio~ of the worde should be taken of the same tong.
Peraue~ture xxx] Belsuin also (other wrytte it Beniuin, other Belzoum) a liquor of moste swiet sauour hath the same Origen of his name.
Not same only with the Hebrewes but also Bosem signifieth a swiet smel ling spyce, whereupon the Germaines may seme to haue called Mosch Bisem.
Balsamum or Balm sum in our age thinke it is lost, the iuice of it was of the colour of gould, it he led woundes, and toke away wrinkles, and kept the faces of deed men from corruptio~: it brake also the stone in the reines, it did put away the spottes x] of the eyes, resisting poyson, specially Aconitum, Hemloke, and the shaking of very feuers, and in all thies thinges the vertues of Balm excelled.
But now ther is another kynd of Balm brought out of Spain, of a red colour te~ding toward blak, weighty, sauouring sumwhat of adustio~ or brent+nes, and by and by it stryketh perceth the heed, and the tounge also sharpely, but sumwhat longe first as peper.
And it also heeleth newe woundes more quikly then any other thinge: and taketh away xx] wrinkles.
could wel beleue that this kynd of oyll is effectuall and good, thof not for all that the trewe Balm is, yet surely to the moste parte.
The tree that bringeth this oyll is called Goacomax, of the form of a Pomgranat tree and in bignes almoste lyke: but it hathe a lief a litle biggar and a thinner barck as though it were drye, the wood of it burneth lyke a torche, the fruite is as the clusters of grapes, but the kurnelles are sumwhat biggar, of a wyny colour, whiche together xxx] with the slippes or braunches sodden long in water, doo yield that kynd of oyll, Cardanus.
Certaine marchauntes affirme that the gardeines of Balme were destroyed, what tyme as Zelimus the Turck, the predecessor of Solyman, wan Chayrum, whan the Turkes killing the gar+deners, did not forthwith put other in their places the yere of our Lorde.
Moreouer they say there is a Balm tree of an indifferent bignes laid to kepe to be compared vnto many thousandes of Ducates, with the moste famous ma~ of our time, x] an other Lucullus, Maist.
Agricola in his commentaries vpon Galen, of the diseased places .iiii. ix. Antibalsama.
Dioscorides prescribeth certaine notes and tokens of the trewe Balm.
In the collection and table of those medicines that may bee vsed one in steed of another, which is ioyned with Galenus workes, and in the ende also of Aeginetas bookes, we reed: In the steed of ye liquor of Balm, Mirh that destilleth, that is liquid and runninge xx] Mirh which is called Stacte.
In the same place is red also: In the steed of Opobalsamu~ the liquor of Myrti: but it semeth it should be more rightly ye liquor of Mirh.
Auicenna in his second booke in the chapt. of oyl: In steed of Balm (saith he) is liquid Mirh vsed, or els lyke weight of the oyl Adhii, or Aldadi, or Dadi as Bellunensis tra~slated it.
Rasis in the latter ende of his Antidotarie separated, in oyl Benedict or of tylstons: It is of like force (saith he) yt oyl of Balm: but it is more subtil hoter more xxx] proffitable in cold diseases, Monaci vpon Mesuen.
And a litle after, in the tretis quid pro quo, what for what, whiche is imprinted with the bookes of the sun of Mesue, it is red.
In the stede of Balm, Turpintyn destilled, or oyll of Bayes, or the gum of Iuy is put.
But what Dadi is, can not easily say: it is described of Auicen the.

Dioscorides saieth that Ladanum is mixt with medicines without smell: Auicenna, that it is good for the griefes of the fundament hemrodes.

Som season the apple fyrste in oyl set it in the sun a few daies, then they bery it in hors dong or in the earth so long til it be cleane putrified: so they affirme it will get the vertue of balm in closing of wounds, and thervpon hath it gotten the name of Balsamina: Ruellius out of Her molaus.

Opobalsamum is most rare and gesen: and therfore most precious.
Wherfore Petrus of Abanus, Guilielmus Placectinus, Bartolemaeus Montaguanus, composed an oyl of balme, nothing inferior in vertues to balm.

THe commun intentand purpose of all Balsams or balmes, to speake of theyr vertue, seemeth to be, to close and heale wounds biles, that in a short space, to auoyd and turne away the euill Symptomata or diseases which the sores wold otherwise xxx] cause: yt they mai heat, dry, be of scle~der partes: hereupon it is that all of them haue Turpintyn Rosin, sum also other rosins, as the rosin of Pyn tree, Mastik: here upo~ also gums ar added Frankensence, Elemi, gum of Iuy, Bdellium, Sarcocolla, Mumy, &c. Vnto sum diuers spyces are put to smell the swieter: wherupon they are made apt for the moo vses, and miet for diuers diseases euen within the body also, as to those also, vnto whiche moreouer diuers plantes or their partes are added.
They are destilled the most part of the~ x] few except, whiche are ministred only without the body, as vnto woundes.
They are destilled in asshes chiefly: all first with a slow fyer, that the cleetest matter and more thin or watery may be gotten out, then encreasing the fier by litle and litle, that the oyll whiche is of a sumwhat reed colour may be receyued, afterward the fier is made biggar that the oyle may be very reed, and at length inclyne to black.
The liquor that issueth in the midst is more allowed to the vses within the body: xx] the last is sumwhat to hoot, to vehement and vnplesaunt, moore miet to be ministred withoute where there is nede of more force: as ye first where there is nede of litle.

The vessell was ful to the middle, able to receiue, if it had been fild vp perauenture, iiii. poundes: he continued this labour .iiii. or .v. daies nightes also, neuer abating the fier.
He separated only .ii. liquors, ye first whyt, whiche was more plentifull and in gretter abundaunce: then a redish, whiche was yielded lesser by the .iii. part.
The clay wherwith the Cucurbita, the lembeck xx] and the receiuer are closed, when it chauneth or chinketh, must be by and by cloosed again with clay, lest the matter issue out on any side: therfore must it be watched also on the night, and lest the fier should go out.
All the liquors also may be receiued in one vessel without chaunging the the receiuer, and after be separated for the For the latter swimmeth aboue the first as the lighter.
This oyll he vsed vnto diuers diseases, geuing them euery day one drop to drynke, and conteining it a certayne xxx] dayes (as fourtien sumtimes) together: so he sayd it was good to chronicall agues, for the mooste part he mixed with it sum spyces, as Ginger and Sugar with wyne the drop of the oyll, that the sick should les perceiue that he dronk only a drop of the oyll: sumtymes he would mixt nothing els with the wyne but one drop of this oyll, specially to amende the defaut of a stinking breeth.
Sumtymes he gaue it in water, other tymes he dropt it into a shyue of breed: sumtymes to flegmatick and gros men, with a sawce made of musterd and x] peper, bidding them sweet after it: he said it chau~ced many tymes that they shoulde auoyde muche fleume therupon.
He commended it to be good for all suche thinges, as triacle is vsed for: and better also against poysons: also to al woundes, swellinges whatsoeuer they were saue only the dropsy: to the Cramp, to purge the tieth: to strengthen the iawes, against the Fallyng sicknes, and poysons.

WAters and oyles, secreate by the singuler x] industrie and wit of Chymists, are of most greate vertues, and of so thin a substance and so subtil, that a drop of a certain oyl by chaunce, falling vpon a bed, perced in a moment the manifold clothes and keuerings thereof and burned the bordes in the bottome of the bed.
This vertue of pearsinge semeth to pertaine chieflye vnto oyles drawne out of metalles, in the which also is a greater force xx] of burninge.

Lullius in the fift Canon of his firste booke of quintessence, when he had taughte to drawe oute the .iiii. elementes oute of plantes, he added.
And xxx] so shalt thou do also with metals: firste thou shalt make them to resolue with oure Menstrue (I suppose he meaneth oure Vrine) vnder dounge for the space of a weke: the Menstruum must be sharp with some Vegetable and stronge quickenynge thinges whiche we shall declare hereafter in the Questionary.
After the metalles shall be dissolued set them to be destilled in a fire of the first degree, and the Menstruum shall issue forthe, and the lime or pouder of ye metal shal remaine in the bottome.
After this reiterat repete it again vpo~ the dregs x] of the metall with newe Menstruum as muche as the weight of the metall, and set it to putrifyinge for the space of a month and a half: and after this destill it as thou didst of the Vegetable or quickning things, but euery time put new Menstruum vpon the dregs.
Other diuers opinions of Philosophers in the drawing out of the elements out of minerall thinges, we shall declare in the thirde boke: This saith he.
suppose it to be a commone thinge vnto all xx] oyles of metals to be heauier then other oyles, as Cardanus signifieih and an other certaine author wryteth, that the drops oyl of Vitriol or Coproos to be ponderous and weightie.
Oyle destilled of Orpment or Mysi (or Vitriol of Rom.) annoynted vpon ye arteries region of the hart, suppose is hable to saue a ma~ infected with poyson, be it neuer so sharp and strong, do kill a manne onlye with touchinge: Cardanus.
And a little after, but sence wee are fallen into xxx] this communication, think it shuld not be so vnprofitable nor far fro~ the purpose to inquere this how oyl may be made whiche beinge annoynted vpon the Arteriis, maketh the venome to breake out by vomit or purgacion, or sweat, or vrine, It is sure, it muste be of metall, which must be most stronge.
sawe suche once and by the waighte onlye coniectured that it was without al doute of metall, It muste also bee of the nature of Venome: for by the immoderate heate, as it is saide, it vanquisheth firste the euill infection conceiued x] and by naturallye attracteth vnto the vtter partes, that is hurtefull, and by the contrarietie driueth it awaye.
It must also haue no small strengthe to discus expel: and again, so~e contrarietie against the poysons them selues, which .ii. things agree to the iuice of Laser or Assa Foeetida.
Therfore those things that must driue out the poysone, ought to be metally poysons, but not most bitter: and most hot and discussing or expelling, also in a maner contrary to the poysons.
The matter therfore xx] of these thinges may consist of these thinges, Mysi Orpment, and the iuice of Laser or Assa foetida, and Gentian, and of the fat of venemous serpentes, and Aconitum.
If so be it that in any land moo of theese (foresaide vertues, as to discus, expell, and resiste poysones. &c. be to bee gotten, the oyle extracted by the force of fyre shall be best of all.
But oyle that onlye by anoyntinge of the Arteries dothe thruste oute the poysone, woulde not call it the best in this sence xxx] that also besydes it thou shouldest Minister in drinke, Triacle or Milke or sum other excellent medicin, ye also it should be the more auaylable.
That dare be bold to say, that the anoynting of the arteries, and the things ministred outwardly, are better and of more strength then those things that are drunck, saue only for this that the poyson remayneth yet in the stomack.
For vnto such (poy+sons newly taken, that they be not yet gone out of the stomack) they that prouoke strong vomities are moost excellent, as Milk, Lie, Oyll, water of x] Nucis vomicae or spewing nut.
Therfore in venemous bytinges, in stingings in oyntmentes that be venemous, in the drinking of venom whiche is now alredy perced to the midrif or nether partes of the chest, the helpes that be ministred outward+ly are more auailable and of greater strength.
&c. Thies out of Cardane haue written the more at large, that therby also ye reason migth be the more euident of that marueilous oyl of Scorpions. &c. Whiche bycause it is made without destillacion, xx] will describe it hereafter seuerally.
Oyll of Antimonium is moste proffitable to all ill soores and byles, as my self dotry with good succes.
But the Antimonium is purged first, ofte~times melted and made liquid with the fyer.
Far from this doth the oyll of Antimonium which chymistes vse, wherwithall they endeuoure to set the colour of gould vpo~ siluer: Matthaeolus vpo~ Diosc.
Oyll of Antimonium howe it is made for soore byles and fistulas.
writ afore out of Vlstadius, xxx] in the treetis of Quintessence.
But certain practicioners also make oyll of Antimonium to diuers diseases within the body, whiche they extoll with maruelous and great praises.
Antimonii half a pounde, whyt Tartari Calcionated asmuche: let the~ be beaten and melted or dissolued in a gouldsmithes Tigillo (crucibulo) vpon cooles: when they are melted let them be powred out into sum earthen pot, where they shalbe sturred and mixt together: and when they are becum into a hard lump, let them x] be pund again, and streined by a colender (that is a sack of that form that they vse for Hyppocras as they call it) in a moyst place (in a hoot and moyst place) as in a wyne celler, the colender hanging: for so shall the oyll destill out by litle litle which of sum bycause of the bloudie colour is called Rubedo Antimanii, and lykewyse it is made of certain Gouldsmithes for a certain painting can not tell what.
But for the remedies of mans body it ought to be prepared with Quintessence of wyn xx] or with burning water, so that twyse asmuche all moste of it be powred to the forsaid rednes of the Antimonium: and let them be sturde diligently in body, and mixt, and then destilled in ashes thre or iiii. times, till the breth lose al the euil smell.
The dregs must always be mixt sturd about when yu powrest again the destilled water vpon the~, or when thou powrest to them new Quintessence, for am not sure whiche way it ought to be doone.
Sum in the beginning do stregthway mixt reed xxx] vineger most sharp (destilled with the Antimoniu~ Tartaru~ calcionated to be melted together.
But wryt althies not as certain: but as noted the~ by the way as hard them recited certain yeres ago of a certain practicioner.
know that certain chymistes goldsmithes serche for ye oyl or Quint essence of ye Antimoniu~ as a moste perfect treasur.
Thies destil first sharp lye co~posed of vnslect lyme and ashes Clauellatas by a Filtru~: and is this lye they sieth the Antimoniu~ subtilly and fynly beten, for the space of .v. houres, and again destil this lye when it is cold, by a Filtru~: that of ye Antimoniu~ x] that passeth through wt it, that is a pouder of yelowe colour, they reserue.
After they powre in vpo~ the Antimoniu~ put in a Cucurbita or body, moste sharpe red vinegar destilled, so that it be aboue it iii. or .iiii. fingars thick: they set it in a hoot place a few daies, and euery day they shake and· mixt it, x. or .xx. times: then they power ye vinegar lightly into an other glas, so yt nothing be troubled.
This do repete .v. or .vi. times (euer powring new vinegar vpon the Antimoniu~ remaining in ye Cucurbita xx] or body) at length they put all the vinegar together, destil it by a lembeck with a slow fyer, til ye oyl begin to run out.
This oyl or quintessence of Antimoniu~, is of a colour of blud.
With this thei die Mercurie, say it is an inco~parable treasure, a chief mistery of ye chymistical art: as we tra~slated out of a certain writen doutch boke.
reed oyll is gotten out of Antimoniu~, very sharp, smelling lyk brimston, it reteineth ye vertue of Antiminium, bycause of the grosnes of the substaunce proffitable xxx] to few thinges.
Hooll Lyme vnbroken, let it be slekt in co~mun oyll, and destill it in a lembeck of glas, there shall issue forth an oyll good for a boon that is corrupt: Syluius.
Put a hot piece of quick Lyme into commun oyll, till the Lyme becum powder, then let it be destilled in a lembeck of glas, and oyll of Lyme shall issue, whiche is the firste that was described by Leonard of Praedapalea Patauinus, Ion. Iacobus de Manliis.
Oyll of Cerussa: Looke before where we intreted of Quintessence out of Vlstadius. x] Oyll of Gagates or ieet, called Sacratum or holy, moste holsum for them that be possessed of spirits, that haue the falling sicknes, the palsy, the cramp, the stifnes of sinewes, the gout, or be chooked in their wombe, it helpeth also co~ceiuing.
It is made of Ieet stones after the maner of oyll of Iuniper (by descention) or elles by sublimacion (as oyll of tyle stones) Mesues of Iac. Syluius interpretacion: out of whose notes we haue subscribed thies wordes: Seing Bitumen is far lighter cost then Ieet, xx] and of the same vertues or stronger, a man might proue to get an oyl out of it, whiche shal run more abundauntly specially if it be new Bitumen, forasmuche as it is as it were the fat of the earth, and is burned in steed of oyll of them that dwell about the place of Asphaltita or deed sea, or els in other places wher Bitumen is.
Forthermore he douteth whether it can heele the falling sicknes, seing the falling sicknes doth the more appeer with ye foule stinking, smell of the Bitumen.
But me thinkes it xxx] semeth probable that that sicknes shuld be helped with it by attenuating, digesting, drying, whiche vertues boothe it hathe theim befoore, and that not feablelye: and also muche moore the liquor destilled thereof perfourmeth theese thinges.
Nether doth it not help this diese therfor, because it is likely that the same should be vttred and appere with the perfume of that bituminous smell, as with the perfume of Myrrh, Galbanum, and horns, houfs, and the skins of a she or he gote.
For Phisicions vse the hornes houfes of diuers bestes x] against this siknes, ministring the shauings of them within the body: nether is it a like reaso~ in the perfuminge of a thinge and receiuinge of it simplely.
But of these maiters, Phisicions shuld teach not so much by reasons coniectures, as by experiment trial.
my self saw once a perfume of beaten Aumber (whiche also is ascribed vnto ye kind of Bitumen) speciallye white, holden to the nosthrils of one sick of the falling euil, with coles in a spone and the Amber vpon them, and by by xx] the fit ceased: which thing appels or bals as they call them made with Mosch or Ambra will do also.
But that Mesuae writeth of men possessed with deuils (saith Syluius) is supersticious, against the faith of a Christen man.
Brimston and iet are molten at the fire as al other liquors.
Oyl of philosophers (which some haue named oyl of wisdom, and of perfect mastership, diuine and holy) by al the old writers consent, is most effectuous to secreat diseases, and not to a few xxx] of them, for it heateth, drieth, perceth depe by the meanes of the subtelnes of the substance, it digesteth and consumeth al excremental and superflu+ous expelled matter.
Therfore it is very holsome for the falling sicknes, palsy, turning sicknes, for getfulnes, and for the cold diseases of the splene, rains, bladder, womb, sinewes, al ioynts, other sinewy parts.
But one sort is natural or mineral and an other of the sea, that runneth out of Iles rocks (called Naphtha) of the which kinde, that which is somewhat white is counted the best: the x] redish of a mean goodnes: but that which is somwhat black thick, is the worst.
Tiles made of red earth very old, must be beaten into pieces, set on fire with vnsmoking coles, til they be red hot, the~ slek the~ in a bole ful of oyl of Rofmary (alchichil) or old claret, as much as is possible let them sok in the oyl.
The Munks vpon Mesuen: wher also is red shortly after, Caczola for a Cucurbita or body of a xx] stil.)
Afterward beat them most smal, and put the~ in a vessel that be destilled by sublimacion, ioyn ye vessel to the hed with claye that chymists do vse, sethe them with coles set a fire in a fornace, til an oyl destil into a phial of glas glued to ye lower end of the nose of the head (with clay, Bulcasis) which stopt veri exactly, set it vp kepe it: for the elder it is the stronger: Mesue as Syluius tra~slateth him, whose words also haue writen here out of his annotacio~s.
Oyl (saith he) of tiles is so subtil, that xxx] in a moment it spredeth most brode: if it be poured into a mans ha~d it perceth it forth wt.
It is much more subtil, more hot and more effectuous in cold diseases, the~ is oyl of balm.
It prouoketh vrin, it breaketh the stone, killeth worms: it is holsom for the singing of the eares comming of a gros wind for the palsi, the cra~p (spasmo cynico) the sciatica or ach in the hukle bones, the gout in the knees, fete the greues of the other ioynts, being drunk or anoynted vpon ye place: but let it be drunke mixte wt a litle porcion of some water conuenient for the disease.
The making of this oyl is described also x] by Rasis in his Antidotari or preseruatiue and by Bulcasis in his boke intitled Seruitor: wheras Bul+casis preferreth new tiles, yt neuer yet toucht water, because they drink in ye oyl better: he bids deuide the~ into pieces of an inche bignes, putreth the~ so in a vessel of glas, or glased, wel claied yt the third part therof remain empty.
The fire must be made soft at ye first, but so yt it touch ye bottom, en+cresed by litle litle.
First shall a water issue forth afterward an oyl (read Bulcasis) which must be ga+thered xx] bi it self.
In the same wise do we destil turpentyn, guaiacu~ many other things.
Oyl also of Chamaemel, Nard also, which is called Benet or blessed of Mesuae: but this (of tiles) is ye chief, of so~e is called petroleu~ or oyl of stones.
Read certain things befor, wher we haue entreted generally of ye destillatio~ of oyls by desce~cion, out of Vlst.
Bul. bideth to dip in the peces euerye one of an bignes (a dramme, xxx] Rasis) made redde hotte, in mooste olde oyle, and when they are quenched to take them out of oyl and when thei are al so~what grose beaten, to put them into one or mo stillatory vessels: whiche he calleth belies, so that .ii. parts of ye vessell or more be filled.
He biddeth also to take hede that ye fyre come not nie to this oile (while it is destilled) because it wil easily be set on fire, and hardly be put out.
Afterward again new peces of tiles, dressed as before, to be destilled, til oyl inough be gathered: which he biddeth to be kept in a vessell with a narow mouth: moste diligently stopte with waxe x] (and earth): For it bretheth out easily because of the subtiltie and thinnes of the substaunce.
Vse this oyl (saith he) in cold sicknesses as the falling euil, the benumming of the senses or Apoplexia, the heauines of hearing, and cold gout: other diseases also haue expressed in the booke of oyles, for it is a secrete thing of philosophers.
The very same way of making it doth Rasis describe.
The oyl that they cal commonlye Balsamyn (of spik) raiseth vp sode~ly them that lie in the falling xx] sicknes, being held vnder their noses to be smeld, or els that which they get out of tilestones, hath the name of the stone: Alexander Benet.
This oyl is made also with certain other thinges mixt with it, as found in a certain written boke, the words wherof wil rehers here.
Take breke into litle peces red tiles very olde or new, but yt neuer touched water, thei being made red hot que~ch them in oyl of oliues, or els, is better, in oyl of baies, by by make the~ red hot again, xxx] slek the~ as befor vntil they wax blacke.
Then put these peces into a lembeck with ye oyl also wherin theiwer que~shed, if ani of it be left, if not, put new vnto it to the measur of a fingar.
Afterward put to it Castorei, and Spicknard, or in the steed of it rew, of ether of them one part: Costi two partes.
When thies are punned, mixt them with the tyles in a Cucurbita or bely, whiche thou shalt digge in hors dong about.
At lengthe thou shalt destill it, encreasing the fyer by litle and litle.
The first liquor is good, the second better, but the third of a red colour is best.
This oyll is good against x] all could diseases as Balm, but this is more subtil then Balm and more proffitable in could diseases, for it perceth through the hand quickly and spredeth abrode a great way.
It cureth the stoone of the bladder and the could diseases of the same.
It helpeth the could diseases of the eares, and killeth the wormes of the same.
It is moste proffitable for them that be sick of the palsy, and of the Cynical Cramp, being anoynted therupon or drunke~, also the Sciatica, the griefs xx] of the ioyntes and back.
plaster made with this oyll and salt Ammoniack, dissolueth in short space the impostumes and hardnesses of the splien.
It is of force against the falling sicknes and the obstruction or stopping of the nose, being put into ye noosthrilles.
It heateth the brain, confirmeth the memory, asswageth touth ache.
It bringeth out the chyld newly conceiued ether dead or alyue.
It openeth the mouth of the vaines, dissolueth the xxx] bloud that is lopperd or curded.
fewe drops of it drunken with syrop of Rooses, helpeth them that drawe their breeth peinfully.
It consumeth marueylously the water descending down to the eyes, that is to saye the disease called Suffusion.
If fishers anoynt their nettes therwith, they shall entyse innumerable fishes.
Iron moystened therin and put to the fyer shall burne streigth way.
Being made hoot in an egge shell or other vessell, may be dropt x] holsumly into the place where the grief is, vntyll the grief asswage.
It resisteth could poysons, as the sting of a Scorpion, and also black Popy, and Henbane, if a ma~ haue reciued the~ by his mouth.
It puteth away the stoone of the bladder, being mixt with the barck of Percily, and Fenell, (the barkes of the routes being sodde in water, and a litle quantitie of this decoction receiued with a drop or .ii. in drinke) but all thies thinges for the moste part doth Rasis in Antidotary attribute and xx] asscribe to the simple oyl Benet, that is, that which is destilled of only tyles oyl.
That is cou~ted the best (saith Rasis) that is very red, of a strong smel, and of a subtill substaunce.
Oyl of leed: Loke befor, wheras we haue reher sed Vlstadius wordes of Quinessence.
Amber by an artificiall meanes of siething is turned into an oyl of his oun colour.
Ge. Agricola In died it is possible to make oyl of Amber, after the same maner as of Iet, wherof we haue writen xxx] befor.
For they seme, not to be of much vnlyke nature.
The Germains call them by a co~mun name Agstein, geuing only the difference of black vnto Iet. Cardan supposeth that Camphora also is of ye same kynd, only bycause yt this, that the perfume of Amber receiued in a moyst cloth, giueth afterward the smell of Camphora in it: which notwithstanding did not appeare so to me as did proue it for a triall.
Brimston anoynted dru~ck taketh away scabbednes, leprosy and the frenche pockes.
But with x] a more vehement force, the oyl therof, which how it should be made, we haue declared in our bokes of the frenche diseases.
But his bookes of ye frenche disease, suppose ar not yet cum forth in print.
Salt co~teineth an oyll in it if it be mixt wt the lyme or clay called Bitumen.
Wherupo~ Arrianus declareth, emongst the Ichthiophagi, the men that liue only by fyshe, in his history of Ind, howe they make an oyll of salt.
That may be an argument also that the Oliue tries delyte in the Sea xx] bankes for a salt grou~d is also not a litle fat.
But as said, al thinges do so contein oyl, that it may be drawen out by ye force of fier, but it can not contein much, except it haue Bitume~ mixt wt it.
For the making of oyl of Brimston, a ma~ must chose out yt which is pure neuer touched the fier, chiefly aliue of an ashy colour.)
This oyl is made many wayes at Rome, by sublymacio~ desce~cion. &c.
It is good for many thinges, chiefly for fistulas, for ye healing of ye wheeles of ye moutes xxx] me~ cal gangrenes (I suppose it to be yt which we call in Englishe cankers) in the curing wherof it excelleth moste of all.
For take and wet the end of a fether or other lyke thing, as some yong and ten+der spring of a trie or herbe, and touche the wheeles once or twyse only therwith, and by and by thei shalbe killed healed.
Take a vessell of glas (as Maithaeolus Senen. writeth in his boke of the Frenche euil) not much vnlyke to a litle bell, daubed with potters claye, hang it the space of a cubit from the grounde, by a wyer of bras or iron, vnder ye which thou shalt set x] a basen of glas of a great co~pas, with a pot turnde vpsyde downe.
Moreouer the bottom of the pot shall hold vp an iron plate of .iiii. fingars broode, made red hoat, wherupon the Brimstone may be brent.
Therupon it shal cum to pas that by the smoke ascending, the hanging vessell in short space shall destill drop down in to the basen that standes vnder, an oyll, whiche gathered diligently thou shalt serue in a phyall of glas. xx] Brimstone that neuer came ny the fyer, or most yelowe, whyles it is brent, giueth a thick smoke to be receiued in a bell of glas or of stoone.
Wherein thorowe the gros vapour an oyll gathered together destilleth into a large plain vessell, in ye mids wherof the brimstone builded vpon a litle vessell is brent.
Other beating the brimstone consume the fyry substau~ce of if, with Aqua vitae set on fyer, and after deuil that whiche remaineth, lyke vnto oyll of Philosophers.
Other sieth yelowe Brimstone xxx] Turpintyn, of ether an vnce, oyl of Roses a pound, with a slow fire, with .ii. vnces of odoriferous wine, til the wine be consumed, (as it is red in Luminari maiore.)
Put one part of quick brimston into .ii. parts partes of oyl of Lynsied, beat them well and diligently together, and let them stand in hors dong ii. dais in a vessel wel shut, it shalbe clere fair.
But all these oyls seme to be prepared only for this purpose that they may be ministred without the body: here say that there be certaine practicioners x] now a daies, which geue men to drink to ther body, a certain oyl of brimsto~, chiefli against falling siknesses, perauenture that kind whose firy substance, as Syluius maketh mencio~, is first consumed by Aqua vitae set on fire, then destild by sublimacion, it may be more safly ministred with in the body then the other.
Oyl of Vitriol or copros is desired of chymists and likewise of phisitions, and as a moste secrete matter is hid.
will put here some descriptions xx] therof, whiche receiued of my frendes, or found in write~ bokes, and after other wil declare one way of this oyl most effectuall approued, which know my selfe, whiche a certaine practicioner with vs vsed to the curing almoste of all kinde of diseases, and in many luckely. &c. Make the Vitriol in to lime, as thou knowest, then pour burning water vnto it, so that it excede the Vitriol a little: then seperate the burning water by destillacion in a phiall or in a croked stil, or xxx] a bely (laid on the one side).
When that is drawne out, vrge the spirits of the Vitriol by litle and little, encreasing the fire more and more, til al ye spirits be ouer passed.
This liquor destilled put it again into som one of the .iii. maner of vessels aforsaid, destil it in a kettle ful of water, vntil whatso euer watry thing is in it, be separated, whiche thou shalt endeuor to bring to pas by al the witte thou hast, that the watrines be clean gotten out, ether by a le~bek, (with a nose) or a blind lembek, whose nether skirt haue a hollow gutter or circle x] like vnto a le~bek) that is to say with a nose).
Endeuor that the water in the kettle sethe lightlye (if so be it ought to sieth at all: the dutch word (siede~) semeth to be and may signify as wel se thing as boyling) to thintent that the waterines alone may ascend, and the oyl alwaies remain in the botom of the bely: the which thing to bringe to pas, you shall haue nied of two daies at the least.
Then afterward that oyl that is left in the belly, put it into a bely or other of the forsaid vessels defensed xx] with clay and destil it: marke whether any water pas before the spirits.
For if there be any watrines yet mixt with it, it shalbe nedeful to set it afterward in sun or hot place in a blind le~bek, the watrines being eleuated and caried vp may remain in the hem skirt of the le~bek.
This if yu repeete ofter then once, this insolacio~ mene the oyl shall becom euer the swieter and better.
Ye also a man may repete the destillacion the second or third time: for by that meanes the oyl is rectified xxx] more and more.
Thou maist minister .ii. or .iii. drops of this oyl against all manner of diseases, ether by it self, or with waters conuenient for euerye disease.
This oyl haue tasted my selfe, it is swiet, pleasant, and strong, in colour (if remember wel) somwhat white.
Take .iiii. poundes of Vitriol of Rome, dry it in an earthen vessel till it wax red, after when it is beaten put it into a bely of glasse diligently defenced with clay (as the maner is for Aqua fortis) and first destilit with a soft fire, encre+sing the degre of the fire by litle and little, vntyll x] white fumes begin to issue out at the nose of ye bely: then set a great receiuing vessel fensed wt clay and make a fire with wod continuing for ye space of .xii. hours, and at le~ght shal issue out red drops and heauye.
When the receiuer beginneth to bee clear, the matter is finished, wherfore then cease that the vessels may be couled.
Afterward shalt put it in a litle lembek to separate and auoide the fleum, and reserue the reast, setting it in the sun a ix. daies.
When thou wilt vse it, minister it wyth xx] white wine, or Malmsy .vi. or .vii. drops, so that nothinge after be eaten by the space of .iii. or .iiii. hours, it mai be receiued also before slepe, if a ma~ drink not vpon it.
This liquor is profitable for a sick stomack, for lepers, for them that be sicke of ye stone, for the retention and keping of vrin, for the~ that be sicke of the Ague, and in time of the pestilence with water of Acetosae, somwhat warm, put+ting vnto it half a dram of spices Diamargariton, which is cold if it may be gotten.
xxx] An other way to make oyl of Vitriol against in rable diseases.
Put as much Vitriol of Rome as ye wil in a bely to wax red, wt such a fire as is vsed to Aqua fortis, for ye space of .xxiiii. hours, as lo~ge as the water commeth forth without spirits, and more if it be not made red, euer kepinge the same fire.
Whe~ as it is now becomed red, take away ye hed (lembek) and the receiuer, and kepe the water for secret vses to be spoken of.
After beat ye Vitriol and put it in a bely with .v. partes of quintesse~ce of wine, that the Vitriol may be soked: The belly x] ought to be laide ouerthwarte in a fornace, to the which thou shalt set an other contrary without, ye bottom wherof let it be put in a vessel of cold water.
Then make a fire in the furnace, no les vehement the~ such as for Aqua fortis is made.
So shal run out first the Aqua vitae, and at length the fyre encreased, oyl of Vitriol shall follow.
Then thou shalt separate the Aqua vitae from the oyl, putting a hed to the bely wherin both are conteined, setting a receiuer without, with a fire of Aqua fortis. xx] But that the matter may be the more euident, we haue drawn a figure such as it is, of the fornace, wherin the oyl ought to be destilled, with a situacion ouerthwart to the bely, and a fire made rou~d about, that the oyl issuing forth may find no colenes saue only in the receiuer.
The vertues of this oil ar innumerable, wherof so~e we wil recite here, yt a learned phisicio~ may coniecture ye rest by him self.
To such as haue any hot or cold disease, but more cold, he shall geue .iiii. drops with good xxx] wine, or burninge water, fastinge earlye in the morning, and forbid [Figure: them to receiue anye meet befor .iiii. houres be past.
Against a co~tinual ague giue .viii. drops, with halfe an vnce of Rose water, in the morning as is said and lykewyse also against other diseases, x] with destilled liquors or decoctions miet for the purpose.
As co~cerning the Dosin, that is the quantitie of the re+ceite, vnto stro~g men thou maist giue .viii. drops, to men of meen strength fiue, to such as be weake iiii. &c.
In this oyll if thou dissolue Marchasit, it shall chaung siluer, and tinge it in all degries.
An other way for the same, that it may be the xx] better made and purer.
Put in an earthen pot of earth of Crucibulorum glased within as muche Vitrioll of Rome as thou wilt: and destill it in a fornace, as is befor said, with a fyer of Aqua fortis and there shall run out a whyte water of Vitriol: After when it ceaseth, thou shalt encreas the fyer, and a grien water shall folow, which whe~ it hath left thou shalt make a moste strong and veheme~t fyer, both aboue and beneth, and a red oyl shall issue out.
Chaunge euer the receiuer according to xxx] the chau~ging of the liquors: Or els take those .iii. liquors in one vessel, seperate the waters afterward from the oyl by destilling them, and the oyll shall remain in the bely.
This separatio~ is made ye bely sta~ding vpright (with a head and a receiuer) the first destillacion of ye oyl, the bely lying ouerth warth, as it is said.
If thou dip a litle drie woul or bombase in water of Vitriol of Rome, and ther wt thouch any kind of diseases of ye mouth, thou shalt easely heale them: Out of a writen booke of a certain friend: he semeth here to meane that water yt x] ru~neth out first: which is to be vsed only without the body, not the very oyl of Vitriol, which is more precious and pure, and is kept to be ministred giuen to drinke against inward diseases.
Of the vertues of oyl of Vitriol, out of ye same writen boke.
Drinck Malmsy with a litle oyll of Vitriol, co~tinually for the space of .v. or .viii. dais, it riddeth a man from all obstructions, it purgeth the bloud, and driueth away the stone.
It healeth the il scab, if it be drunck with water of fumitory, xx] and Myrobalana condite.
It healeth all maner of griefes of the head, with water of Maioram, or Buglos, or Melissa: also the turnsicknes, if it be conteined any space.
With water of Agresta it healeth al ma+ner of diseases, the body being first purged.
It re+storeth the memory with the water of Acorus or Fenell.
It mouith a man to slepe, with the sied of Letis or Popy.
It is good for melancolyck persons with water of Bublos or Borage.
It cureth xxx] mad men with water of the water lily, co~tinuing ye vse of it: also hoat impostums the sleping euil with water of wyld rewe.
It healeth ye palsy with water of wyld mint, or sage, Hyssop, the cramp with water of Sage: the sicknes of quaking with water of Basilicus, diuers inward diseases with water of Tri+folium, all feblenes of the eyes with water of Fenell: the reum from the head with water of Lily, ye catar wt water of Adiantu~ Hyssop, the cough, also the disease of the syde with water of Pla~tain the Pleuresis wt water of maiden hear, the feblenes x] wekenes of the stomack, wt water of mint.
With water of Quinces, it staunceth vomitting: if the sick be of a moyst temperature or co~plexion, let it be giuen him with water of plantain or shep pardes purs with a litle Diarhodon.
It stinteth ye flux of the bely with the water of Plantain: the co lyck with water of Rewe.
It healeth al maner of impostumes and dropsy, continuing it.
It is good for the limes that be resolued, if it bee xx] chawfed vpon with an Ox gaull.
It helpeth the splen with Tamarindis: with water of Radish and and sea bremble, it expelleth the stoone, openeth the stoppinges of theines.
It healeth all agues wt water of Agresta, certain kyndes of leprosy, co~ti+nuing the vse of it.
This is the trew potable gold, and the trew Sela~dyn or Chelidonia, more also in weigth it giueth not place to gold, it hath the same as many vertues as potable gould.
litle of it with a litle water of Roses drunk, restoreth ye xxx] speche that is lost: it stinteth the bleding at ye nose with Roses.
An other maner of oyll of Vitriol, whiche a certain old man a practicioner in Heluetia vsed, mixting .ii. or .iii. drops with Triacle, and bidding the~ to sweet after they had drunck it, in a bed .iiii. or. houres, so that they put not out so muche as a fingar, by the whiche medicine knowe manye too be cured of him from diseases hard to be cured.
When he died sawe the oyll whiche me thougth was of sumwhat a whyte colour or duskish, perauenture bycause of the litle pieces of siluer that x] were put into it.
The taste of it was moste sharpe passing all vinegar be it neuer so stro~g, in so much that one drop perced the tong lyke any hoot markyng iron sodenly, yet hurt it not: ye it nether hurt the throot when it was swalowed: otherwyse of no vnplesant taste, almoste of no smel, or els sumwhat senting of adustion or brentnes.
Putte .iii. or .iiii. pound of Vitriol, or as muche as ye list in a large earthen vessell glased, and fenced without euery where rou~d xx] about with clay diligently and dryed againe, and setting the vessell in a chimney vpon quick coles, procure diligently all the smooke of it (from the which as from the poyson thou shalt beware thou kepe thy selfe) the vapuor and beeth out, stirring it with a staf, and mouing euery fout that whiche is beneth vpward, seing lykewyse that in boyling it run not ouer, and continue so doing till it ceas boylyng, and that all the vapor and smooke seme to be cleen consumed.
Then shalt thou put in bur+ning xxx] cooles of Vitriol many inough from aboue in the very vessel, and leaue it so til the Vitriol be clean brought to lime, that no moisture or vapor at all remain in it, and that now it haue gotten a redish or yelowish colour, nor any vapour or spirits seme to ascend from it any more.
For except ye Vitriol be very dry, oyl effectual strong inough should not be drawn out of it, but mixt with a cer+tain white fleum.
When as therefore it is sufficiently broughte into lime, put awaye the fire, and when the vessell is couled by little and little, take x] it out softly least peraueuture it breake.
The~ get out the Vitriol as wel as ye ca~ with a knife or otherwise: although it is no harde matter to get it out of a glased vessel.
The Vitriol take~ out, breke it smal, put the peces into an erthen bely, which the potter, as be spoken, hath made of ye best erth, and wonderfully wel [Figure: baked, so stronge that it mai be able to abide a vehemente fire in a xx] fornace .iii. daies, and nights, continually: for if it shuld breke thou shouldest loose both oyl and labor, be it neuer so litle a crak or chinck that shoulde happen vnto it.
Ther+fore yt it may the easier withstande abide xxx] the fire, it must be fe~ced with clay, and yt, ii. or .iii. fold, yt is, first dried parieted again, again.
square, in the top a litle imbosed vaulted rou~d in the midst of ye top of ye arch shalbe made a hole or smoking vent, so larg, eueri hour or as oft as nead shal require, coles may be put conueniently into ye fornace by it, wt a lo~g iron fire shouel, to put in the coles ge~tlely charily wtall yt they may slide down about the bely in such wise yt it be not hurt.
corners also aboue must be left holes or x] ve~ts, in euery coruer one, so mani stoples of clai must be made mete for the~.
Whe~ the coles are now put in the fyre burneth, the hole of the valt must be shut wt a lid of iron or wt the fire shouel, and the holes of the· corners must be left open, yt thair mai haue entraunce.
The bely ought to be placed in ye midle of the fornace vpon such an yron which shal rest at both ends in ye wals on both sides of ye fornace: in ye midle bought of this iro~ shal the bely be xx] laid.
The mouth of the bely ought to loke out wtout ye fornace a litle by a hole which must streight way be shut stopt wt clay, yt the air may haue no entra~ce ther about.
The~ must ye mouth of ye belibe ioyned wt the mouth of ye receiue, so yt thone be put into thother.
It is requisit that the receiuer be of glas good great, peraue~ture lest whe~ it is stuffed wt the spirits it shuld cha~ce to breke, or els to ye inte~t it may be the further from the fornace.
And wher thei ar ioyned together, yu shalt co~pas ye ioyntes xxx] rou~d about dilige~tly wt very good clay te~pred wt the whites of egs linne~ clouts about it, lest spirits shuld brethe out.
This clai must be suffred to be dried, before ye begin the busines.
Moreouer ther must yet .ii. holes be made in the ii. contrary sides of the fornace (not in yt side yt the bely loketh out at, nether in the co~trary, but in the other two.
These also must haue their stopples to shut the~ wt al, yt the heat may be kept in.
The vse of these holes, yt the coles which ar put in at the top of ye valt may be hadso~ly disposed wt some iron pro~g for the purpose put in at ye holes, ordred in suche wise yt x] they be beneth, aboue on euery side of the bely, it in the very mids of the fire: by ye same holes, shal it be taken hede, yt the flore of the grate be not stopt wt coles or ashes to much, that thentra~ce of thair be not shut out, by mouing them wt the iron prong: yt being don, by by the holes must be shut again wt their stopples.
In the nether part also of ye fornace must be left a dore indiffere~t larg, yt the air may haue entra~ce beneth, lest the fire be
litle aboue this dore shalbe laid on cros xx] ouerthwart an other in order vpo~ which must be a flore paueme~t made, an inch thik, ful of holes as big as a ma~ may put in his tho~b at the~, to thinte~t ye air mai haue acces: it must be sene vnto most dilige~tly yt the fire may be co~tinued great inough, for space of.
dais nights, as it is said, neuer left or let slake: for so also the oyl the labor shuld he lost.
Thus whe~ eueri thing is apoynted, the fornace the bely dried, yu shalt begin destillatio~ co~tinuing a strong fire with coles as it is said.
dais are ended receiuer beginneth to becom clere and white, the fire burning yet in his ful strength, and this is a token of perfectio~.
Therfore thou shalt let the fire to go oute and the fornace once couled, take awaye the receiuer, and turning it in thy handes, and inclining it now to one side, now to an other, gather all the drops together that cleue vnto the sides, and the oyl or lyquor so gathered, pour it into a vessell of the best Venice glas: for it is daunger leaste the commun glas shuld be eaten through of it, for it consumeth and eteth like Aqua fortis, This liquor that practicioner x] to cloke the thing, called it oyl of philosophers, the philosophers stone, and ye leper: he said siluer wolde be dissolued in it, if it were put into it pure and thin made in a plate, likewise coyns of siluer: notwithstanding found after his deathe hole peces of siluer.
heare that it chaunced him that an earthen bely claue a sonder once: wherfor a man muste prouide, that one maye be had of the best erth, from Haganovv perauenture, or Colen or Acon: for there men saye the best and strongest xx] car then pots of al are made.
He affirmed more ouer that this liquor did graue in the vessel it was kepte in.
He had gotten the waye howe to make it first of a certain goldsmith.
Of the burninge or broylinge of Chalcanthum, that is Vitriol, and his kindes.
Bulcasis, writeth in a maner the same things in his thirde boke of the preparacion of medicines, whiche we haue declared afoore in his preparacion for the makinge of Vitriol Zimor, also he teacheth to xxx] prepare after the same maner.
But emongst diuers wayes of this oyl of Vitriol, lyke that best which described last.
For the liquor that is destilled that way is the sharpest of all, and also the tartest, in so muche that it may be called vinegar of metal, as me thinketh: Wherfore of certain it is highly commended for the quenshing of thirst in somer tyme, one drop of it put into a draught of wyne, lyke as found in a certain doutch writte~ booke, where as this also is added: Vitriolum is x] destilled in a bely laid ouerthwart, fensed wt clay, in the flames of the fyer, it runneth out skant the third day, and first water.
Stiep Vi+triol in Aqua fortis, whiche may drawe out all the fatnes therof, from the which if thou separate the Aqua fortis by destillacion, an oyll shall remaine.
But perauentur this way is to daungerous that a liquor so destilled should be receiued within the body.
But without the body and to the wheeles or xx] cankar of the mouth it may well be ministred.
remember haue red in sum place in Lulli{us} in his worke of Quintessence, where he maketh me~+cion of oyl or Quintessence of Vitriol.
But in what sort it should be made, could neuer yet fynde in any booke that went abrode: so greatly haue they all kept secret this thing as a marueylous mystery.
For the description whiche will declare here after out of the boke of Nicolas Massa vpon the disease of Naples, can not be receiued within ye body. xxx] When the Chalcanthum, that is the Vitriol, or Mysis that is Vitriol of Rome is brent an oyll moste sharp hoat is drawen out of it by the force of the fyre, in vessels of glas wherwith if a man touche wartes when they ar cut or wounded, they will go away.
The same if a ma~ tast it, it striketh the tong lyke as it were a hoat iron.
Yet the vse of it is to dry byles within that be out of hoope of recouery, wher as thei be not much filthy, as it chau~+ceth in certain that be diseased of Phthoe corrupcion matter without grief.
It serueth also to cut x] of cancars corrupt members, with the wood Oliue anoynted with it, Cardanus.
The same coniectur we wryte before, that oyl of Mysis or arsnick anoynted without may seme to deliuer fro~ poyso~.
The spirit or Quintesseuce of Vitriol is praysed of certain practicioners against the falling sicknes and Apoplexia or benumming of sences.
Shomakers inck lowseth the bely, both in hony and meed drunck to the weight of a dram, also in wyne, specially the oyll therof.
George Agricola, xx] in his .iii. boke of the nature of things digd out of the ground.
Oyl of Vitriol doth kill not only men but tries: wherfor it must be made in sum out syd or place where no man dwelleth.
Albucasis other shew the way of making it, Brassauolus (In myne opinion not the oyl, but ye smoke of Vitriol whyles it is brent with fier prepared vnto destillacio~ is so hurtful.)
And again, of Chalcanthu~, yt is vitriol oyl is made so burning, that we vse it for pote~tiall fyer: for it is of a caustical, yu is a burning nature, xxx] with litle grief it cutteth members, if they be touched with a knief anoited with Oliues.
Whyles ye oylis preparing, ye must take hede of the smoke: bycause it doth not only kyl men but also the tries that be nye, it drieth the~ vp.
The tryal wherof Fra~+ciscus de Mo~te the notable bone setter whose tries of his archard euery one died wt the smoke of Vitriol whyles he prepared the oyll therof.
The oyl of Vitriol is maruelous, burning lyke a hoat iro~ without grief, is made in this maner, xxx. vnces of Vitriol of Rome or of Cypres, Salni+trum, x] roche Alum, of ether .iiii. vnces.
When they are all beten let them be calcionated with fier according to arte.
Afterward put this calcionated in a croked Bocia clayed for the fier of an alchymists fornace, and by the fier thou shalt haue the oyl incresed in the receiuer: which is a marueilous Cau+terium or burning thing, and hath no pere in any operacion, and chiefly in takyng away of wens great wartes.
But the receiuer must be great, if thou wilt make the forsaid oyl: Nicolas Massa in xx] his boke of the disease Naples, and Thomas Philologus, who taketh .xx. drames of Vitriol, but of Alum and salt of ether. water of diuers metals (out of a certain dutch boke) for the leprosi, spots dunnes of the eies.
The filing of siluer coper, stiele, gould, of euerye one as muche as ye can get: the first daye put it in vryn whyles it is warm made by a boy or wenche that is a maide, the next day in the crums of hoat bread: the third in a whyte of an egge: the fourth in the milke of a xxx] woman yt nurseth a wenche: the fift in reed wyne.
Then put all thies into a still destill them with a litle fyer, and kipe it.
It is good against the leprosy, and al the spots in the face, and it procureth vnto the face a youthfull brightnes, it maketh also cleernes of ye sight thies shalt thou reed otherwyse in the Addicions vpon the Breuiarium or Bridgment of Ar+nold de Villa Nona.
Of Aqua fortis and such lyke. x] described a litle before a certain water lyke Aqua fortis, destilled of Vitriol, Sal Nitrum, and Alum against greate wartes. &c.
But the commun Aqua fortis also, and the simple oyl of Vitriol, if a man put a drop of them in to a wen or warte first cut, they take it away: of the whiche thing made a tryall in my self vpon a sied wart on my fyngars ende, wherinto when had first cut it with a razer, xx] put a drop of Aqua fortis, and although it we~t not away by by, yet within a few wekes is was gon Aqua fortis or to separate metalles is thus made.
One part of Sal nitrum, liquid or molten Alum (that they call roche .iii. partes: sand half a parte, when they are dryed diligently and purged with the fyer, let them be destilled in a vessell of glas.
It is gathered by it selfe, that whiche issueth out first, at length when the glas looketh lyke a safro~ colour, encrease the fyre and an other foloweth: xxx] whiche is receiued in the first for the moste parte: and yet if thou take it in water of the fountain or well, it is yet so sharpe that neuer the les it dissolueth siluer, and separateth it from Goulde.
Take a litle quantity of ye water drawn out, and put into it the weight of. grains of very pure siluer· and set it vpo~ ashes til the siluer be dissolued.
This shall send down into the bottom of the vessell, groundes like vnto fine lime, which taken awaye the pure water that remaineth, put it to the hole water from the which x] thou druest it, which in like maner shal it self also let down into the bottom groundes like the other, which taken away, thou shalt haue the hole water most pure and most strong to dissolue syluer and other metals except gould (gould also suppose is dissolued of Chymists with Aqua fortis but of another maner of making.)
But seing it va+nisheth away easili and consumeth, it shalbe kept in a glas diligentlye shut.
To a man that imagineth how great strengthes it hath, which takinge xx] water (as said) of the wel, yea withoute fyre in xxiiii. hours doth bring siluer vnto water, but wt a little heate of ashes, in .ii. or .iii. houres, there is no man but he wil graunt those last vapors, and water wherunto they be tourned to haue maruelous strength, or rather increadible.
Of the same kind is water that is made of the salts Ammoniak and Nitrum, with Chalcanthum (yt is coproos) and Alum molten in equal porcions, putting vnto them at last one fourth part of roust: this made xxx] after the same maner, spareth not very stones.
It yet a man ad and put to a litle of the obstracite stone, called Smiris wherwith they polishe precious stones, thou shalt haue more plenty of water and better, because it wil not bee burned.
Theese things therfor receiued and found true by trials, let vs see what shoulde be cause that this water becommeth so strong: for manifest experience techeth, that the drier part attenuated and fined by the force of the fire, receiueth a firye and a fretting or gnawing strength.
But why burneth not x] the water of separatinge, as burnyng water dothe? Because that the burninge water is hotter and thinner, and les drye, therefore it maye bren, and excellentlye heaten, but not freate.
But the other can freat, not burne, and also heaten a little.
By like reason therfore the oyl that is take~ out of Chalcanthum by the force of the fire, for as muche as it turneth the driest part into humor, it is most sharpe, and striketh the tounge like fire.
Let no manne thinke that this liquor perteineth xx] only to Chymists and goldsmithes.
For it is profitable also for medicines vnto mans body.
It is dropped into warts that be cut and slit, as said afore.
Some dip the end of a little band in it and put it into a hollow touth, from which they wolde take the sence feling of the grefe and mortify it.

LEt vs ad here certain massy and hooll medicines, which also be sublimated or sod in glas vessels at the fyre, although it be almoste besydes our matter, when as we purposed to entreat only in this boke, ofliquors separated from a grosser substaunce.
Yet because they be a few medicines and sublimated (that is they are prepared and made with lyke in x] strumentes as the forsaid liquors) and hetherto for the most part secret, yt is knowen vsed of few, maruelous effectuous, thought not good to let them pas.
Quick siluer precipitated is thus made, as Car. wryteth in his fift boke of Subtiltie.
Take Alum, Calcanthum (that is coproos) of ether lyke much: put therto salt as much as one of them half as muche, destil this together in glas vessels.

At length breake the vessell, gather the quick siluer, whiche thou shalt se now gathered to gether lyke a stone, grynd this very small vpon a table of red marble, sieth it again destil it til it be dryed in a glasen vessel.
Again breake ye vessel gather the matter yt remaineth, grinde the same again vpon ye moler very fine subtil.

Nicolas Massa in his booke of the Frenche disease, calleth Mercurium praecipitatum, Angelicall pouder, because of the marueilous as it were a diuine operacion of it in the Fre~ch pockes, which he his selfe hath not seldom tryed.
This medicin (saith he) dryeth, with a certain gentle eating of the soft and superfluous fleshe, and that withoute grief, remouing also the euill secret qualitie of the soores, and chiefly of the disease of Naples.
It digesteth any matter, and purgeth it, letteth the x] disease called Corrosio of gnawyng the canker: it dissolueth groos matter, hard and rawe, after ye opening of gummes.
And no medicine is to be co~pared with this in this disease.
For if thou continew in the vse of it, it leadeth vnto the perfect breding of the skin, as haue oftentimes tryed: and it is excellent in the euill sores of the yard.
But a pound of quick siluer in a litle bely of glas, and power as muche Aqua fortis vnto it.
Then put the bely in a pot and ashes in xx] space betwene the bely and the pot sydes, that the pot breake not assone as it toucheth the fyer.
The~ put vnder fyer, slow at the first, and let it be encre+sed by lytle and litle, yet after a certain mean: and so with a strong fyer let it be left, till all the water be consumed, whiche is perceiued when no more vapours ascend out of ye bely.
Grynde this, if any parte of the quick siluer remaine with it, put the said pouder in a cleen vessell of bras at the fyer, xxx] so mixt it, let it stande till all the part of quick siluer be consumed.
This pouder maist thou vse to all the forsaid diseases and specially to the sores of the yard, of other places, wher rottennes and much il matter letteth the knitting or heling vp: and in fistulaes dissolue it with wine, and cast it in by a brasen pipe, for it worketh meruelously.

This water is meruelous to put away wartes, in what parte of the body so euer they be, and specially in the fou~dament and wombe: it brenneth and searreth also euil sores eating them out euery where, yea euen in the throte, and letteth the sores from crieping and spreading, namelye of the yarde and the wombe.
If it be to vehement, mixte it with Roose water.
And my selfe haue healed ill sores and xx] biles of the throte, touching them twise a dai with the saide water, mixtinge with it half so muche of Rosewater: and it is one of our secreates (se more in the same, the .vi. boke and .ii. chapter.)
But this angelicall pouder had of a certaine olde Alcumist, and made it before Iohannes de Vigo euer made anye mencion of it.
Of the making and commodities of this redde pouder, read Iohannes de Vigo in his fifte boke of xxx] Additionum: where he biddeth that the vessels rereceiuer shall be thrise as bigge as the bealye, the xxxviii. leafe. b.
And that white found with thys pouder, is siluer sublimated from the redde: like as is what so euer is yelowe or of a Saffron coloure.
Pouder of Mercury (saithe Matthaeolus Senensis, in his booke of the waye to heale the Frenche disease) is made in this maner.
Take .iiii. pou~ds of water, wherewith gould is seperated from siluer: x] a pound and a half of quick siluer.
Put these in a vessel of glas, with a narow mouthe, wyth a croked nek, round about fensed with clay, which shalbe receiued of an other: the~ stop the ioynts of the vessels with potters clay diligently.
The~ put vnderfire made of coles, so that it may euer wax bigger and bigger, so long till all the water haue run out.
After this breake the phial, and take out lightly the red cake, that setleth in the bottome, what white so euer sticks in it cast it away, but ye xx] red make it in pouder.
But for asmuch as throughe this pouder much harm might happen to the~ shuld receiue it, except it be duely prepared.
Take ii. ounces of the said pouder, and let them sta~d to soke in water of Plantaine and Acetosae, of ether ii. ounces, the next morow early take the waters from thence and put new vnto it, and set it to the fire in a vessel of bras or erth: when they are hot, cease not to stur them aboute with an iron or woden spattle or vntil al becom pouder and that xxx] withoute anye difficultie: of the which thou maist when thou list make such a recept against ye frenche disease aswel that is Flegmatike as Melancoly.

Shortly, beleue me, shal the french pocks be auoided with this receit.
For the fleum and blak choler also shal vanish away bothe by vomit and downwardes.
Besides this there are very many kinds of diseases that we haue cured with such a pouder.
For it puts not awaye onlye matter and rotten flesh being strawed vppon, but also wythout xx] any difficultie it bringeth sores biles vnto a skar: the pestilence also with a little Triacle, and with the iuice of the hearbe called Tuneci, whiche they call Carduum Benedictum, or wt an electuarye of precious stones, if it be not yet confirmed stablished in the bodye, it driueth it away meruelouslye.
Manye also that bee Limphatici, that is, mad, or Melancolike, whome they beleued commonly to be resorted vnto of Deuils, we haue cured them with ye same.
What make mani words xxx] We haue deliuered with this pouder, those yt wer almost dead of the quartain, putting vnto it Saccharum Buglossatum or triacle, or Mithridatium, som digestion made, an hour before the fit, in .v. or vii. grains weight, according to the age and stre~ght of the body of the diseased.
Yea also it is holso~ to be ministred amongst the griefes of the yard great guts: for we haue cured some that auoyded their dung by their mouth: leaninge to the moniments and sayings of Paulus Aegineta, that saith, how certain phisitio~s haue ministred in that disease x] of the great guttes, quicke siluer killed.
The same resisteth the taking, as they cal it, or incha~tment: It hath besides this many notable vertues which when haue more leisure, wil rehearse vnto thee (he speketh to him yt talketh with him) one by one: perauenture then it shall delite me to expres, in what sorte thou maist make pouder wt gould and quicke siluer, or els the water declared before.
hare of late that a certain phisicion or chymist at Athesin, did prepare Mercurium xx] praecipitatum with gould, and sold it like gold, which had suche vertue, to eat oute gnawinge or grief.
Se those that we shal declare about the end of those that folow next after.
How Praecipitatum is made, which is a remedy against all diseases growing of the rottennes of humors, out of a certain write~ boke. Make a water of equal porcions of Vitriol of Rome and Sal Nitrum, with a heade and receiuer, in the whiche thou shalt put the of the weighte of rawe xxx] Mercury, yt is to say, if ther be.
pou~ds of Vitriol and Sal nitrum, put .vi. vnces of Mercury.
Afterward suffer the water with his spirites to descend in to the receiuer.
Then auoyde all that is in the receiuer into a clean bely and that is claied: vnder the whiche put a head with a receiuer, and destill it again: and whe~ the water is in the receiuer, put it againe in the bely in the whiche the Mercury remained.
Then when it is red washe it with Cordiall waters, as Borage Balme and such lyke. x] But first washe it often tymes in fountain water or well water destilled.
Mercury so prepared shalt thou giue to sick men within their bodies, in this maner.
If the body be very strong, giue .x. grains if it be mean .viii. weakes, fiue: if it be a chyld, co~sider diligently what is necessary to be done.
But vtterly mixt it with triacle: so shalt thou giue it to him that is infected with poyson, droysy, pestile~ce or taken with other infirmitie.
If a sounde man once a yeare, or euery third yeare, as it shall seme xx] him good, vse this Praecipitatum with a dew digestion of the humors, that is with a preparacion of purgacion, he shall preuent many diseases.
Note that in the stede of Mercury thou mayst vse Amal gama made of six partes of quick siluer and of one part of gold and so shalt thou worke greatter wo~ders.
(This Amalgama must be made red lyke as Mercury alone with Aqua fortis: although Mattheolus Senensis, as we declared a litle before, wry teth that the pouder Mercurial may bee made of xxx] such a mixture, yee and that without Aqua fortis.)
And marke that thou maist heale woundes with the first or second Praecipitatum, whiche thou shalt vse thus: Put of it about the wound and within.
And know that in .iiii. destillacions thou shalt bring this to pas: whiche doone, put it in a cleane bely in the fyer, that the spirites (that is of the Hydrargyri that is the quick siluer sublimated mixt with the Praecipitatum) as muche as is possible may departe, then make as is aboue specified.
x] Of the sublimacion of quick siluer, thou shalt read Bulcasis in his thirde booke of his worke that he calleth Seruitor.
But of the vse of it in burninges and seerynges, and for the French diseas, reade Nicolaus Massa the sixte booke, the seconde chapter, and of the same booke the fourth, howe it is to be ordered to seerynges, both otherwyse, and that the seeryng or burning be done with none or litle grief.
Certain vse it at this day for the ill and angry skabes, and ring wormes or tettares. &c. xx] aswell in men as in horses.
Put Quick siluer and Shomakers inck of ether lyke weyght, and with moste sharpe whyte vynegar mixt it so long, till the quick siluer be seen no more: then in a vessel of glas parieted with clay sieth it till it growe together.
If any doe run abrode cum not together, break it again in a morter with vinegar put to it, and sieth it yet again.
Thei vse quick siluer so excoct for painting xxx] For it whytteneth and addeth a brightnes to wemens faces.
But it maketh the tieth fall out and briedeth a stinking breth.

Arsnick or Orpment (sayeth Albertns Magnus in his booke of Metalles) is of the kynde of Stones, of a Citriny colour and reed, the which stone the chymici call one of the spirites.
It hath the nature of Brymstone in heating and drying.
Being calcinated with the fyer it waxeth black, and by and by with sublimation it becummeth mooste whyte.
If it be sublimated three or foure tymes it purchaseth suche strengthe, that it wyll xx] peers through Bras, and burne vehemently all metalles except Gould.
Being set in the ayre it altereth and chaungeth the same Bras in to a whyte colour.
Wherfore Falsifiers vse it, to make Bras lyke Syluer: in whiche thyng it is able to do very muche.

But a man must haue a great consideracion and take diligent hede to the places nye about, whyles it is ministred and laid x] to, leest that they themselues chaunce to be vexed and assayled with any inflammacion or swelling, and concurs of the humors.
Whiche discommoditie thou shalt easely auoyde, if so be it thou anoynt those partes that be ny, and compas the Carcynoma or eating cankar, with Bol Armena, and other lyke.

certain practicioner told me that he did dres and prepare the stoone called Cyanence, that is, Lazulus in such wise, that it might bring vp more stronglye and more safely black choler from melancholy men and those that were mad.
And first if remember me well he saide it must be calcionated, then sublimated: or first that the best Aqua vitae shoulde be destilled vppon it, putte in a Cucurbita or bellye, then sublimated, and be sprinckled or watered with Aqua vitae. vi. times destilled, x] and dried again.
Salt that it may be more pure to be put to medicines or meates, after it is mixt with water let it be destilled by a Filtrum, and again let it be sod till the water be consumed.

Wherfore they vse it only to courser workes, but to finer they vse only Borax.
Ther be so~e that mixt Borax, commun salt molten and salt Alcalis together in equall porcions, and in secreate matters count it for Borax.
But these are besides the matters perteining to phisick. xxx] Soot how it is gathered of pitche and butter, thou shalt read in Dioscorides and Bulcasis.
Of certaine other not Alchymisticall or not destilled or sublimated medicines, but cunninglye and wittilye prepared by other and diuers wayes.
THe medicins that we haue hitherto described are all comprehended vnder the name of lyquors x] because they haue no earthy matter mixte with them, but they are ether of a watry, or aiery, or fiery nature, whether so euer they be waters or oyls, or any third kind of liquor.
Al are prepared in certain Alchymical vessels and by the force of the fire.
But for as much as their scope and ende (that is to the intent that the best and chiefe in euery medicin, might be had drawn out, pure and liquid from the earthye, grose and more impure matter) semeth to be more large, and to be extended xx] also to manye other preparations, makinges and composicions of medicines: thinck it good to ioyne certaine thinges hereunto in manner of a Corollarium or addicion whiche are not verye common, nor to be met with euery where.
But no man ought to looke heare for a full or exacte and generall way of composition at our hands: when as we shal teache only a fewe, and suche as shall come to minde by the waye, and all theese as it were by matters besides oure necessary purpose.

Se the moste part of odoriferous and precious oils to be sod in a double vessel It is an easy matter to pres oute an oyl that shalbe like the plant in sauor x] vertues, in those that contein oyl abounda~tly: (or out of the frutes of them sod in water it is gathered.)
But in such as haue no great plenty of oyle, we are wont to pres oute the sauor and strengthe with the oyl .iii. waies.
In the more common and moore aunciente waye, of Dioscorides the flours were poured into pure oyl .iiii. dais, were set out in the sun, then the oyl being prest out, moste diligently, as muche more of the new flours was added, and again it was set oute in the hot Sunne, xx] so oft might a man do so, til the oyl did drink vp the sauour.
They did ad also thicknings for oyntmentes, as of hony and odoriferous thynges.
The second way it standeth in pressinge oute, in som thinges without any help of Art, as Myrobalano, in other that be dry and odoriferous by their own accord, as the Nutmeg, that is light stiept in wine and pres out with a pres.
But they that be odoriferous, and lack the substaunce of oyles, as flours, xxx] they geue oyle in thys sorte.
Sprynkle Flowers vppon Almondes and vnder them, and lay in order the leaues of Almondes and of the flours by course, and kepe them so longe prest together, till the smel of the floures maye be vanished awaye, then put them away and in their steede laye other flours after the same sorte, and do this so ofte (for there is not one way in all) till the Almonds haue gotten a verye great smell, then haue them to the pres.
man must firste blaunch them and parch them a little at the fyre.
By this meanes the oyle x] getteth the more strengthe and vertue, and is les in daunger of corruption, because no (waterye) iuice is left in it.
The third way is by destillacion (whereof it is said afore.)
Vnto the most parte of oyles that be to be sod and made by fire, they put some wine, by the whiche meanes they smell les of adustion bre~tnes, they be sod til the wine be consumed.
But flowers and suche as be of a sclender substaunce, it is xx] better they shoulde not be sodde in oyle, or at the leaste not to boyle in it. &c.

Som be stiepte firste in wine, and then the iuice prest out is added to the oyle, is sod together, ether by it self, or with a part of Turpentin: as thei do in oyl of Hyperico~ or S. Ihons wurt.
Iasminum is made of .ii. ounces of flours of Ias+min xxx] sette in the Sunne .v. dayes in a pounde of oyl, whiche afterward is sod with a slow fyer.

But thou shalt reed diuers wayes in Mesue, and in the annotacions of Syluius vpon the same, of the pressing out of oyll of Almondes, whiche also may be applyed to diuers other fruites and siedes from the whiche oyll is prest out.
We vse the oyll of Almondes am. (that is bitter) in stede of oyll of ye x] kirnelles of peeches, but it dryeth vp moore then the other, Brassauolus.
am wont to make an oyll of siedes and the reed codes of Capsicum, or Cardamomu~ Arabicu~: other of the codes therof alone, put in oyll, whiche is wont to be vsed in place of oyll of Peper, or also of Euphorbium, if it be put in in more abundance, for it is far more vehement then Peper.
With vs (they call it reed Peper, sum of the co~mun people call it Siliquastrum, but not ryghtly) but fewe of xx] those silique or codes do wax rype, bycause of the hasty coold of haruest.
But vnrype codes also, ha~ged in stoues a few daies and dried, may well be put vnto oyll.
For they haue sharpnes inough: whiche is not to be found in the hool pla~t besydes, when as the leest heares or stringes are without any taste, and the leeues and stem are vnsauery: but in the codes is so excelle~t a tast, that it is worthy to be wondred at.
Sum bycause of the vehement heat therof reken it almost emo~gst poysons, xxx] as Cardan: whiche prayse not.
Nether was euer any man said that fyer was venemous, burn it neuer so much: when it hath no venemous qua+litie besydes.
haue my self vsed both the siedes of this Capsicum and the codes, without harm in potage but in a small quantitie.
An oyl of the kirnels of cheries clenseth ye face, taketh away spottes and frakenes: it is good also for the gout, and the stone of the reynes bladder.
Let the hay be set on x] fyer and quenched: and after let it be layde vpon cooles, and when it is resolued into smoock, lay an iron place vpon it and a certain vnctuositie or fatnes shall cleue vnto it, whiche is called oyll of hay.
This oyll with a fether is anoynted vpon ring wormes and tetters: Rogerius.
Oyl of whete is made betwene two iron plates moderatly made hoat (or as Rasis hath, between a marble and a thick plate of iron,) but muche better as heare, by destillacion: it is commended xx] against the ruggednes of the skinne and ringwormes: Furnerius and other.
Sum say also that it is good for fistulas, the chames or chinkes of the skin: Mat.
Oyll of Iuy beries, drawen out lyke as out of Bay beries, is good against the gout of a could cause, or of obstructio~ or stopping: and it restoreth the astonied me~bers take~ with the palsy.
Thre vnces of the tops of Hypericon are in xxx] fused .iii. daies in odoriferous wyn as much as is sufficient, afterward sieth it in a double vessel wel stopt, and pres it out strongly.
Lykewyse stiep new Hypericon, sieth it and presse it, put to it .iii. vnces of Turpintyn, six vnces of old oyll, a scrupull of Saffron.
This oyll (saith Syluius) no man knoweth who was the author of it: Yet Galen wryteth that Tart or harsch wyne, wherin the leeues of Androsaenni or Ascyri (whiche are kyndes of Hypericon) are solde, doth cloose great woundes: and as sum x] thinke, Hypericon hoat, dry and of subtill partes, is holsome for them to drynke that be diseased wt ache in the hippes or Sciatica.
Of the whiche, the vertues of other mixt heer, thou maiest gather, whiche oyl strengtheneth, digesteth and sclendereth.
Sum (saith he) put simpely the flowers into a glased vessell, the oyl may be gotten out by it self wt the strength xx] of ye sun: other dig it vnder ye ground, other make it by infusing, ether of the flowers alone, or other mo thinges mixt with it, (as we haue declared al+redy out of the wordes of Syl.
Thus prepared in a glased or glas vessell, they keepe it.
But thies thinges are cleerly expounded of Mesue newer authors.
Sum put to it wormes or bowels of the earth, and let it stande a moneth or more in a wine cellar in a pot stopt with clay or past, the~ they sieth it by litle litle in same about xxx] ten houres, they strein it through a bag pres it.
The colour of the oyl is almost red, the tast is sumwhat sour.
The vse of it is for woundes, prickinges and all kyndes of offensions and the swellinges that cum therupon.
Sum vse them to the greuous soores of the legges.
An other co~position of oyl of Hypericon, which healeth any wound great or small within .xxiiii. houres, out of a certain boke imprinted in french without an author.
handfull of Hypericon: Co~mun x] oyll two poundes, a pound of Axungia, that is swynes grees, clarified streined.
Cut all small and fyne and mixt them in a great phiall of glas, whiche when thou hast stopt diligently with wax and otherwyse, set it in dong two foot diep or more, in a place that the morning sun beemes and euening may cum to it.
At the length when the yeare is gone about, take out the phial, in the whiche thou shalt fynde an oyll lyke xx] vnto Balm.
That must ye vse as hoat as may be suffered.
An oyll is made also of Iuniper beries, by expression, as of other siedes.
An oyll of the beries of Bayes and Iuniper, stept in wyne, is beate~ out with a miln, wery profitable for the~ that haue griefe in the hukle boon, and colde diseases of the ioyntes: Iac. Hollerius.
The beries of Baies grene and beten, let them be sod in oyl and streined.
Beat the rype beries of Baies with ye leues, sieth them and strain them.
Otherwise, set the beries beaten in wine, and when they are stiept .iii. daies, let them be prest out in a pres.
Or els fresh and ripe beaten, let the~ be put in a sak, and the oyl drawn out.
It is holsome againste the colick, the disease of the great guts the Sciatica: Rogerius.
Oyl out of the Myrepsical Nutte, prest with an Anuil and a redde hotte iron is gotten oute.
Oyles to asswage griefes are made of certain x] herbs brused together and sod in oyl, as of Calen dulae (Mary goldes) Rosemary, Maioram and other.
Cut them in smalpeces, and when they haue stand .iii. dais infused in Malm sye, drye them in the shadow .ii. daies, then warm them moderatly in a fryinge pan: and thou shalt sprinkle them in the meane season with Rosewater, and pres them out in a pres Cardan.
hear say som do not stiep them in wine, but xx] pres the very nuts alone beate~ and heated.
my self made of late verye good in this wise, beinge taught of a certain French man.
put in a glas about .v. ounces of Nutmegs somwhat grose beten, for the space of one nighte in wine so that the wine was higher by a finger bredthe.
The nexte day shut ye matter in a sack of linnen, bound at the end, that they could not fal out: The~ bound euery wher with thred that they shuld not com all together on a hepe.
But the matter must firste be xxx] warmed in a skellet, not to much, but as much as a finger may suffer, and so put in a litle bag must they be by by tied, and pressed in a little presse of wod, with a litle lake or gutter of wod, hauing a spout enclining downward, the litle bag put ther in. &c.
They yeilde for the most part, the .viii. part of the weight of the nuts, so that one ounce of the nuts geue a dram of oyl, if the nuts be sufficie~tly moystie.
man may warm ye same matter again pres it as before: but the second time yeldeth very litle oyl and not so good.
It is better therfor to x] leaue this matter and to dry it in the bag: whiche when nede shalbe may be laid to the stomak, or to the mouthe thereof.
This oyle lately prest oute is somwhat thick, and separated as though it were by Hilloks, al which must be diligently gathered out of the wine, and the wine streined from them with a linnen cloth, they be brought into one mas and lump, pressing and wringing it with your fin gers to the dish side wherinto the matter is crusht out, that al the wine may be most diligently seperated. xx] The substaunce and the coloure appeareth like waxe.
The mountenance of a pease annoynted vpon the mouth of the stomack, dothe meruelously stre~gthen it.
here say som vse the anoynting of it to the sturring vp of their luste.
Beinge swalowed, it heateth moderatly the stomack, and maketh swiet breth.
here more ouer that som sieth the nuts beaten a while (I can not tell whether in wine or in water) and gather the fattines that swimmeth aboue.
remember also yt saw xxx] once an iron instrument like a pair of tonges, the two extreme irons or ends wherof, consisted of. hollow half spheres, so that when they wer prest together they might hold a Nutmegge, or a little les, as occasion of the pressing serued.
The one of the half spheres was bored throughe with .iiii. or v. little holes, that the oyl might run out, whe~ the ends of the tonges moderatly made hot wer prest together.
Thre ounces of Malmesy, wherewith the Nutmegs x] (somwhat grose beaten) may be sprinckled.
Put to half a pounde of commun oyle elect: when they are all mixte together, let them be prest cunninglye in a pres.
But my waye, whyche described afore and tried my selfe, liketh me moore then the other.
It is made ether with oyl and ripe Roses, or bothe of them vnripe, or the one ripe, thother vnripe and so ther is .iiii. diuers waies.
Som in stead of xx] commun oyle take oyl of Almondes.
Take a pound of co~mun oil washed, wherin thou shalt put the fourthe parte of Grene Rooses in a glased vessell (of glas rather) which thou shalt set in the sun for the space of .iii. daies (ye .xl. as Aegi neta hath).
The second: Take oyl and Roses as before, and hang the vessell in a well so that it maye be touched of the water: xxx] and after .ii. monethes take it oute, straine it and kepe it.
The third: Oyl and Roses as before, put them in a glas anoynted within with honye, which stopt thou shalt let it diep in ye erth, wher it shall not be touched nether with water nor other moisture.
This oyl wilbe better smellinge then the other: These writeth Rasis oute of Aegineta as it appeareth.
Aegineta biddeth in the xx. chap. of the seuenth boke, vnto a Sextarium or wine pint of oyl Omphacinum (made of oliues not fully ripe) to put .iii. ounces of red Roses the nails x] taken awai, and for the space of .xxiiii. hours laid out in the air, then the oyl to be set .xl. daies wtout dores in the sun, not vpon the ground, but vpon a borde.
First that fresh and new red roses be set in the sun .vii. daies, then let them be sod in a double vessel .iii. houres: then (the Rose leaues wronge oute) let other be put in, and let them be set in the sun and sod as before.
Which whe~ thou hast done thrise, put to the oyl water of infusion of Rooses, xx] yt is wherin Rooses likewise haue sta~ded, (which he saithe, we haue prescribed in the chapter of syrrups,) as it were the fourth of the oyl (that is, the fourth part, as the Munkes haue it.
Syluius tra~slateth it, as much as the oyl is, which like not so well.)
So when it is set in the sunne .xl. daies, straine it and sette it longe againe in the Sunne.
The second, mixting with the oyl washt the iuyce of Roses, and the water of their infusion, and the leaues beaten together: then setting it in the sun xxx] and chaunginge it as before.
The thirde, that with swiet Almondes blaunshed, exactly beaten in a morter, leaues of Roses be beaten again, the~ make them in litle lumpes or caakes, and keepe them in a hoat aire .xxiiii. houres.
Then beate the~ again and kneed them in the morter very exactly, pouring vnto it a litle hoat water of infusion of Roses.
At length prees out the oyll with a presse, put in a glas couered set it to su~.
The fourth, it be made with Sesamum blaunshed after the same maner as with Almondes.
But Almondes are x] more mete for vnrype Rooses: Sesama for rype.
The first composition (saith he) of the .iiii. now rehersed, is vsed of many: but of the Parisians, the composition of Nicolas, whiche shalbe declared in his Antidotary.
And againe, heare that oyll of Roses is is made moste odoriferous, by putrifying the roses one moneth in dung in a vessell well stopt.
After the same maner of commun Mastick, and Roses incarnate and Muske Roses and suche lyke, xx] doubt not but it may be made most odoriferous without the mixture of any oyll.
Sieth Roses, Wormwod, or any other odoriferous herb in water with the fourth part of oyl, til all the water be consumed, and the oyll shall haue the strengthes and vertues of the herbes.
So shalt thou make oyll out of hand of any thing.
There be sum that when the Rooses are beeten, and sod in only water, say there swimmeth a certain fat foom, whiche may be streined or gathered xxx] with a fether.
An other certain man told me, that the leaues of Roses new should be sod in water til they be thick as hony almost, then crusht with a spoon, that the oyll or foom may enter in to it: but sum water wilbe mixt also with it, wherfore when it is gathered in a glas, it is set in the sun ye oyl swiming aboue in ye top is separated.
Oyll of the flowers of Elder purgeth and maketh smouth the skin, strengtheneth the sinewes, and helpeth the griefes of them.
Oyl of Spick moste holsome for the~ that haue x] the gout in their fiet, whiche a certain physicion of late did co~municate.
Fill a glas with the flowers of Spick nard dryed in the sun, and power vpon the~ oyl of Oliues, so that it be higher by a fingar bredth.
When it hath stande .iii. daies in the sun, make it boyll in a kettell six or seuen waues and streine it with migth: then put in other flowers dried, set them in the sun .xvi. daies or more.
So shalt thou haue (saith he) an oyl to put away peyn or grief wurth gould, as haue tried with often xx] experience.
Lay linnen cloothes moystened in it vnto the grief, it misseth very seldo~, yea although a man do not consider the humor offending.
See more in the Antidotary of Arnold de Villa noua.
Oyll of the flowers of Verbascum is made, by settin them in the sun in a glas (as also of the flowers of Rosemary) moste co~mended praysed for the gout of the fiet of other griefs, specially hoat.
Oyl of violets is made as oyll of Roses, but of grien or oyll of Almondes or Sasamin: Mesue. xxx] Paulus Aegineta maketh this oyll of purple Violeth or Leucoio that is yelowe: or he setteth them in the sun couering the vessell exactly that it breth not through, only ten daies, the Violettes in the meane season thrys chaunged, and at lengthe he addeth dry Violettes.
Of oyll of Tartarum, that is the dry Lies of wyne.
OYll of Tartarum deuysed by Peter Argil x] lata, serueth to clense the face and to smouth it.
Tartarum cleauing to the sydes of the vessell, whyte rather then red made into pouder, is stept in vinegar, after it is folded in a linnen cloothe, then lette it be put in Tow moystened with water vnder the ashes: after that let it be laid in a dish hielding towad the one syde .iii. daies: then shall a certaine humor sumwhat red destill.
Nicolas way to make oyl of Tartarum cleaning xx] to the sydes of the vessels.
Take that Tartaru~ that is of good wyne beaten, folded in a linnen cloth, moysten it well with strong whyte vynegar: sieth it vnder hoat ashes (burn it) til it wax black, beet it again, kepe it in a vessell lying on the one syde enclyned eight daies, in a cold place, til it be resol+ueed into oyl, whiche if it doo not, pres it out and kepe it.
It wer better, whe~ ye Tartaru~ is calcinated and put it in a Hippocras bagge, as they call it, xxx] let it be put in a dry place, till the oyll runne out into a vessel set vnder it.
fynd an other certain maner in Furnerius in a Frenche booke of decking, where as he biddeth to take Tartaru~ bur+ned and calcinated, as muche as can be taken at two handfulles and tied straite in a linnen clout to be burnt and calcinated in a furnace of Glas, Lyme or Brick: the~ to be powred into a good qua~titie of water with as muche Alum as a nut and to be muche sturred aboute: then when thou hast let rest .xxiiii. houres, streine this water (casting x] that away that remaineth in the linnen cloth) and sieth it in a skillet, till nothing els then a certayne whyte crust remaine. &c. (this place semeth to be mangled,) whiche (hanged in a litle bag) ny to the earth, within thre daies thou shalt see it turned in to liquor: whiche muste be a certain tymes strained til it becum cleer.
Sum put Tartarum to be calcinated in a newe pot in a potters ouen, and when the vesselles are all baked then take it out.
But thinke it should xx] be calcinated better moore purely in hoat ashes or cooles, as apples or wardens are wonte to bee rosted happing them also with cooles.
It shalbe inough burnt, when it shall appeare nowe whyte nor any more black, whe~ it is so burnt, they hang it in a litle bag with a sharp end lyke a spyr stieple tund vpsyde doun, the mouth or wyde end put in a clouen stick wherby it shall hang and be prest together, wt a phiall of glas set vnder with a tunnil.
Take equall porcions of Tantarum xxx] and Salnitrum pund, burne them in a larg pot: then grinde or breake them with a hotte iron and put them in a little bagge in a wine celer, that they may destill.
Beat Tartarum and Nitrum in equal parts, mixt them and burn them that the Nitrum maye be consumed.
The Tartarum that remayneth: put in a bladder (that is a glas like a bladder) hang it in hot water, and it shallbe streighte resolued into oyle.
Tartarum well washte from the dregs and verye wel dried shalt x] thou calcinat till it waxe white: Then when it is beaten and sifted, dissolue it with raine water destilled and made warme: when it is molten destill it by a Filtrum: then lette it gather into a Iellye: when it is so, calcinat it againe that it may waxe more white.
So at lengthe shalt thou hange it in a little bagge, as an Hippocras bagge in a moyst place: laye on some brode thinge for a couer, that no vncleane thinge fall into it, and setting a glased pot vnder it. xx] Some destill it in a lembeek of glas (that is to say in ashes) from whence a water runneth first, then the fire encreased by litle and little, the oyle.
It is good for all scabs and Ringwormes, it maketh the skin white, cleare youthlike.
haue sene it vsed to runninge soores of the head: to the which thinck that is better wher wt Nitrum is burned together.
It maketh coper also siluer white, and putteth away spots steins in linne~ clothes.
It is put to colours to make the~ xxx] more bright, as think, as they put to wrytinge inke, of the coloure of the bresill wode and other.
This (saith he) clenseth cloths and spots remaining after birth of a melancoly cause, purgeth the face.
Of oyls of the yelkes of egges, wormes, and Scorpions.
Put the yelks of egs in an iron kettel vpon the coles till x] they be burnt, and the oyl that drippeth out kepe it in a glas.
It is good for the greues of the tuel or fundament, and of the eares and teethe.
This oyl (saithe Mesues) is proued with much experience to purge the skin, to heale thorowly tetters, ringwormes and other faultes of the skin, to brede heare, to sores boyles and fistulaes.
Thirty eg yolkes or there about hard rosted, crummed with the handes, let them be parched in an earthen frying pan or skellet leaden wt xx] a moderate fire, sturring them with a wode~ spone or erthen, til they waxe red, and let the oyle be resolued from them, which being pressed yeld more then a sponeful.
Or the same yelkes harde rosted let them be broken vpon a moler, then let them be beaten into lumps, and prest out in a pres as we haue declared in oyle of Almondes, and an Oyle shall destil from them.
Or the same yelkes put in to a bealy with a lembecke let them be destilled by the force of the fire, as it shalbe said of oyl of Philosophers. xxx] These saith Mesues.
It taketh away meruelously the foulnes of the skin, and skars, specially that be left in burnte places, for the moste parte it smelleth somwhat strong, yet at the laste destilled by sublimacion, les.
Frye sodden yolkes of egges with a slow fyre made of coles in an iron skellet, continually sturringe them wyth an iron rodde, till they be well rosted, presse them x] oute in a stronge linnen clothe moystened in oyle of Almondes.
But it is better (saithe Syluius) to frye the yelkes rawe, and moue them continually with a spone, til they being rosted, and prest with a spone, geue an oyl in a vessel hielding, which put in a glas reserued good a greate while.
Oute of xx. yolkes thou shalt draw oute in .ii. houres .iiii. ounces or there about.
Matthaeolus wrytinge vpon Dioscorides, prayseth this oyl for the roughnes of ye skin, for ringwormes, xx] for cleftes of the lippes, handes, feete, and tuell: also for the griefes of sores, ioynts, and all sinewy places: to conclude for the griefes and sores of the eares.
Moreouer it is good (saith he) for places burnt with fire, and in the thin skins of the brain, it separateth the impared partes from ye hole meruelously, whiche not without my great honor and commendacion and profit of the sicke, haue often tried in Surgery.
In a wounde vpon the braine panne, poure in xxx] the oyl of egs, and it wil take away the griefe, as Abhomeron, Abynzoar teacheth, whiche we haue also tried with good succes: Marianus Sa~ctus.
An oyle for the sores or boyles of children .xvi. yolkes of egs sod: an vure of Mirrh .iiii. graines of black Helleborus, let them be mixte together wt an iron spone in an iron skellet set vpo~ a few coles, then pres the yelks, and get out the oyl, till it begin to be clere without skin: put yt oyl in a glas and kepe it for thine vse: anoynt the sores twise a day, and the scabs shall fall awaye by their owne x] accorde.
haue sene this oyl made .ii. waies: firste, frying the yelks in a frying pan til they wax red and yeild an oyl: secondly, siething them much lo~ger, til they appere blak, all the moisture gone oute of them: for at length they yelde an oyle fodenlye: which is separated with a spone remouing frying pan from the fire streightway, and pressing ye yolkes with the spone: this some men think to be xx] of greater vertue for places burnt with fyre: it semeth in dede to dry more.
This oyl maketh skars subtil, dissolueth Tetters and ringwormes: Rogerius.
But Brassauol{us} writeth that the Apothecaries do falsly attribute vnto this oyl the vertue to put away skars, to the intente they may get egges from folishe people.
Thou shalt reade more of the vertues thereof in the Antidotary of Arnold.
Some tie the yolckes so fried in a linnen cloth, and pres them in apres xxx] Oyll of wormes or bowels of the earth is commended for the asswaging of griefes, specially of the sinewes ioyntes, also if they cum of the fre~ch diseases.
It is made, the worms purged fro~ their earthy excrementes, ether by styping these excrementes through the fingars, or rather by letting them stande alyue in sum vessell where hay is, to crepe: then sod with a litle wyne in oyl and strayned: or set in the sun before thei be sod.
Sum sieth them in water and gather the fatnes that swymmeth x] aboue.
Sum get out the peth of biggar elder pypes somwhat strong, put the wormes into the~ powring in also oyl: and so stopt, they let them stande in a furnace for the space of halfe an houre: then they take away the oyl and kepe it.
Oyl of Scorpions (saith Mesues) breaketh the stone of the reines and bladdar, and expelleth it, being anoynted vpon the loynes, the priuy partes where heer is, and betwien the tuel beneath the xx] beginning of ye yard, or els spouted in by ye yarde.
It is made of .xx. Scorpions or a litle moo, or fewer, set in the sun in oyll of bitter Almondes for the space of a month in a glas well stopt.
Or rou~d Aristolochia gentian, Cyperi, the barkes of the rotes of Capers, of euery one an vnce, let them be set to sun in a Sextar of oyll of bitter Almondes, xx. daies in a glas stopt: then put in the Scorpions from ten till .xv. in to the oyll: stop the glas and set them in the sun againe a moneth.
He that xxx] is diseased with the stone shalbe anoynted with it as he cummeth out of the bathe, in the .iii. forsaid partes, and let a litle portion of it be put in at the yard euery houre.
Sum had ra+ther vsed the first, sum ye latter as more effectuall and better wurking.
But Siluius in his annotacions saith, it is prepared also nowe with old oyll putting to simple medicines good against poyson: and it becummeth an oyl of maruelous vertues against al poysons and pestile~ce.
knowe a man with the help of this, that seteth x] light by any be it neuer so cruel and strong a poyson, but both he and his seruauntes are preserued safe going with him to visite the sick of the pestilence: and with the only anoynting, diuers to haue bene deliuered from moste cruel poysons drunke~.
The first because of the Scorpions is coulde, the latter bycause of the spices is hoat more strongly wurking, not bycause of the heet of thies and subtilnes of the substaunce (wherwith it openeth perceth, sclendreth, clenseth, breaketh thorowe) xx] but also by the propertie of the hool substaunce of Scorpions, and (as they speake) specificall form, wherwith it breketh both the kynde of stone of the reines and bladdar, anoynted only vpon the loynes, if it be in the reines: but if in the bladdar, vpo~ the priuy place wher the heer is, betwien the tuel and the yarde, and then also a litle put in at the yarde: Hitherto Syluius.
In the secretes of Variguanus, we reed that cer+tain haue been presently and out of hande deliuered xxx] from a cotidia~ ague being anoynted with the oyll of Scorpions.
Oyll of Scorpions whose operacion is maruelous against poysons specially of Serpentes and other beates, and peculiarly against Napellum, is written by Matthaeolus Senensis in his sixt booke of his comme~taries vpon Dioscorides imprinted in Italian, from whence we haue translated it into Latin.
This oyll (saith he) anoynted vppon the pulsing veynes, where they appeare moste, as of the temples, handes and fiet, and in x] the place of the hart, so that euery third hower the anoynting be repeted, deliuereth safely from all poysons within the body receyued, that haue no gnawyng nor frettyng operacion: and lykewyse from the bytinges of Eddars, Aspes, and any other venemous beast.
The composition therof is thus, whiche let bee knowen abroode, that the hool worlde may knowe and confesse my lyberall and good hart.
In the begynning of May take thre pound of commun oyll of a hundreth yeare xx] old, or certenly the eldest of all that may be found.
Thre handful of Hypericon or saint Iohns wurt fresh, (with the herbe and flowers.)
Put the oyll into a bely of glay, twyse as big as for the measur thereof, and when the Hypericon is a litle beaten put it in vpon it.
Then the vessell being stopt, set it in moste fyne sand vp to the midst where it may be made hoat the hool day of the sun, for the space of ten or twelue daies.
After thou shalt put it in Balneo Marie fowre and twenty howres. xxx] Then pres out the oyll from the herbe and put to Hyperici, Chamedryos, Calaminthae, Cardui sancti, of euery one a handfull moderatly beeten: and put them again into the bath for .iii. daies.
Afterward thou shalt streine them and pres them: and putting to them .iii. handfuls of flowers of Hypericon well pickt from the stalkes, and wel beeten, set it again .iii. daies in Balneo Mariae, and pres it out as before.
This shalt thou repete .iii. or .iiii. tymes, till the oyll haue gotten a colour as red as x] bloud.
Afterward take the sedes of ye tender parts of Hypericon, or the huskes lyke to the cornes of barly, wherin the sedes ly hid, in suche plenty that it may be equall with the three handfulles: beate thies sprinkling vpon them a litle whyte wyne, power it into the said oyll. then bery it in sand in the sun eight daies, and straight after in the bath for .iii. daies.
And do this thre or .iiii. tymes putting in new tenderlynges of Hypericon, till a very sad or darke reed xx] colour remaine in it.
After this, take fresh Scordium, Calamint,, the les Centaury, Carduum sanctum, Veruin, Dictamnum Creticum, of euery one halfe a handfull.
When they are beaten, put them into oyll: and put them in a bath for twoo daies.
Then take Zedoariae, the roote of whyte Dictamni, Gentian, Tormentillae, Aristolochiae root, of euery one thre drams: of freshe Scordium a handfull.
When they are beaten together, power them in and let them xxx] stand thre daies in the bath, strein and pres.
And again, put into the oyl Styracis Calamitae, Belzoi or Laserpitii, of ether .vi. drammes: the bearies of Iuniper .iiii. drams: Nigellae. iii. drams: odoriferous Casiae. ix. drammes, white Saunders .iiii. drams: Scoenanthi, Cuperis of ether a dram and a half, when they are beaten pour them in, and put them into the bath .iii. daies, straine and pres.
After, take .xxx. liue Scorpions, gathered in the Caniculer daies, and put them in a belly of glas vpon hot ashes, and when thou seest them sweate x] for heat, and to send out an humor, power vppon them al the forsaid oyl hot (but not so hot, that the vessell breake therwith,) and sodenlye stoppe the mouth of the vessell, and put it in a bath .iii. dais.
Then strain it and pres it, and cast awai the scorpions now sod: and put into the oyle Rhabarbi Electissimi, commun Mirh, Aloes Hepaticae, of euery one .iii. drams, Spiknard .ii. drams, one dram of Saffron: Triacle elect, Mithridatii perfecti, of ether half an ounce.
When they are beaten poure xx] them in and put it in a bath .iii. dais, and strain it no more after that, but set it vp, and keepe it as a balm.
For it is a remeady of great admiracion against the forsaid poisons, specially against the Napellum, wherewith those .ii. theues of wer infected, whose history we recited in ye fourth boke, wher we made me~tion of Aconitum, to whiche place send the reader.
Cardanus thinketh that the oyl which should be anoynted without the body against poysons, vpo~ xxx] the pulses and region of the hart, oughte to be of metall, as of orpment or drawne out of Myssi, see before in the beginning of the tretise of oyles destilled of metally thinges.
Of oyl of Serpents or blacke Edders, also of oyl of frogs, rede Mesuae. &c. Oyl of Castoreum is composed with manye other spices, and hot gums. &c. as Syluius describeth vpo~ Mesuen: it may also be made simple and single, and for the hard and Massy part of Castorei the fattines cleauinge to it to be added, or rather both, as counsell. x] Brimston is made hot in oenostagmate (I vnderstand burning water) till a certaine skin swim aboue (they call it an oyl) which a man must take in a shell, sometimes the water muste be chaunged, till oyl inough be gathered, wherewith they saye Hydargiron, that is quicke Siluer sunken in a body is entised oute, if it be anoynted streighte waye when a man commeth oute of the bathes.
See befoore amongste the destilled oyles. xx] Of fomentations and perfumes· FOmenta are called of the Grekes Pyriamata, all thinges that be laide hot to the bodye withoute, ether to asswage the griefe, or to drawe oute the matter, bothe otherwise, and also to dissolue swellings: this perauenture is done by dri rather, xxx] the other by moyste.
Sometimes woulde vse now the one now the other both dry and moyst by course, as in gouty greues ether in the feete or other ioynts, wher as it is ieopardy least the more subtill parte of the matter drawne oute, the groser be lefte behinde and made more hard.
Moyst fomentacions seme to prepare the matter for the drye, to extenuate and make sclender, to mollefy, to digest, to make them vapor out: some perauenture do none of these, accordinge to the diuersitie of the matter.
But dry fomentacions do drye and x] draw outward, and heaten more.
Moist be ether liquid or running as simple water, or Oyl, milk by it self, or with hony: herbs and flours sod in water or wine or other liquor, and laid vpon a linnen cloth or bag, or put into a blader, or a moistned therin, or a linnen cloth, or wul, or a Fil+trum, that is a shred of wollen cloth.
Bladders or like thinges full of hot water or oyl. Cataplasmata also maye be numbred amongste these, whyche are ministred hot, that is to saye hearbes sod, and xx] beaten laide vppon a linnen cloth.
Dry are suche, as Milium, Salte, Sande, bran, Otes made hot in a kettle, and sturred aboute, are put into a linnen clothe or bagge.
Celsus in some places commendeth the iuice of hotte Salte, and in an other place he saithe it is most holsome to make fomentacions wyth moyste Salte.
You shall, as he expoundeth putte a little bagge into hotte water, and laye it hotte to the place diseased: puttynge into the bagge nowe and then an iron hotte, xxx] whyles it lyeth vppon the place that is greaued, sprinkling water lightly vpon it: therefore you shal haue .ii. slices redi, that while the one slis is put into the bag the other may be heated in the fire.
In the disease of the necke called Tetanus, whiche is the stifnes of the sinnewes (saith Celsus) it is necessarie to haue a moyste and warme fomentacion.
Therfore the moste part of men do pour often vpon the neckes much hotte thinges.
That procureth presently ease, but it maketh the sinewes more apt to receiue cold: which ought to x] be auoided.
Therfore it were beter to anoynt the nek with some waxed moisture, then to laye Oxe bledders, or like thinges filled with hotte oyle, or some hot plaster of bran, or rounde Pepper with figs beaten But the best of al is to make fomentation with moist salt.
In the same we red a meruelous fomentacion for the touth.
To put wilde Minte in a Basin, and water to it, somewhat aboue it: then to putte in hotte burnynge Flintes, the diseased gapinge with his mouthe receyueth xx] the vapoure.
harde of a late of a woman deliuered from a longe paine of the touth ache, whyche receiued gapinge the vapoure of a black flint, (wherewith the streates are paued (be sprynkled with wine.
The same Celsus biddeth to vse fomentacions vnto sore nosthrils, only wt the vapor of water, out of a vessel wt a narow mouth.
certain woman that had ben long sick of a Paronychia or whitflow, or ilgnawing sore vpo~ her xxx] toes, nie ye nail, when now certain, litle bones wer out, and many medicines vsed in vaine, she laide vnto it a fomentacion of the mos of a walnut tree sod in wyne, so that she held the sore place a prety whyle in that vapour: then bound part of the mos hoat therupon, and was by and by made hoole.
fyer brand also brent, foulded in a moyst cloth is in stede of a hoat fomentacion in Celsus.
haue put Caret or Cumin sede beaten in a bag moystened with burning water hoat, vnto the nauell of them that were sick of the colick, and haue had oft x] good succes through the same burning water set on fyre, in a bath stouf or sweeting hous narowe and close euery where, the aire waxeth hoat, wher+in the sinewes, ioyntes, and other partes couled, are proffitably fomentated, and if it be possible to be done they sweet also.
To moue sweet and to warme the bathing place with the vapour of hoat water, the commun people set great caudrous wt hoat water in their sweeting places, with chaf together (to keepe the heat longer) and sumtymes xx] swiet herbes.
Other haue a pot hoot without the bath, with water and other herbes or medicines put in it, from whence the vapour entreth into the bath by a pype beneth.
This other do with other instrumentes and vessels, as they in Italy in the old tyme heated hoathouses.
When the bathing place is alredy made hoat, a burning coole might be put into the pot, and dry medicines be in, the perfume wherof is desyred or st, both otherwyse also chiefly for wemens vse, to diuers xxx] diseases of the wombe, receiuing the perfume by a pype.
Let them put out their head the whyle, which are to weake for to abyde it, or such as it is to be feared lest they swound or chaunce into ouer great thirst. &c. Sum in bathes power water or wyne, simple or mixte with medicines vpon reed hoat tyle stones or dros of iron, or stones.
Sweet in bed is prouoked with hoat tyle stones foulded in moyst linnen clothes and put in to the bedde, or with tinnen bottelles filled with x] hot water: or with litle bagges wherin herbes sod are put yet hoat, and the better if a hoat tyle stone also be put in withall.
Wull vnskoured suppled in wyne or vinegar, wherunto oyll is put, Dates beaten, Bran sod in salt water or vinegar, do both repres and mollifie together.

Sum put hoat ashes, or burning cooles rather in a vessell xx] of wood, filling it to the half, the rest they fyll with what herbes they list, as wormwod, mints, to comfort the stomack, ether by them selues or sprinkled with a litle wyne: then bynding vpon it a linne~ cloth they lay it to ye part diseased, specially where it is nedeful to heaten, to dry, to discus to drawe sumwhat strongly.
It is conuenient for partes couled and to them that haue gouty aches to vse it with mugwort only or also chamemell, vnto the diseases of the womb, with Matricaria. xxx] This fomentacio~ may be made with .ii. vessels to be laid vnto by cours.
Celsus willeth men in sum place to lay about the places diseased wull perfumed with the smoock of brymston.
Hereunto may be referred all suche thinges as Fuchsius other wryt of fomentacions, apposicions, embroches, litle bags and insessions.
The greke word aeonein signifieth the water vpon and power vpon, whether it be done bicause of fomentacion, that is wt heat, or other cause.

THe iuices of certain herbes wrong and prest out, are sod at fyer or dryed in the sun, as Bulcasis teacheth seuerally of the iuice of Hamsig, Plantain, Lettis, Singrien, Purselan, Rostrum Purcinum, or hogges snout, Scariola, Fenel, Sma+lage, Volubili, Sorrell, and other.
maruelous waye to drawe out the iuice out of black Elleborum, whiche sum vse as a secrete xxx] mystery, the commoditie whereof also trying would not hyde, lest should seme to be sory that our posteritie shuld haue any excelle~t knowledge.
who founde this way first can not saye learned it of certain my moste secret friendes mean that black Elleborum whiche communly all men in Germany name in lyke maner, lyke vnto Consiligo, very many kepe it in their garde~s: but that whiche groweth vpon the mou~taines, to be found in our countrey Heluetia is best.
man may trye the same way in Colocynthida Esula, Laureola, &c. x] Sieth lightly in water the routes of black Elleborum cleen and washt, set infused in the same first a night or more, small cut.
Thou shalt take hede both in this and in the other decoctions that thou skim away diligently al the foom that swymmeth aboue, as venemous.
This water shalt thou kepe and again power other vnto it warm, and heet it a whyle moderatly, chaunging the water so oft til the routes retein none or very litle bitternes any more: whiche shall cum to pas when thou hast xx] chaunged the water seuen or nyne tymes.
But in the meane space whyle thou chau~gest the waters, destill the first euer with a Filtrum or through a brush: and at length sieth all with a slowe fyer, or with burnt cooles rather, so that they boyl not, yet let them be alwayes at the poynt of boyling, vntil they be as thick as hony in an earthen pot glased, or of bras tinned, the pot couered or litle ope~. Whe~ as now a litle water remaineth, about the ende of the siething, stur it about gently now and then wt xxx] a stick, that the iuice be not burnt too, and at the same time for a pound of rotes of Elleborum, thou shalt put .ii. drammes of Mastik pund, and cease not to sturre it, other continuallye, or by little distaunces, til the iuice seme out and out sufficiently thickened, whiche wil chaunce sodenlye for the mooste parte: and that the matter may be the les burnt, the nere vnto the ende and to the thickning the iuice is, so much vrge it with les fyre: nor be not weary of the time: for thou shalt haue a most excellent and exquisite medicine againste diuers x] diseases, speciallye melancholik diseases.
It shal become of a darke red coloure, of moste bitter sauour, with a percing sharpnes, like as is in Asarum or and Cloues, but stronger, ye burning as it semeth to the taster: yet is not burning in deede, that is because of the tenuitie and sclendernes of the partes, as wold haue tried.
It is ministred an hour after supper, in the mou~tenance of a pease, in all diseases whereunto Elleborus is conueniente, and where it is good to lose xx] the bealy.
One pill of that quantity that saide. wil make a man to haue .iiii. stoules.
But hear that certaine when they had taken to muche, as much perauentur as a beane, they haue ben emptied to ofte by the bealye and vomiting, and haue bene verye muche weakened: whiche to take heede of, vsinge the counsell of a certaine learned Phisicion woulde brynge to iuyce, not the Elleborum alone, but infused and decocted with other diuers medicines, as shall declare by and by. xxx] perceiue it skilleth little whether the rootes be taken grene or dry.
But a man must take a pou~d at the leaste of the rotes.
Lullius and other (Cardan) haue made mention of the quintessence of Elleborum, where vnto thincke this iuice to bee nothing inferiour.
This truelye is worthye to be wondred at, that the iuice so longe decocted is not onlye nothinge weaker but also muche stronger: for it seemeth, (that may speake of coniecture) that one parte of this iuice to be tenne times and more stronger then Elleborus it selfe, and yet nothing x] more daungerous or hurtful: but the stre~gthe withoute harme is encreased.
And although my selfe woulde haue remitted and asswaged his strengthe, puttinge to manye medicines, yet can commende more this simple waye alreadye described, where as nothinge but a little Mastik is added at the laste, speciallye for more hard and greuous diseases, where necessitie requireth extreame medicines: and for Franticke persones and otherwise madde and dotinge, whiche when xx] they can not be compelled to take anye medicins, they are the easier deceiued with so little a dosi in quantitye.
Yea also withoute the bodye for venemous bitinges and sinnewes hurte, canne beleue that the vertue of it shoulde be mooste excellent.
finde no iuice made in this sorte in anye authors: the iuice of Acatia and of Berberies in Bulcasis.
For the straininge of it onlye is decocted, not that which is depressed oute: also the iuice of Galbanus and Licoris: but the water in them xxx] is not chaunged.
Other iuices are made all by expression, and aresod til they gather into a Ielly, as of Poppy, Wormwod, nightshade, Vinae Acerbae, Memithae, Agremony, Hypocisthidis, the barkes of the rotes of Mandrag.
The same Bulcasis also, willeth to put to a little gum to certaine iuices that be prest out which are sod by them selues at the fire, that the partes of the~ may better cleue together, as the iuice of wormwod gasid, that is Eupatorium or nightshade: also of Centaury, and x] Gentian (which is made of a decoction strained.)
But Mastik is mixt with ye iuice of Elleborus, not onlye for this cause, but also to amende the venemous vertue therof and contrary to the stomak.
Moreouer in certain other medicins, wher a ma~ list to encrease the strength and vertue of any me+dicin which is to be left and laid away in some liquor, we chaung not the liquor, but the medicin: that is euer when the first is strained, putting in new medicin into the same liquor, as in many decoctions xx] and oyles: but here in the iuice of Elleborus we do contrary: For keping the same rotes of the Elleborus, we chaunge oft the liquor.
maye tel the cause, because ye rote of Elleborus aboue all other things, hath most stro~g vertues, not in ye superficial other parts only, but in ye hole substa~ce imprinted veheme~tly fastly: wherfore it may be also kept most long of al other.
my self vsed it, when it was .x. yeares olde, in his full strengthe.
And certaine common Practicioners bidde men xxx] drinke for the lousinge of the belly the wine wher in a part of it hath sooked a nighte and the nexte daye is strained, and the rotes to be dried again: for they are nothing or veri litle weaker therwith although they be somewhat often repeated to the same vse and dried again.
But of Elleborus it self and what we haue tried and experimented therof, perauenture we shal once haue an other place and occasion to wryte of.
Pils of blak Elleborus, or rather of his iuice, is to be taken euery seuenth day in the curing of the x] French disease that is Melancholy, as Matthaeolus cou~selith.
Three drams of the rootes of blacke Veratrum or Elleborus fresh and new: Dauci or Anisi, Peper, of euery one a dram .vi. grains of Mosth. scrupuls of Epithy or the harder time: let all theese be lightlye beaten: then when they haue stand to soke a day and a nighte, v. poundes of Malmsye (heare semeth to be som fault of the printer, for it is to great a measure of wine) let them be mightilye prest oute.
Take .iii. xx] drams of this expression: of the pouder of pils of Fumitory, Cochiarum, Aurearum, of euery one. drams and a half, knede them together, and then let them be dried.
Moreouer when they are dry made againe in pouder, thou shalt stiepe them again in the same Malmsy, as before .iiii. tymes.
The pilles thereof, muste be taken at one time, to the weight of one dram.
Two poundes of Blacke Elleborus newe cutte: xxx] Liquoris scraped and brused with a pestil a pou~d stiep them a night in a good quantitie of water.
The next day after sieth them an houre a halfe with a slow fyer, or .ii. houres, power it out straining it, and put in to it other water warm (which shalbe redy in a chafer by the fyr for this purpose.
Then castyng away the routes, take the hooll water streined or destilled by a Filtrum, and sieth it by litle and litle and when as yet a litle of it shall remaine, power vnto it this decoctio~: Seuen handfull of Betain, x] Agrimony two handfull, Anisi. iii. vnces, stiep the~ in water and sieth them till the consumpcion and wasting of the thirde parte: pres it out, strayne it twys or thrys, at the length put to fiue vnces of Agaricum elect cut smal: flower deluce two vnces and a half: Cinamon six drams, Ginger halfe an vnce: sieth them to the half, pres them out strain the water as befor.
Then power this decoction to the decoction of the Elleborus boyling moderatly: and let them be together to the thicknes of hony. xx] litle before the ende put to .iiii. drams of the pouder of Mastick .ii. drammes of Scammonium: thies dissolued together in a litle of the decoction of Elleborus, that it may be lyke the substaunce of hony, not muche before the end of the decotion power it in, (when the iuice shalbe moderatly thyck, or beginneth to be thick) and thou shalt stur it about till the iuice be consumed.
Thou shalt trye now and then a drop of the iuice, let it fall vpon a tinnen and when it shalbe so thick that it xxx] wil almost run no more abrode when thou leenest the trencher on the one syde or lifts it vp, then is the iuice perfect.
But by the space of an houre or more before the ende thou shalt now and then stur it about with a slow fyer, lest it burn too.
Of this decoctio~ had almost .xi. vnces of iuice: thinck should haue had skarsly ye fourth parte, if had sod Elleborum alone.
This iuice haue vsed alredy sumtymes: for ministred it vnto a yonge man sik of the falling euill, with good succes, who now of long tyme God be thanked, is well: but x] with many other medicines also ther with, as letting of bloud and sweeting. &c.
And an other certain person molested for .iii. yeares with the Ascarides or litle round wormes breeding in the long gut, many medicines tryed in vayne, was restored with this iuice once receiued, and a few dayes after taking hartes horn burnt.
Pilles of the bignes of a pees, from .ii. to fiue may be ministred af+ter supper, that is from half a scrupull or there about to a hool.
But a man may try thies better in xx] proces of time.
This doo admonish physicions that be litle exercised, that thei vse it not rashly but with diligent consideration: for it is a vehement medicine.

gaue of la to one sicke of a quartain fyue pylles of the bignes of a pees, whereupon he perceyued great anguishe, and was purged only by vomit: voyded xxx] nothing downward, nether was eased of the diseases.
my self taking two pyles lyke peasen after sopper, ye next day felt no smal grief about my stomak, auoyded su~tymes downward, but vomited not.
man may more safly giue it to the~ yt be sufficiently ful of flesh or fat, of a moyst stomack, and a stomack of moo exquisite sence.
Again of the iuice of black Elleborus: and of the drawing out of the vertues out of purging medicines and certain other, as learned of a certin friend.
THis drawing oute was inuented for delicate x] and such as be of a weake stomack, for the~ that can not abyde nor beare a great potio~ of any lousing medicine, but ar loused wt the leest weight.

Vnto this straining power ye forsaide .iiii. pou~des of iuice: let the~ boyll a litle at fier: afterward put in cut beate~ Ellebo. sieth the~ lightly by litle litle till yt the rootes appeare aboue, the~ pres the~ out again, strain the~ through a filtru~, sieth this straini~g to ye thiknes of hony wt xxx] a slow fier, taking co~tinually hied lest it· be burnd to.
Afterward take it of the fier vse it, trying experime~ting in the dosior qua~titie of from half a scrupul to a hool or further.
It is ministred to louse ye bely, folded or moulded in a litle moystned dow vnleuened, mixt with a drop or two of oyll of Anis.
Cut a pound of the pieces of Rhabarbarum elect small, and beat it sumwhat gros, and power to it ye clarified iuices of Borage and Buglos, of ether two poundes, let them stande .xxiiii. houres.
Afterward sieth them at a slowe fyer, till the Rhabarbarum appeare and x] be higher then the rest.
Then pres it out strongly and put the decoction prest out through a wullen sight, and pres it out, that the substaunce may remaine in the sight.
Sieth this sighting to the thik+nes of hony, putting to it an vnce of yt best sugar.
Sum sieth in Balneo Mariae till it be thick lest it should put to whiche is better, as lykewyse in a double vessell.
In purging giue it to be swalowed doun mixt with a drop of oyll of Cinamon and Anis, foulded in vnleuened dow, making a triall xx] in the quantitie of ministracion, from a scrupul to ii. Sum bicause Rhabarbarum by it selfe doth not purge greatly, do sharpen the hooll extraction wt a litle of the best Dacrydium, which hurteth not.
Take any lump or mas that wil of pilles composed most diligently, of the best medicines: when it is broken into litle pieces, stiep it eight daies in raine water iuice of Borage, iuice of Fenell, in equall porcions, as muche as suffiseth.
Then sieth it in a glasen double xxx] vessell a hool daye: then pres it out through a moste cleane wullen clothe, that will lose none of his heares, and sieth it againe in a bath and double vessel diligently to a conuenient thicknes, and frame little pils whereof thou shalt geue .ii. scruples or ther about.
matter drawne oute in this wise is most pure, very tender and melteth easily in a mans hand.
In like maner may also the vertues of other purging medicins be drawne oute.
But hede must be taken, that euer softening and slippery iuices be mixt therwith in the decoction, x] such as they before are: and it shall be muche the better if all be sod in a double vessel.
description of a purging Electuari extracted, whiche a certaine excellente Phisition at Norinberg did vse .xiii. drammes of Colocynthidis, blak Elleborus, senae Alexandrinae, of ether an ounce, of mooste white Agaricum an ounce: Rhabarbarum Electum halfe an ounce, or if the Rhabarbarum be not very good, an ounce: xiiii. drams of Dacrydium: Turbirh, (if rede right) Stichas Ara. of ether xx] ii. vnces a half: ii. drams of Cinamon: red Roses Lignum Aloes, Mastik, red Mirrh, Asarum, spiknard, Styrax liquid, of euery .v. scrupuls.
Pour al+together and digest or putrify the~, as they cal it .x. daies or .xiiii. in warm Aqua vitae thrise destilled.
The iuice prest out therof shalbe ioyned and mixt with .iii. vnces of prepared Aloes.
About apou~d of Aloes is put into a basen, caudron or pot, putting therto vinegar made with Rosewater, and Roosewater xxx] as much as shalbe sufficient, but so yt ther be more of the vinegar of Roses, then of the water of Roses.
Let them boyle together with a slowe fire .ii. or .iii. boylinges: then straine them pressing them strongly.
When it is strained, let it boyle againe with a slow fire to the thicknes of Aloes sturring it continuallye with a slise.
When it is coulde, let it be kepte for vse.
The species or particulers rehersed are firste cut small, then beaten, infused in Aqua vitae, as muche as is sufficiente, they are let stande in the infusion warme in Balneo Mariae or sande .xiiii. daies, sturring and chafinge them in x] the meane season oftentimes euery day, then are they prest oute strongly throughe a grose linnen clothe.
Then are they put in a lembeck, and with the fire, is the waterye moysture drawne oute, till the consistence or thicknes of Diacy donion of the said medicin.
If ther remain yet any moisture let it be put vpon burning coles in some vessel as much as is sufficient.
Of the iuice of the Flour Deluce xx] and Rape. &c. OVre Floure Deluce is more stronge in operation in the dropsy, as semeth me, then the Florentines: of the whiche opinion a frend of mine also a very wel Phisicion is, who of late sente mee these hys experimentes and trialles of the iuice of the roote of Flower Deluce and Rape.
Take a hens xxx] egge, and pouringe oute the white, put the iuice of the Flower Deluce in place, and mixte it diligently with the yolke: and when thou hast a little warmed it in the ashes, geue it for a mornynges draught, which shall auoid downward aboue mesure the dropsy water.
This also (saith he) haue emongst my secretes for them that be sick of the dropsy and can not swete: take the iuice of a round Rape beaten in a morter and prest out, seasoned with Suger or cinamon, that it taste somthing els then the Rape, x] geue this in the morning to the sick well couered he shall sweat.
The iuice of Purslan, Singreen or Houslike, Cotyledonis, and of other likewise that be slimye and Clammy, because of the clammines can not be prest oute alone: The herbe well punde wyth Omphacium is prest oute.
Other when they are punde heat them at a flow fyre.
Other beat them and let them stand in a colde place, as a wine celler, put in a basket of wikars, to destill downe into xx] a dishe set vnder: Syluius, in whome thou shalt reade moore of the preparinge and preseruynge of iuices, in his boke of the preparacio~ of simples.
Of Lignum sanctum and anye other, we draw oute teares, whiche is moore precious then the woode it selfe, in this wise.
The Lignum is cut in pieces, the thicknes of a finger, which are put in the fire: therby is gathered what tere so euer is in the Ligno.
Milk is gathered of Esula Selandin, cuttinge xxx] the highest bowes, and laid hielding in a vessell, pressing (milking or sliping· the~ one by one.

And of late red almost ye very same medicine in a certain boke of a certayn practicioner, writen in frenche, and a few yeares past whe~ the pestilence was here, a certain friend of myne sent vnto me a lyke description.

LA&st of all wee wyll teache and declare here certain thinges of made and counterfeit wynes, yet not of all of purpose, x] whiche should be to long.
Who so desireth mo kindes of made wynes, and their compositions and vertues let him go to Dioscorides, Ae+tius in his last booke, and to the booke of Arnold Villa nouani of wynes.
Wynes mixt with medicines are made diuers waies: first siething the me+dicines with the wyne whyle it is must and new, for the moste part to the consumpcion of the third part, skumming in the meane season straining afterward.
Sum sieth the wyne alone: other till ye xx] third part be co~sumed, other much les: afterward they hang within the wyne in a litle bag the medicines sumwhat gros bete~.
And bitter medicines specially ought to be put in decocted and sod wyne (for so it waxeth swiet) in a litle bad, or els to be sod together, or both.
So are wynes made wt wormewood, with Zedoaria, with Inula, also wt Borrage and Melissa, in Arnold.
Sum sieth a litle newe must and when it is couled, they power it vpon the herbes in the vessell.
Secondly putting the xxx] herbes them selues or the medicines dry in ye new wyne, before it be hoat, that by the heet of it in the vessel, the vertue of the medicin may be mixt with it: So the mooste men with vs prepare wyne of wormwood, and they let it stande a hooll wynter in the vessels, euer filling the vessels again, if thei draw any thing out of it, in the beginning of vere they take the herbes out: sum leue them in al summer also, but yet it is easely corrupted, waxeth hoor and mouldy, and sower specially if the vessell bee not full.
Sum set a plate of iron tinned boored x] through with many hooles, within the vessell about the tap or spigot, that it be not stopt with the medicines that are put in.
man may any tyme of the yeare put wormwood or other herbes in old wyne in a litle vessell, specially in cellers that bee sumwhat coule, or in a great glas well stopt: if so be it the route callet Cariophyllata dry be put to, wyne shalbe preserued the lo~gar.
Other sieth simpely with wyne the medicine whose vertue they would haue to pas in the wyne, at any time of the xx] yeare: but sod wynes for the mooste parte, breeth out and becum almoste sower: therfore allowe rather the medicines beaten to bee stiept in wyne together wt clarified hony or sugar a fewe houres, and then after to be strained sumtymes through an Hippocras bag.
So haue made sumtymes wyne good for them that were sick of the dropsy, of the rout of flowre deluce, and for them that wer short wynded of Inula. &c. Wyne may also be mixt and streined with the iuices of herbes clarified: or xxx] els the iuice of them whiche dry beaten, haue been hanged in a litle bag in it a few daies, to be prest oute and when it is strained to be mixte with the wine, and newe medicines to be put into the bag, &c. for if the matter be prest oute often and newe put to, the wine shall be the stronger, and we shall fil the vessel now and then for that that is drawn oute: for if not, the wine will become euerye foote weaker.
Wines medicined (as we haue saide) maye be made, leauinge the medicines put in a bagge, or x] simplely in Must or new wine, that they heat together: or in wine sethinge at the fire But the first way is preferred bycause by it the vertue of the medicines is not resolued, nor altered or wekened.
The hole of the conseruatiue vessel ought to be couered with a litle couer, that the heat may brethe out moderatly, and yet the odour fewm not out to much.
Yet if ye thinke good to sethe them in wine at the fire, let the fire be made moste slowe, and continued without smoke, with the vessel couered, xx] least it brethe out, and let it be sod a certain space (with a bigger or les fire, according as the substance of euery thing requireth, Arnold in his boke of wine.
Such as a ma~ list to sethe, it shuld be best to sethe it in a double vesselor in Baln.
Aromaticall made wines or with spices maye be kept for .iii. or .iiii. daies clear, afterward they are troubled.
Plinius teacheth the confections of wines of diuers simple medicines.
Wine of Wormwode howe it is made, haue xxx] alreadye saide before.
Some make it with onlye Wormwode: other mixte with it other diuers herbes, speciallye hotte: as Hyssop, Rue, Sage, Cardnus Benedictus, Peny royall, Costus Hortensis, Phyllitides, the floures of Eldar, the Barkes of Ashe.
make somtimes in a glas forthwith, putting the leaues of Wormwode dry, into Malmsy and burninge water, thrise destilled of ether like much.
This may be long kept: a litle of it put to a great deale of wine, doth season it holly with the qualitie of Wormwode.
It is good for a cold stomake, x] it duscusseth winde, it healeth the fleumatik colik, and that is bred of wind: it healeth scabbednes being annoynted vppon: Arnoldus in hys boke of wines.
better way of making it saith he, that the Wormwod grene or dry be beate~, and that the wine warme be straind vpon it certaine times, til it receiue the sauour and vertue of it, and to season it with Suger or Honye: this waye to make this wine is better then other, because all the strength of the Wormwod is in the superficiall xx] and outward parts of it, which by this menes is best drawn out: then is he long in rekening the vertues of it, Galangal or Anise maye also be added, or any other thinge as a man thinkes good.
Wine of Mugwort is made in the same manner that wormwode wine is.
Wine of the kirnels of Alkckengi or Haliacacabus, is made the same way, straining the wine vp on them beaten, for one Dosis, of it thou shalt take from .v. to .x. it bringeth out stony matter fro~ the xxx] rains and bladder manifestlye, and guideth oute the water that is reteined and kept in (see Arnold in his boke of wine) wherof my self also made a trial of late, straining together Anise, the rote of Carlina, the kirnels of Peches, and litle stones of crabs, wherupon the vrin holden now of long space, followed within an houre.
Some put the graines of Haliacacabus hole into newe wine in a little vessel, that they may sieth together, and kepe it for their vse.
Wine of Betain is good for the griefes of the stomacke.
Benedictus, x] Wine of Buglos of the rotes of Buglos stieped in wine, is maruelouslye commended of Arnold againste the diseases of Melancholy, with a story of a certaine woman healed with the drincking therof, which through anger, became oftentimes a fole.
Wine of Buglos, wherein the rotes of Buglos wel washt haue ben a day and a night or the syrup of it, it bringeth mirth and is good for melancholical persons.
Certain me~ haue ben cured by the vse of that wine from madnes, and the xx] mixture alienacion of reason: Arnold, of the co~seruacion of youth, the .iii. chap.
An other wine composed with the rotes and floures of Buglos, with Sena or without it, shalt thou read in Arnold in his boke of wine, with this title.

Take a pounde of the rotes of Buglos made cleane: Red Rooses.

When they are beate~ together put them in a bag, and the bagge in a vessell conteininge .iii. burthens of good wine (newe suppose) freshe and newlye prest oute white and clearest that maye x] be founde.
Let halfe this wine be sodde with the saide species, and the other half alone skimminge it well.
Then straine that where the species be in to a vessell: fill it vp wyth the other, till the heate be gone, and it become sufficientlye cleare.
The vse of it oughte to be continuall, Arnold, of the co~seruacion of healthe.
The Rootes of Inula cut small as hearbes to the potte, sethe them in a new earthen potte glased in .ii. pintes or more of xx] Must or new wine, til some partes of it be consumed.
The~ sieth .xx. sextars or more, that is about xvii. pintes of the best new wine swiet, in a kettle till it waxe swiet: afterward, poure vnto it the rotes of Inula together with the newe wine wherein they sodde, and when as yet they haue sodde a little while together, ye shall set it downe from the fire and keepe it.
When the newe swite wyne is skimmed and sodde to the consumpcion of the xxx] thirde parte, euen when it is sodde nowe inoughe put in rootes of Inula. (for .xxv. congies or there about, whiche is about .xv. galons of our measur, take .ix. vnces:) and when the must or new wyne hath yet a litle boyled, take it of and whe~ it is cold kiep it, and hange the rootes of the Inula (the very same that were separated in the streining of the wyne) in a bagge within the vessell.
The rootes should be gathered in October in the spring of the mone, or in the beginning of summer, to be dried in the sun.
This did translate out of a certayn x] dutch booke.
For .xx. congies or ther about of must, take half a fourth deell of Iuniper beries (a fourth deel we call of the measure of Heluetia, but that varieth also, the fourth part.)
First thou shalt straw the bottom of the vessel wt thin chipes of hewed ashe, lest the beries may stop ye entrance of the tap: then strawe the half parte of the beries in vpon that: thirdly the rest of the chipes, furthly xx] the rest of the beries, with a handful of Mugwurt together, and a half of the hartes tong communly so called: last of all thou shalt fill the vessell with the best and swiet new wyne, that it may heate~ together.
The vse of this wyne is to preserue a man against poyson and many sickneses.
draught of it or two must be drunke at the beginning of dinner, and one after supper before ye go to bed: The author is nameles.
Our contrymen make wyne in summer, with ye xxx] black sower chery, which, they call Visula, putting them hool into the vessell, leuing the fourth parte emptie, powring in vpon them whyte olde wyne, whiche in short space will haue a reed colour, and soner if all the stalkes be cleen taken away, more slowly if they be so cut that part of them be left in, but yet thus, they kepe the colour lo~gest.
But they are wont when they haue drawen any wyne out, to fill the vessell again by by.
It strengtheneth the hart and stomack, asswageth thirst, couleth, dryeth, byndeth.
Other put them not in holl but x] pund, or els they hange them in a litle bag, by the whiche meanes the wyne becummeth more odoriferous, bycause of the kirnles, and byndeth les, and more prouoketh vrine.
It may be made at any tyme of the yeare of dry cheries.
Sum put the iuice of thies cheries alone in a vessell, and when it hath sod, thei stop it and vse it for wyne, ether by it selfe, or mixting a litle of it with a good deale of wyne.
The same iuice with siething is made thick and the Cheries them selues are seasoned with xx] Sugar.
Wyne of wylde Plums Bulies or Sloos, is made in the lyke maner in heruest, when they shal be now sufficiently tender and rype inough.

It helpeth the bo+dy dissolued with heat, chiefly in summer it is prof+fitable for Cholericke and Sanguine persones: xxx] it is made in this wyse.
Some sower grapes together with the rype are put in the wyne pres to be prest out together.
Or yt is better, let the grapes be kepte and brooken together with Raspaciis, put into the vessell with the Must: That Must or newe wyne, by the iuice of this Raspacia (Scapos Frenche men cal grappes, our co~trymen rappen, wherupon the wyne taketh the name) or kirnels in the grapes whiche are sower, dothe get a certain ponticitie or tast lyke wormwood and bynding: x] Arnoldus de Villa Noua.

ARomaticall wynes are wont to be made two waies, ether hanging the spices on+ly in a litle bag, within the vessel which is let stand in a wyne celler: or also putting xx] to hony, that so muche as we would so muche may be made out of hande, and the spyces beaten together, sighed strained a few tymes through a streiner or Hippocras bag of wull, as they call it.
This wyne may be called Mulsum or Melitum, they cal it communly Claret and Nectar and Melicratium but improperly, with whyte wyne.
If they put to sugar for hony, with reed wyne, they cal it Hippocras.
There are made at the Apothecaries thies spyced and aromatical wynes for the xxx] moste part in that proportion, that .xiii. vnces of hony be put to .vii. drams of spices: and .iiii. pou~des of white odoriferous wine.
Or to .vi. drams of spices, half a pound of most pure Suger .iiii. poundes of red wine, or les: other put to muche more suger, and spices also.

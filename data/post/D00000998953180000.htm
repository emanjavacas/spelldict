to the reader

that thou may'st profit by thy hearing or reading of sermons there is a necessity of more pastors and teachers to open and apply the word than one thou must act the part of a pastor and teacher unto thy self and thine own soul
the ministers application without thine own will be to little or no purpose
when there is the application of the word to the heart by preaching and the application of the heart to the word preached by serious meditation when say both these meet and strike one upon the other there will by the help of the spirit who is always ready to promote his work be some sire struck and a kindling of some good things in our

souls towards the lord our god meditate on these things saith the apostle that thy profiting may appear
reader if thou wouldst meditate well on this plain sermon and ponder with thy heart and soul on these plain truths that are here laid down thou wouldst doubtless find them to be blessed for thy spiritual and eternal advantage but without this all will prove but empty words and the whole discourse but as so much water spilt upon the ground
this sermon was calculated for a plain countrey auditory such as it is mean rude rough and unpolisht as it is let it go being importuned by the earnest desires of several persons especially those concerned for the preaching of it to send it forth
and indeed to tell you the truth if had never so many polished shafts in

my quiver as have none should not care to draw them out in my ministerial work being convinced in my soul and conscience that there is very little work done for god or mens souls this way
don't at all affect to tickle means ears with pleasing eloquence or to humour their fancies though the flashy professors of our age whose religion lies all in their fancies memories or minds for there is little or nothing of it in their hearts like nothing else am sure that god in the scripture doth not labour to please mens ears nor to adorn his matter with a curious garment of words but represents the matter it self to the souls of men as that which is worthy of all acceptation
the things of god need no humane eloquence to commend them painting spoils native beauty

and external ornaments would disfigure some things that are of themselves proportioned and lovely
it's that preaching which the world counts foolish and which men being vain in their imaginations are ready to despise that is made mighty through god for the casting down the devils kingdom and the setting up the kingdom of christ in the souls of men
if god would please to bless these plain things for the good of any poor souls then should easily despise all the exceptions of the curious and slight all the cavils of the captious
that the lord may water these seeds with his blessing shall be my prayer

epigraph psalm

whom have in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that desire besides thee
my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever

my beloved

this text was bequeathed unto me and you as may say by the last will and testament of a deceased friend both mine and yours which the lord can make more profitable to us than thousands of gold and silver and am sure it was the earnest desire of her that left it that it might be blest to us all for our everlasting benefit

in the first verse of the psalm the sweet singer of israel lays down a consolatory proposition for the whole israel of god to cheer up and refresh their souls withal in their darkest and most cloudy seasons of trouble and affliction god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart as if he should say though god may seem by his providence to neglect the ways of men and the worst in the view and

judgment of sense may seem to prosper most and the best be of all men the most miserable yet for all this am sure that this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that god is good to his israel and will do them good
then to come near to the text he tells us that god will guide them
by his counsel and hereafter will receive them to his glory
he speaks indeed in the singular number as of himself but you are to understand him in what he says as personating all the people of god therefore it must needs be well with the people of god here since infinite wisdom doth guide and direct them and it shall certainly go well with them hereafter since infinite glory then shall crown them which blessed estate the psalmist esteemed above all that this world can afford because god in that estate will be all in all in the faith hope and expectation of the enjoyment of him for ever knowing that in him he shall inherit all things he incourages and comforts his soul in his present troubles verse
whom have in heaven but thee and what is there upon earth that desire besides thee the words you see are an interrogation which here hath the force of a negation thus there is nothing lord in my judgment either in heaven above or on the earth beneath that is of any real worth and value to me or affords any comfort to my soul besides thy self
now the doctrinal observation which shall draw from hence is this

doct
that god is the all of a gracious and godly soul

other things to him are but as cyphers that signifie nothing are but as shadows which are something

in shew but nothing in substance the things that the men of the world court and adore the trinity which the world doth worship which are earthly pelf sleshly pleasure and airy honour

are nothing less than nothing and vanity in compa+parison to him unto such a soul
take this in two or three particulars


this gracious soul sees all things in god am god saith god to abraham and see thou art so saith this soul to god
in thy breasts are all things as the hebrew word imports out of which we may draw and suck every thing that we need either for the vile body or the precious soul he sees by an eye of faith and the vision of an enlightned mind that all things are in god comprehensively eminently virtually superlatively according to what we read rev

he that overcomes shall inherit all things and will be his god
the carnal heart makes nothing of god psal

he is not in all his thoughts god is not worth his thinking of he idolizes god as if he were nothing in the world and he deifies the creature making that a god he sees nothing in him no excellency at all why he should desire him he prefers the dung and dross of the world before him and is a lover of these things more than god these broken cisterns that hold no water he prefers before the fountain of living waters
but the gracious soul sees all things in him and that all things which we can desire are not to be compared to him


he accounts nothing misery but to be separated from god
there is no sorrow saith this soul to this sorrow all other sorrows laid in the ballance he sinds but light
he had rather chuse to beg with god than to reign without him he had rather die with god that is in the arms of his mercy and in the bosom of his love than live without him in the affluence and confluence of all creature comforts enjoyments and delights
hîc ure hîc seca saith this soul burn me lord wound me rend and tear me with the briers and thorns of the most grievous afflictions for this do chuse and this is infinitely more eligible unto me with the enjoyment of thy self than to live without god in the world in the of all its favours and to bathe my self all my days in the river of its pleasures and delights
much rather would this soul be with job upon the groaning under the burden of all his sorrows or with lazarus at the rich man's door covered all over with sores and ulcers from the crown of the head to the soles of his feet than to be without god

but you may say are not these things miseries surely they are for a poor creature to have no soundness in his flesh and to have no rest in his bones to be chastned with pains to be feeding on wormwood and drinking the waters of gall all the day and all the night long to be pinched with poverty to lie upon the wrack of continual pains to be always under griefs and groans are not these miseries

ans
yes they are mala miseriae in se but not ad hominem istum mean that they are evils and

miseries in themselves and so they are to all others but not to that man that hath the lord for his god therefore saith the apostle rom

we glory in tribulations having peace with god tribulations are to us no tribulations all our maladies are now turned into medicines our crosses into comforts all these things shall work together for our good
god's people shall gather grapes of all their thorns and figs of all their thistles all their bitter waters of marah shall be turned into sweet wine unto them god will comfort them in all their sorrows for he will not leave them comfortless

but will come unto them the fruit of all shall be the taking away their sin and the making them partakers of his holiness when they fall into the waters of affliction it's that they may be washed there when they fall into the fire of tribulation it is that they may be purged there with these god proves them that he may do them good in the latter end all shall work for the increasing their grace and preparing them for glory and the adding more weight of glory to their eternal crown
these are restraints to them from doing evil undefined span alphabet and spurs to them to provoke and excite them to good
in a word there is no evil befals any one that hath an interest in god but what shall be turned to a far greater good than that is an evil therefore under all they should with habakkuk joy in the lord and rejoyce in the god of their salvation


he accounts nothing blessedness and happiness but to be united to him to be one with him and to live

in the enjoyment of him psal
last happy are the people that are in such a case even the people that have the lord for their god
nihil bonum sine summo bono there can be no good without the chiefest and best good therefore those terrae filii those men of the world that you read of amos

that did lie upon their beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches and did eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall that did chaunt to the sound of the viol and invent to themselves instruments of musick like david that did drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chief ointments are said verse to rejoyce in a thing of nought intimating to us that they did put a value upon nothing and made themselves glad with dreams and fancies as use to do we must derive our joy from the eternal spring which is god himself else our joy will quickly be turned into sorrow because that well out of which we did draw our water will be dryed up
in john

these things write unto you that your joy may be full and what he was writing about we read before about fellowship with the father and with his son jesus christ that you may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and truly unless we attain to that blessed fellowship we can never have verum aut plenum gaudium that is true or full joy

qu
but you may say is not this happiness to have what heart can wish for a man to have his desires attend him all the days of his life and to have all the sdreams of the creature to concur together to

bring him satisfaction to be like the rich man in the gospel to be clothed with purple and to sare delicicusly every day

ans
this is indeed no happiness no blessedness without god at all because without him there is nothing blessed but every thing cursed which we do enjoy psal

their table becomes a snare how well furnished soever it may seem to be and that which should otherwise have been for their welfare is turned into a trap by which they are taken and snared unto their destruction job

their portion is cursed in the earth it may be a large a very plentiful and stately portion and men may bless them because of it but the lord abhors them and the curse of the lord is upon them and their portion they were better indeed ten thousand times have no meat than such sawce
solomon tells us that the prosperity of fools doth destroy them and is as

a sword in their bowels to them their cups of pleasure and delight are but sweetned draughts of mortal poyson this the godly man seeth by faith and that this poison will work in a little time in a visible way and they will be brought into desolation even in a moment

use

examine your selves whether god be your all can you say whom have we in heaven but thee and that there is nothing on earth that we desire besides him prove your own selves by this touchstone try your selves by this weight and ballance of the sanctuary

if you do not attain to this you are reprobate silver and the lord will reject you
we have reason to examine our selves about this matter


because there are but few that make god their all many give him glorious titles and challenge an interest in him they call him their lord their god and their king yet in their serious and practical thoughts have higher estimations of lying vanities than of god blessed for ever
many there are that hear the word of the lord they come before him as his people use to do and sit before him as his people use to sit but amongst these how few are to be found that make him their all that look for no happiness no comfort no good but in the enjoyment of him
we have reason to examine because of the necessity of it it must be done woe unto us if it be not done we are no christians without it we are not in the state of grace if this be not we are no more saints whatever our profession may be than the picture or carkass of a man is a man
oh if we do not make god our all though we may seem to be something and may deceive our selves and others yet in god's account we are nothing and god will make nothing of us will have no regard of us or respect unto us another day
to help us now a little in our enquiry about this matter shall give you a few characteristical marks of such a soul as makes god his all


this soul will love to draw near to god to draw near to him by faith by prayer and in all the duties and ordinances of his worship you read in

the last verse of this psalm it is good for me to draw near to god so saith every one that makes god his all oh love to draw near to god one day in the courts of the lord is better

to me than a thousand elsewhere
was

glad when they said unto me come let us go into the house of the lord whilst others say unto god depart from us we desire not the knowledge of thy ways job

and again chap

they said unto god depart from us and what can the almighty do for us we shall get no good by gods drawing near to us nor by our drawing near to him and in the verse of the chap of job what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profit should we have if we pray unto him this is the language of the men of the world their words are indeed stout against the lord but saith the soul that

makes god his all it's good for me whatsoever the sentiments and apprehensions of carnal ones are this am sure of it's good for me believe it to be good and have found it to be good all the people of god say it's good for them and will say it's good for me to draw near to god lord saith peter whither should go but unto thee thou hast the words of eternal life lord saith this soul whither should go but unto thee love love to come to thee for thou art my all and all my springs are in thee and slow from thee


he is one that fears to sin against god he fears indeed nothing more his motto is nil nisi peccatum timeo there is nothing in all the world that fear more than sin because this is the only thing

that can separate between him and his god and that can make a partition wall between him and his great all
he fears sin more than suffering and will chuse it rather than iniquity because suffering doth not separate between the soul and god
he fears sin more than poverty than sickness than death it self for none of these can separate between the soul and god
he knows what is exprest rom
ver
that tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness peril or sword neither height nor depth death or life
the pains of death or the afflictions and sorrows of life can separate from the love of god in christ jesus therefore he fears sin more than all
sin is against god suffering is only afflictive to the creature
it's sin only that causes god to hide his face from us and to set his face against us


when other things come into competition with god this soul that accounts god his all will leave them and cleave to god
if he can't injoy father and mother brethren and sisters houses and lands with god he will leave them all because they are not his all and will cleave to god
as rath left her kindred and her fathers house and joyned her self to naomi and as it's said a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife in like manner will that soul do whose all the lord is as mephibosheth said let ziba take all since the king is returned in peace sam

so saith he let all go am willing to forgo them all if god will return to me in peace and abide with me shall say my lines are fallen in a fruitful place and truly have a goodly heritage
sometimes we may see a

servant following two gentlemen but unto which of these the servant belongs we can't tell until they part asunder and then the servant will go with the one and leave the other
while we can have god and the world both it's hard to say which is our all and which is our master that we desire to serve but when they come to part asunder and we can no longer injoy god and the world together that soul whose all the lord is will resolve with joshua that he will serve the lord and as the needle in the compass leaves all the other points and stands to the north so will he leave all his other injoyments and joyn himself to the lord in an everlasting covenant to love the name of the lord to fear him and serve him for ever


such as these will not be envious at the foolish when they see the prosperity of the wicked
mean this temptation will not abide in and upon them· they will not remain under the power of it though they may be surprized with it but they will soon get out of it
he that makes god his all cannot but see that tho they seem to possess all things yet indeed they have nothing that they are more to be pitied than to be envyed and that they have greater cause to weep and howl even in the fulness of their sufficiency than they have to rejoyce and be glad
it's said of jehoshaphat that he had silver and gold in abundance riches and honour in abundance chron


but his heart was lift up to god in the ways of god he valued not himself by his riches and honour but by his relation to god and interest in him without whom all other things had been but

commodities and of very little account with him
the wicked man's riches honours and good things are his all for what hath he more god pays them their portion in the world's coin and in a little while will say unto them you have received your consolation and then they will wish that they had begg'd their bread with lazarus on earth rather than their water with dives in hell
oh pity these miserable souls they have nothing within them or without them that can do them any good they have nothing but sin within them and that will damn them they have nothing but the world without them and that cannot save them no it will prove a heavy about their necks which will sink them down deeper into the gulf of eternal woe and misery

now pass on to the next which is the verse my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever
where you have the psalmists complaint and secondly the psalmists comfort
in the former part of the verse you find him going forth weeping my flesh and my heart faileth but because he had within him precious seed for light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart this seed is already sown in their hearts and souls therefore in the latter part of the verse we find him returning again rejoycing with his sheaves in his bosom but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever
we will first consider his complaint my flesh and my heart faileth will fail my flesh will fail my heart will fail in a little time he speaks in the present tense to

notifie the certainty of the failure such forms of speech are frequently used in scripture babylon is fallen is babylon shallas surely fall as if it were fallen already
the scripture speaks often of things that will be done as if they were at present done rom
whom he justified them he glorified that is they shall as certainly be glorified as if they were already in the kingdom of glory
thus here my flesh and my heart faileth that is it's sure and certain that it will be so my flesh my heart we are not to understand it exclusivè as if it were only appropriate to himself and were not the case of others as as his no but you are to understand it inclusivè as meant of all that dwell in these fleshly tabernacles and houses of clay this is a common case there is no exemption from this general calamity and affliction the doctrine from hence which shall but briefly insist on is this

doct
that the flesh and the heart of every man will certainly fail

though at present this flesh of ours may flourish as the grass and may be in its beauty as the flower in the field yet as the grass soon withereth and the flower soon fadeth so will it be with our flesh
though at present these hearts of ours may be sound and strong though they are every moment moving and beating in our bosoms always opening or shutting
still busie either in a way of contraction or dilatation but e're long all this work will fail this motion will cease the heart will faint and succumb and the strings of it will be broken in pieces

mans slesh and heart will surely fail shall in a few words animadvert


upon the failing of mans flesh

on the failing of mans heart and then
shew whence this failing proceeds and doth arise and make some brief application


mans flesh that will fail flesh sometimes is taken in scripture sensu morali or rather immorali corrupto in a moral or immoral and corrupt sense for the depraved nature for the unregenerate part in man as in gal


the flesh lusteth against the spirit
rom

in my flesh there dwelleth no good thing
so in gal


the works of the flesh are manifest
but this is not the meaning of it here
though this flesh shall fail and doth fail for in every regenerate soul it is dying daily
sin in the godly hath lost its sword
so that it can't kill it hath lost its scepter so that it can't rule and in a few days it shall lose its being its habitation and residence
the death of the body shall be the destruction of the body of death
now sin is dying in them it hath received a deadly wound but then it shall breathe out its last and live no longer to be a thorn in their eyes or a goad in their sides to vex and disquiet their righteous souls as now it doth from day to day then this cursed inmate shall be turned out of doors and grace shall dwell alone in the soul for ever
this body of death is now under a curse and then the curse of the barren shall fall upon it and no fruit shall ever grow on it more

but secondly flesh is taken and to be understood sensu naturali physico in a natural and physical sense and thus we are to take it here for the fleshly part of man that fleshly substance that our bones are covered withal that fleshly tabernacle in which the soul of man doth dwell this flesh will fail isa

all flesh is grass and the goodliness thereof as the flower of the field the grass withereth and the flower fadeth so will the flesh all the goodliness of it its comeliness strength and beauty all will fail a blast will come upon all which will cause it to wither and decay which will turn it into rottenness and make it become like a garment job

how beautiful soever you may now be in a few days your beauty shall be turned into deformity and how strong soever you at present be it will not be long but this flesh of yours will become so weak that it will not be able any longer to hold the spirit
the lord hath determined a consumption to come upon all flesh isa

and he hath many ways and methods to bring it about as in deut

either by the pestilence or a fever or an inflammation or an extream burning or the sword how many hundred diseases and distempers are there up and down in the world effecting this determined consumption if god give any one of them a commission to come to us and to effect the same as surely at one time or other he will then will our beauty consume away as a moth and this blow of his hand will make our flesh to fail


mans heart will fail
this heart of man which is that part that is primum vivens and ultimum moriens

in him which is first alive and dies last this heart will fail grow cold and die away it dies last but die it must
this strong hold in man will be assaulted and forced nolens volens whether it will or no to surrender to the power of sickness and death sickness will come and closely besiege it one disease and distemper or another will give it a summons then death will come that mighty conqueror and break the very strings of it and so quite subdue it
thus as you read eccles

ver
this golden bowl will be broken and the pitcher will be broken at the fountain and the wheel will he broken at the cistern that is the heart of man with all the instrumental and subservient parts whereby supplies of blood and spirits are conveighed from it into the several parts of the body will break and fail and the offices of these parts will cease and be performed no more


we are to shew from whence this failing doth proceed
the answer to this question hath occasioned many serious thoughts amongst the wise men of this world mean amongst many sage heathens and profound philosophers these evils and miseries they were sensible of and complained of them but the rise and original of them they could not come to the knowledge and understanding of this wisdom and understanding was too deep for them to sound with their line of reason and too difficult for them to attain unto therefore they looked upon death and all the failings and tendences thereunto to be a common tribute laid upon every creature to pay to be an universal law that all mankind must obey·

and submit to and to have the same reason that other mutations and changes have which they did see in the course of nature every day and they could render no other reason but the same which they gave when they saw other things dissolved into their elements this is a common fate sic fata volunt it's so appointed by the higher powers but the reason of the appointment they could not find out
and because they did apprehend no farther it's no great wonder why they did fear death and dissolution no more than they did but rather expected or desired it as a rest from their labours and an end of all their sorrows and miseries

but god hath shewn in his word unto us the true cause of all our woe and the original of our failing and dying that all proceeds from mans sin hinc illae lachrymae from this cursed root of bitterness doth spring and arise all our and gall
rom

by one mans disobedience sin entred into the world and death by sin death with all its appurtenances with all that leadeth to it and all the miseries that follow after it all are the issues and products of sin there had been no sickness no death no failing of heart or flesh had there been no sin
man hath sown unto the flesh and therefore of the flesh must reap corruption gal


sin as naturally produceth these evils as every seed doth produce and send forth its own herb it's this that hath opened the sluce and let in that inundation of miseries that we poor creatures are assaulted and withal
it's storied of a person travelling in germany and beholding the ruins and desolations

which the wars had made there that he said haec sunt peccata germanorum that is these ruins and desolations are the germans sins meaning that their sins and provocations were the procuring causes of all their mischiefs and miseries
james
ver
the apostle proposes a question and gives the resolution of it from whence saith he come wars and fightings with all their mischievous and destructive attendances he tells us they come from the lusts of men that war in their members against the lord and against their own peace comfort and tranquillity
there had been nothing but good seed in the whole creation which would have brought forth good fruit had not man by his sin sowed tares there had been no pricking bryar nor grieving thorn there had been nothing to hurt or destroy in the whole universe had it not been for mans sin man hath sowed the wind and reaps the

we will now make some brief application and so dispatch this point

use

let's all look to this that all be well within with our souls and spirits because these failings and failures will certainly come upon our slesh and our hearts oh look to your souls and ask them often how they do and whither they are not in danger of failing too mean of being lost and undone for ever
oh it's sad to have a failing body and a perishing soul to have a pained and languishing body and to have a pained and dying soul troubles without

and terrors within this must needs be doleful and dismal the spirit of a man will bear the infirmities and failings of the body if that be but sound and in a good condition but if that be wounded and galled with the guilt of sin and apprehensions of wrath what is there then to help us to bear

use ii

let's think seriously of this failing make me to know how frail am psalm

help me to and consider what a poor failing creature am saith david those of you that have bones full of marrow and breasts of milk that are in your health and strength and seem to slourish like the green oh consider this and lay it to heart that your flesh and your hearts must fail before it be long
the lord help us so to consider it that we may apply our hearts to wisdom oh that there were such an heart within us eccles


if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they will be many
oh don't let us forget the days of darkness let us not put away from us the evil days of failing of trouble and affliction because they will assuredly come upon us
some heathens accounted it true wisdom and sound philosophy to meditate often of death to be sure this would be of excellent use and would much conduce to the promotion of piety and true religion if we would be much in meditation on this subject
let it be much in your thoughts in your lying down and in your rising up in your going out and in your coming in at

home and abroad oh consider that your flesh and your heart must fail in a little time
this frequently considered on and often revolved in our minds would by the assistance and operation of the spirit of grace doubtless better us to a far higher degree than yet we have attained unto


we should verily be less earthly than we are did we ponder this more in our hearts than we do
we should not be so much concerned about the body and the things thereof as we are did we seriously consider this certainly men would not spend their days waste their lives prostitute their consciences in making provision for their flesh and in getting supplies for their bodies did they seriously consider that this fabrick of the body this tabernacle of dust this house of clay is falling down about their ears and then what profit will they have of all that they cared for and laboured after under the sun were this well considered we should not be so like the serpent as we are which goes on its belly and seeds on dust
mens souls cleave unto the dust as david speaks though in another sense psal

adhaerent pavimento they are as if they were all flesh and had no spirit to mind at all as if they were all body and had no soul which would not be if this were well considered by us


we should be surely more heavenly than we are if we did meditate more on the failing of our flesh and our heart
we should be more heavenly in our conversations in our communications in our hearts and affections in our labours and indeavours
this

would cause us to groan to be delivered out of this failing tabernacle and to be cloathed upon with our house which is from heaven
here we have no continuing city saith the apostle heb

there is not a house in it but what is failing decaying and even ready to drop down therefore we seek one to come even a city that hath foundations and will never fail whose builder and maker is god

use iii

let's from hence learn to hate sin to a greater degree than yet we do
this is the evil of evils the greatest evil of all evils and the evil that is the cause of all our other evils it's this that doth us all the mischief all our consumptions our pains diseases distempers failings come from this cause
it's strange indeed that men should be in love with their deadly enemy that they should entertain it in their bosoms that they should lodge it so near their hearts that they should nourish this viper which will gnaw out their very bowels and will assuredly feed upon the slaughters and ruins of its dearest lovers
oh if we love our sins we are cruel unto our own souls
if any man among our selves should take away our money should fall upon us and beat and wound us or deprive us of any worldly accommodation how easily can we hate such a person and how hardly be reconciled to him oh learn to hate sin all ye that love the lord hate evil all ye that love your selves that love your souls hate sin there's nothing more prejudicial and destructive to us
this is the enemy that robs

and wounds us this weakens and debilitates our bodies and ruins our souls this is the enemy that separates the soul from the body and god from the soul

thus we have done with the psalmists complaint my flesh and my heart faileth there's the dark side of the cloud we pass on now to the bright side thereof which is the psalmists comfort but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever
thus as in sam


he encouraged himself in the lord his god and in the view and apprehension of the failing of his flesh and his heart these consolations did refresh and delight his soul
here shall only glance a little upon these three particulars which may serve for so many doctrinal observations


that god is the believers strength

that god is the believers portion

that god is the believers everlasting portion

every one of these is a well of salvation out of which with the bucket of faith we may draw out abundance of the waters of consolation to chear our hearts withal in our greatest troubles


god is the believers strength from god he hath strength
to bear his burdens
alas without the strength of god we should faint in the day of adversity because our strength is small god puts underneath his everlasting arms and enables them

to bear he strengthens them with all might by his spirit in the inward man and helps to undergo the miseries infirmities and burdens that are upon the outward man therefore by faith we should cast all our burdens upon him for he hath promised to sustain us psal

he will give us shoulders suitable to our burdens or else suite our burdens to our shoulders


from god he hath strength to do his duties as he gives shoulders for every burden he hath for us to bear so he gives hands for every piece of work he hath for us to do alas without him we can do nothing as the hand can do nothing without the head the body can do nothing without the soul no more can we do without the strength of god therefore where ever there is a command that finds us work there is always a suitable promise to find us strength will cause you saith god to walk in my ways my grace shall be made sufficient for you god doth not deal with us as the egyptian taskmasters did with the israelites who required brick but would give them no straw god doth not require duty and service of us and leave us to get strength to do it where we can no but is pleased graciously to promise that he will give what he doth command and that his spirit shall help our infirmities and that he will strengthen us unto the performance of every good work


from god he hath strength to overcome his corruptions
were it not for the power of god resting on them and working in them these sons of zerviah

would be too hard for them these mighty philistines would certainly vanquish and overcome them
therefore he goes out against them in the name of the lord as david did against that philistine giant sam

knowing that in his own strength he cannot prevail therefore he begs of god to teach his hands to war and to strengthen his fingers to fight that he may be avenged on the enemies of god and of his soul and be made more than a conquerour in and through the strength and power of christ jesus it's from the spirit and strength of christ that any soul is enabled to mortifie the deeds of the flesh without this strength instead of mortifying our lusts our lusts to be sure would mortifie us and lead us captive as it were bound hands and and feet and triumph over us


in god is his strength to stand it out against to resist and to overcome satan's temptations
the tempter is strong and we are weak he did overcome man when he had no sin and gave him a sad fall even then when he was in the rectitude of his nature when there was nothing within to take the tempter's part but now he hath much more power over us because we have a party within us that upon every occasion and temptation is ready to betray us and to deliver us up unto him
so that if we be not kept by the power of god through faith in christ jesus unto salvation we shall undoubtedly come short of the kingdom of god we have not only flesh and blood but principalities and powers to wrestle withal
how shall we quench the fiery darts of the devil how shall we resist his strong temptations when

we are weak as water if we be not strong in the lord and in the power of his might and be not strengthned by the hand of the mighty god of jacob but god tells us that we have more with us than we have against us though the gates of hell and all the power and policy of that kingdom of darkness be engaged against us
he hath assured us that he will be with us and strengthen us and that the gates of hell shall not prevail against us

use learn from hence that such as are without god are without strength you are in the midst of enemies and have no strength to resist them in the midst of dangers and have no strength to fly or make an escape and so to deliver your own souls
you are without strength for active obedience you can do nothing as you ought to do it you are without strength for passive obedience you can bear and suffer nothing as you ought to bear it in a word you have strength for nothing but to fight and rebel against god and in so doing you do but kick against the pricks you wound your own souls and add coals of fire to your eternal flames

use ii
let the people of god have frequent recourse unto their strength
the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous fly unto it and they are safe all is well with them then

let me tell you that you are but a feeble people of your selves every blast of temptation will blow you down every gust of the wind of affliction every wave and billow will overcome and overwhelm you every duty and service will be too mighty for you therefore have recourse to your strength keep close to your strength
you read prov

that the coneys are but a feeble folk therefore they dwell in the rocks
oh go to the rock that is higher than you dwell in the rock and build upon the rock and this rock will be a from the wind a covert from the storm and afford a shadow unto you in a weary land you will find honey in this rock to delight you water in this rock to refresh you strength in this rock to support and bear you up when your flesh and your heart will fail you
this rock will follow you whither soever you go it will never leave you nor forsake you when you go through the fire and the water you will find it present with you as isa

when thou passest thorow the waters will be with thee and thorow the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest thorow the fire thou shalt not be burnt neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
none have such a rock as is our rock we may appeal to the very enemies of god themselves to be judges if they would speak arbitrio sano and judge according to evidence
let us then fly to our rock by faith and prayer let us get into the clefts of it if we build upon this rock and put our confidence in it we shall never be moved


god is the believer's portion
the people of god are the lord's portion and jacob is the lot of

his the lord calls them his pleasant portion deut

god indeed would be very poor in the world and would have no pleasure in the works of his hands were it not for them so god is their portion he hath made over himself by a deed of gift to be their god and their exceeding great reward and here might shew you


what an enriching portion god is

what a soul satisfying portion god is
and
what a portion god is

but have no time to enlarge upon these things if you know god you know it all and abundantly more than am able with words to express
shall therefore only shew you first how they came to have this portion and then secondly make some brief application
first how they came to have this goodly portion and to be instated in such an inheritance which is incorruptible undesiled and that fadeth not away
for answer

first negatively
they were not born to it
some among men are born to great portions and large inheritances these are their and intailed upon them as being the lawful heirs of such and such persons but the lord knows that we are all baseborn because born in sin our father was an amorite and our mother an hittite and so we are become an accursed generation and are heirs of nothing but wrath and hell we did no sooner live but we

deserved to die and no sooner did we see the light but we deserved that god should give us our portion among devils and damned ones in the kingdom of darkness in the womb we were like the cockatrice egg fill'd with deadly poyson and since we came thence we have been like the troubled sea casting forth myre filth and dirt
as we are adam children if god should pay us our portion that belongs unto us it would undo us for ever

secondly they did not get this portion by their own industry labour and diligence
sometimes among men the diligent hand makes rich and persons born to nothing come to acquire great things and to purchase for themselves large revenues
but so it is not here this portion was not acquired by us in this way
alas what were we able to do in order to this whose hearts are deceitful and desperately wicked above all things as god who knows us infinitely better than we know our selves witnesseth of us
we have nothing within us to principle any one good action if the tree be bad so must the fruit of necessity be
if we would attain to this of our selves we must first pay the debt which we owe to justice for our sin and then we must perform that sinless and unspotted obedience which the law demands
both which all the men on earth and may add all the saints and angels in heaven are not able to do
thus negatively


and positively
we are born again to it by the resurrection of jesus christ pet


who hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection

of jesus christ the meaning is that being born again we slie to jesus christ by faith and by his resurrection are assured that god is reconciled and that our peace is made our debt is paid for otherwise he having been arrested and laid in the prison of the grave he had not risen again and come forth from thence if full satisfaction had not been given and thus we come to a lively hope that now we are upon good terms with god and that he is become our father and will be the portion of our souls for ever

use
hence we may be informed that none are so rich as the people of god none so rich in possession none so rich in reversion many of them seem to have nothing yet they possess all things none can tell how rich they are but they that can tell how rich god is for the riches of god are all theirs

use ii

let the people of god make use of their portion is men do for the supply of those things they need they go to their portion and with that procure those necessaries and conveniences which they want
oh let the people of god go to their portion every day and make use of it for all they want for their bodies or for their souls for their inward and for their outward man for time and for eternity there are some men of the world that do not use their portion eccles

ver
there is

a man to whom god hath given riches wealth and honour so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth yet he hath not power to eat thereof
by reason of inordinate love distrustful providence and the incumbrances of earthly imployments they hinder themselves of the injoyment of what they have and so they are poor in the midst of their riches and beggars in the midst of their abundance
there is as it were a spell set upon their estates so that their wealth says to them touch not tast not handle not
they are like the dog in the wheel that toils all the day to roast meat for others eating
truly many of gods own people live exceedingly below their allowance they live as if they had nothing were worth nothing when they have a rich portion they have it but they do not use it what comfort what joy what peace which passeth all understanding might they find in it if they would live by faith upon it

use iii

let all be exhorted to get this portion what will you do when your flesh and your heart faileth if god be not your portion what will you do when death and judgment comes if god be not your portion oh death will be deadly to you if god be not your portion judgment will be terrible and amazing and you will be ready to cry to the rocks to the hills and mountains to fall upon you and to hide you from the wrath of the lamb that sits upon the throne if god be not your portion
oh get this portion told you before that

it is not procured by our indeavour we can't purchase it by all that we are able to do but this is procured by another there is a near kinsman of ours that hath redeemed this morgaged or lost inheritance that is jesus christ the right of redemption did belong to him and he hath done the part of a kinsman for us
now if we will come to him as poor miserable and undone creatures and take this inheritance thankfully out of his hands if we will receive it in his right and submit to his terms which are as reasonable as can be desired then this inheritance is our own and god will become our portion again
oh get this portion or you get nothing get this portion and you get all this portion will make you happy in life and death

if god be your portion if your possessions are lower he will heighten the fruition he can croud in abundance of comfort in a little of the creature
he can make a single dish a feast and the meanest fare suppose a dinner of green herbs to be sweeter and better than a stalled ox with god a small stock will be more comfortable and satisfying than a large revenue
or if he susser us to be bereaved of all he himself will be instead of all
he hath taken to himself the names of all things needful and comfortable to intimate to us that he alone stands for all they signify or are worth
therefore he is called a portion an inheritance an habitation high tower shade strength deliverer friend father husband
to let us know that all these are nothing without him and that he can be all without these·

without this portion when you come to die not angels but devils will receive your souls and eternity will not be the measure of your joys but of your woes oh think of your dying day and how near you may be to that day and be awakened to make sure of this portion
death is riding its circuit up and down every day it will not be long but it will come to us it will come with its sythe and mow us down it will come and take down the glass and stop our breath and tell us that we have lived our last oh then make sure of this portion and he will be your god in life in death and after death to all eternity
make sure of this portion or you will have the wicked mans portion psal

upon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and an horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup


god is their everlasting portion
a portion that they shall never leave a portion that they shall never lose
for we must have a better and a more induring substance than can be had and injoyed here we shall outlive all these things
a portion in this world will not serve our turns because we are hastning away out of this world into an everlasting state and therefore must get an everlasting portion alas a month may devour us and all our portion that we have here hos

yea a week a day a night may devour all but the godly mans portion is everlasting
god saith the psalmist in the text is my portion for ever
there's nothing but god that suits the souls nature nothing but god that can

fill the souls capacities nothing but god that can equal the· souls duration
here is a portion indeed that is coaetaneous with the immortal soul of man
as for all the perfection that is here below we shall soon see an end of it as david said have seen an end of all perfection psal

he speaks not of every kind of perfection but of all the perfections of one kind as for divine perfections and injoyments they have no end therefore an end of them cannot be seen but all humane perfections and injoyments they must and will end
by the sight of his eye he had seen an end of many humane perfections and by the sight of his mind he had seen an end of them all some he had seen already ending and he saw of necessity that all must end
but the godly man hath an everlasting portion a portion that shall survive all the vicissitudes and changes of time in fatal period shall ever come to put an end to their injoyment of this portion to denude or rob them of this precious treasure

to the enjoyment of this blessed and everlasting portion our friend whose death was the occasion of this discourse is gone and now all tears are wiped from her eyes and she is bathing her self in those rivers of pleasures that are at gods right hand for evermore
tho she be dead she yet speaketh she speaketh to her and children that she hath left behind to live godly righteously and soberly in this present world as she did to mind their precious and immortal souls to provide for eterity and to lay a good foundation against the time to come she did
she speaks to us all to be followers of them through faith and patience inherit the kingdom

such a one she was under her long affliction though she groan she never grumbled though she mourned she never murmured her earnest desire was rather to be her affliction sanctified to her than removed from
as to life or death she left it wholly to gods choice chusing infinitely rather to be at his dispose than her own
verily believe that if life and death had been put in a pair of balances she would not willingly have in one dram to turn the balance any way
the king+dom of heaven had already entred into her and she had a longing desire if her time was come and her work done to enter into it

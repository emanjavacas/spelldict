Here endeth the table of this presente booke named the ordynarye of crysten men.
[Figure: Here foloweth a notable treatyse and full neces+sary to all crysten men for to knowe and it is named the Ordynarye of Crystyanyte or of crysten men.
EVery creature resonable vnto who me god hath gyuen mynde vnderstandynge wyll.
Hym ought to knowe serue loue with all his myght as moche for the goodnes and noblenes of his creacyon as well as of his redempcyon of the glory that we trust in.
The whiche thynges be so grete good that no herte them may thynke ne tonge can them declare.
Also he ought to be fered for to eschewe yt payne of eternall dampnacyon.
The whiche is so horryble a thynge oonly to ymagen that there is none erthely herte that by a thousande yeres yf he so longe sholde lyue vpon erthe but yt euery daye he ought to tremble.
And these paynes we may not eschewe ne the goodes of eternall glorye haue ne possed.
Yf we be not obedyent vnto our creatour in kepynge our vowe baptem and in accomplysshynge all his co~maundemente~s.
The whiche to knowe vnderstande euery man ought to put also grete dilygence more as he doth for to saue his corporell lyf.
For otherwyse he may not longe go eschewynge synne nor of the fautes co~mytted ayenst ye wyll of god hym clense repent confesse.
And for as moche vnto ye blessyd trynyte the whiche is the fader ye sone the holy goost one essence of deite and for the helth of soules that the swete Jhesus hath with his holy blood agayne bought Foloweth a breue doctryne true catholyque and ryght necessary for the instruccyon saluacyon of crysten men.
In the whiche shall be spoken pryncypally of fyue thyng{is}.
Of the whiche sayth saynt Poule in the fyrst epystle ad Corinthios that more it is worth and profyteth vnto the saluacyon of soules fyue wordes then. x. thousande.
And vpon that sayth Nycolas de lyre that of these fyue wordes the whiche vnderstandeth. saynt Poule.
The thyrde of synnes ye whiche a man ought to eschewe.
The fourthe of the paynes of helle the whiche a man ought to fere.
And the fyfth of the glory the whiche is without ende that euery man ought to desy+re.
Of these fyue thynges in example of the holy apostell ought to wryte preche teche all they that wyll please god and vnto these soules proufyte all ryght faythfull crysten men the whiche haue desyre to come vnto saluacyon hym ought aboue all thynges to rede or here.
For whoos deth the con+trary hath in hym the sygne of eternall dampnacyon as they that loue better Romayns of warr{is}. of bataylles wrytynges of poetes of these phylosophres erthely.
The whiche make not the lyues examples of holy sayntes and other holy wrytynges that touchen the dede of conscyence and of theyr saluacyon and man sayth that wylfully suche people renneth after ye prechers the whiche pryn+cypaly secheth to speke vnto the worldely people for to go with theyr substau~ce syluer the whiche oftentymes inplye the mynde of them worldely in hye harde curyous questyons by the swetnesse of fayre speche they wrape them brynge them to theyr ende.
So as prophecyed saynt Poule in the pystle vnto the bysshop Thimothee sayeng the ty+me shall come that the worlde wyl no more of the good doctryne and salutary but they shall desyre maysters that them shall tell preche thynges curyous fables the whiche vnto them shall be plea sau~t.
Of the whiche synners wryteth saynt Peter in spekyng vnto crysten men sayth that so as it was of the people of the Jewes fals cursyd prophetes sy~ners so vnto them shall it come for ther shall come aryse amonge them some maysters full of falsenes of cursydnes of disceyte the whi+che shall gyue vnto the people occasyon of theyr pardicyon.
And many shall take and folowe the pathes the wayes of theyr adulteracyon.
Here sayth mayster Nycholas de lyra that the worde of god is the seed he than that soweth this seed for auaryce or for pryde pryncypally renou~ceth wor+de of god his creatour and many ther shall be the whiche shall here gladly here suche prechours not pryncypally for theyr saluacyon or for to correcte theyr vyces or synnes but for ye swete fayre langage of theyr phylosophy these newe thynges curyous the whiche they shall fayne for theyr excu+se and inuencyon and by this forme maner the waye of god of trouth that is of the co~maundementes of the artycles of the fayth shall be blasphemed of suche maner of worldely people curyo{us} the whiche shall disprayse these prechours of the symplenes of the gospell.
And for so moche sayth saynt Gregory that none is wylfully herde yf he please not vnto the herers.
Some of these prechers of the gospell consyderynge ye predicacyon of these worldely maysters afore sayd to be praysed desyred theyr predycacyon dyspraysed shall them enforce to do ayenst them them to folowe in alledgynge phylosophres poetes other not of the gospell by the whiche they shall fall in thraldome of the deuyll of helle in the bonde of god our creatour.
For the holy goost sayth yt they that desyre worldely pleasures in the curyosyte vanyte of theyr desyre come to grete confusyon the gospell these other holy wrytynges in many places vs forbydde ayenst the temptacyon of the fals euyl disceyuable prechours the whiche shal be the token pronosticacyon of the Antecryst as we haue late seen by many experyence in specyal wtin these fyfty yeres shall be seen so that beleue from ylle vnto the worst vnto ye reygne of the fals Antecryst.
And vnderstande of those sy~ners that do lyue otherwyse then that yt our moder the holy chirche vnto them hath lymytted ordey+ned in Sexte of the Decretales in the Chapytre.
And in tho. vij. in the Chapytre the whiche begynneth.
Abusioni{bus} the whiche pryn+cypally secheth not the loue of god nor the saluacyon of theyr soules but golde and syluer after the apetyte of theyr coueytousnes for he that wyl is suche maytene with takynge parte yt suche prechers weren of ye party of Jhesu cryst he hym sheweth a very heretyke and exco~menged then for to eshewe the peryll of this errour dampnaco~n for to resemble aduyse these poore blynde of Jhesu cryst they be all trewe faythful crysten men they shal haue in this present treatyse as of late it hath be sayd fyue partes.
The fyrst parte shall be of ye noblenesse of the trouth of the vowe of crystendome the whiche is made in the sacrament of baptyme also of the .xij. artycles of the fayth The seconde shall be of the .x. co~mau~dementes of the lawe with ye transgressyon of them that be the .vij. deedly synnes.
The thyrde shall be of the .vij. werkes of mercy the whiche werkes shall be holde~ the grete last Jugeme~t and the good ylle shall be examyned these cruwell and coueytous folke vnto deth eternall condempned and these pytous mercyfull people in the glory of paradyse shall be rewarded.
The fourth partye shall be techyng{is} for well¬∑ enterly hym to confesse of synnes ye whi+che he may co~mytte ayenst ye of the fayth of the co~mau~dement{is} of the lawe of good werk{is} that a man leueth to do ayenst ye mercy of god wtout the whiche no man may wel come vnto salua+on for all synne is reherced compryseth in ye co~+missyon in doynge synne or abomynaco~n in leuy~+ge the good the whiche a man is holden bounde to do.
The fyfth the laste partye shall be of the paynes of helle of the Joyes of paradyse.
Also it is to be noted yt as well for to satysfye vnto these clerkes for the more parfectly to conferme yt the whiche is wryten in englysshe as also for to eschewe detraccion of lytell vnderstandynge of symple people put in the heed of this boke in many passages these auctorytees conuocacions allegacions the whiche be made in latyn excepte ye texte of the vowe of baptyme the whiche haue wyll to put worde by worde in this wrytynge for to shewe the charyte ruyne of crysten people in all estates in the whiche they lyuen at this daye.
That is to wyte the .xiiij. daye of January the yere of our lor+de.
M. CCCC. lxvij. after the Natyuyte of our lorde Jhesu cryste after dyuers cronycles maner of nombre the yeres.
In the whiche yere and daye this present boke hath be fyrst begonne to be wryten.
[Figure: Here endeth the prologue and now foloweth the fyrst parte of baptem.
Here foloweth the fyrst parte of this present bo+ke of the vowe and sacrament of baptem.
[Figure: AS vnto the fyrste partye the whiche is of the vowe sacrament of baptem it is to be noted yt after that Jhesu cryst had made publys+she preche solemply the trouthe of the gospell as well by his holy apostles as by other prechers it is impossyble for man to be saued that is not baptysed.
In lyke wyse it is impostyble but that fynally he be saued.
For it is the mouth of god the whithe is the sentence texte of the gospell that so vnto vs wytnesseth wherfore it is a thynge ryght necessary to knowe Fyrste how in what maner the sacrament of baptem ought to be gyuen.
Thyrdely the vertue and the effecte that it hath in the soule of a crysten man.
And fourthly to knowe euery ar+tycle of the fayth in partyculer.
As vnto fyrst that is to vnderstande that to crysten or baptem is as moche to saye as to wasshe and is vnderstande pryncypally of the soule the whiche by the of god is puryfyed hauynge this sacrament from all synne be it pryde venyall or mortall.
And for as moche that ye puyssau~ce of god is not restraynte ne bounde by the institucyon of these sacramen+tes the whiche of pure myght absolueth he may in many maners clense purge the soule it from synne.
The doctours saye that there are thre maner of baptemes.
The fyrst maner is whan ony persone shall by preuylege syngulerly sanctifyed from orygynall synne afore that he be borne or after the pleasure wyll of god as were saynt Jheremy and saynt Johan baptyst.
The seconde whan ony not baptysed vnto the purpose to make hym baptysed in place tyme and befor that he be baptysed he deyeth by martyrdome or otherwyse he may be in the waye of saluacyon yf he haue none other lettynge.
The thyrde is the co~+mune sacramentall the whiche is done by worde water.
And suche sacrament all other ought to be ordynatly executed by man preest or curate as vnto that of Jhesu cryste true god and true man.
But in the caas of necessyte the baptem may be gyuen dewely by euery other persone erthely that may haue puyssau~ce intencyon to do say that that holy chirche doth sayth in admynystrynge solemly suche sacrament.
For yf it so be that there be a man that myght ought to do it a woman ought not it to do yf there were clerke in holy ordres the subdeacon ought not to do it before the deacon nor the lay man before the symple clerke. otherwyse they synne.
And yf ther be oportuny+te of tyme they sholde be it man or woman requyre mercy with grete contricyon of theyr synnes yf they haue remorse of conscyence of deedly synne.
For he that admynystreth or receyueth ony sacrament he ought to be in the state of grace that is as vnto the mynysters of that sacrament.
Also it is to knowe that euery creature erthely not baptysed is bounde to receyue that sacrament as it is sayd in place tyme.
But otherwyse was this oblygacyon accomplysshed at the begynnynge man was not baptysed but in the vigyll of Eester of Whytsontyde they that dewely were cathecumi+nus: that is to saye instructe of the artycles of the fayth of that yt they ought to vowe or promytte But after by the inspyracyon of the holy goost it was ordeyned that these childern forthwith after yt they were borne sholde be baptysed.
For in them is no thynge that may lette the effecte of that sacrame~t as sholde be mortall sy~ne actuel or fiction And that procedeth of the mercy Justyce dyuyne For so as two persones that is to knowe Adam Eue vs bynde all by lawe comonly to synne and dampnacyon wtout our gylte actuell.
So pleaseth vnto the Justyce dyuyne that our fader Jhesu cryst our moder holy chirche sygnifyeth the godfader and godmoder vs promyttynge vnto saluacyon before that we haue vsauuce reason or myght of ony operacyon.
Here foloweth the maner to conferme the holy baptem in the artycle of necessyte.
Of the maner to conferme the sacrament of baptem in the caas of necessyte.
That is to knowe that yf a woman or other symple persone baptyse he ought to take hede vnto ye mater of the sacrament vnto the forme of the wordes and vnto the intencyon.
For man may not be baptysed with wyne with sydre with blood with mylke with vryne with water of roses or other water dystylled but man shal be baptysed in necessyte with lye and with water in the whiche man shall haue smarte in the flesshe.
And it is holy thynge good cou~seyll that a man haue holy water in his house For yf it were wel possyble man sholde not be baptysed with other water.
Also it is to aduyse symple people that yf there apere ony membre of the chil+de in the whiche men knoweth lyf of the whiche he fereth the deth before that it be borne {per}fectly he it sholde baptyse in that membre the whiche apereth.
Also yf the moder passe this lyf before the na+tyuyte of the childe ye whiche a man byleueth truly lyf in her he ought hastely to gaffe her mouth after dyscretly open the bely of the woman bap+tyse the lytell childe yf it be fou~de on lyue yf it be founde deed it ought not to be buryed within the holy grou~de yf the moder hath not ben slayne put to deth for the loue of god or for the trouth of the fayth.
For in suche caas may doctours holde yt ye childe sholde be martyr.
For it is more to fere to playne where a childe deyeth without the receyuyn+ge the sacrament of baptem then it doth of the de+struccyon the fallynge in to depnes of all ye to wnes castelles cytees of the worlde.
In the whiche apereth the grete synne the grete blame of those the whiche them gouerne ylle in this mater what so euer maner it be in.
As vnto the forme that is those wordes the whiche he ought to saye he behoueth to take hede vnto theym that be ordeyned of god of holy chirche as well in caas of necessyte as of solempnyte.
That is to knowe Ego baptiso+te In nomi~e patris et filij et spiritus sancti amen.
baptyse the in the name of the fader of the sone of the holy goost.
Or in other langage or wordes betokenynge the same sentence For one may baptyse in all maner of langages And it behoueth that the wordes the doynge that is to put the water vpon the childe be holy in ony wyse togyder.
That is to saye that before that he hath sayd all these wordes he haue begonne to put the water or before that he hath endeth to put the water he begynne the wordes for otherwyse there is no baptyme.
That is to knowe yf a man saye all these wordes after put the water or fyrst endeth to put the water after sayth these wordes.
As to the entencyon that is to knowe that at the lest that persone the whiche baptyseth ought to ha+ue intencyon to do that that our moder the holy chirche intendeth co~mau~deth to do it may suf+fyse suche generall intencyon so that he byleueth the same or haue in his intencyon yt the sacrame~t of baptem purefyeth man from all synne or these wordes afore sayd suffyse.
That is baptyse the in the name of the fader of the sone of the holy goost that he saye not with that of our lady of saynt Johan or of thynge lyke he hath not than baptym for the intencyon the whiche is of necessyte of the sacrame~t is not good nor ryghtfull.
Of other cases diffycultees the whiche be in this mater sholde these curates prechers somtyme shewe in publysshynge for these dyuers pyteous cases the whiche by Ignoraunce may come in many places of crystendome.
The seconde thynge pryncypally to be consydered in this mater is of ye forme maner the whiche is moost comonly holden in the holy chirche of Rome in baptysynge solemply in the whiche shall holde this maner ordre.
Fyrst shal declare what it is to saye exorciser and cathecyser.
Secondely shal put the latyn as well of the ordynary as of the orysons other thy~+ges soo as men vse in the chirche moost comonly.
And thyrdely shal put the subitau~ce of the latyn afore sayd in englysshe the significacion of that that is done sayd after ye exposicyon of some doctours in holy theology.
As vnto ye fyrst that is to knowe that the exorcysyon cathecysacyon ought to procede the baptem but for the good vnderstan+dynge the whiche is exorcyser that is to be noted yt whan Adam Eue vnto whome god had gyuen dominacyon of all the morlde disobeyed vnto god the deuyll toke power vpon theym in lyke wyse vpon all theyr dominacyon as were the ayre ye wa+ter these other creatures the whiche were made create for man.
And than the deuyll hym called Prynce of the worlde but Jhesu cryst is comen for to fyght wt hym to put hy~ out of that yt he helde by tyranny.
And for so moche all these thyng{is} the whiche be spoken co~secrate vnto god vnto his dyuyne seruyce as chirches chircheyardes awters corporaces chalyces towelles vestymentes apperteynynge vnto ye holy mysterye of the awter be exorcyses by the benediccion by the holy oryson of preestes bysshops.
That is to saye yt the puyssau~ce of ye enmye infernall is coniured put out of these sayd thynges.
And for as moche ye lytell childe is in the power dominacion of ye deuyil by the sy~ne of our fornfads whiche ought to be by the holy sa+crament of baptem wtsayd halowed ye ryght holy temple of the holy goost deputed vnto ye dyuyne seruyce of Jhu cryst of the holy chirche catholyke he ought to be exorcysed.
And yf it so were that sa+me lytell childe were baptysed in ye of necessyte wtout beynge cathecysed or exorcysed he lyne a man ought then after beseche do ye of exorcysacion.
In ye whiche after Rychard demy ville be made many thynges so as it appereth in declarynge ye text.
And yt is as now of ye exorcysion rest to see what it is to saye signifye cathecyset Cathecyser is as moche to saye as to instructe or+teche ye fundacions artycles necessary of our holy fayth.
For all they yt ought to be baptysed {pro}mytt to kepe ye fayth co~mau~deme~t{is} they shold fyrst be taught.
For our lorde co~mau~ded vnto ye apostles daye of his blessyd Ascenco~n to go thrugh ye world to teche baptyse fyrst teche to baptyse for as moche at ye begynnyng of ye holy chirche this was kept yt none were baptysed vnto yt yt he we+re suffycyently cathecysed yt is instructe taught of ye pryncyples artycles of ye fayth.
And duryng the tyme yt they lerned the lawe in good purpose to be baptysed men dyde them calle Cathecumin{us} in this astate degree abode saynt Martyne by the space of. viij. yeres for at. x. yeres were made ca+thecumine at. xviij. yere were baptysed.
But after yt Crystendome was moche augmented mul+teplyed the blessyd holy goost hath enspyred ye holy chirche of the maner to do it more certen {pro}fyta+ble.
That is yt these childern sholde be baptysed as soone as they be borne for ye peryls lettyng{is} that may come in so moche yt the godfaders godmoders them bynde vnto god holy chirche yt whan they haue age dyscrecyon that they shall lerne them the lawe of the fayth these thynges apper+teynynge necessary vnto theyr saluacyon yf the naturall fader or moder or other them teche.
And for so moche sayth saynt Thomas in his quart yt whan the godfaders or godmoders saye Credo it is as moche to saye after one exposicyon as promytte to put true herte diligence to instructe this childe whan he shall haue wytte discrecyon for to vnderstande that the whiche is of necessyte vnto saluaco~n for as moche as it apperteyneth vnto pre+lates and curates to teche theyr subiectes generall how be it apperteyneth in partyculer in especyal vnto ye godfaders godmoders for to teche them for whome they be bou~de.
In the whiche appereth the grete merueyllous peryll of many godfaders or godmoders the whiche to teche that that they knowe not.
In so moche that in the more parte or all at this daye breke yt {pro}messe.
By ye whiche moche of these yonge people come to an euyll ende byleue verely that is the defaute of fayth and these ylles that we see come rathely in the more grete parte of that defaute.
Wherfore pryncypaly haue be moued to declare and wryte this mater for as no thynge it is to repayre the hyenes of the buyldynge where the fundaco~n is ruynous that suffysed as now of ye exorcysme cathecysme.
For the maner the practyse is declared here after more in partyculer to the entente that symple peo+ple may vnderstande that they haue vowed promysed vnto baptem the noblynes and dygnyte of crystendome the forme maner as they haue sayd in the temple of ye holy goost and of that as vnderstande these good faythfull crysten men in lyke wyse as they may vndstande the falle ruyne of the peryl the grete ylle in the whiche is become ye more partye of crysten men the whiche kepe not neyther fayth nor co~maundementes.
And also that they the whiche them well reforme crye god mercy them repent confesse not despayrynge themself may haue by this wrytynge the forme maner and the waye to retorne vnto swete Jhesus the whiche doth them calle abyde his armes spredde promyttynge yf by this waye or by other whyle that it is tyme them conuerte that he vnto them shall pardone the transgressyon treason of brekynge the fayth.
Here foloweth the texte of the offyce of baptem with the exposicyon in englysshe.
In sufflo te diabole in noi~e patris et filij et spiritus sancti amen. vt exeas et recedas ab hoc famulo dei. N. Exi ab eo i~mu~de spirit{us} da locu~ aduenie~te spirituisancto paraclito.

HEre begynneth ye ordre maner of baptem whan it is done solemply.
Fyrst at ye chirche dore not wtin ye childe is offred vnto ye preest who demau~deth ye childe a questyon what axest yu what wylt yu haue or where wylt yu become.
And they yt it present answere for hy~ in his {per}sone requyre crystendom.
And after yt preest demau~ded what name wylt yu haue ye godfad or both two togyd answer for childe John or els after yt yt they hy~ wyll name Then ye preest bloweth vpon ye childe sayeng to deuyll of helle ye whiche hath puyssau~ce dn~acyon vpon ye lytell child for ye gylte of origynal sy~ne enmy blawe ye in ye name of ye fad of ye sone of ye holy goost ye co~mau~de yt yu go forth depart from this create which yu holde in thy seruyce cometh to ye seruyce of god de{per}te yu forth wt spiryt of da~pna+cion gyue place to the holy gost to come reforme cou~sell this soule.
After yt sayd maketh the preest the sygne of the crosse in the forhede in the brest of the childe sayeng put the sygne of the lyuyng god of Jhu cryst in thy forhede in thy brest.
Vpon this mystery a man myyt make a questyon yf ma~ ought to say vnto the childe exeas recedas ab hoc famulo tuo vel dei yt is to saye depart you fro~ hy~ or this thy seruau~t or yf a man ought to say de{per}te you fro~ this thy seruau~t or seruau~t of god.
The answer men fynde in some bok{is} ye seruau~t of the deuyll yt may be one vndstande one other how be it there semeth well to be grete dyfference bytwene seruau~t of god the deuyll.
For it is a thynge i~possyble to be seruau~t of god ye deuyll togydbut they yt haue in wrytyng in theyr bok{is} the seruau~t of ye deuyll speke as for ye houre present for the childe is not ye seruau~t of Jhu cryst tyll vnto the water of baptem yf he dey befor yt he hath recey+ued yt water in ye name of ye fad sone ye holy gost he sholde not be in ye way of saluaco~n as sayth Ci+pryan.
And saynt Thomas reherced it in his boke wherfor ye lytell childe may saye faythfully in the o{per}acion of deuyll not the seruau~t of god the whiche callen before baptem the seruau~t of god vndstanden tyme to come after yt the mystery shalbe ended which is now begonne.
And for so moche yt this solempnyte of the exorcyson cathecyson is not of ye insence necessyte of baptem ther is no grete peryll or dyfference to rede ye one or the other so yt he vndstandeth holy.
Also by the exsufla+cion yt the preest doth vpon the childe betokeneth yt he chaffeth put out power of euyll spiryte which hy~ inforseth to let euery good werke.
Also by the sygne of the crosse made and put in the for+hede in the brest is the toke~ that the child taked vtue myght to resyste the deuyll openly it ape+reth by the crosse made in the forhede in the secretnes of conscyence made in the brest.
After these thyng{is} befor sayd the preest maketh his prayer to god in the thyrde persone with all the holy chirche in this maner.
PLeaseth it the blessyd lorde god to exalte my prayer and my desyre and clamour may come before the true god eternall.
And all myghty fader of our lorde Jhesu cryst pleaseth it to beholde this thy seruau~t whom it hath lyked the to drawe calle at the begynnyng of knowlege of the lawe the it pleaseth to wt thy gce to breke the bou~des of the deuyll of the whiche he hym helde enlasyd.
Also pleaseth the ve+ry god to open hym the yate of thy mercy hym gyue the token of the true sapyence by the whiche he may eschewe the power of all coueytousnes erthely to receyue the swete odour of thy holy co~mau~deme~tes by the whiche he the may Joyously serue in the holy chirche.
Also to profyte from day to daye to the ende that by that medecyne he haue dysposycyon to receyue the grace of thy baptem.
And that we requyre in the vertue and in the name of our lorde Jh~u cryst Amen.
Also it is to be noted that the preest that consecrat vnto god be in the estate of grace out of deedly synne whan he doth solemply the offyce the whiche apperteyneth vnto a preest he is the mynyster and seruaunt of all the holy chirche and speketh vnto god for and in the name of hym.
And for so moche the clergye the whiche sygnyfyeth and representeth the chirche answereth Amen.
That is to saye we requyre all that it soo be as thou haste sayd and demaunde.
And for that that the holy chirche vnyuersally and comprehendeth alle the holy college of paradyse all the holy creatures of this worlde and of purgatory the blessyd swete Jhesus the whiche is cheyf capytayne of al the holy chirche Beholdeth pryncypally the merytes of these holy orysons that these preestes maketh be they good or ylle where by ye lyght of true fayth of holy contemplacyon he shall see the virgyne Mary all the holy college of paradyse hym yt moost is the blessyd swete Jhesu cryst in so moche that man praynge besechyng the maieste of god that it wolde please hym to pardon vnto this childe the orygynall gylte hym gyue grace that he may be the membre of Jhesu cryst of the college company of all sayntes sholde well be fulfylled of the swetnes admiracyon.
Also we sholde ma+ke that our lorde Jhesu cryst vnto vs hath taught co~maunded to requyre axe in his name saynge truely saye you that yf ye demau~de ony thyn+ge of god my fader in my name he shall gyue it you.
And for as moche our moder the holy chirche holdeth this forme that in the ende of these Orysons he putteth per dn~m nostru~ xp~m.
Man de+maunded in the name of Jhesus whan he asketh thynges that before the glory of god the saluacyon of soules.
And it is impossyble that who so demaundeth that that he ought to demau~de so that he de+maunde as he ought that it be refusyd.
For god hath sayd with his mouth that al they the whiche axe so as it is sayd that they shal receyue theyr askynge and petycyon.
¬∂Here shall the preest make a crosse in the forhede of the childe sayenge.
PReces nostras quesum{us} clementer exau+di et hu~c famulu~ tuu~ crucis dominice cui{us} impressione cu~ signam{us} virtute custodi vt magnitudinis glorie tue rudime~ta serua~s {per} custodia~ ma~dato{rum} tuo{rum} ad noue regenerationis gracia~ {per}uenire mereatur.

AFter these thynges aboue sayd ye preest ma+keth agayne ye sygne of ye crosse wt ye thom+be in the forhede of the childe wt suche an oryson very lorde of all ye worlde we requyre yt of thy swete mekenes yt it wyll please the to receyue our pray+ers yt is that yu kepe defende this thy seruytour or seruau~t vnto whome we haue enprynted in the forhede the sygne of ye crosse vnto yt entent that he may kepe the instrucco~n of thy co~mau~deme~t{is} yt he may come vnto the glory of ye newe regenera+cion yt is of the holy fonte of baptem of yt we requyre the in ye name in vertue of our sauyour Jh~u cryst ame~.
And so it ought to be vndstande as it is specifyed before ouer al where theris {per} dn~m nr~m Also here foloweth an other oryson in suche maner Very god the whiche hast made formed hu+mayne lygnage afterwarde hast reformed Pleaseth it to receyue in adopcion this newe lyf wryte among these child of newe testame~to to ende yt by thy holy he may receyue yt yt he may not haue by nature.
And so it apereth yt by thre tymes wtin a lytell whyle hath ben marked wt soke~ of the crosse he yt sholde be baptysed thre orysons vnto god presented in tokenynge vertue of holy baptem that yt is made cometh {pro}cedeth aboue all of yt holy blyssed trynyte.
And of yt we haue a fygure in baptem of our lord as where he shewed hy~ vnto the blessyd trynyte euydently.
God ye fad in the voys whiche sayd here is my sone god the holy goost in symylytude of a douue and god the sone in our humanyte.
EXorciso te creatura salis In noie dei patris omipote~tis in caritate dni~ nostri iesu xp~i et in spiritussancti. exorciso te {per} deu~ viuu~. {per} deu~ veru~. {per} deu~ sanctu~. {per} deu~ te ad tutella~ humani generis et populo venienti ad crudelitate~ {per} seruos suos precepit.

Here he putteth the salt in to the childes mouth askynge his name sayenge.
Accipe sal sapiencie vt sit tibi dn~s {pro}piciatus in vitam eterna~ Amen.
AFter these thynges aboue sayd the preeste exorcysed the salte sayeng.
coniure in the the puyssau~ce of the dyuyll in helle in ye name of god fader omnypotent in ye charyte of our lorde Jhu cryst in the vertue of ye holy goost.
coniure the from the lyuynge god from the true god from the holy god from god the whiche the created vnto the deffence consolacyon of humane lygnage co~maunde that thou flee consecrated for the pro+fyte of the people that wyll come vnto the trouth of the fayth.
And for so moche our blessyd god lorde we the requyre that this creature of salte be made suche sacrament in the name of the blessyd trynyte that he may chasse the deuyll.
The which salte thou wylt our blessyd lorde in halowynge halowe in blessynge blysse.
To the ende that this medecyne abyde in the soule of all them that it receyue in the name in the vertue of our lorde the whiche shall come for to Juge the quycke and the deed this present worlde shall make brenne by fyre amen.
Than the preest taketh the salt so halowed in demau~dynge the name of the childe it puttynge in his mouth sayenge.
Take now the salt of true sapyence to ye ende yt it may please god to gyue the grace for to come to the lyf eternall Amen.
HEre is to be noted as for the entent of thyn+ges afore sayd as for those that folowe the whiche in this solempnyte of exorcysm{us} or of coniuracyon of the deuyll some thynges they make in operacyon wtout all only the whiche thynges are not in the soule materyally.
But they betoken thy~+ges spirytuell as in puttynge the salt in yt mouth of the childe he puttynge of ye spotell of the preest in his nosetrylles in his eeres he makynge the crosse with the holy oyle in the brest bytwene the sholders.
Also after the baptem he maketh ye crosse with the holy vpon the childes heed he put+teth on hym afterwarde the whyte robe the which is called the crysome.
And of the signifycacyon of all these thynges shall be sayd euery thynge in his ordre.
These other thynges be the whiche signifye make that that they signifye in these thyng{is} there is dede worde as in the coniuracyon of the deuyll whan the preest vnto hym sayth.
Cursed dampned spiryte departe then forth wt from this creature as it is also the imposicyon of the hande of other thynges that folowe.
They sygnifye make ryally in dede that that these wordes sygnifye.
And it so be mayster Guillyam durau~t it pre+ueth in his quart by reason by auctoryte.
The blyssed holy goost ye whiche may not fayle or bere fals wytnes gouerneth illumy+neth the chirthe in all thynges syngulerly in the solempnyte custome of the seuen sacramentes.
Wherfore it behoueth to saye that these wordes these dedes that man holdeth kepeth in the custo+me of the chirche in executynge these sacramentes be not made for no thynge with thynkynge but ryally truely make sygnifye the thynges befo+re vnto that is ye auctoryte of saynt Au+gustyn the whiche that these lytell childern be blowed on exorcysed by the preest to ye entent that they be put out delyuered from the puyssau~+ce of the deuyll to the entent that they haue not in theyr soules ony lettynge to receyue the grace of god to be made and consecrated the temple of the holy goost.
Rest than to see what sygnyfyeth vs the salte so nobly consecrated and put in to the childes mouth.
For the fyrst of his dyner is not oonly to moche salt but as vnto the trouth it is but salt.
And it is now manytested that it is not gyuen to hym for substaunce or reteccyon but for some sygnyfycacyon spyrytuell.
The whiche sygnyfycacyon vnto vs is gyuen for to vnderstande by the proprete naturell of salte the whiche is moche more gretter and larger in foure maners.
The fyrst is that the salt dryeth the erthe in suche a maner that she may not ony herbes gyue or brynge forth after the salte.
The secon+de is that it gyueth sauouor vnto the metes.
The thyrde is that it keppeth the meetes from putrefyenge and from roynge.
And the fourth that it is made of the water of the see by the force of fyre.
The fyfth is that god co~maunded vnto Moyses that in all the sacryfyces the whiche he offred that he sholde put salt therto.
And by these propretees vnto vs is fygured truely as wytnesseth the holy scrypture the noble vertue of sapyence and of dyscrecyon by the whiche man deserueth bytwene good and ylle and bytwene the more goodnes and the lesse goodnes and bytwene the more ylle and the lesse or the moost lytell.
And for so moche he that hath the trewe sapyence of Jhesu cryst and of a good crysten man he deserued and consydereth the dyfference bytwene the greate vertue and goodnes of the glory of paradyse eternall and the greate ylle of dampnacyon without euer to haue ende.
Also bytwene these lytell temporall and worldely goodes and the trewe goodes of the soule as ben the greate graces of god his vertues and his merytes and dyspraysen these lytell worl+dely goodes for the loue of the greate myghty souerayne and fereth and fleeth the greate horryble paynes of helle and secheth and desyreth the glorye of paradyse.
By the whiche he is fulfylled in his spyryte of all desyres erthely vayne and worldely and desyreth not to fructefye neyther to encrease with the goodes of the erthe by auaryce or by other ylle maner wayes agayne the sapyence dyuyne.
And this is for to the fyrst proprete of the salte the whiche dryeth the erthe.
Also the good crysten man putteth reason and discrecyon in his thoughtes and wordes and in his dedes.
By the whiche they be fwete of sauour and pleasaunte vnto god and vnto his neyghbours.
And that is for to vnderstande by the seconde proprete of the salte the whiche gyueth sauour to all meetes.
Also it kepeth hym from all ylle or euyll example and to gyue occasyon of ylle and hym enforceth for to please god and to conferme hym vnto those holy persones.
By the whiche waye he may gyue vnto his neyghbours example to do wel lyue well.
And this is to be vnderstande by that that the salte kepeth from stenche gyueth good odour.
Also the salt of dyscrecyon is made of the water of deuocyon and of fyre of tiue dyleccyon.
Also fastynge almesdede prayer or other sacrifyce that man may thynke vnto god hym pleaseth not yf it be not with the salt of dyscrecyon.
They that haue left the salt of discrecyon of crystendome supposynge that they be full of wysdome brutale deuylesshe and worldely as be they that haue theyr hertes more in the world then vnto theyr sal uacyon.
And for one carnall pleasur or some good transytorye lese the grete goodes of eternall glory.
The whi+che is as moche to saye as ben vncrystened made as in maner forsakyng theyr fayth as vnto spi+rytuall vnderstandynge of these there ben with out nombre.
By the whiche they shall be departed from god and with the angels foles in the paynes of helle the one with the other all togyders amonge these deuylles.

After the salt put in the childes mouth the preest in his owne persone with all the holy chirche maketh this prayer.
Trewe god aboue all holy faders fontayne of all trouth we the beseche requyre that it wolde please the swetely to behol+de hym or her thy seruaunt or seruytour in suche maner that yu vnto hym wyll grau~te that in castyn ge this fyrst refeccion of salt neuer may haue hongre.
That is to say that he haue alwaye wysdome and dyscrecyon suffycyent in all thynges the whiche appertayned vnto saluacyon and that he be replete of heuenly meetes to the ende that he haue desyre of spiryte in seruynge the by true hope.
And that it may please the very god hym to conduyte vnto the holy regeneracyon to the entent that he may come vnto the here the whiche thou hast promysed vnto all faythfull crysten men.
THe god of Abraham of Ysaac and of Jacob the whiche apyred vnto Moyses in the mounte of Synay the whiche drewest thy people the childern of Israell of Egypte vnto them geuynge by thy swete pyte an holy angel for to kepe them daye nyght we the requyre that in lyke wyse thou wylt do vnto hym or her thy seruytour or seruau~t suche grace that he may come vnto the holy welle of baptem.
By this oryson is eneweth euydentely sheweth that the baptem was auncyently fygured whan the people of god by myracle and puyssaunce dyuyne and by the seruyce and mysterye of angelles passed thorugh the reed see and were put out of Egypte and from the subieccyon of Pharaon.
For by the baptem men gooth from the derkenes of synne and cometh vnto the lyght of grace and from the of the deuyll vnto the seruyce of Jhesu cryst and man receyued the co~maundementes vpon the hyghe mountayne of the true fayth.
And so moche after this oryson the preest sayth vnto the deuyll.
CUrsyd deuyll knowe thou thy sentence gy+ue maugre thy wyl honour vnto god the ta+der vnto Jhesu cryst his sone vnto the blessyd holy trynyte departe thou forthwith from this the seruytour or seruau~t of god.
For ye blessyd plea+sure mercy of Jhesu cryst is to calle hym now to his grace vnto the holy welle of baptem.
And we defende the that thou be not so hardy for euer to do vyolence vnto the holy token of the crosse the whiche we put in his forhede.
GOd of heuen of erthe god of angels god of archangels god of propheses god of apostles god of martyrs god of confessours god of virgyns god of all good lyuers vnto whom euery tonge oweth confessyon of trouth and before whome euery creature celestyall terrestyall infer+nall hym inclyneth we the requyre our souerayne lorde that it wyll please the to conduyte brynge this mayden vnto the holy fonte of baptem.
And here the preest sayth agayne that the whiche is before wryten vnder this worde.

BE thou incertayne sathanas that paynes tormentes waylynges eternall approche vnto the.
For the daye of Jugement wherof thou owest to meruayll fere as man doth a brennynge ouen enbraced with fyre at whiche daye thou all thyn angeles apostates shall be eternally fynaly condampned.
And for so moche accursyd and lately dampned the whiche ayen at the sayd daye of Jugement shalt be condampned gyue honour vnto god the fader vnto Jhesu cryst his sone vnto the holy goost in name in the vertue of the whiche fader holy goost.
ye co~mau~de how be it yt yu be acursyd spiryte fedynge yt yu go thy wayes departe from this the seruau~t of god the whiche our blessyd sauyour Jhesu cryst as at this daye wylled to calle vnto his holy grace benedic+cyon vnto the holy fonte of baptem to ende he be made the temple of god by the water of rege+neracyon in remyssyon of all in name in vertue of the same our lorde Jhesu cryst whi+che wt the holy goost shall come for to Juge the ly+uynge deed this present worlde amen.
These thyng{is} beforsayd made acco~plysshed axen name of the childe taketh the spetell of his mouth vpon his thombe in touchynge ryght eere the nosetrylles left eere of sayd childe saynge vn+to ryght eere.
Effeta yt whiche is as moche to saye make openynge vnto nosetrylles speke.
By the ryght eere to vs may betoken yt wylfully we shold here good doctryne whiche vnto vs is signifyed by the spetell of the preest.
By spetell put in to nosetrylle whiche receyuen good odour by whi+che the brayne is comforted vnto vs is signifyed swetnes pleasure yt a good spiryte ought to take in holy doctryne.
By coniuraco~n whiche is made vnto left eere is vnderstande he ought to put out of vs all euyll thoughtes euyll opera+cyons to shewe all occasyon the whiche myght ste+re vs vnto ylle.
And whan the persone is in suche dysposycyon he is worthy to be receyued to the co~pany of faythfull crysten men and vnto hym one may saye this fayre worde of the gospell.
Enter now in to the Joye of thy lorde Jhesu cryste.
And therfore these thynges done accomplysshed they enter in to the chirche with the lytell childe sayenge.
Pater noster and Credo in deum of the whiche shall be spoken here after more playy.
And afterwarde the is brought vppon the holy fontayne and the preest demau~deth agayne to here the name of the childe.
And whan one hym hath named than he demaunded hym renou~cest thou Sathan.
Yet agayne the preest demaundeth renou~cest thou all the pompes of the deuyll.
And this renuncyacyon done the preest hym maketh the crosse of the halo+wed oyle the whiche is the oyle of the cathecumin{us} on the brest bytwene the sholders sayenge.
the anoynte wt oyle of helth in brest bytwene the sholders in vertue of our lorde cryst to ende that thou haue euerlastynge lyf in the worlde of worldes amen.
¬∂Also it is to be noted that many of the mysteryes afore sayd be done at chirche dore not wtin for to shewe none may be of the no~bre of faythfull cryste~ men nor enter in chirche of the royalme of paradyse yf he be not purefyed from all grrour the whiche is vnderstande by the cathecysme from all synne the whiche is vnderstande by the exorcysme.
Also by the renunciacions is gyuen to vnderstande that he renou~ceth specyally vnto thre synnes.
That is vnto pryde vnto coueytous vnto lechery or vnto synne the whiche is all oonly at wyll vnto hym the whiche is in wyll in operacyon withoutforth.
Also by ye token of the crosse in the brest is sygnyfyed the loue of Jhesu cryst and of his holy passyon the whiche the good crysten man ought to haue in his herte in his wyll.
By the token of the crosse bytwene ye shol+ders vppon the whiche man bereth the burden is sygnyfyed the obedyence of the .x. co~mau~dement{is} For as no thynge it is sayd that he loueth Jhesu cryst or that he is a crysten man yf he kepe not his co~mau~dementes.
By the holy fonte where the chil+de is brought to vs is gyuen to vnderstande sig+nifyed the blessyd mystery of passyon in the crosse for there is it fou~de the fontayne of eternall lyf in the whiche the childe is wasshen bayned purefyed from the tache meselerye of all synne the yate of paradyse to hym is opened vnto that sygnifycacyon our lorde wylled that his holy syde to hym were opened.
Out of whiche yssued blood water in grete habundau~ce to the ende that he shewed that by the blood the payne by the water the gylte vnto vs ben by the holy baptem all enterly pardonned for yf a persone hadde lyued an hondred yeres before that he had ben baptyfed and in those hondred yeres he had slayne fader moder done all the synnes that may be sayd or thought afterwarde he comed in true intencyon vnto holy baptem yf yt he deye incontynent, after the baptem or lyue a longe tyme without mortall synne venyall dye in this estate it is in the innocence of baptem he sholde go all ryght vnto pa+radyse wtout ony payne suffryng for the synnes be forsayd for the paynes is lately payd by ye pryce of the blood of Jhu cryst the yate open by the which theris no lettynge to enter the realme of paradyse.
And vpon this may some thy~ke or make aquestyo~ yf it sholde be a {pro}fytable thynge to dyffer the bap+tem tyll yt yt one seeth hym in some artycle of deth. maketh hy~ to be baptysed for to haue remissyon of payne of gylte of all the synnes of tymes past the answere.
It is more worth to be baptysed to lyue from yought in crystyente for the good yt one doth before the baptem is not merytorious nor wor+thy of ony remuneracion eternall in paradyse By the whiche after yt as sayth Frau~ces de maronis it is more worth to a persone the whiche hath lyued an hondred yeres in this worlde there hath done no good in all these hondred yeres but to saye one pater noster in the state of g~ce than to be a .L. M. yere in purgatory afterward to haue the hyre of the sayd pater noster than to be baptysed in the en+de of an hondred yere than for to go wtout purgatory al ryght in to paradyse wtout the meryte of the sayd pater noster.
And the reason of yt is suche for the hyre of the pater noster sayd in the state of grace shalbe infynyte the sayd payne of the hon+dred yere shalbe infynyte.
Now is it all clere yt it is more better to seche good tresour infynyte then to shewe temporall payne hauynge an ende all be it that it be grete.
And so it appereth yt the ymagyna cyon to abyde hym to baptyse tyll vnto the ende of his lyf for to haue playne remyssyon of payne of gylte it sholde not be resonable sure nor profytable.
AFter these thynges aboue sayd done acco~+plysshed the preest enquyred ayen the name of the childe the whiche name herde reherced he hy~ demau~ded John peter or otherwyse.
Byleuest yu in god the fader o~nypotent creatour of heuen of+erthe.
Than the childe by the mouth of the godfad godmod sholde answere Credo.
Byleuest yu in Jhesu cryst the sone of god the fader souerayne lorde that for vs wylled to be borne deye ye answere so byleue.
Byleuest yu in the holy goost the holy churche catholyke the co~munyon of sayntes the remyssyon of synnes the resurreccyon of ye body the lyf eternall.
Than the preest demau~ded in the name of all the holy chirche what demau~dest yu they answere the holy baptem.
Also ye preest demau~ded wylt yu be baptysed as yf he wolde say yu demau~dest of god of holy chirche a grete thynge.
Then the preest demau~ded his name the whiche herde knowen he putteth water on his heed thre tymes sayeng.
baptyse in the name of the fad of the sone of the holy goost ame~. Vpon these thyng{is} beforsayd one myyt demau~de wherfore the preest axed so often by so many tymes the childes name.
The answere it is for to teche to shewe as how by ye holy baptem childe is wryten named in paradyse in so moche yt all the saynt{is} of heue~ as of this worlde or of pur+gatory hy~ receyue in to the co~pany participaco~n of ther prayers meryt{is} as longe as he wyll kepe the noble state yt he {pro}mysed receyued.
Also he is ayen named to ye co~fusyon of ye deuyl of helle ayen whom he entred in to the felde for to fyght it is wryten regystred in ye wages souldery of ye holy kyng of glory Jhu cryst for al holy chirche fro~ hy~+beneth is ayded strengthed by euery lytell childe baptysed all holy chirche ye co~pany of paradyse receyuen a newe Joye gladnes god is praysed glorifyed in the heue~s.
Also a man may axe a questyon wherfore he is demau~ded yf he byleue in the fad in the sone in the holy goost.
For in yt is conteyned all ye substau~ce of our fayth in the vertue myght of yt blessyd infynyte trynyte he ought to receyue the vtue theffect of the holy baptem.
Also wherfor it is demau~ded hy~ .iij. tymes yf he wyll be baptysed .iij. tymes he answered wyll be baptysed.
For to shewe yt he ought a stedfast wyll to be crystened in the depnes of his herte wtout hauyng ficcion in his worde confessyon to shewe it by his conuersacyon by good operacyon example.
Also wherfor the water is put on hy~ .iij. tymes sayeng.
baptyse the in the name of ye fad of the sone of ye holy goost.
It betokened by the water of baptem he is wasshen clense fro~ all synne be it of of dede or of thought be it mortall actuall or
Also for this mystery is made in the name of al ye blessyd trynyte as it is sayd.
And of yt we haue a fygure in the baptem of our lorde Jh~u cryst where all the blessyd trynyte shewed sensybly.
God the fader in boys the whiche came fro~ heuen sayenge of the persone of Jh~u cryst.
Here is my ryght dere sone god the sone shewed hy~ in our humanyte god the holy goost in semblau~ce of a doe hy~ sette put aboue the holy Jh~u cryst the apered open to shewe to signifye that the fad the sone the holy goost descenden aby+ded in the soule baptysed.
The whiche by baptem is made dysposed the temple of the holy trynyte tyll vnto yt yt she co~sented vnto mortall synne.
And theris tonge nor ymagynacion yt may saye thynke or declare the beaute of a soule after the baptem to hy~ is gyuen a spirytuel token yt these theologie~s calle caractere the whiche may neuer be defaced be he saued or dampned after yt he hath ben baptysed the whiche token shall be to the grete confusyon of those yt be dampned vnto the grete honour glo+ry of those yt be blessyd as shall be temporall the lyuery a grete lorde gyuen lyberally vnto a man of lowe condycyon.
Here foloweth the vertue theffect of baptem in the soule baptysed.
BY the sacrame~t of baptem cometh. xij. goodnesses vnto the soule of the whiche. iiij. vnto vs be signifyed by. iiij. propretees ye whiche be in ye water.
yt one is suche yt by ye one clensed thyng{is} fylthy vnclene.
By the baptem the soule is pure fyed made clene from all ordure of synne.
The baptem taketh coleth the inclynacyon and the corrupcyon the whiche is abydynge in humayne nature for ye gylt of origynall synne for yf two childer of lyke com+plexion of the whiche yt one sholde be baptysed that other not.
put that he wende to be were they nourysshed togyder he yt was not baptysed shalbe more inclyned to ylle more harde in doctryne the~ he baptysed.
The baptem refeccyoneth the soule kepeth it from dryenge from deth.
The baptem causeth the soule to fructefye spyrytually in good werkes in vertues in meryt{is}.
Also by ye baptem the soule receyued ye lyuery the token ye caracter afore sayd.
Also he receyued augme~+tacyon of grace lyght of knowlege spirytuell is incorporat vnyed with holy chirche the whiche is ye mystycall body of Jhesu cryst.
Also he is quyte assoyled of the obligacyon in the whiche euery persone not baptysed is bou~den.
Also by ye baptem is the yate of heuen opened.
After these thyng{is} before sayd the preest maketh the crosse with the holy creme vpon ye forhede of hym that is baptysed in namynge hym makynge suche prayer.
GOd almyghty fader of our sauyour Jhesu cryst the whiche the regenerat by the water of baptem wt the blessyd holy goost the ye whiche the pardonned all thy synnes gyue the now the na+me of ye holy creme make the membre of Jh~u cryst the promytte eternall lyf amen.
Here is to be noted yt the holy creme is composed of bame of oyle vnyed sanctefyed by ye benediccion of the bysshop.
By ye bame whiche kepeth all maner of flesshe from rottynge fro~ corrupcyon to vs is sig+nifyed soule the whiche gyued lyf vnto ye body kepeth it fro~ rottynge durynge ye tyme yt it is vnyed wt the body.
And by ye bysshop vnto vs god is represented ye whi+che these thyng{is} of so moche dyfference yt is ye body ye soule hath vnyed assembled gyuen his benediccyon vnto humayne nature.
And for so moche sayen these doctours yt a symple preest suppo+synge yt he had baptysed ye childe sholde not sette yt crosse of ye holy creme in ye presence of ye bysshop yf it were not by his specyall co~mau~deme~t yt is for the holynes of ye creme of the mystery of the be+nediccyon the whiche by yt is signifyed.
Also it is to be noted that this crosse made gyuen vnto the newe crysten man is the seuenth crosse the laste that is sette on his body or the fourteneth in this mystery in acou~tynge these other seuen the whiche be made in ye exorcysaco~n of the salte the whiche is put in his mouth.
By ye salt the whiche vnto vs be tokeneth wysdome we vnderstande consequently the soule so there be made seue~ crosses as vnto ye body as many vnto the soule they be fourtene Forther more it is to be consydered yt it sygnifyed the nombre of seuen ye whithe betokened the crosse And vnto that sayth saynt Gregory yt by the nom+bre of seuen vniuersyte to vs is sygnifyed.
For all thynges that god hath made be they corporell or spirytuell may be brought deuysed in seuen.
Of these corporell there be seuen planetes vnto the bo+dy celestyall the whiche haue¬∑ theyr influence puyssau~ce operacyon gouernynge vpon these thyng{is} a lowe.
Also there be seuen ages in all the worlde seuen dayes in the weke no mo seuen sacrame~t{is} in the holy chirche seuen gyftes of the holy goost seuen werkes of mercy seuen deedly synnes.
And also of other thyng{is} whiche may be brought vnto seuen by whiche a man may well knowe yt by the nombre of seuen to vs is signifyed vnyuerlyte.
Also by ye token of ye crosse in what so euer maner yt it be made be it in wood in stone in golde in syl+uer or wt ye hande or otherwyse ye passyon of yt bles+syd Jh~u cryst to vs betokened by whiche he hath had victory of all his aduersaryes vnto his enmyes confusyon.
Also hath rescuwed and delyuered humayne lygnage broken ye yates of helle opened the realme of paradyse.
And for to speke shortely all ye goodnesses of g~ce of benedicco~n of glory pro+ceden of ye depnesses of ye blessyd passyon therfor of good ryght all faythfull crysten men ought to receyue ye token of crosse for honour for tryu~phe for it is ye shelde defence ayenst all our aduersaryes.
That is to knowe ye worlde the deuyll our sensualyte or poryde coueytous lechery.
Wherfor in ye mystery of baptem ye newe knyght entryng in to batell of crystyente ayenst these thre aduersaryes afore sayd taketh receyueth the soules and the lyuerey of blessyd Jhesu cryste chyef duke and capytayne of al them that ben chosen.
By the whi+che armes well kepte he shall haue knowlege defence vyctorye in all thynges wherfore of good ryght it is sygned seuen tymes as vnto ye body se+uen as vnto the soule wherof that of the creme is the last the souerayne.
For by that he is proprely called a crysten man ye whiche is as moche to say as anoynted or of god consecrated.
And therfore whan these childer of these crysten men be put vnto scole for to lerne connynge vnto them is gyuen for the begynnynge for the fundacyon of all wy+sedome crystis crosse for to shewe yt inco~paryson of the knowlege of the crosse is always to be vnderstande his passyon.
All other scyences erthely or worldely is but foly all noblenes as vylany all rychesse as pouerte all delytes be not but as bytternesses temporall lyf the begynnynge of deth Afterwarde the preest gyueth vnto the childe the crysome aboue his heed vnto hym sayenge.
Take now the whyte leuery the whiche is without spote the whiche thou mayst kepe and bere at the grete daye of Jugement the whiche our lorde Jhesu cry+ste shall holde vnto whome be honour glory in the worlde of worldes amen.
Also vnto hym gy+ueth the preest a taper brennynge in his ryght han+de saynge vnto hym.
Take now this lyght ye whi+che is without reproche kepe thy baptem kepe thy co~mau~dementes to the ende that whan our lorde shall come for to make these weddynges wherof these promysses be made by this holy baptem thou them mayst receyue as the faythfull spouse of thy soule in ye company of all ye sayntes of paradyse in the whiche mayst lyue eternally in the worlde of worldes amen.
By these thre thyng{is} done after the baptem that is of the crysome of the creme of the lyght be signifyed grete thynges spirituell For by the creme receyued in toke~ of the crosse the whiche is the propre token where the armes be of Jhesu cryst is signifyed yt he is named the cryste~ broder of Jhesu cryst in armes parte taker enherytour wt hym in the realme of paradyse.
And it is to be noted that auncyently foure maner of people all oonly be anoynted wt the holy vnccyon that is to knowe these kyng{is} these knyght{is} these preestes these prophet{is} the whiche thynge is do+ne in token and fygure of faythfull crysten men.
The whiche anoynted with the holy creme may saye truely kyng{is} yf they gouerne truely the realme of theyr conscyence the estate of theyr vocacyon for yf they haue in this present batayll victory of the worlde of the deuyll of theyr sensua+lyte they shalbe crowned as noble kyng{is} knygh+tes so shall haue totall peasyble possessyon of the realme of paradyse.
Also they may be sayd sacerdotales the whiche is as moche to saye as enryched ennobled with holy mysteryes.
Now it is so that the crysten man the whiche hath thre noble vertues in the soule that is fayth hope charyte hath the gyftes of the holy goost is the habytacyon temple of all the holy trynyte by the whiche he may well be named preest or sacerdotal.
Also prophetes is moche to saye as they that see and knowe thyng{is} to come.
And the good crysten man by the lyght of fayth sayth consydered the paynes of helle by the whiche he shewed all ylle all synne.
Also he seeth consydered the shortnes of this lyf the grete glorye of paradyse by the whi+che he hasted enforced hym to accomplysshe good werkes merytoryous by the whiche he may come vnto so grete goodnes.
And in accomplysshynge these two thynges that is to flee ylle and to do good he gyueth good example vnto his neyghbours by the whiche he preched better than he the whiche is in the chayre declared these holy wrytynges whan the lyfe the werkes of suche a prechour ben contraryous to the co~mau~deme~t of god By the crysome is signifyed the beaute the inno+cencye of the soule the whiche is annorned ennobled with all vertues as the noble spouse of Jhesu cryst.
Also by that is signifyed the beaute and the do wars of the body after the resurreccyon for it shall be more shynynge than the sonne.
By the lyght the whiche ought to be in the hande not in the mouth or bytwene the feet is sygnyfyed the example of good werkes by the whiche werke euery good crysten man ought to be lyght before the worlde.
By the ryght hande often a man vnderstandeth the good werkes.
And therfore as after these holy mysteryes done acco~plysshed the lytel childe is the childe of god of the holy chirche he wyll not it leue without kepynge nourysshynge.
For not withstandynge by the mercy of god he be clene from all synne and replenysshed with all vertues of beaute inestymable as vnto the soule.
How be it by the Justyce of god he abydeth subget vnto the body vnto hungre vnto thyrste vnto col+de vnto heete and vnto many dyuerse maners of sykenesses the whiche ben abydynge for to seche more gretter merytes in this worlde yf that it be not by our defaute.
And lyke wyse as vnto the soule he abydeth subget vnto ignorau~ce vnto concupyscence vnto malyce sooner than vnto good.
By the whiche it is necessary to gyue hym to kepe and conduyte for to prouyde for these inconuenyences before sayd.
And in as moche the godfader godmoder ben pledges maketh good for hym holy chirche them enioyned comenly to prouyde hym as well vnto the necessyte of the body as of the soule.
And they be bou~de in case that the fader the moder naturall do not that that is of necessyte.
And in as moche that at this daye full fewe there be that them acquyte they ben in grete blame before god.
The comyn people grete small abyden in thre peryllous ignorau~ces as well of ar+tycles as of the co~mau~dementes of our holy fayth Many faders and moders ben moche desyrous to nourysshe to clothe to make purchasses and to gyder goodes for the bodyes of theyr childern.
But ryght fewe there be the whiche thynke on the soule in techynge them and makynge them to kepe the doctryne and the lyf of holy crystyente.
But vnto the contrary vnto them they gyue all euyll example.
And in so moche that the childe is more inclyned to ylle than to good notwithstandynge the gra+ce of baptem as soone as he cometh to haue discrecyon vsau~ce of vndstandynge he fynded hy~ in the place to chose ye waye vnto helle or to paradyse He taketh sooner ye waye of perdicyon the whiche is more large more comen than he dooth the lytell pathe of paradyse.
And yf one demau~de in what age the childe may ought vpon payne of synne chose the good flee the ylle.
Theris moo yt may for all put a comen rule for one hath some tyme more greter capacyte at foure or fyue yere then an+other at seuen or eyght.
And therfore it behoueth yt one watche on them with grete desyre dyscrecion to the ende that they be put in the ryght pathe good waye whan they shall come by age vnto the before sayd discrecyon.
But how shewe the fader the moder the good waye vnto the childe the whi+che go themself by the ylle waye.
And therfore by the defaute of fader moder ryght fewe therbe of the childern in our tyme the whiche kepe vntyll. x. or. xij. yere the tresoure of Innocencye of holy baptem.
And vnto that attendeth well the deuyll the whiche hath so grete payne soo grete confusyon as hath ben afore sayd hath ben put in put out of his lodgynge.
And therfore vs aduysed teched the blessyd Jhesu cryst in the gospell sayenge that whan the deuyll hath ben put out of a persone he taketh grete payne dylygence thyder to retorne taketh. vij. spirytes worse then he is cometh wt suche company ryght often fyndeth ye yate open without resystence he entred agayne fro~ whens he was departed than yt persone is in wors state then before.
By this we may vnderstande that the synner be he olde or yonge that after the holy bap+tem retorned vnto synne is from the moost gretest payne remedyed the deuyll chased from his conscyence by the sacrament of penaunce as whan he was fyrst baptysed.
Than for to ayde them that be fallen hym to areyse vnto them that strongely stande resysten for to proufyte for to contynue here folowen the .xij. artyen of the fayth.
Here foloweth the declaracyon of the .xij. artycles of the fayth in the whiche shall be holden suche ordre.
Fyrst there shall be declared in fewe wordes generall what the fayth is the goodnes ye whi+che therof cometh vnto these faythfull crysten men Secondely euery artycle in partyculer shall be declared the werke answerynge vnto euery artycle for as no thynge hath he promysed the fayth the whiche it shewed not by good holy werkes.
Saynt James ye lesse [Figure: Saynt phylyppe Saynt barthylmew Saynt mathewe Saynt symon Saynt Jude Saynt Here foloweth the fayth catholyke.
Caplm. v. AS vnto the fyrst ti is to vnderstande that there ben thre vertues theologales infuses.
That is to knowe fayth charyte hope the whiche ben called infuses for that that whhan the soule is puryfyed by baptem from origynall synne god createth and putteth these thre vertues in the soule by the whiche she hath dysposycyon to be the temple and the habytacyon of the holy trynyte.
And here presently of the Fayth the whiche¬∑ is named the substau~ce or fundacyon of all spyrytuell huyldynges for without fayth it is impossyble to please god.
Who so euer wyll be saued it behoued hym fyrste that he holde entyerly and vndefyledly the trought of the fayth catholyke of the whiche vertue cometh foure pryn+cypall goodnesses in to the soule.
The fyrst for it is the meane by the whiche the soule is espoused and vnyed with god.
By the whiche maryage the soule is ennobled infynytly and more than vnderstandynge created neyther may ymagen and the fayth ought in hym or in other procede the baptem.
Teche ye that is for to vnderstande the fayth fyrste and the baptysynge folowynge.
Secondely the fayth and the begynnynge and the yate of eternall lyfe.
The lyfe eternall after that as the gosspell sayth and knowe god the fader and Jhesu cryste his sone the whiche thynge we may doo in this present mortall lyfe but by the fayth the whiche is the fyrst begynnynge to see to knowe hym face to face in paradyse therfore the fayth is not of thynges yt we see knowe naturally.
Thyrdely a reasonable persone knoweth yt god is ryght Juste for to punysshe all yll souere~tly god for to rewar+de all goodnes{us} wherfore he is induced to do well to flee yll synne ye whiche thynge is {per}fyte Justyce all the rule of good lyf. Fourthly by the fayth man hath victory of all his aduersaryes yt is of the deuyll of the worlde of the flesshe of the whiche is wryten that by the fayth all the sayntes of paradyse haue had victory.
The fayth telleth vs that honours rychesses and other goodes and pleasurs worldely passen and ben tranlytory and daungerous wherfore we them dyspraysen.
The fayth vn+to vs sayth that in helle theris all euyll wherfore we it fere that in paradyse is all goodnes wher+fore we it desyre.
And this is as vnto the fyrst and in generall of the goodnesses that the fayth dooth one good crysten man.
¬∂Here foloweth the substaunce and dyuysyon of the .xij. artycles of the fayth the .vi. chapytre.
AS vnto the seconde poynt for to declare what is to be seen of euery artycle in partyculer it is to knowe that these artycles of our ho+ly fayth some tyme ben taken and dystyncted after the nombre of the .xij. apostles the whiche made fyrst the Credo.
Or other wyse it may be dyuysed after as the seuen artycles appertaynynge vnto the dyuynyte and seuen vnto the humanyte of Jhesu cryst.
And so there ben .xiiij. the whiche a man may so shewe.
For that that whiche we sholde byleue of the humanyte appertayneth vnto the essence and vnyte of the dyuynyte.
That is for to saye yt we sholde byleue that there en is but one god and not tweyne or many.
And it is the fyrst artycle in that that we saye.
Where it appertayneth vnto the persones of the blessyd trynyte.
And so ye artycle of god the fader vnto vs is signifyed in that that we saye {pro}a+trem o~nipotente~.
byleue in the fader omnypotent The artycle of god the so in that that we saye.
by+leue in Jhesu cryst the sone of god the fader.
The artycle of god the holy goost in that that we saye.
These other thre of the seuen the whiche appertayne vnto the diuinyte ben as in regarde of ye thre pryncypal operacyons withoutforth.
That is creacyon redempcyon glorificacyon the whiche apperteynen all only vnto ye blessyd trynyte.
Creacyon of all thynges is grau~ted vnto the fader in that that it is sayd.
That is to saye of all thynges be they corporell or spirytuell.
Redempcyon is grau~ted vnto Jhesu cryst by the sacrament{is} vnyon of holy chirche.
And that vnto vs is signifyed in that that is sayd.
Or vniuersally beynge of all sayn+tes the remyssyon of synnes.
In this artycle ben comprehended vnderstande all the sacramentes of holy chirche.
Of the whiche thynke all oonly to speke in partyculer of baptem of penau~ce as well for cause of shortnes as also of necessyte of these two sacrament{is}.
The operacyon to gyue the glorye the whiche all these blessyd haue now and that we trust is gyuen vnto the holy goost that we byleue in sayenge.
byleue that we shall aryse that these true crysten men shall haue the euerlastynge lyf in lyke wyse these that ben acursyd shall ha+ue dampnacyon without ende.
And we sholde not vnderstande that god the fader hath made creacyon without god the sone without the blessyd holy goost.
For these thynges appertaynen vnto the dyuynyte the whiche is one and not deuyded in many.
And appereth clerely that the creacyon and gubernacyon of all the worlde the redempcyon of humayne lygnage the gloryficacyon of them that ben saued proceden of all the blessyd trynyte. and so there ben .vij. artycles appertaynynge vnto the dyuynyte and these other vnto the humanyte.
The fyrst is of the blessyd incarnacyon where as we saye.
That is to saye that the virgyn Marie conceyued sone of god by the vertue of the holy goost.
The seconde is of the Natyuyte in yt yt is sayd.
That is to saye that we byleue that he ye whiche procedeth of god the fader by eternall incomparable generacyon is borne by naturall Natyuyte of her ye whiche alwayes is virgyn as well before the childynge as after.
The thyrde is of his passyon in that that is sayd.
That is to saye that we byleue that the sone of the virgyn Marie very god very man was cru+cefyed suffred deth passyon vnder the sentence and Jugement of the bysshop pylate and was buryed.
That is to saye that Jhesu cryst descended in to helle was in lymbo where were these holy persones the whiche had byleued in his comynge and were deed in the estate of grace.
And it is to be vnderstande that he descended as vnto the soule vnyed with the dyuynyte for the body abode in the tombe the spa+ce of fourty houres without lyf.
The fyfth is to byleue that he arose the thyrde daye in that that it is sayd.
And a man sholde not vnderstande that he was deed thre dayes entyre for that sholde be by thre score and twelue houres but he was deed parte of the frydaye all the Saterdaye parte of the Sondaye¬∑ the whiche thre partes ben fourty houres.
The sixte is that the fourtyest daye after his resurreccyon he ascended in to heuen and sette hym on the ryght hande of god the fader in the whiche is sayd.
And the seuenth is that he shal come for to Juge the quycke and the deed and is in that that is sayd.
And soo it appereth clerely that there ben fourtene artycles vnto whome them he wyll so assygne and deuyse.
But all is comprehen+ded and brought vnto twelue conteyned and put in to the Credo that the apostles made the whiche euery man ought for to knowe that hath age and dyscrecyon.
And also he ought for to knowe the Pater noster the Aue maria and Confiteor.
The Credo for to ha+ue knowe ye fayth promysed vnto baptem.
The Confiteor for to accuse hym requyre pardon of his synnes defaut{is}.
And a doctour sayth named Linchorence that these crysten men ought to knowe the Pater noster the Aue maria the Credo in theyr langage maternall.
That is to saye the Frenshe man in frau~ce the Englysshe man in englysshe so of other.
And in as moche shall put the latyn of euery artycle of the sayd Credo.
And afterwarde the englysshe the declaracyon of the werke the whiche ought to be in euery true crysten man for to answere vnto euery artycle.
For the holy scrypture sayth that that fayth ought to be sayd deed the whiche bereth not the fruyte of good wer+kes.
And he that hath not the good werkes of a cry+sten man ye fayth is no thynge worth.
But for the fayth promysed not kepte by good lyf holy ope+racyons shall be more greuous more sharpe of dampnacyon of an ylle crysten man than of a sar+rasyn or a payneme.
Here foloweth euery artycle in partyculer of the werke for to answere.
byleue in god the fader omnypotent creatour of heuen of erth Also it is to be noted that it is an nother thynge after these doctours to byleue god to byleue of god and to byleue in god.
These euyll crysten men that byleue that these wrytynges ben holy trewe do the contrary they byleue god of god not in god.
But these good crysten men the whiche by theyr charyte kepe the co~mau~dementes by leue well god of god in god.
For he that sayth that he byleueth in god kepeth not his co~mau~dementes lyeth falsely.
Who so euer byleued in god parfectly byleued that in hym is souerayne goodnes infynyte.
And for so moche that euery creature desyred appetyted loued good thynge it behoued that a creature resonable loue god hym ap+petyte soueraynly for in hym is bonte infynyte.
And yf it be so he shall kepe aboue all thynges his co~mau~dementes the whiche may not be but good for good syns that they procede of the bonte infy+nyte.
And he that doth the contrary is he that kepeth not the co~maundementes he lyued not good merytoriously after as god hym hath co~maunded sayenge.
Thou sholdest loue god with all thyn her+te with all thy thought and with all thy myght.
Wherof sayth a doctour named Prosper he that lo+ued god is often thynkynge on hy~ desyrynge to co+me vnto his blessyd vysyon hauynge synne in hate in anoyau~ce charge and these honours plea+surs of the worlde these rychesses to disprayse in comparyson of the loue of god our creatour of the goodes the whiche be without ende.
The cause to loue god aboue all thynge is his bonte infynyte for as moche that he is our fader omnypotent wherfore he loued vs his childer not of other loue than of loue infynyte.
And in as moche that he is almyghty it behoued that he make that he gyue goodes vnto his childern after the loue of the whiche he them loued they ben goodes glory that no herte it may thynke ne no tonge can it declare.
the whiche he vnto vs may gyue by his souerayne myght by the whiche he hath created made heuen erthe.
He can well make it by his grete wysedome he wyll by his bonte pyteous buxomnes.
By the whiche euery man ought for to enforce hym to byleue and to haue hope to the ende for to come vnto the augmentacyon of charyte and of holy and merytoryous werkes.
For as saynt Gregory sayth as moche as the fayth greueth hope is augmented and as moche as man hath of dyspay+re man wanteth of charyte and after the good holy operacyons.
And soo these thre thynges ben alwaye egall as vnto the proporcion that euery of these vertues ought to haue.
And therfore after the grete or lytell man may truely vnderstande and knowe what fayth what charyte and what hope is in the persone and none other wyse.
And therfore sayth our lorde Jhesu cryste in the gospell that man knowith the tree after the fruyte that it bereth be it good or euyll.
By the the fruyte that pro+cedeth of the tree menynge the or the floure and the leef be entended the werkes the whiche proceden of the herte and of his wyll eyther of the fayth as the fruyte of the tree.
In lyke wyse than as there ben twelue artycles dystyncted it behoueth that there are also twelue fruytes or twelue werkes and euery of them for to answere vnto his artycle.
The werke of this present artycle after the mortalyte is childely fere or amerous fere.
The whiche thynge vnto vs is shewed and gyuen to knowe and to vnderstande in that that is sayd.
Fere is due vnto god the whiche is Juste infynyte.
And loue vnto the fader almyghty fader of mercy and of bonte infynyte.
And who so euer shall haue the fayth of this artycle in his herte and the werke as it is sayd he shall habounde in good werkes withoutforth and shall shewe euyll and synne in lyke wyse as sayth holy scrypture.
And man ought to byleue that the fayth of this artycle is deed that bereth not here the fruyte of this werke.
AT in iesum cristum filium eius vnicum do minum nostrum.
byleue in Jhesu cryst our souerayne lorde the sone of god the fader.
And in that a man ought to vnderstan+de that he is semblable egall vnto the fader in all thynges the whiche appertaynen vnto the deite is one self essence in dyuynyte as well the fader as the sone and also the holy goost for he is not but one god.
But that blessyd and that Infynyte and incomprehensyble dyuynyte is one in thre per+sones.
And notwithstandynge that we be made vnto the ymage of that blessyd trynyte pryncypally as vnto the soule in the whiche there is mynde vnderstandynge wyll ye whiche he thre myght{is}. of the whiche that one is not that other always it is not but one essence or one other.
And that by this ymage of the trynyte the whiche is in vs we may somwhat knowe serche the thynge the whi+che it represented that is the blessyd trynyte.
How be it we ought to byleue symply without to moche curyous inquyrynge.
And yf this fayth were not aboue all entendement that man may well vnder+stande comprehende in hym the mysterye of the blessyd trynyte he sholde haue neyther fayth nor meryte nor by the consequence he myght neuer come vnto saluacyon.
For the fayth whiche is none other thynge than that that god hath shewed and that he may not nor ought vnderstande naturally is the begynnynge the grou~de of all saluacyon.
Wherfore it behoueth vnto all the moost grete cler+kes that euer were to sharpe theyr naturall entendement in these thynges that touche vnto ye hyghnes of our holy fayth vnto vs it ought to suffyse for to knowe that he may do more than we may vnderstande.
And that we see in euery lytell creatu+re be it herbe or tree or other thynge for ther was neuer so grete a clerke or phylosopher that myght knowe parfectly all the propretecs the vertues the nature of a lytell herbe.
By the whiche it foloweth by more greter reason that he may not natu+rally knowe the creature but by the fayth the whiche is more certayne knowlege that is that of naturall entendement.
For god the whiche may not lye vnto vs hath shewed his holy wrytynges the whiche ben his owne wordes the whiche hath put in to the herte in to the mouth of holy prophetes apostles other.
Also by those holy martyrs con+fessours the whiche haue holden kepte trought of this holy fayth catholyke shedde theyr blood and receyued the deth Joyously.
God hath done in theyr lyf after theyr deth myracles so grete and so euydent for to approue the trought of the fayth that in crysten man after those sayd myracles theyr predycacyons made solemply of the trought of our holy fayth catholyke ne ought ony thynge to doubte.
For otherwyse he synned ryght greuously neyther it may not be sayd that he byleued stedfastly in Jhesu cryst the very sone of god the fader that he doubted in the fayth for Jhesu cryste the whiche is trought infynyte hath promysed that he shalbe wt the chirche hym gyue vnto ye holy goost tyll vnto the ende of the worlde.
In these wordes of these artycles vnto vs ben shewed the .iiij. {pro}pretees of ye true seygnourye yt is to knowe wysdome swetnes or mercy myght nobles the fourth is Justyce.
By the whiche we sholde haue hym auowe for souerayne lorde.
Than the fyrst reason is for the wysdome infynyte the whiche vnto vs is gyuen for to vnderstande in this worde Jhesum The seconde is by the swetnes pyte and mercy the whiche is sygnyfyed by this worde Xpristum.
The thyrde is puyssaunce and nobles the whiche vnto vs ben sygnyfyed by that that is sayd filiu~ dei.
The fourth is Justyce the whiche is sygnyfyed by this worde dominu~ nostru~.
He is very lorde by creacyon by redempcyon for ye resurreccyon.
For ther is none other lorde yt may yelde vnto the body soule lyf whan one hath lost it in his seruyce except Jhesu cryst lorde of all lordes kynge of all kyn+ges.
The werke of this present artycle after ye moralyte is obedyence in kepynge the co~mau~dement{is} of Jhesu cryst after his intencyon ye trouth that he hath declared in the gospell not all only the en+tent lyterall carnall of scrybes pharysees.
For for no thynge without cause called he hym his lorde of whome he wyll not his co~mau~dementes.
Also it is hym to humble to loue holy pouerte for who so euer byleued that Jhesu cryst is very god full of wysedom infynyte he that in our humanyte in this present lyf he vs hath gyuen example of all perfeccyon chosynge the lyf estate the whiche is moost worth.
Now taketh he humanyte obedyence penau~ce pouerte in shewynge vs to folowe hym by the whiche the good crysten man catholyke hym ought to meke all auaryce vsury rauayne symonye to forsake his propre sensualyte restrayne repreue.
Or elles the fayth of this artycle is deed whiche this werke bereth not here.
byleue that the virgyn Marie conceyued the sone of god the fader by the vertue of the holy goost bare childe her virgynyte abydynge alwayes saue hole entyere.
And this artycle is declared more openly in the Credo the whiche a man syngeth whan he sayth the masse where he sayth that for the loue for the saluacyon of humayne nature ye sone of god the fader descended from the heuens toke our humanyte in the blessyd gloryous sacred virgyn Marie by the vertue of ye blessyd holy goost in makynge hym very man he is comen downe by humylyte in suche wyse that many almoost all the worlde but that hym reputed as for man he the whiche was is and shall be very god almyghty.
Or elles the virgyn Marie sholde not be a moder yf she had not nourysshed in her wombe and borne hym whiche is god.
Here is the hyghnes and perfeccyon of the fayth of crysten men the whiche saynt Peter confessed and auowed whan he sayd.
Thou art very cryste the sone of the lyuende god in that that he confessyd cryste he knoweth hym man in that that he called hym the sone of god he wytnes+seth verely that he is god.
And therfore our lorde hym answereth that auowe that trought that he knoweth that is to knowe humayne nature and dyuyne to be in one persone he shall founde and sette the trought of the holy fayth catholyke.
The werke of this artycle after the moralyte is for to conceyue the sone of god spyrytually by the vertue of the holy goost and of the holy fayth catholyke by the meane of the whiche fayth Jhesu cryst enha+byted within the conscyences of the true catholykes so excellently that he hymself wytnesseth in the gospell the conscyence that he receyued by true fayth ought to be sayd his moder certayne it is more noble more dygne and more holy thynge to conceyue hym spyrytally than it sholde be to conceyue hy~ corporally all only.
And suche nobles in one crysten man that is to knowe yt the conscyence is yee moder of god no tonge may suffycyently speke nor vnderstandynge byleue comprehende nor duely adueruayll.
In this depnes these deuoute comtemplatyf spyrytes erthely them ought to pro+sterne ryght humbly and the holy goost by the whi+che he maketh suche concepcyon to them shall declare thynges that may not be sayd nor wryten.
Also it is to be noted that humayne nature by the concepcyon and blessyd incarnacyon is honoured exalted moche more than nature angelyke in moche that god is becomen man and not angell for to proue and shewe vs his Infynyte loue and the waye of saluacyon the whiche is obedyence humylyte.
Also in that that our lorde borne of his moder dyde not vnto her ony sorowe or payne nor yet hurte in makynge her to lese the tresour of her virgynyte vnto vs is sygnyfyed and shewed that no good childe by his yll and synne ne ought to wrathe his fader and moder ne them ought to depryue from honour and obedyence that he vnto them ought as well by the co~maundement of god as of nature.
And therfore our lorde hath wylled honour vnto his ryght holy moder in heuen and in erth by suche maner that many crysten men in lyke wyse haue more grete hope to fynde mercy by meane of the moder than of the sone and all that hath he done in geuynge vs example that the fayth of this artycle is deed that the fruyte of honour bereth not vnto his fader moder.
byleue that Jhesu cryst suffred deth passyon vnder ye bysshop Pylate so as it hath ben sayd before.
Here the true crysten man ought to enforce hym to thynke on ye lyght of the holy fayth.
By the whiche one sayth these thynges dyuyned these thyng{is} past beynge to come what is he that suffred what thynge he suffred endured wherfore he suffred.
And as vnto that it is sayd now ynough certayne by these thynges aforesayd that he the whiche suffred is ve+rely god man the true lambe.
The Innocent of god of maieste of bonte infynyte he suffred sorowes in his soule and torment in his body without nombre without measure for them that vnto hy~ ben the contrarye the whiche haue done the ylle the synne wherof he bereth the payne of the whiche he myght no better do whiche of that they may not hym worthely gyue thankes by them seluen the whiche he hath agayne bought and the whiche were ryally the seruytours of the deuyll of synne.
And the true crysten man ought to byleue that the soule of Jhesu cryst vnyed with the dyuynyte hath clere knowlege of all thynges past present to by the whiche it behoueth to confesse that he seeth all these synnes mortall other that euer were or shall be done vnto ye ende of the worlde.
And in as moche that it was the pleasure wyll of all the blessyd trynyte that by yt passyon was the world ryght habundau~tly agayne bought from eternall dampnacyon.
Jhesu cryst suffred endured partyculer payne for euery mortall synne that euer was or shall be done ayenst the wyll dyuyne be it by hym that shall be fynally sad or by hym that shall be dampned and as moche gre+te payne as there was was due vnto euery mortal synne the whiche thynge surmouteth all vndersta~dynge create but only that by ye lyght of the fayth we knowe that he that suffred was very god.
By the whiche reasonably we consente that yf he had not shedde by sorowe and anguysshe but one oonly droppe of blood that yf it so we soueraynly it suf+fyseth for to redeme a thousande worldes how be it all oonly he hadde gyuen but one droppe of blood.
But by the space of two and thyrty yeres and thre monethes he hath suffred and endured as well in the wombe of the virgyn Marie as also syns yt he was borne in this worlde labours paynes trauayles in fastynge in prayenge in temptacyons in contradiccyons fynally the deth the moost greuous pyteous dolorous yt herte may thynke.
But the naturall foly of herte of erthely vnderstandynge may saye ymagen that in this the whiche is here sayd it is impossyble to co~tynue for as moche that he suffred not but in soo moche as man not in suche moche as god.
Wherfor he myght not suffre but payne infynyte full lytell vnto regarde of that the whiche is here purposed the whiche is an hondred tymes infynyte yf it were possyble to speke it or ymagen.
And on the other parte it hath ben sayd that for euery mortall synne that euer was or shall be done he hath borne payne suffycyent for to repayre the Iniurye done vnto the maieste dyuyne.
The whiche Iniurye for euery synne is infynyte for the ransome of hym the whi+che hath offended.
For reason and nature it agree that in as moche that he that man offendeth is moost grete the offence and Iniurye done ayenst hym is moost grete.
Now it is ynough knowen god is of the maieste infynyte by the whiche it foloweth that the offence done ayenst hym ought to be infynyte and by the consequens the payne due and for to answere vnto suche offence or elles god sholde not be true Juge to da~pne eternally for one oonly mortall synne hym the whiche by his defaute shall not be ayen bought by this blessyd passyon The answere vnto yt folysshe ymagynacyon the whiche alwayes grau~te by the lyght of our holy fayth yt he the whiche suffred is god how be it yt he suffred not in so moche as god.
Also confesse by the fyrst artycle these thynges beforsayd yt he is almyghty as the fader.
Also confesse yt Justyce dyuyne the whiche may not be chau~ged or varyed requyred that after the gylte the payne be mesured Also graunt that Jhesu cryst is very redemptor and suffysaunce of all the worlde.
Wherfore it behoued that he the whiche suffred be almyghty that he may susteyne payne infynyte.
And sythen that Justyce vnmeuable requyred suche payne it behoueth that it offred payde sythen that it hath pleased vnto Jhesu cryste ryght parfyghtly vs for to by agayne and that he it may and that Justyce it requyreth it foloweth that he hath payed for vs passyons sorowes and anguysshes Infynyte.
Wherof sayth a deuout contemplatyf that yf the payne that our lorde suffred for euery one of vs for vs in lyke wyse were dyuysed in as many partyes as there ben droppes of water in all the sees or in all the worlde.
Also in as many partyes as euer was of brekynge of grasse of ye leues of trees of fethers of byrdes of sterres in the skye of cornes of the erthe of men of women the humanyte of Jhesu cryste or other naturall man had not borne half a quarter of an houre without deth one of the moost lytell partes of the payne before sayd so dyuysed.
But for as moche that yt blessyd humanyte as well the body as the soule be shall be always vnyed in the dyuynyte in ye seconde persone of the blessyd trynyte she may bere endure by the vertue myght of the dyuynyte passyons torment{is} without comparyson.
And more ouer euery true crysten man ought to be certayne from the houre that Jhesu cryste beganne to suffre this payne.
That is to knowe from ye fyrst beynge of his bles+syd Incarnacyon he see euery persone that euer was is shall be in knowlege dyuyne in the whi+che all thynges ben past or to come as vnto vs ben ryght present as vnto hym and not oonly he knoweth euery persone that hath ben syns is or shall be.
But with that he hym loued of suche loue that yf god the fader had vnto hym made suche offre or suche proposycyon at the houre of his deth.
receyue the sacrifyce of your dolour passyon in the whiche ye be as now for the saluacyon of all them that haue ben ben or shall be except for suche a man and for suche a woman vnto hym specyfyenge me or an other.
And vnto hym offerynge more ouer yf ye wyll not be for the loue of hym or of her in the an of the payne in whiche ye be as now vn+to the daye of Jugement.
Knowe all those that ben present to come that from that houre he loued so moche euery persone euery poore synner that syns hath be shall be that yf yet he sholde be on ye tree of the crosse hangynge as yet that this present bo+ke was fyrste wryten.
That is the yere of grace a thousande foure hondred thre score seuen.
By the whiche it appyred he there hath ben more than xv. hondred yeres.
And more ouer there sholde be tyll vnto the daye of Jugement for the loue infynyte that he hath ayenst vs before that one erthely persone what so euer he be were eternally dampned by the defaute of that passyon.
And who so hy~ wyll areste in this meditacyon he there shall fynde pyte loue Joye compassyon admyracyon infynytly.
Here is the depnes of the glorye the uoblenes of a crysten man the whiche byleued knowed to be in so profou~de loue of his creatour his god his broder his loue almyghty that hath wylled to suffre for hym more than ony wyll or may for hymself.
Here euery good crysten man sholde thyn+ke meane deuoutly one tyme on a daye at the lest one tyme in the weke specyally whan one seeth the precyous body of Jhesu cryst bytwene ye preest{is} handes.
For vnto that is instytute this ryght holy sacrament that is to knowe that we sholde reme~bre vs of his infynyte loue of his blessyd passyon Also the deuoute co~templatyf may hym prosterne before the ymage of the crucyfix or in an other pla+ce secrete or in ymagenynge that he is ryally vpon the mounte of Caluarye that he seeth the swete Jhesus hangynge on the crosse syns the tyme befo+re sayd that is to knowe a thousande fyue hondred yeres in these paynes in these torment{is} before sayd also that he seeth hym deyenge languysshe for the loue of his swete moder virgyn pyteous sorowfull be he ryght certayne wtout doubte that it is for the loue of hym for to delyuer hym from eternall deth and yf he be not more harde than ony other thynge he shall falle in pyte in admyracyon he shall knowe clerely that all that that he may do saye thynke or endure in recompensacyon of that loue grace bene diccyon is all as nothynge.
By the whiche he shal be preserued from the arowe or darte of the deuyll the whiche fleeth ryght peryllously in the mydde daye and at the houre of none.
That is vayne glo+rye the whiche some tyme surmonteth for prayer or holy medytacyons or for some other good werkes.
Also he shall be wyllynge contynually to do some thynges as penaunce prayer almesdede or other holy medytacyons for the honour and glory of god.
But with good herte he may some thynge saye or ymagen.
Yf it so be that by suche loue as it is sayd god hath so moche endured for me and also ryght habondauntly payed the grete payne of my grete synnes by what reason or by what Justy+ce ought for to abyde subgecte vnto these grete paynes of this worlde and also for to do penaunce after my confessyon and fynally deye and after the deth be punysshed by fyre yf do not here penaunce suffycyently on this halfe where it is soo that god punysshed not the gyltes of his creature by two tymes in lyke wyse as sayth holy scrypture.
In all werkes of god agayne nature humayne there is mercy and Justyce and euery of them is infynyte.
Now is it so that by syn+ne after the Justyce dyuyne we were Joyned vnto foure maner of dethes.
That is to knowe vnto deth of gylte vnto deth cyuyle the whiche is to be dampned or exyled from his herytage of his countree or to be in vnto deth of nature ye whi+che is separacyon of the body of the soule and vnto deth of helle eternall.
By the mercy of god infynyte the merytees of his blessyd passyon we ben delyuered from two maner of dethes that is from the deth of yt gylte of synne from eternall deth by suche wyse that we shall kepe vnto Jhesu cryste our redemptour yt yt we haue hym promysed in baptem.
But by the dyuyne Justyce for our grete profyte we shall abyde subiectes vnto two other maner of dethes.
That is vnto ye deth cyuyle. for we be out of paradyse terrestyall ye whiche was our herytage yf synne had not ben vnto deth of nature.
From the whiche dethes the Justyce dyuyne vs sholde not delyuer for in so doynge he vs had pryued by a meane for to purchace grete merytes of the whiche the hyere shall be infynyte.
For of as moche as we suffre the more in pacyence and for the loue of god in the exyle of this worlde our rewarde shalbe ye greter in the realme of paradyse so it apyreth yt by Justyce we ought to do penau~ce in this worlde.
The werke of this artycle after the moralyte is to haue pacyence makenes in aduer+syte be it syknes of body pouerte or losse of goodes or of frendes fortune of tyme.
Iniuryes feblenesses or temptacyons For of as moche that ony man suffred the more in this worlde in the estate of grace in takynge it pacyently for the loue of god of as moche he hath in hym the more grete token of the loue of god of saluacyon.
The crosse that is to vnderstande trybulacyon aduersyte is the very token where ben the armes of the kynge Jhesus without the whiche there shall neuer persone enter in to ye royalme of paradyse.
And in as moche that they ben the more playne the more grete of as moche is a man sette in the royalme the more honorably the more nere the kynge.
Also the good crysten man sholde take his crosse hym crucifye in lyke wyse as ye gospell sayth.
And it is none other thyn+ge to saye but that the crysten man sholde resyste and not folowe obeye vnto the inclynacyons and mouynges of the sensualyte.
And that vnto vs is sygnyfyed in that that we saye.
That is to saye that our lorde was crucyfyed for to gyue vs example to suffre endure for the loue of hym with pacyence.
And the poore synner ought not to dyspayre hym how be it that the sensualyte complayned hym an inpacyent that he be inclyned passo~ned to take vengeau~ce or to do a grete many other ylles.
So that reason hym holde ferme stedfast in the fere loue of god not beynge of con+sente it for to breke in ferme sensualyte for as to suffre suche rebellyons of the sensualyte is not but mater to purchase meryte.
Also ought good crysten man to be deed buryed with Jhesu cryst¬∑ the whiche is none other thynge to vnderstande but that he ought to mortifye his membres that is his sensualyte in kepynge it vnder the rodde dyscyplyne of reason his fyue wyttes of nature that is to vnderstande the syght the herynge the tastynge the sauorynge the touchynge.
He ought also to haue mortefyed quenched in hym the seculer lyf worldely that is gyuen vs to vnderstande by that that is sayd.
For otherwy+se the fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche bereth not the fruyte of holy mortyfycacyon.
Here foloweth the .v. artycle the whiche is suche DEscendit ad inferna. tercia die resurrexit a mortuis.
That is to wyte the soule vnyed with the persone of the very sone of god as before it hath ben expowned and the thyrde daye arose.
The werke of this artycle after the moralyte is that we sholde by holy and fructuous medytacyons descende in to helle durynge this pre+sent lyf to the entente that thyder we descende not after the deth by eternall dampnacyon.
For before that he styed vnto the heuens he descended in to the helles The whiche medytacyons the good crysten man ought to make of the paynes of helle for to cly~me vnto the heuens it shall be spoken in the last par+tye of this boke.
Also by this artycle we sholde kno+we the mysery ryght grete vnkyndnes of humay+ne condycyon yt we see our lorde for the loue of vs descende in to helle loue of hym we wyll not mou~te in to paradyse.
Also we sholde aryse fro~ helle yt is from the estate of mortall synne on the thyrde daye that is by contrycyon confessyon and satysfaccyon.
Fyrst for the loue of god pryncypally Secondely for the desyre of the glorye of paradyse And thyrdely for to shewe ye grete paynes of helle the tormentes that there ben for euer without en+de.
And therfore the fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche bereth not here this fruyte.
byleue that our lorde ascended in to heuen the .xl. daye af+ter his resurreccyon sette hym on the ryght hande of the fader.
Here is to be noted yt how be it our ho+ly fayth is of thyng{is} ye whiche furmou~ten the puys+sau~ce capacyte of naturall vnderstandynge how be it she conteyned not no thynge impossyble nor contrary vnto reason.
And thefore we saye that sone of god descended from heuens by his blessyd incarnacyon styed in to the heuens by his gloryous ascensyon we sholde haue in vs suche dyserecyon yt we vnderstande yt to descende to mou~te as vnto the mutacyon of the place may not belonge vnto the diuinyte whiche is imeuable infynyte But we shall vnderstande that the descendynge is none other thynge to saye but hym to shewe to present in our nature humayne.
And in lyke wyse the mou~tyng vnto heuens is as in regarde of our humanyte in the the sone of god the fa+der the whiche by the vertue dyuyne is lyfte vp aboue all the heuens that is aboue all creatures.
He sytteth on the ryght hande of god the fader as vn+to the dyuynyte it is none other thynge to vnderstande but that ye persone of god the sone is egall to god the fader in maieste puyssaunce bonte wy+sedom diuinyte.
As vnto the humanyte he setteth hym on the ryght hande of god the fader that is to vnderstande that he is in rest gloryous after his ryght pyteous passyon.
On the ryght hande that is in all the souerayne hyghnesse of glorye and of benedyccyon that euer man may speke or thynke as the bonte and puyssaunce dyuyne may gyue.
For truely Jhesu cryst very man in body in soule resonable in vnyte of persone dyuyne is kynge of glorye of myght egall vnto god the fader is Juge of the quycke of the deed.
By the whiche it is well sayd he setteth hym on the ryght hande of god.
For by the ryght hande in holy scrypture vnto vs is oftentymes sygnyfyed soueraynte of glorye of blessydnes in the whiche the blessyd Jhesu cryfte is in humanyte in dyuynyte.
The werke of this artycle after the moralyte is that the true catholyke the whiche stedfastly byleued these thyn+ges before sayd ought to haue his herte his loue and his desyres on hye departed from the eithe and from these thynges benethe and transytorye.
That is to saye that he hath not his loue in pryde in worldely vanyte in delytes nor in rychesses but his loue is where his tresoure is his glorye and his blessydnes that is the blessyd Jhesu cryste very god of loue the whiche draweth all his trewe louers vnto hym.
For no thynge that may be sayd may not better drawe loue than dooth an other lo+ue and therfore he sayth in the gospell.
Come vnto me all ye the whiche ben in laboure and in payne as yf he wolde saye.
laboure as you and more than you and for the loue of you ryght now sytte and reste me.
am in glory perdurable redy for to gyue it vnto all theym the whiche after me wyll labour.
These worldely people laboure for the worlde pryncypally and these good crysten men laboure for the lyfe eternall.
And therfore euery true crysten man beynge in the labours of this worlde sholde saye by the vertue of the fayth that that saynt Steuen sayd whan he laboured in the artycle of deth whan he bare the grete strokes of the harde stones.
see the heuens open and Jhesu cryste on the ryght hande of god the fader vnto whome Jbere Joyously the laboure of this cormentes.
And therfore yf thou haue hungre thyrste temptacyon trybulacyon aduersaryes and contradyccyon enuyous or other mortall persecuco~n beholde swete Jhesus knowe thou that it is impossyble to go+sette hym at his table the whiche wyll not drynke of his cuppe and the whiche holdeth not the waye that he hath holden.
That is for to descende in to helle as it is sayd for to stye vnto paradyse there where he is.
And knowe thou that the fayth of this artycle is deed ye whiche bereth not here this fruyte.
INde venturus est iudicare viuos et mortuos That is to saye.
byleue that the sone of god the fader shall come to Juge the quycke the deed.
At his fyrst comynge he came in humylyte pouerte was of cursed men Juged and reproued At his seconde comynge he shall come in glorye maieste shall Juge all the cursyd people.
Here a man may demau~de who that wyll speke to Juge the quycke the deed where it is so that whan he shall gyue sentence in lyke wyse as it hath ben declared in the gospell all good euyll shall be on lyue.
These doctours sayen that whan he shall come for to Juge at the grete last Jugement those the whiche lyue than vpon the erthe he than shall make to deye.
And this fyrst Jugement is called the Jugement of the quycke.
And after ye resurreccyon he shall Juge togyder all them ye whi+che before the sayd resurrecco~n haue ben deed.
But the exposicyon of pope Innocent the thyrde and of many other it semeth better to be vnto the purpose how be it that he agayne sayth not vnto the expostcyon before sayd.
And that is suche that our lorde shall come to Juge fyrste the quycke that is at the Jugement partyculer the whiche is done at the houre of deth of euery man.
For mayster Nycholas de lyra sayth in many cases in his doctryne that our lorde cometh vnto ye departynge of euery man be he good or ylle.
Also the pope Innocent sayth that these good men seen hym at the houre of deth vnto theyr grete Joye consolacyon in example of a noble espouse the whiche sholde receyue his ryght well beloued faychfull retornynge from a moche ferre regyon.
And the cursyd hym seen vn+to ther confusyon for than they seen the horryblenes of theyr synnes theyr infydelyte theyr vnkyndnes that Justely they ought to be dampned And of this apparycyon at the houre of deth we re+de many examples as well of the good as of the ylle.
Of the good as saynt John the euangelyst of whome Jhesu cryst hath sayd.
Of saynt Andrewe of saynt Katheryne of other many we rede that he apyred vnto theym at the houre of deth.
And in lyke wyse appyred he vnto the cursyd for elles the hou+re of deth sholde not be the Jugement partyculer yf they had not one Juge an other ought not to Juge fynally these erthely people excepte hym vnto whome god the fader hath gyuen puyssau~ce auctoryte in heuen and in erthe that is the blessyd Jhesu cryste not all oonly in so moche as god but with that as moche as man.
Moche it is for to do for to brynge often vnto mynde that we all shall be present in persone at the grete.
Also the synnes of the dampned shall be publysshed and manyfested vnto Juges angelles and vnto all them that ben saued and also vnto the deuylles.
Also one shall see the falsenesse of these ypocrytes the whiche men wende other tymes to haue ben trewe faythfull and good people.
Her false Jugementes and cursyd sentences shall be ryght holely and Justele Juged.
Gyftes promys feres nor fauoure may not tarye Justyce infynyte the whiche is and shall be the very Juge of the quycke and of the deed.
The werke of this artycle after the moralyte is that euery man sholde take hede of his spyrytuall dede. in lyke wyse as Jhesu cryste vs hath warned in the gospell sayenge.
Wake ye in your caas for ye kno+we not the houre that the Juge shall arryue.
And who so that well remembreth of the houre he shall neuer consente for to perseuer or for to abyde in mortall synne houre nor halfe an houre.
And the fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche he+re this fruyte the whiche fruyte is the fere of god preparacyon to deye well bereth not.
For euery faythfull crysten man ought to byleue in one god or in one dyuynyte in thre persones that is in the fader in the sone and in the holy goost.
And of this a man ought not for to doubte or for to knowe or curyously for to enquyre as afore hath ben sayd. for entendement create is not suffycyent ynough for to comprehende and to vnderstande the mysteryes of the blessyd trynyte.
But alwayes in these thyng{is} yt he vndstanded he hath some rep~sentacion of the blessyd trynyte for theris not so lytell a crea+ture but that he hath vnyte veryte bonte.
Also yf he haue admyracyon that one essence of deite be in thre persones of the whhe the one is not the other as to merueyll may haue two natures in one persone that is in creature humayne ye whiche hath in hym nature corporell nature spirytuall that is body soule wherof the one is mor+tall the other i~mortall in one self persone.
Also euery thynge corpprall hath thre thynges that is the length the largenes the depnes.
Also in all the worlde there is but thre maner thynges.
The fyrst ben spirytuell all oonly that is nature angelyke.
The seconde ben corporell all oonly as the foure elementes.
The thyrde ben thynges spirytuall corporall togyder that is man woman.
Also in the soule the whiche is vnto the ymage of the blessyd trynyte hath thre myghtes.
That is to knowe mynde vnderstandynge wyll is not but one soule in the trynyte the trynyte in vnyte byleue than euery crysten man ye persone of the holy goost to be one dyuynyte one puyssau~ce one maieste with these persones of the fader of the sone that that make the one of these thre persones as in regarde of the creacyon of the gouernynge of all the worlde to glorifye the good to dampne the euyll is made of all these thre without dyfference.
The werke of this artycle as vnto the moralyte is for to meruayll.
For as sayth saynt Poule they in whome the holy goost enhabyted by grace habunden in dyuers gyftes.
Some haue gra+ce to speke well wysely some other haue vnderstandynge knowlege of many thynges that man may not knowe but by the gyfte of the holy goost of prophecye.
Some other do myracles some other suche merytes vertues by humylyte charyte mercy in the vertue of the holy goost the whiche conuerted moued and teched enbrached in loue these humayne bodyes the whiche dyspose them to receyue it them gyued spirytuall lyf by the whiche they profyte in good werkes they fyght resyste the worlde the deuyll vnto theyr inclynacyons sensualles.
For in lyke wyse as the erthely spyryte that is the soule gyueth vnto ye body vsau~ce of the fyue wyttes of nature that is the syght the herynge the tastynge the smellynge ye touchynge hym gyueth also power to speke to walke and to be besy in dyuers mysteryes werkes.
And whan it departed from the body he leseth all these thynges before sayd falleth vnto erthe rotten retorneth vnto asshes.
So moche more excellently whan the holy goost is in the soule by grace he hy~ gyueth fyue wyttes spyrytuall by the whiche the soule knoweth meruayllous thyng{is} of god hym gyueth myght to walke in kepynge the co~mau~dementes of god to speke with hym in prayer to resyste batayll in this present lyf.
And whan by the gylte synne of ony he is departed from ye sou+le she leseth the true knowlege of helle of paradyse falleth by effeccyon in loue dysordynate in to pouder asshes of thynges erthely becometh fylthy stynkynge in wordes in dedes in saeynges thoughtes no power well to resyste the deuyll to kepe the co~maundementes nor to do thynge the whiche is vnto god pleasau~t merytoryous for to purchase a rewarde in paradyse soo we ought to byleue euery true crysten man that ye fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche not the fruyte of this knowlege.
That is to saye byleue the holy chirche catholyke or vnyuer+sall.
Here is to be noted yt holy chirche is as moche to saye of all those them the whiche haue ye blessyd holy goost by grace be it in this worlde or in ye other.
For in lyke wyse as ye humayne spyryte that is the soule vnyeth many dyuers membres as the heed the feet the handes the other membres be they grete or lytell in suche maner that there en is but one body humayne not many.
For they haue not but one forme the whiche forme or spyryte humayne is alwaye in euery of the membres ouer all so as hath these phylosophres wyse worldely men a lytell whyle syns perfytly knowen declared.
In lyke wyse moche more excellently the blessyd holy goost vnyeth vnyfyeth all these me~bres of the holy chirche in one so dygne so perfyte yt ye goodnes of yt one be it grete or lytell is ye goodnes of yt other.
For by ye vertue of charyte euery man of body mystycall of holy chirthe loued his neyghbour as hymself by the whiche it foloweth yt the honour the goodnes the Joye of yt one is the goodnes of yt other.
That is ye blessyd company that is to knowe the vnyuersall chirche is in thre partyes.
The fyrst is named ye chirche tryumphau~t or victoryous that is these blessyd men the whiche ben now in pa+radyse here neuer sought degre of meryte esse~cyal for they be vnto the~ determyned.
The is named ye chirch mylytau~t or she ye whiche is in batayll yt be these good crysten men whiche yet be in batell of this worlde may from day to day wynne prayse meryte.
The thyrde partye be they yt be in purgatorye whiche be in loue of god but they haue not done penaunce suffycyent for theyr synnes ye whiche they achyue in the sayd place of purgatorye.
And for as moche yt euery soule whiche is of ye nombre of yt one of these thre companyes vnto ye holy goost by g~ce.
The whiche holy goost is one in all is not all but one oonly chirche catholyke.
And lyke wyse as ye me~bres of ye body natural do ayde serue yt one vnto yt other euery of them in his offyce in lyke wyse ye me~bres of ye body mystycall of holy chirch~ do seruyce yt one vnto yt other for these blessyd saynt{is} praye for them ye whiche be in ye batayll reioyse the~ of theyr goodnes of ye con+uersaco~n penau~ce of sy~nes.
And they of ye batayl yt is of ye chirche mylytau~t gyue glory praysynge vnto god of ye tryu~phe victory of sayntes they make feestes solempnytees in erthe they founde chirches they gyue rente tresours in requyrynge the~ vnto theyr ayde by deuoute orysons.
In lykewy+se they praye vnto god for the~ of purgatory they offer sacryfye{is} almesdedes to allege theyr payne And they of purgatory praye for theyr benefactors aswel i~ purgatory as i~ heue~ as they be thyd come theyr prayers {pro}fyte gretly the~ of ye batayl of this world as it shalbe sayd herafter i~ ye treatyse of The werke of this artycle as vnto the moralyte is in thre maners.
The fyrste is to kepe the festes of the holy saynt{is} of paradyse in prayers in orysons in other deuocyons in requyrynge theyr ayde and helpe.
The seconde is for to praye for theym that be departed.
The thyrde is sufferaynly for to kepe hym to be exco~myned departed by mortall synne from so noble a company as is the holy chirche catholyke for it is impossyble yt yf a creature be in ye state of deedly synne hath the holy goost by grace.
And in lyke wyse as they the whiche haue ye holy goost be in nature angelyke or humayne make an holy chirche a body mystycal as it is sayd.
In lyke wyse by some semblau~ce the congregacyon of cursyd folke maketh a body mystycall in a chirche the whiche is of god acursyd.
And therfore ye fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche bereth not here his fruyte.
Here is to be no+ted that true faythfull loue maketh all thynges comyn.
And for as moche yt holy chirche is vnyed as it is sayd in the loue of yt holy goost euery man hath parte of the goodnes of that other as well in heuen as also in erthe for the sayntes of paradyse reioyse them of good werkes merytoryous yt whi+che be done vpon the erthe these faythfull cryste~ men Joye them moche fruytefully of the glory of these blessyd men.
Also in the erthe the true catholy+ke playned sorowed of the ylle of his neyghbour by compassyon mercy Joyed hym of his goodnes profyte by the whiche it appyred that he hath co~municacyon wt the holy sacrament{is} the whiche vnto them be comyn syngulerly with the ryght precyous body of Jhesu cryst the whiche vnto vs fy+gured and represented this vnyon.
Also in this artycle is conteyned the trought of all the sacrame~+tes of holy chirche in lyke wyse as the doctours sayen specyally in yt yt is sayd remissione~ peccato{rum} byleue the remyssyon of synnes for it may none otherwyse be done after the ordynau~ce dyuyne but by the sacramentes as it appyred of baptysme as it hath ben afore declared shall be herafter more playnely in the treatyse of confessyon.
The werke of this artyle as vnto the moralyte is to haue honour reuerence vnto the sacramentes of the chirche hym prepare them ensue as the very medycyne of all the sekenesses spyrytuell conseruatyf of of strength of helthe augmentatyf of grace of benedyccyon.
The fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche bereth not here his werke.
For as saynt Poule sayth in a moment and is as lytell whyle as one may close open the Joye all good and euyll shall aryse in body and in soule at this mysterye shall be all those blessyd angelles by the co~maundement of god in this lytell momente of tyme shall assemble the asshes and the douste of all erthely bodyes without that that he shall fayle one heere of his and that done in a moment or instant the blessyd Jhesu cryste in dyuyne nature and humayne shall yelde the propre body vnto euery soule them areysynge and gyuynge lyfe that neuer shall haue ende nor departynge.
But grete dyfference moche to meruayll shall be bytwene the bodyes of them that be damp+ned of them that ben blessyd.
For these dampned shall be blacke heuy stynkynge and horryble and so dysformed that none erthely herte ne may thynke it.
And by the contrarye the bodyes of them that ben blessyd they shall haue foure noblenesses that is claryte impossybylyte subtylyte and agylyte that these theologyens calle dowers of the whiche shall be sayd in spekynge of the glorye of paradyse Man may perswade the trought of this artycle by these thynges that we see in nature in arte in reason and in auctoryte.
Nature is moche to be meruaylled in a corne of whete or of other seed after that it shall be rotten by ye vertue or the sonne of the moysture of the erthe from the rottennes shall become quycke boudde the whiche shall yelde an hygh stalke and a ryght and for one corne there shall come an hondred.
Also it is seen in the moneth of Apryle one tree growynge or an other grete chosen braunche grene wt leues and coured with whyte floures and to yma+gen the lytell now rotten wherof he procedeth is a mater of ryght grete admyracyon.
And the puyssaunce naturall of the sonne and of the erthe maketh of a lytell corne rotten of newe so fayre and pleasaunt thynge.
Wherfore shall not the sonne of Justyce make it that is the blessyd Jhesu cryste in whome is puyssaunce dyuyne infynyte of the rottennes of ye body humayne a more fayr thyng than man may thynke.
Also we see that of ferne brente and put in to asshes man maketh by crafte these vesselles of glasse so fayre so clere and so pleasaunte that kynges popes and emperours leue cuppes masers of golde for to vse the pleasure of the glasse.
By the whiche then god the whiche is souerayne mayster of arte the whiche hath forged the sonne and the mone and the whiche hath made all thynge of nought may he not make of the asshes of a body humayne fayre vesselles and full of glorye shynynge more than the sonne.
Also reason vs telleth that trewely he the whiche was deed and is arysen he beynge a lyue may a reyse these other Also the auctoryte of saynt Poule wrytynge vnto the Corynthyens sayd.
So as Adam by his synne is cause of the deth of all these erthely men.
In lyky wyse Jhesu cryste theym shall areyse all by his Justyce.
The werke of this artycle as vnto the mo+ralyte is not to fere to deye for the trought of the fayth and for the loue of Jhesu cryste syns that we be certayne that he shall yelde vs body and soule in the moost fayrest moost noblest moost dygne of dysposycyon without ony comparyson than they be now for they shall be Immortall and Impassyble.
Also we sholde not wayle nor sorowe dysordynatly for the loue of our frendes and kynnesmen syns that we haue fayth and hope for to see other shortely.
The fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche not here the fruyte of this werke.
byleue that they the whiche haue kepte the trought of the fayth shall haue the lyfe eternall.
That is to saye requyre and desyre that it so be.
Here is to be noted that eternall lyf is none other thynge to vnderstande for to see knowe clerely in blessydnes of paradyse by the lyght of glorye that yt we see byleue in erthe in the lyght of the fayth that is the blessyd trynyte the fader the sone the holy goost the swete humanyte of Jhesu cryst of yt to haue fruiction for euer wtout ende in body in soule.
The whiche vysyon and fruiction wt the blessydnes is so grete herte ne vn+derstandynge may it thynke nor tonge declare for so moche that it is a thynge infynyte eternall as to haue god in the maner beforsayd.
And of that glorye shall be sayd afterwarde in the ende of this boke.
Also it is to be noted that notwithstandynge that in this artycle is not made nor exprest mencyon of the dampnacyon eternall of those that ben ylle how be it it is there ynough to be vnder+stande in that yt man byleueth that god is the Justyce infynyte the whiche is for to yelde vnto euery man that that he hath deserued.
They that haue well done after the Jugement shall go vnto lyf perdurable and eternall they that haue done ylle to the fyre of helle euerlastynge.
And this that is before sayd wryten is the holy fayth catholyke the whiche it behoueth to be kepte stedfastly entyerly vpon the payne of eternall dampnacyon.
The werke of this artycle as vnto the moralyte is to dysprayse these rychesses the loue the glorye the felycyte of this worlde in comparyson of the lyfe eternall.
Yf we thynke consyder ye goodnesses that god vs promytted in paradyse all the goodes of the erthe shall be lyke vnto vs vyle as no thynge.
Also it is to be more curyous mo+re desyrous for to seche these goodes by the we shall be honoured in ye other worlde infynytly that them of this mortall lyfe the whiche dyspose vs vnto dau~ger be dampned eternally.
And man ought to byleue yt the fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche bereth not here this werke.
By these thynges beforsayd it apyreth shortly in generall the substau~ce of the .xij. artycles of the fayth by yt trought of the whiche euery crysten man is to be ordred conserued pryncypally in the lyfe contemplatyue in lyke wyse as by the .x. co~mau~dementes man is well ordeyned pryncypally in the lyf actyf.
These doctours make a questyon that is to knowe yf euery crysten man the whiche hath aege dyscrecyon is bou~den to haue the knowlege of the .xij. or .xiiij. artycles beforsayd all in generall as partyculer.
Of crysten man some be in dygnyte or in offyce to teche or to redresse.
These other in the fayth in the co~mau~dementes of god they here be bou~de to knowe in partyculer those thynges the whiche they ought to teche vnto theyr subgectes.
These other crysten men be of symple lasse condycyon as the comynalte of the laye people and vnto them here it suffysed to knowe in partyculer these artycles of the fayth moost comyn as it is that there is but one god in trynyte of persone the whiche artycle he may kno+we by the comyn maner to make the token of the crosse in the name of the fader of the sone and of the holy goost.
Also they ought to knowe in par+tyculer these artycles the whiche ben in comyn vsa+ge of the festes of holy chirche as the Annuncyacyon the whiche represented that the virgyn Mary conceyued by the vertue of the holy goost.
Also the Natyuyte of our lorde the Passyon the Resur+reccyon the Ascensyon of whome men make testes solempnytees in some and certayne dayes euery yere.
For it is also as impossyble but that a crysten man the whiche hath wytte and age may knowe suche artycles yf he be not in suche wyse occupyed and blynded of the worlde that he dysprayseth the sauacyon of his soule the whiche thynge is deedly synne.
Also he is bounde for to byleue that who so trespasseth vnto his wyttynge ony of the .x. co~maundementes is in deedly synne.
Of these other thynges subtyle of our fayth the symple laye man ought not but lytell to inquy+re but to hym it suffysed to byleue in generall and to haue wyll for to deye in that fayth that our mo+der the holy chirche byleueth an holdeth.
The whi+che thynge vs lyketh to graunte the fader and the sone and the holy goost.
¬∂Here foloweth the seconde partye of this booke in the whiche is made mencyon of the .x. co~mau~dementes of the lawe.
God i~ vayne yu shalt not swere by nor other lyke.
Fad mod yu shalt honor to thende yu lyue longe.
Lechery yu shalt not do of body ne of consente.
Fals wytnes yu shalt not bere nor lye in ony wyse.
The werkes of ye fleshe yu desyre not but i~ maryage Other me~s good{is} yu shalt not coueyte to haue i~ iustli [Figure: AFter the treatyse of the .xij. artycles of the fayth here foloweth the .x. co~mau~dementes of the lawe.
God our fader omnypotent seenge knowynge the lytylnes fraylte of humayne na+ture he requyreth not of vs all enterly the seruyce that we ought to do vnto hym after the reygne of Justyce but vnto vs hath gyuen certayne nombre co~mau~dementes the whiche yf we them kepe ac+complysshed vnto hym it suffysed for to gyue vs saluacyon.
And they be named the .x. co~mau~deme~+tes of the fayth the whiche euery crysten man hath auowed promysed solemply in receyuynge the baptem.
By the whiche sacrament by hymself or in the persone of his godfaders or godmoders he renou~ceth vnto the deuyll vnto pryde vnto pompes vanytees of this worlde as it hath ben before sayd in promyttynge vowynge vnto Jhesu cryst vnto the holy chirche to kepe all the tyme of his lyf the .xij. artycles of the fayth conteyned in the Credo also the .x. co~mau~dementes of the lawe And this vowe here of the fayth of ye obedyence is so grete so solempne in euery crysten man that god nor holy chirche ne may with hym dyspence but that vpon payne of dampnacyon he is bou~de vnto the kynge.
Jhesus to kepe vnto hym the fayth promysed doynge hym the seruyce of the .x. co~mau~+dementes.
And euery persone the whiche hath ma+de the holy vowe of baptem accomplysshed not kepe the co~mau~dementes is a thynge lyke vnto a tree that bereth no fruyte the whiche is by the gospell of god acursyd.
Wherfore sayth well saynt James in his canon that fayth is sayd to be deed the whiche bereth not the fruyte of good werke.
This werke ef the .x. co~mau~dementes the whiche god nature vs hath gyuen wryten in thre maners vpon our bodyes in so moche that we haue .x. tooes on on our two feet ten fyngers on our two handes fyue wyttes of nature double in theyr organs instrumentes naturall.
For two eyes serue vnto the syght two eeres vnto the herynge two nosetrylles vnto the sauerynge two lyppes vnto the tastynge two other thynges for the touchyn+ge.
By the feet of the body to vs is sygnyfyed the desyres affeccyons of ye soule.
By the fyue wyttes of nature all our gouernau~ce as well of body as of soule.
And therfore our creatour vnto vs hath gyuen wryten the .x. co~mau~dementes in thre places maners before sayd doynge vs to knowe that by the .x. co~mau~dementes in all thynges in all places we sholde be gouerned as well ayenst god as ayenst our neyghbours.
We be well ordeyned ayenst the blessyd trynyte the fader the sone the holy goost by ye thre the fyrst co~mau~dementes than is to knowe yf we loue god the fader soueraynly we take not the na+me of Jhesu cryste in vayne in ony wyse ayenst the holy goost yf we kepe the feestes holely in ac+complysshynge duely these thre co~maundementes we dyspose vs to receyue of god our blessyd creatour the thre vertues theologyes or dyuynes that is to vnderstande charyte ayenst the fader hope ayenst the sone fayth lyght of grace ayenst the holy goost.
By these .vij. other co~mau~dementes we be well ordeyned ayenst ye vnyuersyte of our neyghbours Fyrst doynge vnto them good pleasure in place in tyme.
Secondely kepynge vs in offendynge vnto them doynge vylony or damage.
To do good vnto vs is commaunded in that that we ought to honour fader moder.
The whiche co~mau~dement conteyned and compreheded the seuen werkes of mercy as well corporall as spyrytuall the whiche here after shall be declared.
To do ylle vnto his neyghbours may be entended in thre ma+ners that is to knowe in dede in worde and in wyll.
Also a man may do ylle in dede to his neygh+bour in thre maners that is to vnderstande to his owne persone vnto his wyf or espouse and in his goodes mouable and vnmouale.
To do ylle vnto the very persone of his neyghbour vnto vs is defended by that that we sholde not do homycyde the whiche is the seconde of the seuen co~maundementes.
To do vylony or treason of auoutry ayen his wyf or vnto other persone vnto vs is defended in the thyrde the whiche is yu shalt not do the synne of lechery.
To do ylle vnto thy neyghbour in his goodes vnto vs is defended in ye fourth the whiche is be in no wyse a theef a sacryleger an vsurer a symonyer or a rauenour.
To do ylle vnto thy neyghbour vnto hym spekynge Jniurye or vnto hym shewynge his synne by euyll intencyon proce dynge of yre or of enuye vnto vs is defended in ye fyfth by yt yt we sholde bere no fals wytnes.
To do ylle vnto his neyghbour of wyll all oonly is vnder+stande in two maners.
The fyrst in couetynge car+nally the wyf or the doughter or also the wyf of the sone or the espouse of his neyghbour that vn to vs is defended in the sixte co~mau~dement whiche is he sholde not haue the desyre of lechery.
Secondely we may offende our neyghbour in desyryn+ge his goodes ouer reason ayenst Justyce that vnto vs is defended in ye seuenth the whiche is desyre not an other mannes goodes ayenst reason as it is sayd.
And by that it appyred that thre co~mau~+dementes be ordeyned vs ayenst god seuen ayenst our neyghbour the whiche ben ten the whiche is en+terly the lawe of god eternall he that trespassed in one all only he trespassed all the lawe synned mortally for he lesed charyte the whiche is consummacyon of the lawe his soule dysposed vnto dampnacyon.
Pryde ayenst god is defended in the fyrst co~mau~dement in the seconde.
Than it is to be noted fyrst that mortall synne is none other thynge but transgressyon of ony of the .x. co~mau~dementes by the whiche it foloweth that all mortall synne is defended by ye co~mau~dement{is} of god as it is sayd by the whiche it apyred ye necessyte of true intencyon clere knowlege of ye .x. co~mau~deme~t{is} to thende yt man may shewe synne them kept enterly merytoryously in the trea+tyse of the whiche shall be holden suche ordre.
Fyrste shall be shewed how he them vnto vs hath gyuen wryten in dyuers maners to the entent yt we sholde not haue excusacyon not doynge them.
Secondely shall be {pro}mysed benedicco~n to them that wyll kepe them the maledicco~n to them the whiche fere not to offende them.
Thyrdely shall be spoken of euery of them in partyculer as well of that is co~mau~ded fyrst as of that that is defen+ded consequently.
¬∂Here foloweth how god vnto vs hath gyuen the .x. co~mau~dementes in the lyght of our vnderstandynge.
AS vnto the fyrste it is to vnderstande that the god of nature hath put wryten the .x. co~mau~dementes not all oonly in the body as it is sayd but also in the lyght of the soule the whiche lyght and reason sayth that a man ought to loue god his neyghbour and that a man vnto hym ought not to do saye nor wyll that that a man wolde not hymself to be sayd done or wylled.
And in these two poyntes is comprysed all the holy scrypture as wytnesseth Jhesu cryste.
Also more ouer them he hath gyuen in wrytynge whan he gaue vnto Moyses the two tables of stone wryten wt his owne hande conteynynge the .x. co~mau~demen+tes ryght brefly ryght clerely ryght easely.
Ryght easely to the entente yt man them sholde studye Joyously.
Also the blessyd sone of god the fader theym vnto vs hath expowned declared in the gospell by his holy mouth doctry+ne in example by his holy lyf.
By the whiche it apyreth that no crysten man hauynge age knowlege hath no cause or excusacyon that he taketh not lerneth the co~mau~dementes necessary vnto saluacyon.
And this is as vnto the dyuers maners of the tradycyon of the .x. co~mau~dementes.
¬∂Here foloweth the benedyccyons promysed vnto them the which kepe the co~mau~dementes.
AS vnto the seconde the whiche is of the be+nedyccyons vnto them the whiche wyll ke+pe the co~mau~dementes that is to knowe god promytted vnto the Jewes rude and carnall all maners of goodes temporall the whiche they myght desyre in this worlde the whiche may be brought in to fyue maners.
The seconde helth abundaun+ce of godes necessary vnto this lyf as brede wyne and other necessaryes vnto the body.
And in these gyftes and promysses we+re the Jewes abundaunt and moche gloryous durynge that they obeyed vnto god and in that they kepte his co~maundementes.
In lyke wyse as it apyreth in the auncyente testamente the whiche in all thynges were fygured of the newe testament and of the estate of crysten people.
By the whiche it behoueth that in lyke wyse as god promytted the realme and the goodes of the erthe vnto them the whiche kepe by fere lytterally his co~mau~dementes as dyde the moost parte of the Jewes.
Also he promytted vnto all crysten people the whiche kepe them by true charyte spyrytually not all oonly the goodes beforsayd but with that in abondynge the goodes of his grace benedyccyon in this worl+de and ye realme the glory of paradyse eternally.
The benedyccyons promysed by the holy scrypture vnto the good faythfull crysten people true obseruatours of ye co~mau~dement{is} may be brought vnto .xij.
The fyrst for man may not do vnto god in this worlde a more certayne sacryfyce for to come vnto saluacyon for after masses fastynges al+mesdedes prayers man may be dampned but after the obseruau~ce of the co~mau~dementes man may not fayle to be saued.
The seconde for ye obedyence obseruau~ce of the co~mau~dementes is the moost precyous tresour that man may seche in this worlde.
The thyrde he yt kepeth the co~mau~deme~t{is} he is in the loue of Jhesu cryst hath his grace the whiche is so noble a thynge yt no herte may thynke it.
The fourth he hath with hym the fader the so+ne the holy goost by the whiche he ought to fere no thynge in this worlde but the separacyon of yt company.
The .v. he is endowed the broder of Jhe+su cryst enherytour of paradyse.
The .vi. all that that he demau~ded of god the whiche vnto hym is moost profytable to hym is gyuen in this worlde in the other.
The .vij. the creatures small grete vnto hym ben subgettes obedyent in that that it apperteyned vnto his goodnes saluacyon.
The viij. he may no thynge lese ye whiche vnto hym cometh be it prosperyte or aduersyte but for yt he wyn+neth in prosperyte by attemperau~ce in aduersyte by pacyence.
The .ix. he receyued ye benedyccyon of god in his prayers in his werkes.
The .x. sayth saynt Austyn allegynge auctoryte of holy scryptu+re that who so kepeth the co~mau~dement{is} may neuer deye an euyll deth in this worlde.
The .xi. he shall be preserued from the deth of helle eternall.
The .xij. he shall come Joyously vnto the vysyon of god eternall possessyon of the realme of paradyse.
By the whiche it apyreth that of good ryght they be called his co~mau~dementes the pathe the waye by two reasons.
The fyrst for as moche that by the obseruau~ce of the co~mau~demantes god cometh descendeth in to vs in geuynge vs grace.
The seconde for as moche as it is the meane by the whiche we go to hym in glorye.
¬∂Here foloweth the maledyccyons of them that trespassen the co~m~au~dementes of god.
THe maledyccyons of them that trespassen the co~mau~dementes ben infynyte.
How be it they may somwhat vnderstande by the opposyte of ye benedyccyons beforsayd.
For yf they be not punysshed in this worlde temporally by the which punycyon they receyuen true correccyon they shall be punysshed of eternall dampnacyon.
And vnto many it becometh that they be punysshed in this worlde and in the other.
In this worlde in theyr lyne fals and accursyd the whiche gyueth vnto the fader and vnto the moder desolacyon and sorowe.
Also these fruytes of the erthe decay and perysshe oftentymes by lyghtnynges and tempestes of the tyme.
And that cometh oftentyme by the transgressyon of the co~mau~dement{is}.
Also they falle in dyuerse aduentures of sykenesses as well spyrytuell as corporell.
Also vnto them cometh warre by the whiche they be pylled and destroyed wyues wydowes childern faderles and moderles and mannes blood shedde.
Also hongers mortalytees and all other maledyccyons that may be sayd and thought.
And all that cometh by the rebellyon that man doth vnto his creatour not kepynge his holy commaundementes the whiche he hath gyuen vpon the payne of lesynge goodes meouable and herytages.
By these goodes meouable is for to be vnderstande pryncypally the grace of god in this worlde.
Also vpon the payne of lesynge of body and of soule and to be co~dempned vnto the gybet of helle.
But symple people make here admyracyon for as moche as they see sensybly and more comenly that they the whiche kepe them worste or leste they haue more of worldely prosperyte than they that kepe them by the whiche they be the lesse ferefull to offende god.
But suche doubte or admyracyon is grete dau~gerous defaute of fayth of true inten+cyon for there is not a more greter token of damp nacyon than to haue prosperyte worldely not ke+pynge the co~mau~dementes of god.
And in lykewy+se as Jhesu cryste bare the payne of the synnes of his people wherof he had not done the gylte so these chosen suffre oftentymes grete aduersytees tem+porall the whiche cometh for the synnes of them the whiche go vnto helle that haue had theyr felycyte theyr Joye in this worlde.
AS vnto the thyrde poynt the whiche is to see of euery co~mau~dement in partyculer it is to knowe that the fyrst co~maundement is to byleue in god to put in hym his trust hym loue aboue all thynges in seruynge hym deuoutely.
In this present co~maundement be conteyned two thynges that one is co~mau~ded that other defen+ded.
By the whiche it is to be noted that where it is so that charyte is the ende the goodnes consummacyon of all the lawe of god it behoueth to saye that charyte is co~maunded in euery of the .x. co~maundementes the whiche is shewed as well ayenst god as ayenst his neyghbour in many and dy+uers operacyons after the dystynccyon of the commau~dementes as it apyreth here after.
The thyn+ge co~mau~ded than pryncypally in the thre the fyrst co~maundementes is charyte ayenst all the blessyd trynyte the whiche charyte is shewed by humble adoracyon seruyce all oonly due vnto the fader vnto the sone vnto the holy goost.
That adoracyon ought to be done of soule of body of soule he may not do it nor accomplysshe merytoryously yf he haue not true fayth hope charyte.
To the entente than that symple people may haue some knowlege of thre vertues without the whiche it is impossyble for to come vnto saluacyon it behoueth to saye some thynge in shorte in generall And for as moche as haue declared the noblesse and dygnyte of the fayth in the fyrste treatyse reste as now to see of charyte.
Charyte is a noble vertue moder nouryce and lyght of these other vertues by the whiche man loued god aboue all thynges his neyghbour as hymself.
That is to saye that for to wynne ony good create be it neuer so grete or for to kepe hym from the lesynge of it man sholde not do ayenst the wyll and co~mau~dement of god.
For euery persone that kepeth it for the losse of ony thynge or the gaynes trespassynge ony of the commaundementes of god he hath no trewe charyte.
And yf before that he synned mortally he were in charyte he it leseth all hole by the whiche losse he is gretely in dammage.
For he the whiche was by the vertue of charyte the sone of god by adopcyon is made the sone of the deuyll of helle by imitacyon and the sone of dampnacyon and of perdycyon.
He the whiche was in beaute spyrytuall vnto the ymage and semblaunce of the blessyd trynyte is horryble and deformed as a spyryte dampned.
He the whiche hadde god the whiche is the good infynyte hath all loste in lesynge charyte.
He the whiche was the broder of Jhesu cryste enherytour of paradyse and of the holy angelles honoured and praysed is the seruau~t of the deuyll and of mortall synne and vnto the deth eternall condempned yf by trewe penaunce he be not releued.
Charyte is the noble robe lyght of the weddynges of paradyse wherof the soule the espouse of Jhesu cryste is anorned without the whiche man shalbe confusedly put out departed from the company of all those yt be chosen the whi+che hath holden kepte this boke in lyke wyse as sayth saynt Johan.
Who so hath charyte is with god god with hym and by the vertue grace of this presence vnyon of the soule with god god with the soule cometh the lyf spyrytuall.
For so as saynt Austyn sayth as ye soule gyueth vnto the body myght to meue hym to do his operaco~ns so god gyuech vnto the soule beynge in true chary+te. xij. fruytes that saynt Poule rehersed that is to vnderstande Joye spyrytuall one pease yt the world may not gyue pacyence in aduersyte swetnes bon+te amyte longanimite fydelyte temperau~ce contynence chastyte, And for to speke shortly he yt hath charyte hath all goodnes he yt hath it not hath no thynge.
And therfore sayth our lorde in yt gospell he that loueth god his neyghbour accom+plysshed all the holy scrypture hy~ it suffysed vnto saluacyon by the consequens he yt offended charyte putteth his soule vnto dampnaco~n.
These doctours make a questyon yf a man may well kno+we of hymself or of an other yf he haue true charyte.
The answere is yt a man may not knowe by the waye of nature but well by ye reuelaco~n of god as haue had some holy persones The whiche thyn+ge is not profytable or necessary of the comen lawe to thende that we be alwayes in fere in mekenes.
And therfore sayth holy scrypture no man knowed it that is to knowe by certaynte humayne yf he be in the loue or in the drede of god.
But ony may knowe by some correctours as Saynt Bernarde sayth.
Fyrste whan the persone hath dyspleasure of his synnes of his cursyd wycked lyf for the loue of god.
The seconde whan he hath ferme purpose for to kepe hym from synne mortally in tyme to come.
The thyrde whan he fyndeth hymself redy Joyefull in vsynge good werkes.
The fourth after some is whan a man here wylfully hereth the worde of god for the gospell sayth that they the whiche ben of goddes partye heren gladly to speke of hym.
And it is a lyke Jugement of them the whiche in redynge or in herynge thynges of deuocyon proufytable vnto the soule fynde sauour enioye them in theyr spyryte.
This noble vertue of charyte shewed hym in these good crysten men without forth he knelynge Joynynge his handes in berynge honour reuerence vnto the holy sacramentes vnto the relyques ymages of sayntes not oonly that a man ought to worshyp the ymages nor to haue hope in ye fayre more than in the foule or vyle.
For that sholde be ydolatrye but a man ought to bere reuerence for the honour of the holy sayntes the whiche they represent who me we sholde knowe for as moche as god theym hath approued by myracles by vertues by holy lyf.
Also we sholde bere honour reuerence vnto the prelates of holy chirche the whiche ben the admynystratours of the sacramentes.
And who soo doth the contrarye by pryde or by malyce is not the true childe of the holy chirche.
The thynge defended in the fyrst co~mau~dement is pryde ayens god all maner of ydolatrye.
The fyrst is whan the persone byleueth to haue the goodes of the grace of nature or of fortune of hymself not of god.
And that cometh whan the persone is vnkynde ayenst god of the sayd goodes not yeldynge hym thankes mercyes.
The seconde maner of pryde is whan the persone byleued well to haue all goodnes of god but he that vnderstanded that it is by his me+rytes pryncypally whiche thynge is outragyous presumpcyon detestable ayenst god.
The thyrde is in auau~tynge hymself to haue ye goodes spyrytuell or temporell the whiche man hath not as yf it we+re to haue connynge vertue or deuocyon.
And in so doynge it is arrogance iactance ypocresye as vnto regarde of the goodes spyrytuell and vayne glorye as vnto the regarde of the goodes outwarde As be the goodes of fortune.
And that pryde is she+wed in gownes in furres with sleuys with syde lap+pes or plyted in cuttynges dysgysed of dyuers facyons some naked vnto the sholders or all moost vnto the pappes in doublettes in cotes in gyrdelles in chaynes in rynges with precyous stones excedynge not apperteynynge vnto the estate of the persone nor vnto the honeste of holy crystendome And there in he may haue so grete notable exces affeccyon so dysordynatly that it is dedely synne And that may come in all estates be it grete lytel or meane.
The fourth maner of pryde is whan ye persone appetyted dysordynatly to appere excelle~t aboue these other be it in connynge in beaute in strength rychesse or other goodes.
And of that procedeth errour ambycyon vayne glory inobedyence vnto his souerayns rebellyon syngularyte in abylymentes in wordes in opynyons partynacyte dyscordes noyses contencyons debates slau~dres dyuysyons.
The whiche thynges somtyme be mortall synne or venyall after the dyuersyte of the circu~stances.
As oftentymes as many as pry+de is co~mytted by delyberacyon fully consented it is dedely synne in foure maners beforsayd.
And of all these thynges he ought to examen ye persone after his estate his callynge be he seculer or of re+lygyon.
Ydolatrye defended in the fyrst co~maundement is co~mytted in fyue maners.
The fyrst is that of the paynems ye whiche worshyppe the deuylles.
The seconde is of the fals Jewes the whiche yet abyden Jhesu cryste receyuen the antecryst.
The thyrde is of the sarrasyns the whiche worshyp Mahonde heretyke dampned.
The fourth is the fals ymagynacyon of these heretykes be they crysten men or other ye whi+che ayen saye vnto fayth of holy chirche the whi+che is gouerned of the holy goost.
The fyfth is of these fals crysten men is co~mytted in thre maners that is to knowe by pryde by couetyse by lechery.
And vnto these .iij. maners may be brough+te all other maners of synne.
And so it foloweth who that synned mortally loued not god his creatour perfectly.
And for as moche as the lecherous man loued to be honoured praysed dysordynatly the couytous man loued his rychesse worldely and the lecherous man his pleasure carnally ayen the prohybycyon and defence of god his creatour they make theyr god of these thynges before sayd.
For soo as these doctours sayen the thynge that ony man loued soueraynly that thynge is his god.
By the whiche it appyreth that the ydolatrye of these euyll crysten men prowde men couytous men and lecherous men is more to be dyspysed than that of the paynems and of sarrasyns the whiche well consyderen the hyghnes of the lawe of Jhesu cryst the vnkyndnes of these euyll and vnfaythfull crysten men.
Take hede than the syn+ner that wyll examen his conscyence in the whiche is pryncypally his loue his thought his desyres and yf he fynde that there be ony thynge worldely accuse hym as a fals traytour vnkynde and an ydolatrer.
Also in lyke wyse he ought to take hede yf he hath ben impacyente of the Jugementes of god as of the deth of frendes of the losse of goodes of pouerte of malyce of defamynge of warre or of other trybulacyons.
For as saynt Gregory sayth there may not come ylle of payne in this worlde as ben these thynges abouesayd where as it is by the wyll and ordynaunce of god.
Now it is soo that of the ordynaunce and Jugement of god may no thynge procede but that it be good well done.
By the whiche it appyreth that who so meruayled dysordynatly of a thynge well done is none other thynge than to contrary to take god his operacyons ordenau~ces Jugementes the whiche thynge is blasfemynge horryble detestable.
Here than ought the persone to take hede of the synne of murmuraco~n of impacyence of dyspayre.
Al+so vpon this co~mau~dement he ought to examen hy~ of all fals byleues as of sorceryes of wrytynges of caracters of inuocaco~ns of deuylles of diuinacyons of folysshe byleues vnto ye regarde of the co~+stellaco~ns in ye whiche ye childe was borne of ye songe or cryeng of ony byrdes or metyng of some best{is} Also yf he be arested in ony dremes in byleuynge that for the dyuersyte of dremes to hym shal come Ioye or desolacyon.
Also yf he put trust vnto these bokes reproued as is the scyence the whiche is called of the arte inuocatoria or other in these thynges there may be mortall synne after the qualyte of the persone the malyce of the caas in other dyuers maners the whiche sholde be to longe for to telle as these doctours them distyncten determen Also here the persone ought to take hede yf he haue made ony vowes the whiche by forgetfulnes by neclygence or by malyce he hath trespassed.
Also yf he hath made a vowe a thynge vnlefull to do or in lettynge of more gretter good as woman ye make vowes not to kembe them or not to wasshe them or not to spynne on some dayes the whiche ben grete superstycyons folysshe.
And it is to be noted that these bysshoppes or those vnto whome they haue gyuen auctoryte may chau~ge the vowes of theyr subgectes for some good causes reasona+ble.
Excepte the vowe of chastyte of relygyon of of pylgremage vnto saynt Iames of Rome of Iherusalem the whiche vowes aperteyne all oonly vnto the puyssaunce apostolycall with other yf it please hym them to retayne.
Also it is to be noted that as oftentymes as the persone breketh his vowe without Iuste resonable cause as oftentymes he synned mortally.
An example who so had auowed chastyte after maryed with intencyon to ac+complysshe the werkes of maryage synned mortal+ly in maryenge hym.
Also the fyrste tyme that he accomplyssed the dede of maryage he synned mortally ayen.
Also as oftentymes as he accomplysshed the dede of maryage by his request he synned ayen mortally.
An other thynge it sholde be yf at the request of the partye she yeldeth the deuour of maryage ayen her wyll assoyled.
Soo may a man saye of fastynges and other thynges that a man hath auouwed.
THou shalt not swere by god in vayne nor by none other thynge.
In this present co~mau~dement is some thynge co~mau~ded ye other defended.
The thynge co~mau~ded is to accomplysshe our vowes Iustely lawfully to kepe the trouth of the fayth our holy baptem vnto the whiche we haue taken receyued the name of Ihesu cryste or of a crysten man the whiche is a vayne thynge yf we accomplysshe not the werkes of a true crysten man in kepynge fayth trouth lawfull for the loue of god pryncypally.
Of the trouth of ye fayth hath ben before sayd in the treatyse of baptem wherfore of that vertue it suffysed as now.
The thynge defended pryncypally is that a man shall not swere for no thynge that the thynge the whiche is fals be true or that the trouth be fals for in that he is forsworne.
And yf it were in Iugement ouer the dedely synne it sholde be infamye bou~de to restytucyon of the da~mage the whiche of it cometh a caas comenly reserued vnto the bysshop Also here ben defended horryble othes detestable as ben by goddes deth by his vertues by his passyon by his heed by his woundes by his bely or cursynge hymself and geuynge hym to the deuyll other inuencyons in the whiche many crysten men be more to be behated than Iewes or sarrasyns.
And they ought to be punysshed after the lawes as theues and mordres wherof is grete defaute in them that sholde remedye it do it not.
Also here offended peryllously those the whiche as at euery worde for no thynge swere by my fayth by god¬∑ by our lady so of other othes the which custome is moche peryllous.
And of that cometh oftentymes that for a penny of marchaundyse or a lytell ware the seller and the byer forswere them by ten or twelue tymes in the whiche it appyreth that after these thynges theyr synne excedeth that of Iudas.
And of that abusyon of swerynge sayth the holy scrypture that he the whiche swereth oftentyme shall be fulfylled with iniquyte shall not longe abyde without the punysshement of god Vnto the transgressyon of that co~mau~dement ben brought the brekynge of vowes of maryage the reuelacyon of secretes of an other vnto his grete da~mage and preiudyce.
Also in lyke wyse synnen they that swere to make a thynge the whiche is synne or Iniuste of hymself yet they do it worse in it accomplysshynge.
Here is defended pryde ayen god also as in the fyrst.
THou shalt kepe the holy dayes in doynge holy werkes in the whiche vnto vs is some thynge co~mau~ded the other defended.
The thyn+ge co~maunded is charyte the whiche is shewed in halowynge.
And secondely in halowynge the solempnyte of the holy sondaye of other festes co~mau~ded The whiche is done in reknowlegynge god of the benefytes of the creacyon by souerayne puyssau~ce of the redempcyon by his souerayne wysdome of glorye that he vs promysed that he vnto vs hath purchased by his souerayne bou~te.
Also in examynynge his conscyence of euyll thoughtes wordes of euyll werkes for to make a lawfull confessyon in place in tyme.
Also in occupyenge hymself in holy medytacyons praysynges prayers orysons in herynge masses sermons.
In occupyenge hymself in the werkes of pyte of mercy be they corporell or spyrytuell.
Of the whiche werkes shall be sayd more here after.
And in soo doynge duely man seched augme~tacyon of goodes as wel corporell as spyrytuell pryncypally the vertue of hope the whiche procedeth is purchased in ye soule of a crysten man by the consyderacyon of bou~te lybaralyte of god by ye propre werkes good merytoryous of the persone in lyke wyse as reherced the mayster of ye sentences.
And without suche consyderacyon man may not haue true hope.
The lyberalyte of god the bou~te ayen nature humayne appyreth infynytly by that that is sayd in the treatyse of the artycles.
But with this consyderacyon lyberalyte of god it behoueth that we consyder our lyf our werkes.
For yf the lyf be confer+med vnto the co~mau~dementes of god we ought to hope stedfastly that the Justyce dyuyne vs shall re+warde after that it aperteyned vnto the lyberalyte of his dyuyne maieste.
And yf our lyf our werkes ben other that is to knowe that they be contrary vnto the co~mau~dementes of god vnto the vowe made vnto baptem that sholde be presump+cyon not hope to wene for to come vnto saluacy+on.
By hope a man hath myght strength ayen the trybulacyons and aduersytees worldely and bryngeth a man vnto saluacyon.
Also it is to be noted that so as there is one fayth infused and put in the soule by the vertue of god.
In lyke wyse there is an other founde by study doctryne and predycacyons of holy scrypture.
And also a man may saye after these doctours that he may well haue in the persone two maner of hopes and of charyte that is for to knowe infused and purchased and this suffysed as now of the thre vertues dyuyne that is fayth hope and charyte.
Here foloweth that the whiche vnto vs is defended they ben worl+dely werkes and seruyles feyres markettes pledynges all other occupacyons corporall the whi+che may lette vs from the thynges beforsayd.
The which thynge ought to be vnderstande whan these sayd thynges be acco~plysshed by couetyse auaryce worldly.
For in the caas of necessyte or some lytell thynge a man may do almesdede or charyte wtout co~tempte of ye co~mau~deme~t of god of holy chirch~ a ma~ may do some of ye sayd thyng{is} wtout sy~ne spe+cyally wha~ a ma~ had herde masse do his deuour ayen god.
For a man sayth comenly that charyte necessyte hath no lawe.
In that co~mau~dement is defended slouth the whiche is an heuynes noyau~+ce to do well to saye well to occupye hym selfe well.
This synne hath .vi. braunches as declared saynt Gregory in the .xxxi. boke of his moralles that is to knowe malyce rancoure dyspayre pusillanimyte vnclennes euagacyon of thoughtes Malyce is taken here for a maner of ymagynacyon of ylle ayen these holy persones the whiche war+ned these slouthfull people to do well they it disdayne in theyr courage.
Rancoure is to shewe suche indygnacyon by some taken outwarde.
Pusillanimyte is to flee the werke of cou~sell of perfeccyon or fere to take laborous werkes.
Vnclennes is a slouth lachosnes to accomplysshe the co~mau~+dementes of god.
Euagacion of thought is to gyue occupye hymself with talkynges in folysshe vayne langage to brynge hymselfe here there vnprofytably or to chau~ge his courage from one thynge vnto an other.
Dyspayre is somtyme synne ayen ye holy goost wherof there are .vi. maners contraryous vnto the .vi. operacyons the whiche the holy goost maketh in the soule the whiche is in the estate of grace.
The fyrst operacyon is that he gyued hope of the mercy of god ayen that grace is proprely dyspayre as it was in Cayn in Judas.
And thatt cometh whan the persone byleueth holdeth that for penaunce or for prayer that he doth god wyll not pardon hym the whiche thynge is ayen ye infynyte bonte mercy of god.
The seconde operacyon of the holy goost is to gyue an holy fere of god in the soule.
And ayen that grace is presumpcyon the whiche is in suche wyse to pre+sume of the mercy of god that ye persone despysed mystaked his Justyce as ben a maner of synners dulled the whiche answere vnto them that them re+preuen that god hath not made them for to haue them lost.
The thyrde operacyon of the holy goost is to gyue teche the holy trouth necessarye vnto saluacyon.
And ayen that grace is impugnacyon of trouth the whiche is whan the persone of certay+ne malyce ayen sayth vnto the trouth of the fayth of the co~mau~dementes in dytynge hym to proue the contrarye vnto the trouth.
The fourth operacyon of the holy goost is to gyue ayde vnto the soule by grace dyuyne.
And ayen that grace is a dyspleasure of spyrytuell goodnes of the grace of his neyghbour in repugnynge by certayna malyce vnto the honour of god and the vnyon of the membres of holy chirche.
The fyfth operacyon is to gyue vnto the soule true correccyon of his synnes.
And ayen that grace is obstynacyon purpose neuer to repente hym of his synne he is named fynally impenytent.
The sixt operacyon of the ho+ly goost is to haue a ferme purpose neuer to co~myt+te thynge that is contrary vnto the honour holy wyll of god.
And ayen this grace is obstinacyon ferme purpose not to leue or departe hym from ye pleasure that he hath in his synnes as pryde coue+tyse lecherye.
And it is to be noted that these .vi. maner of synnes beforsayd be sayd inremyssyble but not in suche wyse but that god may them well pardonne yf the synner wolde do penaunce.
For as saynt Austyn sayth there was neuer so grete a synner but that he ought to haue hope of his saluacyon in as moche as god hym hath gyuen lyf.
But they ben named inremyssybles for as moche that full fewe arysen with grete payne.
And to ye entente that a man may lyghtly retorne comprehende the .vi. graces of ye holy goost the .vi. synnes contraryous they be reputed in suche forme.
Dyspayre ayen hope presumpcyon ayen the fere of god impugnacyon of the trouth ayen the knowlege of ye trouth dyspleasure of goodes spirytuell ayen ayde by the grace of god beynge in purpose to do no penau~ce ayen contrycyon of his synnes beynge in purpose alwayes to contynue in synne ayen ye purpose to absteyne hym.
THou shalt loue thy neyghbour as thyself pryncypally thy fader thy moder.
In this present co~mau~dement vnto vs is some thynge co~mau~ded the other defended.
The thynge co~mau~+ded is charytable to bere honour and reuerence to do seruyce with herte with worde vnto our souerayns and pryncypally vnto fader vnto moder the whiche thynge ought to be vnderstande ge+nerally specyally.
Specyally it ought to be vnderstande of the fader of the moder naturall also of the spyrytuell as ben the pope the bysshop and the curate.
Generally they be vnderstande of the kynge of duke of erle of baron of au~cyentes of them that gyuen good example by theyr lyfe and doctryne consequently they folowe that co~mau~dement ayen all the sones and doughters of Adam of Eue the whiche were our fyrst frendes we sholde honoure in theyr lygne that is in our bredern systern in nature hamayne.
By the whiche it appyreth that in lykewyse as the thre ye fyrst co~mau~dementes of the fyrst table of the lawe taken vnto Moyses we sholde worshyppe duely by fayth hope charyte ayen the fader the sone the holy goost.
Also this fourth co~maundement the whiche is the fyrst of the seconde table conteyned in hym vertuously the .vij. werkes of mercy of the whiche is made mencyon in thyrde partye of this present booke.
It conteyned also these .vi. other co~mau~dementes ye whiche folowen the whiche vnto vs be ordeyned duely ayen the vnyuersyte of our neyghbours the whiche ordynau~ce kepte accomplysshed vnto vs ben necessarye the foure vertues cardynalles that is to knowe prudence force attemperau~ce Justyce the whiche techen and adressen hym his neyghbour vertuously and morally.
Prudence is a moche noble vertue the whiche dyscerned bytwene good ylle and the grete with the lytell and the lytell ylle with the gretter.
By the whiche also a man chesed the good fleed the ylle.
This vertue chesed more sooner the gretter good than the lytell for as nothynge dyscerned well the whiche chesed not well.
By the whiche it is for to knowe that prudence consydered thre maner of goodes thre maner of ylles that is to kno+we the lytell the grete ye souerayne.
They than the whiche haue prudence in the lyght of charyte chesen the goodes of the soule as ben these noble merytoryous vertues by the whiche they come vnto souerayne goodes in glorye.
But prudence carnall worldely and deuyllesshe chesed the lytell goodes of this worlde lesed the souerayne is brought vnto souerayne ylle of helle.
Justyce is a noble vertue by the whiche a man gy+ued vnto euery man that that is his.
That is to knowe in generall vnto god obedyence vnto his neyghbour innocence vnto hymself clennes of con+scyence.
Innocence is to do nothynge vnto his neyghbour that he wolde not vnto hymself to be done In lyke wyse as by Justyce a man doth well plesure vnto his neyghbour by innocence a man kepeth hym from offendynge hym.
Force is an other vertue by the whiche a man vndertaketh to do or suffre for the loue of god these thynges stronge harde.
As yf it sholde be to do grete penau~ce to en+tre in to relygyon to pardonne grete offences to ouercome his propre inclynacyons to suffre Iniuryes passyons.
Attemperau~ce is a noble vertue whiche putteth measure in all these other vertues. and without maner attemperau~ce no vertue is parfyte.
Also attemperau~ce gouerned the persone in his fyue wyttes of nature restrayneth putteh measure in all sensuall appetyte.
The thynge pryncypally defended in this co~mau~dement is pry+de rebellyon ayen our neyghbour specyally ayen our souerayns in lykewyse as it hath ben sayd in the fyrst co~mau~dement.
Ayenst this co~mau~dement ben pryncypally these childern yt whiche ben harde in herte rude in wordes frowarde in werkes ayen theyr frendes souerayns.
And yf there be mortall exces they ben of god accursyd by sentence of dyuyne scrypture.
For fyrst they sholde dye be stoned of all the people after the auncyent la+we.
Also they come comenly to grete pouerte and mysery by the Juste Jugement of god.
Also they lese all good renowne be in hatred with all the worlde.
Also and furthermore they ben in gylte of the synne of the transgressyon of all the lawes that is to knowe of nature of dyuyne scrypture and of lawe Canon the lawe Cyuyle in the whiche lawes is co~mau~ded enioyned the honour of the fa+der of the moder.
By the whiche it behoueth for to conclude that who so doth the contrary is worth of eternall dampnacyon.
Also yf they do not theyr deuour ayen theyr frendes that ben deed they offen+de this co~maundement and ben worthy of grete punycyon temporall spyrytuall.
Also those the whiche mocken with these auncyentes or the whiche bere not honour vnto the people of the chirche syngulerly for the honour of theyr offyce and dygnyte and also vnto the noble people Justyce seculer for as moche as god suffreth and gyueth puyssaunce vpon theyr subgectes they trespassen this commaundement mortally or venyally after the canses and circu~staunces of the offence the whi+che they co~mytte of the whiche shall be seen in the treatyse of co~fessyon.
Also it is here wel to be noted that the childern owen vnto theyr frendes many thynges that is to knowe loue of herte honour in wordes purucaunce of thynges necessarye seruyce and obedyence supportacyon in theyr defautes and pacyently for to endure yf they gyuen or make ony persecucyon and he that doth the contrary may not be parfyte the obseruytour of this commaundement.
THou shalt slee no man in this co~maundement vnto vs is some thynge co~maunded and the other defended.
The thynge co~maunded is charytably to socoure our neyghbour in kepynge hym vnto our power in place and in tyme that he renne not or falle not in ony of the foure maner of dethes the whiche folowen.
For as for to come vnto saluacyon it is not all oonly requyred ney+ther to slee bete kylle or do ony other dyspleasure vnto his neyghbour but it behoueth of necessyte of the co~mau~dement of god to do vnto hym pleasure in tyme in place in preseruynge his lyfe in defendynge hym from the deth.
For we sholde not in ony maner wyse what soo euer yt it be to be Iniustely the cause of the deth of our neyghbour.
As vnto the thynge defended is to be noted that there be foure maner of lyues by the consequent foure maner of dethes.
For deth is none other thy~+ge than the separacyon of lyfe.
And for as moche as there ben foure maner of lyues in lyky wyse a man may fynde foure maner of dethes.
The foure maner of lyf is lyf naturall lyf in substau~ce temporall lyf in helth corporall lyf in renowne spirytuall.
Than vnto the lyterall sens by this co~mau~dement is pryncypally defended manslaughter that is to be the causer by dede by cou~sell by co~mau~de+ment by wyll or otherwyse of the deth of an other vnto thy wyttynge by wrath or by ylle wyll and wtout ordre of Justyce.
Ayenst this co~mau~dement do these prynces theyr counsellers the whiche by couetyse or tyrannye meouen warres bataylles the whiche they may not do Justely without fyue condycyons.
That is to knowe Juste auctoryte good pyteous affeccyon in hym ye whiche is Juged the whiche batayll and warre he ought to do.
Good intencyon certayne condycyon in hym or them the whiche putteth the warre in execucyon that they vnto whome he maketh warre be worthy of punycyon.
Ayenst this co~mau~dement doo they the whiche by theyr couytousnes put them in warre for they haue noo good ryghtfull intencyon.
Also the people of the chirche be not of condycyon that they sholde excercyse mortall warre to make effusyon of humayne blood.
For in so doynge they sholde be irreguler indygne of ye saerament of hym the whiche hath co~maunded that a man sholde loue his enmyes.
Also ayen this co~mau~dement synne men women be they in maryage or other wyse the whiche by theyr flesshely dysordynate indyscrecyon cursyd goueruynge or also by malyce or vnto theyr wyttynge ben ye causers that a woman lefeth her fruyte that it cometh forth deed.
Also as vnto the lyf of substau~ce temporall ayen that co~maundement do those the whiche pyl+len stelen taken awaye or wtholde from an other for as moche as is in theym they take from theyr neyghbour the thynge the whiche vnto hym is necessarye where with he sholde susteyne his lyfe by the whiche as vnto that they be ye causers of his deth.
And of this sholde well take hede these aduo+cates worldely grete pleders the whiche oftentymes make the poore symple for to lese meouables and herytages as ben poore wydowes childern fa+derles and moderles other.
For suche theues pyllers ryally may be sayd mordres in as moche as they stele and take awaye from the poore people theyr substaunce and goodes of the whiche they myght haue theyr lyuynge.
Also they the whiche by defaute of charyte lete these poore people deye for hongre or in pryson by defaute of theyr ayde whan they may and sholde do it.
Also as vnto the lyf of helth corporell ayen this commaundement do they the whiche stryuen and stryken ayenst the ordynaunce of Justyce in hurtynge ony persone and in puttynge hym from his good helth.
Also as vnto the lyf spyrytuall ayen this commaundement done those the whiche hate theyr neyghboures or page duplicate] page duplicate] the whiche by coueytousnes or of euyll dysposicyon desyre the deth of an other.
For holy scryp+ture sayth who so hated his neyghbour is a man kyller.
Wherfore it is to be noted that manslaugh+ter is co~mytted somtyme in courage and wyll all oonly and not as in dede outwarde.
Somtyme it is co~mytted of dede and not of wyll.
An example of the fyrst The Jewes by theyr Ire and enuye by counseyll and wordes put the sone of god the fader vnto deth without touchynge hym with theyr handes so as it appyreth by the gospell in that that they sayen it is not lefull vnto vs for to put no man to deth in alledgynge theyr holynes and Justyce.
And alwayes the blessyd sone of god sayd vnto Pylate Those the whiche me haue betaken vnto the that is for to vnderstande those bysshoppes scrybes and the pharysees haue more greuously synned than thou.
The whiche oftentymes hadde ma+de shedde his precyous blood by the torment of fla+gellacyon.
By the whiche Ire and enuye may be so greuous that they may be compared vnto man kyllers.
So ought a man vpon this commaundement to examen hym of his synnes the whiche fo+lowen in a shorte declaracyon.
And fyrst of enuye Enuye after saynt Gregory hath fyue braunches That is for to knowe hatred of herte susurracyon detraccyon for to enioye hym of ylle and for to be sory of his neyghbours welfare.
Susurracyon is for to speke cursyd langage by malyce for to put noyses in some persones.
Detraccyon is for to speke cursyd langage for to take from his neyghbour his good renowne or good name.
And ryght often in these two maners there is deedly synne dampnable and suche people may not be assoyled without ferme purpose for to restore his neyghbour vnto his good name and fame.
good name is more worthe than myllyons of golde of syluer and as oftentymes as he hath taken from ony man two pens or fyue shellynges he may not haue absolucyon without restytucyon of dede or in purpose.
And for as moche the counseyll of the wyse Salomon is that as with detractours no man kepe company with wor+des.
For not all oonly to speke detraccyon or susurracyon by hate or by enuye of his neyghbour.
But with that to prouoke or for to be the cause or hym for to reioyse that suche langage is spoken or wylfully it hereth it is a grete synne and a dampnable And as sayth a glose vpon the margen of this wry+tynge that by this synne of detraccyon well nygh all the worlde is dampned and that we may coniecte.
For suppose that many confesse them of that synne how be it they make no restytucyon.
And for to see the remedye in that caas there ben many confessours vndyscrete in assoylynge to lygh+tely.
This fals and accursyd synne is co~mytte some tyme in puttynge ylle on his neyghbour the whiche is not true or whan it is true but by wordes a man it byleued or whan it is ylle it is secrete a man it shewed ayenst the ordres of charyte or so whan a man sayth that the thynge the whiche of hym is good hath be done in cursyd intencyon.
So+me tyme in holdynge his pease of the goodnes of his neyghbour by enuye and in all maners there may be deedly synne dampnable for it is ayenst charyte in takynge awaye or in mynysshynge the good name of his neyghbour.
Of the whiche sayth holy scrypture that euery man ought to haue grete herte desyre of his good renowne name.
For who so leseth good renowne leseth the loue of those the whiche hym loueth the whiche is incomparable.
Also by the occasyon to do many good dedes so it is by suche caas many tyme of shame by the whiche he dysposed hym to all ylle.
And vnto that it is trewely sayd that he hath more gretter payne for to be helyd of the wounde of the tonge than of the stroke of sworde.
And this suffysed as now of the synne of enuye.
Ire is a synne dysordynate to auenge hymselfe vpon ony persone by ony waye and maner ayenst reason and the ordynaunce of Justyce.
And it is ayenst the loue and charyte that a man ought for to haue vnto his neyghbour and by the consequens it is mortall synne of the whiche proceden many braunches after as saynt Gregory sayth.
That is to vnderstande indygnacyon ymagynacyon of hym to be auenged clamour in wordes blasfemynge ayenst god his sayntes debates oppressyons.
For Ire may be shewed only in courage in wyll wtout shewynge it outwarde.
And these be the two fyrste brau~ches yt is indignaco~n ymaginaco~n to auenge hy~.
Where suche Ire is not all oonly in ye wyll but wt that it is shewed in wordes in this ben vn+derstande the other two brau~ches that is clamour and blasphemynge of god of his sayntes.
man may also ouer these cursyd courages these wycked wordes procede vnto the dede as to bete to stryke or to mysentreate in speche other dyuerse maners in that ben comprysed these two other membres that is debat{is} improperacions.
And in all these brau~ches there may be dedely synne after the affectyon delyberacyon other circu~staunces.
Oftentymes also it is but venyall synne vnto the whiche dyfference he ought to take hede of the con+scyence of the persone by the meane aduysement of a sage confessour.
Of this synne of yre procedeth somtyme derysyons susurraco~ns detracco~ns also to curse the whiche thynges may be mortall synne or venyall synne after the rote intencyon wherof they proceden.
And for to kepe hym yt this passyon of yre procede not vnto mortall synne he ought to warne the persone in two maners after saynt Gregory.
Fyrst in consyderynge ye Iniuryes as well of wyll as of worde done vnto god vnto sayntes the whiche thynges they haue suffred in grete pacyence.
For they knowe well that he were impossyble to be saued ye whiche hath not pacyently endured.
The seconde remedy is that god his sayntes enduren more of vs without takynge ven+geau~ce of our synnes the whiche we can neuer do of our neyghbour for ony Iniurye that we knowe to be done.
Here vnto vs is some thynge co~maunded that other defended.
The thynge the whiche vnto vs is co~mau~ded is charytable prudence by the whiche we haue purchased sobrenes and attemperau~ce.
By the ver+tue of prudence we purposen the delytts spyrytual vnto the temporelles and carualles.
By this vertue of attemperaunce the creature reasonable kepeth hym from to moche drynke and from to moche meete and also from all dysordynaunce sensuall touchynge the synne of lecherye.
The thynge defended ben two synnes mortall that is glotony and lechery.
Fyrste in etynge at an houre not dewe without appetyte before that the meetes taken ben dygested wherof cometh many syknesses the whiche greuen the body and the soule.
Secondely by to moche grete desyre for to haue bought precyous meetes the whiche some tyme perteyneth not vnto the estate of the persone.
For for to make dyspence in meetes the whiche appertaynen not vnto the persone is a greuous synne.
Thyrdely for to ete to haboundauntly by the whiche nature is greued the whiche is consent with a lytell and complayneth hym of to moche.
Fourthly not kepyynge honest maner as for to ete to hastely the whiche thynge is called deuourynge.
And fyfthtly in the maner of the preparacyon of meetes with to moche grete herte of saltes of spyceryes of decoccyons and of confectures.
Of that synne comen many cursyd bowes or braunches after saynt Gregory.
That is to knowe gladnes dysordynat wordes carnall vnhoneste exces of dyuers langages vnclennes of body blyndynge of the entendement.
In all these braunches may he haue so grete exces yt he shall falle in dedely synne.
Dronkennes may come in thre maners without synne with venyall and without mortall.
Some persone knoweth not the vertue of the wyne and hath grete thorste and drynked after his thorste it may be that he shall be dronke.
put caas that the persone knoweth the strength of of the wyne how be it he weneth not yt it hym sholde surmou~te for that he hath not ben acustomed and it may be venyall synne all oonly Thyrdely it may happen that some knowen the myght of the wyne by experyence of ye inco~uenyent yt he is acustomed to be dronken but he loued better to obeye vnto his apetyte dysordynatly than to kepe hym from the inconuenyences and than he synned mortally.
For vnto his wyttynge he it proued of vsage of reason greued his body his soule hym dysposed to all ylle in lyke wyse as a true sobre abstynet dysposed hym vnto the grace of god vnto the clerenes of ye intendement.
THe synne of lechery hath seuen maners That is for to knowe symple fornycacyon auoutry sacrylege defloracion vyo+lacyon and the synne of sodomyte or ayen nature Symple fornycacyon is bytwene two persones the whiche be not the one ne ye other wtin ye sacrame~t of maryage nor in ye estate of virgynyte of lygnage of gossyprede in holy ordres nor in the vowe of cha+styte.
Auoutry is whan the one or the other or both tweyne ben maryed with the other partye.
In this whan the one or the other ben of lynage or of ony affynyte or gossyprede.
Sacrylege whan the one or the other ben in holy ordres or haue made auowe solemply of chastyte.
Defloracyon whan the one or the other or both tweyne be virgyns.
Vyolacyon in rauysshynge whan by force vyolence be she wydowe virgyne or maryed is knowen carnally.
The synne ayenst nature sodomyte is co~mytted in many maners.
For the persone reasonable ought to knowe that god nature defended al maner of touchynges lecherously in the whiche a man kepeth not the ordenau~ce the maner the partyes or membres the whiche ben requyred by reason for to receyue lygne so moche the wors it is whan a man is dysordynate be it in maryage or other wyse in touchynge hymself or another or beest by vylony foule pleasure carnall.
Who so is culpable of suche synnes may well ynough vnderstande his caas by this maner of speche.
For other wyse as in generall this horryble synne ought not to be wryten nor openly preched.
But the dyscrete confessour may well from the lytell vnto the more grete after the qualyte circu~staunces of the synner come vnto the knowloge of the caas after to shewe vnto the synner the horryblenes of ye synne the whiche is so grete that he ought to be punysshed after the lawes for to brenne in the fyre for as moche as this synne cryed afore god vengeau~ce for of that cometh hongres warres mortalytees pestylences perdycyons of reames as wytnesseth these holy scryptures.
By this synne pryncypally was the dyluuye in the tyme of Noe all the worl+de deyed except.
Also for these same synnes felle in to depnes Sodome and Gomorre thre other Cytees.
And now of late ben as many of ylles comen and cometh shall come that no man them may wryte or nombre.
It happened also as wytnesseth saynt Gregorye that the lecherous persone leseth the clerenes lyght of vnderstandynge so he is without constaunce without consyderacyon takynge without true hope of the delytes of paradyse and in one affeccyon loue dysordynate of this present worlde of hymself for alwayes he wolde lyue in the stenche of his syn+ne.
By the whiche it happeneth often that suche le+cherous people dyspayre them whan the houre cometh of theyr departynge so they goo vnto the deth eternall.
And this is as vnto the synne of lecherye for this the .vi. co~mau~dement.
In this co~maunde+ment vnto vs is some thynge co~maunded and the other defended.
The thynge co~maunded is charytable prudence in the lyght of charyte by the whiche we haue consyderacyon of the greate dyfference the whiche is bytwene the goodes erthely and the goodes of glorye.
By this dyfferece and knowlege we dysprayse and repute as nought all felycyte worldely in comparyson of the very blessydnes.
And in lyke wyse by this consyderacyon we ben enclyned induced to do Justyce the whiche is none other thynge as now but for to yelde vnto euery man that that vnto hym apperteyneth as it hath ben sayd before shall be more playnly in spekynge of restytucyon.
The thynge the whiche is defended by the co~mau~dement is the synne of couetyse.
Couetyse is an appetyte dysordynate of goodes transytorye temporall what soo euer they be.
This synne is co~mytted generally in thre maners yt is to knowe in gettynge to moche brennyngly in retaynynge to streytely in dyspendyn+ge to scarsely.
And for as moche sayth saynt Poule that the coueytous man is an ydolater a seruytour of the deuyll.
Wherfore it is to be noted that a deuyll named Ma~mona made vnto the coueytous man. vi. co~mau~dementes.
The fyrst is that he ke+pe well his golde his syluer or other goodes.
The seconde is that he lese not in his handes.
The thyrde is that he encrease them from daye to daye The fourth is that he gyue no thynge in almesse nor other wyse.
The fyfth is that he lene not nor doo noo pleasure for in soo doynge he putteth his goodes in peryll.
The sixte is that he shall restray+ne hymself his housholde from meete drynke for to spare his goodes.
Of this synne cometh procedeth seuen doughters or braunches after as sayth saynt Gregorye.
That is for to vnderstande treason fraude begylynge periurynges rauay+ne desyrous for to gete hardynes of body ayenst the poore and many other euylles.
Here is defended all euyll marchaundyse euyll laborynges and werkes to fayne hym in his Journey and to selle fals ware for good.
put caas that the seller hath ben dysceyued in byenge them for good for one dysceyued ought not an other for to dysceyue.
Here is defended theeft vsery rauayne symony sacrylege fals spekynge fals swerynge and generally all decepcyons openly or pryuely by the whiche a man maketh the losse of an other his owne or els that a man wolde not reasonably vnto hym to be done.
Also all contractes and other thynges in the whiche it behoueth¬∑ For to make restytucyon of the whiche shall be treated in partyculer in the fourth partye.
And this is in generall and in short as vn+to the .vij. co~maundement.
In this co~maundement vnto vs is some thynge com+maunded and the other defended.
The thynge whiche is co~maunded is the contrarye and the opposyte of that the whiche is defended.
To bere fal+se and cursyd langage is contrarye vnto charyte the whiche we sholde haue ayenst our neyghbours By the whiche it appyreth that it vnto vs is commaunded to saye well to magnyfye and to exalte the good and the honour of our neyghbours and in praysynge god charytably in place and in tyme the whiche thynge we accomplysshe by the vertue of prudence of force illumyned with charyte for so doynge desyrynge the good honour of our neyghbour to be our honour in lyke wyse as requyreth the vertue nature of charyte the whiche is to loue his neyhbour as hymself the whiche maketh all goodes to be comyn.
Than by good prudence we shall exalte augment our welth our neyghboures.
And by that vertue of force we hym sholde purchase good and honour in berynge hym good wytnes in place in tyme in defendynge hym to our power his good renowne.
And this is in short as vnto ye thynge co~mau~ded.
That is to saye cursyd langage procedynge of Ire of enuye in lyke wyse as Ire enuye ben defended in the .vi. co~mau~dement pryncypally in as moche as the shewe them by werke in lyke wyse they ben defended in the .viij. in as moche as they it shewen by cursyd langage.
For as a man may noye his his neyghbour in dede in lykewyse a man may noye hym in worde.
And they that may not of dede oftentymes they do it by cursyd langage ye whiche is co~mytte in dyuers maners.
For as sayen these doctours the holy scryptures in the operacyon of the tonge is the deth or the lyf.
And therfore wolde the blessyd holy goost hym shewe appyre in the lykenes of tonges of fyre for to gyue vnderstandynge that yf the tonge be not purged and gouerned of the holy goost it is an harde thynge but that it be gouerned of a cursyd spyryte.
That is the deuyll the whiche by the meane of the tonge serpentynously putteth all humayne lynage vnto perdycyon and the whiche gouerneth and ledeth theym that ben replete with Ire and enuye and them aydeth with theyr tonges as with glaynes cuttynge.
And therfore sayth the Psalmyste that the tonges of synners is the glayne of the deuyll sharpe and full of venym.
And after these doctours .xij. synnes proceden of the tonge the whiche may be mortall or venyall after the dyuers circumstaunces and intencyon of the synner as ben blasphemynge periurynges lesynges boostynges murmuracyons detraccyons wordes carnall and vnhoneste folysshe langages talkynges Jangelynges and many other euylles the whiche ben shewed as wytnesseth the conscyence of suche people to be horryble and detestable.
For as our lorde sayth by the wordes of a persone a man may some what haue knowlege and Juge of the wyll and of the conscyence.
Of de+traccyon of dyuers maners for to lye and of fals wytnes in Jugement shall be spoken in the fourth partye.
And this is in generall and in short as vn+to the .viij. co~maundement.
THou shalt not desyre an other mans wyf And in lyke wyse the wyf sholde not desyre the man that is to knowe by cursyd concupyscence.
But well may the one the other desyre with out synne by good and Juste affeccyon of maryage.
In this present commaundement vnto vs is some thynge commaunded and the other defended.
The thynge commaunded is the vertue of chastyte and clennes of spyryte and of wyll in the vertue of holy charyte that is to knowe for the lo+ue of god and of the saluacyon of our soules the whiche vertue of charyte we sholde haue and procure as well in vs as in our neyghbours.
And vnto that we may come by the vertue of prudence and of force after the maner of forme declared in the .vi. commaundement.
The thynge defended in the sixte is all concupyscence by consent dysposed out of maryage. and put caas yf that suche cursyd ylle wyll is not shewed outwarde in effecte neuerthelesse notwithstandynge yf it soo be it is deedly synne.
For as our lorde sayth in the gospell who so euer hath concupyscence carnall of the wo+man or the woman with the man with consente dysposed offended the commaundement of god.
By the whiche it foloweth that all vnhoneste kyssynges touchynges lokynges wordes lettres gyf+tes promysses abylymentes countenaunces and many other ylle cursyd dedes pryncypally for the entente for to drawe ony persone vnto the consent of concupyscence of the synne of lechery it is dedely synne for the wyll all oonly is deedly synne as it is sayd.
And therfore the wyll the whiche is shewed by ony of these tokens before sayd it is more greuous than yf he abyde stedfast inwarde of the wyll.
And this is in short as vnto the .ix. co~+maundement.
THou shalt not desyre an other ma~nes goodes vnto his hurte ayenst the ordynau~ce of Justyce of reason.
In this present co~maundement vnto vs is some thynge co~maunded the other defended.
The thynge co~mau~ded is the vertue of lyberalyte ayenst our neyghbours.
The whiche vertue is excercysed by the vertue of true prudence of Justyce enformed with charyte as it is sayd in the .vij. co~mau~dement.
In this present co~mau~dement may be vnderstande the seuen werkes of mercy.
To desyre than to gyue of his goodes by loue by charyte vnto vs is here co~maunded.
And yf a man may not do it in werke the good desyre of the wyll suffysed before god for to be gretely rewarded as the desyre for to do ylle is worthy to be dampned.
The thynge defended is concupyscence couetousnes of thynges temporell or the dammage and preiudyce of an other.
For in lyke wyse as in the fourth in the fyfth in the sixte and in the seuenth commaundementes vnto vs is defended for to do ylle dysplesure or vylony vnto our neygh+bour by ony maner of operacyon.
And in the .viij. vnto vs is defended the offence of wordes.
In lyke wyse in the .ix. and also in the .x. vnto vs is defended the cursyd wyll for to do vnto hym hurte vylony by concupyscence carnall or other wyse In the whiche it appyreth clerely that who so euer hym wyll gouerne by the rule of the .x. commaun+dementes shall be well and Justely ordeyned as well ayenst god as ayenst his neyghbour be it in dede in worde or in wyll.
Also it appyreth that in euery commaundement be it affyrmatyf or elles negatyf there is some thynge commaunded and the other defended.
For god neuer co~maunded for to do ony thynge but that he forbade the contrary nor not defended ony thynge but that he co~maunded his contrarye.
Here foloweth the epylogacyon or short repetycyon of this seconde partye.
FOr to vnderstande the better retayne these thynges beforesayd they ben recapyteled enployed in suche maner.
In the fyrst co~mau~dement of the lawe is co~mau~ded humble adoracyon of the dyuyne maieste ydolatrye defended all pryde ayenst the maieste dyuyne.
In the seconde confessyon of the trouth in worde and in dede is co~+maunded and all periurynges and cursyd othes defended.
In the thyrde loue vnto the dyuyne bou~+te vnto vs is commaunded and vndeuocyon and foulnes of spyryte vnto vs is forboden.
And by su+che wyse in accomplysshynge these thre commaun+dementes we be ordeyned ayenst all the blessyd trynyte.
For vnto the fader is attrybute dyuyne maieste and vnto the sone infynyte veryte and vnto the holy goost souerayne bounte.
And therfore to the entent that we haue dysposycyon to byleue to confesse to loue this blessyd trynyte the thre vertues theologyes that is fayth hope charyte they ben create of god in the soule the whiche worthely receyueth the holy sacrament of baptem.
Charyte for to loue god the fader fayth for to gyue knowlege and for to aduowe the trouth of god the sone and hope for to confesse hym in the bou~te of the holy goost.
In the fourth co~maundement honoure reuerence loue pyte vnto vs be co~mau~ded pryncypally ayen fader moder consequently ayenst euery creature humayne all rudenes cruelte vnfaythfulnes ayenst our neyghbours vnto vs is defended.
In the fyfth swetnes benygnyte ayenst our neyghbours vnto vs is co~mau~ded.
In the sixte chastyte clennes in dede in worde vnto vs is co~mau~ded and all lechery by ony maner what so euer it be vnto vs is defended.
In the .vij. lyberalyte in departynge resonably the goodes of this worlde necessarye vnto our neyghbour is co~mau~ded and all rauayne coueytousnes is enhabyte.
In the .viij. trouth in wordes be it in Jugement or otherwyse vnto vs is co~mau~ded and lyenge disceyuynge defamynge mockynge or abusynge vnto vs is defended.
In the .ix. chastyte in thought in desyre in poorenes of spyryte vnto vs is co~mau~ded all foule thoughtes carnall desyres vnto vs ben enterdyted defended.
In the .x. to delyre coueytously the goodes transytory vnto vs is defended and good desyre of power for to accomplysshe the werkes of mercy in place and in tyme that vnto vs shall be possyble and of rea+son vnto vs is co~maunded.
vij. the laste co~maundementes we ben perfectly Justely ordeyned ayenst our neyghbours in two maners that is in kepynge vs from offendynge them and in doynge vnto hym in place and in tyme pleasure and seruyce.
In these two poyntes that is for to knowe to flee the euyll and to do the good is comprehended all parfeccyon of Justyce as sayth holy scrypture.
Kepe the from doynge ylle vnto thy neyghbours and enforce the for to do vnto hym good and pleasure.
It suffysed nor for to seche saluacyon not to co~mytte ony ylle nor synne but it behoueth for to excercyse hym in good werkes in place and in tyme the whiche is of necessyte.
Than he that wyll be saued hym behoueth necessaryly for to kepe all these .x. commaundementes.
For god by his Justyce ordeyned may not dyspence nor doo other wyse.
For he hath assented that who so wyll come vnto saluacyon hym behoueth that he kepe and that he accomplysshe all these .x. commaundemen+tes.
He that trespasseth one of these commaundementes synned mortally and breketh all the lawe.
Of the whiche brekynge Jhesus soucrayne vertue vs wylleth for to kepe and the true entendement of his lawe and of his holy co~maundementes vs inspyre and them for to accomplysshe by true fayth hope and charyte vnto the whiche alwaye laketh it the fader and the sone and the holy goost vs ayde Amen.
¬∂After the declaracyon of the .x. co~maundementes of god here folowen the .v. co~maundementes of holy chirche.
¬∂On the sondayes thou shalt here masse and the festes of co~maundement.
¬∂Of all thy synnes thou shalt be confessyd at the leest one tyme of the yere.
¬∂These festes thou shalt halowe that ben gyuen the in co~maundement.
¬∂The foure embres vigyles thou shalt faste and the lente entyerly.
OVer the .x. co~maundementes of god before wryten our moder holy chirche hath put to fyue.
The whiche to obeye and to hepe all crysten people be bou~de after the forme maner that holy chirche entendeth to bynde her subgectes.
The fyrst is yt on the holy sondaye other grete festes solempnytees gyuen by co~mau~dement after dyuer syte of cou~tre of the dyoces euery man the whiche hath age dyscrecyon ought to here masse enterly yf he haue no lettynge nor excusaco~n reasona+ble by ye whiche of yt he may be excused.
The seconde co~mau~deme~t is yt he ought to be confessed at the lest one tyme of the yere vnto preest yt hath auctoryte to assoyle hym in lyke wyse as it apyred by ye statute ordynau~ce of holy chirche.
To confesse hy~ many tymes in ye yere as haue of good holy custome many good faythfull crysten men it is of cou~seyll not of co~mau~dement except some cases partyculers the whiche ben here after put declared in the treatyse of confessyon.
The thyrde co~mau~dement is that all persones the whiche hath wytte age dyscrecyon competent after the Juge+ment good cou~seyll of his curate or other confes+sour ought to receyue ye holy sacrament of the awter at the tyme of Eester trewely confessed repen+tau~t of all his synnes the whiche he hath co~mytte in his lyf and of the whiche he may haue remembrau~ce after the fragylyte of intencyon humayne.
The fourth co~mau~dement is to kepe the feestes yt be gyuen in co~mau~dement in halowynge theym.
And for to do it the better a man ought to cesse of all werkes of synne erthely and seruyle the whiche may lette the spyryte to retorne vnto god vnto hymself in tyme and place as holy chirche hath or deyned.
And it ought to be vnderstande yf necessyte hym enforce none other wyse.
In lyke wyse it hath ben declared before in the thyrde co~mau~+dement of the lawe.
The fyfth co~maundement of holy chirche is that euery persone the whiche hath passed the yeres of one and twenty ought for to faste foure tymes in the yere the Embrynge tyme. the vigyles co~maunded and the fourty dayes the whiche endeth at Eester yf he haue not excusacyon lawfully in lyke wyse as it apyreth more play+nely here after in the treatyse of confessyon.
Vnto these fyue co~maundementes vs byndeth holy chirche vnto the whiche we sholde obeye as vnto god For he hath sayd that they the whiche obeye vnto the prelates of holy chirche hym doth obeye and they that them dysobeye hym dysobeyeth.
By the the whiche it appyreth clerely ynough that they the whiche trespassen these co~maundementes before sayd synnen mortally yf cause resonable them excuse not in all or in parte.
¬∂Here foloweth of two maner of lyues the whiche ben in holy chirche.
That is to knowe of the lyf actyf and the lyf contemplatyf.
AS wel for these thynges spoken as for these thynges the whiche folowen is well for to be noted that holy chirche is comprysed in two estates.
That is to knowe in the lyf actyf and in the lyf contemplatyf the whiche vnto vs ben well sygnyfyed by two women the doughters of one fa+der of one moder that is Martha and Mary mawdelayne dwellynge in one house the whiche chose our blessyd sauyour Jhesu cryste for to lodge there and enhabyte.
The lyfe actyfe is the lyfe as of them that ben worldely the whiche vnto vs is sygnyfyed by Martha the whiche was desyrous to lodge our lorde and his apostles and to aparell them and to gyue them refeccyon in betokenynge that they of the lyfe actyfe ought for to excercyse them in the werkes of mercy corporall.
The lyfe contemplatyf is the lyf of holy relygyon and that vnto vs is sygnyfyed by Mary mawdelayne the syster of Martha the whiche was at the feet of our lorde herkenynge ryght swetely the ryght holy doctryne of our lorde the whiche is the brede and the refeccyon of the soule.
By the whiche it appyreth that the lyf contemplatyf excedeth in va+lour and in dygnyte the lyfe actyfe in as moche as the soule is more noble than the body and the werkes of mercy spyrytuall ben more noble than these werkes corporall.
For in lyke wyse as the excercyse and occupacyon of the actyfe is ayenst the body.
In lyke wyse the occupacyon of the lyf contemplatyfe is pryncypally ayenst these necessytees and for the prouffyte of the soule.
But not withstandymge that the lyfe contemplatyfe is more hygher and more noble she is not the lesse peryllous.
For as moche as the estate is more hygher the falle or the defaute that a man there in may do is the more greuous.
And therfore may a man saye that euen in lyke wyse as the ryche worldely man of the lyfe actyfe is in payne and in thought for to gette and to augmente goodes temporall¬∑ fyrst for the necessyte of hymself and of his and folowynge for to gyue and to departe vnto the pore in place and in tyme after good prudence and that is the commaundement of god vpon the pay+ne of deedly synne and by the consequent vpon the payne of dampnacyon.
In lyke wyse the persone relygyous and contemplatyfe consyderynge his pouerte and indygence spyrytuall and other necessytees without nombre as well in hymselfe as in his neyghbours enforced hym and laboured to socoure vnto the one and vnto the other and of as moche as these dyuersytees as well corporall as spyrytuall ben the more gretter of as moche groweth the payne and the thought in soule of the trewe relygyous man charytable and contemplatyfe.
Alas it is well vnderstande and consydered so many we see of the blynde of meselles the halte the lame croke backed foule and mysshapen the whiche well vnderstandeth by the sykenesse of the body and than that of the soule is moche mo+re greuous and also moche more for to be playned and redoubted than these sykenesses corporall in as moche as the soule is a more gretter thynge than the body.
And as now vnto the purpose who is more blynder than he the whiche gy+ueth or that leseth paradyse for to purchase helle Also who is more rotten or stynkynge and detesta+ble before god and before all the courte of heuen than ye myserable synner swollen by pryde rotten foule stynkynge by the synne of lecherye wronge crockyd myshappes by the synne of couetyse of of enuye so of other synnes in the whiche the soule is ordeyned as well ayenst god as ayenst his neyghbours and also as broken and put out from the lygne ordynau~ce of nature.
And for as moche he that loued his neyghbour as hymself hym seeth spyrytually in suche aduersyte of synne dampnable the whiche is the waye the danger of eternall dampnacyon may not haue in his spyryte gladnes nor reste.
But yt behoueth that of as moche as he loueth his neyghbours more or lesse that of as moche he is pyteous heuy and sorowfull of the grete ylle and excessyue foly of his fren+de.
By the whiche appyreth the labour and pyteous thoughtes of the true contemplatyf the whiche seeth and consydereth all moost all the worlde out of the waye and go vnto perdycyon.
It appyred more ouer that as well in the lyf actyf as in the lyf contemplatyf he hath grete and peryllous laboure vnto whome well and merytoryously he wyl do his deuour and that of good ryght for payne thought and labour is the meane for to come vnto the reame vnto the whiche these blessyd be come in doynge hymself vyolence and by harde grete and stronge trybulacyons.
And this vyolence dooth the ryght trewe contemplatyf in hymblynge hymself truely in repentynge hy~ all his wer+kes power and of no valoure.
For yf ony goodes there were founden he ought for to knowe verely that suche goodes cometh not of hymselfe but of the oonly bounte dyuyne the whiche is the fontayne of all perfeccyon and in suche wyse humblynge hym truely he feleth in hymself all mysery and imperfeccyon there is grete vyolence specyally in those worldely people the whiche begynne for to do well as it is for to make restytucyon vnto an other requyrynge pardonne for to humble hym in in to relygyon or in betakynge other trewe wayes of penaunce.
For it is a thynge naturall vnto a creature reasonable for to desyre honour glorye and gladnes pleasures and all other excellentes and perfeccyons as well of the partye of the body as of the soule¬∑ But suche is the condycyon of this valey of mysery the whiche by humylyte it behoueth to come vnto honour for to be vyle and dysprayse voluntaryly it behoueth to come vnto the glorye the whiche is without ende.
By contrycyon sorowe and pyte dysease compassyon and mortyfycacyon man hath purchased Joye gladnes and lyf eternall.
And so all other thynges that may be sayd or thought of the one the contrarye behoueth for to come vnto the other.
For it is impossyble after the ordynaunce dyuyne for to haue paradyse in this worlde and in the other in comyn+ge from Joyes gladnesses pleasures and delytes worldely vnto the Joye and vnto the reame of paradyse.
By the whiche a man may well vnderstan+de as for to lyue he muste deye for to haue Joye he muste wepe to haue all goodnes for euer hym behoueth for to renounce vnto hymself that is vn+to his sensualyte vnto his desyres worldely naturall and all other goodes wordely and temporall and for to take and enbrace hertely holy pouerte of spyryte aboue all the goodes worldely and temporall.
And by these thynges beforsayd may a man clerely vnderstande the errour foly of these worldely the whiche with all theyr power sechen the felycyte worldely for it is none other thynge to saye or to do but for to flee and renou~ce vnto the beatytude eternall.
Also may a man well vnderstande that this meruayllous mutacyon and werke of god whan the persone vayne and worldely hym conuerteth and retorneth for to take the waye of paradyse the whiche is penaunce and that in so doynge hath grete vyolence as it is sayd.
Also the persone contemplatyfe the whiche by the grace of god is trewely propred of all his desyres and plea+sures vayne and worldely ought soueraynly for to watche and for to kepe hym from the darte that the deuyll casteth subtylly and ryght vnpyteously in the houre of myddaye that is the synne of presumptuous thoughtes or vayne glorye that he bryn+geth vnto the creature by the reason holy estate of graces spirituell and good werkes the whiche of that maken a maner of lyght spyrytuall and therfore they ben lykened vnto the houre of the myddaye but oftentymes they ben the occasyon of pryde and of ruyne who is not ryght strongely armed with humylyte and the whiche hath not before hym the bockeler of the of god.
And vn+to that purpose sayth the honourable Beda that for the grete gyftes graces and reuelacyons that god hath made vnto saynt Poule.
He was fallen in pryde and in vayne glorye notwithstandynge his grete and synguler scyence yf god hath not letted the deuyll for to tempte hym moche horrybly and that yf that temptacyon had not be by the whiche he was in fere and in he had ben fynably dampned.
And therfore sayth well Isydore that the persone the whiche chaunged the estate and lyfe from ylle vnto good or from good vnto better he ought soueraynly to take hede that the vayne glorye of his estate of hie graces and of his vertues make hym not falle more lower and more greuously than he was by his grete vyces synnes.
Also he sayth more ouer that for noblenes of estate for for force or other goodes of nature or of grace noo man ought for to truste in hymself or to gloryfye.
For Lucyfer surmounted all erthely creatures in all gyftes and perfeccyons of nature and neuertheles by his pryde and folysshe thynkynge is torned and fallen in to eternall dampnacyon.
Also Adam fauted moche greuously Salomon with his grete scyence.
Dauyd with his holynes Peter with his hardenes and with his stedfastnes many Heremytes and Relygyous of grete excellent perfeccyon ben fynably fallen and all comenly by folysshe thoughtes presump+cyon of theyr estate.
And therfore sayth saynt Austyn that more it pleased vnto god the persone the whiche of synnes maketh humble confessyon than of hym the whiche of his graces vertues hym gy+ueth vnto pryde presumpcyon.
And this vnto vs is declared in the gospell by the example of the pub+lycane the whiche was a man mylcheuous and worldely and of the pharysee of grete relygyon of the whiche the synner publycane humbled hymself before god in sayenge and cryenge that he was not worthy for to lyfte vp the face ayenst the and the pharysee hym gloryfyed in bryngynge in to his mynde how oftentymes he fasted he payed the demes he gaue almesse and many other good dedes by the whiche he Juged in hymself that he was moche better than these other and that he resembled not vnto these synners worldely.
And by suche pryde and boostynge he was by the sentence of Jhesu cryste reproued and condampned and the poore publycane by his contrycyon and hu+mylyte approued and Justyfyed.
Here folowen thre reasons by the whiche we may be enduced to fere and to mekenes.
HOr to holde hym in fere and mekenes with+out praysynge hymself or grauntynge vnto ony vayne glorye for the estate of perfeccyon or ony other vertues or merytes.
Here folowen thre reasons taken and drawen out of the booke of lyf of Jhesu cryste by the whiche well comprysed and vnderstande the spyryte deuoute and contemplatyfe may take grete meruayllous strength ayenst his enemye the deuyll his and feruour to prouffyte from good vnto better.
The fyrst rea+son is that yf we consyder our lytell power the hyghnes infynyte of the dyuyne maieste his wysdome his bounte his honour and his puyssaunce and these other perfeccyons infynyte the whiche ben in god by the whiche he is worthy to be honoured serued fered and loued.
We knowe clerely that all that that we may do saye or thynke in regarde of these thynges abouesayd is lesse nought as is of our parte.
And therfore to pryde hym for suche or ony good werkes it is a grete folye and after some thynges more and vnto god more dyspleasure than the pryde of Lucyfer.
The reason of good ryght is the fyrste for as moche as all our werkes ought to be done pryncypally for the honour and glorye of god.
The seconde reason is that yf we consyder the mekenes of our lorde Jhesu cryst the and reproues and the paynes labours and fynally the deth of his precyous blood and how he hath all swetly borne endured more than ony vnderstandynge creature may speke or thynke and how all that he hath pryncypally endured to the entente that he may haue the lawe of our for the whiche loue vnto vs yet he wyll gyue by his ryght abondau~t grace hymselfe his glorye and his reame.
We see clerely that all our good werkes in comparyson of soo ryght grete paynfull passyon and of the grete goodes of glory whe+re in we truste ben lesse than nought.
This reason of good ryght vnto the seconde for as moche that she more hyer incompreuable mater as these whiche folowen as is the passyon of Jhesu cryste and of the glorye of paradyse.
The thyr reason is that yf we consyder the innocence and the perfeccyon that we haue promysed and vowed vnto holy baptem the whiche we sholde holde and kepe before god as is his co~maundement to loue hym with all our herte with all our thought and with all our myght and vertues.
And also that for to please our blessyd creatour we sholde be annorned with all vertues as is fayth hope charyte humylyte pacyence obedyence chastyte and so of all other maner of vertues We fynde in a dystaunce also as infynyte and in the depe dyche of vnkyndenes and of all imperfeccyn.
The fourth reason is that yf we consyder the grete graces and grete benefyces that god vnto vs hath done and doth contynually as well in generall as in partyculer as well vnto the regarde of the body as of the soule.
We see derely that we ben acountable ayenst hym without our power hym to acquyte of as moche as he is a more gretter thynge and a more vaylable than we for whome he it is all gyueth the whiche thynge is infynyte.
For he vnto vs hath gyuen his ymage and his semblaunce in our creacyon.
God the fader vs gyueth his oonly and his ryght dere sone na+turall for our redempcyon.
The whiche sone vs gyueth his ryght holy flesshe his swete herte and his ryght precyous blood for a ryght dygne and spyrytuall refeccyon.
The blessyd holy goost also vnto vs gyueth his gyftes and his graces and by spyrytuall infusyon.
All the blessyd trynyte it promytteth for to gyue vnto vs eternall beatyfycacyon.
And in recompense of suche thynges all our dede is as no thynge in the whiche it appyreth wel the folysshe presumpcyon of many peple the whiche wenen for to preuayle in grete thynges before god.
The fyfth reason is that yf we consyder more ouer and in partyculer the honour the Joye the noblenes and the ryches of paradyse the whiche is without ende and without measure as it is to see the blessyd trynyte thre persones in one essence of dyuynyte.
To see in lyke wyse with our eyes corporell the ryght holy humanyte of our sauyour Jhesus the whiche shall gyue vnto all his faythfull and gloryous chosen pleasaunte lokes enbrasynges and swete kyssynges.
To see also the swete virgyn Mary moder quene of all chosen.
To see also the gerarchyes heuenly and ordres of angel+les.
To see and vnderstande the vnyon of all the court celestyall.
And how by charyte he is taken the parfyte goodnes and glorye of that one is the welth and the loue of that other for euery man that loued his neyghbour as hymself hym enioyed of the glorye of his neyghbours as of his owne By this consyderacyon it appyreth clerely that that ony humayne creature may do for to come vn+to suche a College and vnto suche honour is lesse than nought.
The sixte reason is that we consyder profundely the grete dyfferent of a soule the whiche is in the estate of grace vnto yt the whiche is in deedly synne.
We see that that one is the doughter of god by grace and by adopcyon enherytour of paradyse and the espouse of Jhesu cryste the temple of the holy goost sanctuary and the habytacle of all the blessyd trynyte ryght fayre and ryght pleasaunte enorned and enryched with noble vertues more bryghter and more shynynge spyrytually than euer may do the sonne corporally But all the contrarye is it of the soule in mortall sy~ne for she is ye doughter seruytour by i~uocaco~n of our goodly enemye the vessell the stynkynge de+lytes vanytees worldely the temple of ydolatres deuyllesshe the fals and vnfaythfull rybande the whiche hath broken the fayth the maryage bytwene her the kynge of kynges Jhesus the sone of god the fader for to submytte her vnto the stynkynge lechery of ye mesell of deuyll angell apostat By the whiche she is vyle horryble stynkynge mo+re than ony carayne as well before god as before all the sayntes of paradyse.
By the whiche it appy+reth that we sholde moche enforce vs to seche ye one estate to flee the other in as moche as they ben of dyfference.
And in so doynge yf god gyue vs not ye grace there is none the whiche worldely hym may thanke.
The seuenth reason for to see and knowe our feblenes and lyfell valure is in the consyderacyon of the lyf and of the vertues of holy faders apostelles martyres confessours virgyns.
Who where not of yron or of stele no more than we be who haue resyste vnto the temptacyons of the deuyll matted and vaynquysshed theyr bodyes by meruayllous penaunce and abstynence dyspraysed the worlde suffred martyrdoms terryble all oonly to thynke haue purchased merytes the fere and loue of god holdynge and kepynge the waye of all holynes some in aege of theyr tendre youth as these blessyd virgyns sayntes and martyrs.
Barbare and other without nombre in dyuers ages estates and voca+cyons.
And we the whiche haue theyr lyues by doctryne example ye lyght of myracles yt god hath done for to approue ye holynes of theyr lyues.
And that the whiche is more we haue theyr aydes intercessyons how be it vnto vs they speke not.
And notwithstandynge all these thyng{is} we ben laches. frowarde brought lyghtly to falle torne to impacyence in to murmuracyon in to vnhope in to dyspayre.
By the whiche appyreth well our lytell fraylte lytell valour in all these estates ye whi+che at this daye ben vpon the erthe.
That is the ye+re a thousande fyue hondred after the Incarnacyon the yeres six thousande six hondred thre score six that the worlde began after the conuocacy+on of the Hebrewes maner of nombre.
The. viij reason is yt yf euery lynner sholde consyder the gre+uousnes ye grete nombre vnkyndenes of his synnes ye rygour of the Justyce dyuyne he sholde kno+we clerely yt all the penaunce all the seruyce ye he may do vnto god tyll vnto ye ende of the worlde in byenge ayen ye payne due vnto his synnes it sholde be a thynge of lytell valour in comparyson of ye dette in ye whiche we be bou~de for our sy~nes.
The ix. reason is yt yf we consyder perfyte ye dyuers ma+ners occasyons the whiche in an hondred thousande maners comen proceden by successyon of tyme as well of ye partye of the worlde as of ye excu+se of the deuyll of ye fraylnes of our power my+serable condicyon we sholde defye aboue all of our strength our metes vertues in retornynge vs aboue all vnto god by ye true hope yt euery true crysten man ought to haue in god his creatour fontayne depnes of mercy of all swetnes.
The .x. reason is that yf we consyder the Jugement of god ryght Juste the whiche is done at the houre of deth and how hym behoueth to yelde acou~pte of all the goodes yt we haue receyued ben they goodes of nature of fortune or of grace tyll vnto the laste fardynge of all the tyme of our lyf tyll vnto the clo+synge of the eye.
In lyke wyse also the purenes of conscyence the ornament of merytes of vertues that we shall haue before god the satysfaccyon of synnes yt other tymes we haue co~mytte we shall see clerely yt our goodnes is a lytell thynge as vnto yt yt we myght haue done in comparyson of thyng{is} beforsayd ryght grete is our iperfeccyon.
The .xi. reason for to holde vs in fere in mekenes is that yf we consydre the shortnes of this lyf the necessy+te to deye the incertayne of ye houre of a moment of the estate we see clerely yt to lytell is the prepa+racyon the fere the dysposycyon the whiche shol de be in vs for to receyue suche auenture.
The .xij. reason is that yf we consydre the sayenge of saynt Gregory that is to vnderstande yt those the which wyll come vnto saluaco~n sholde alwayes go from good vnto better mou~te from vertue vnto vertue or elles they go behynde by slouth neclygence we see clerely that ryght lytell is the profyte ryght grete peryllous our slouth neclygence.
The .xiij reason is that yf we consydre perfytly the grete horryble paynes of helle as vnto the oppresseth as vnto the dyuersyte vnto the multytude as well ayenst the body as ayenst the soule and the eternyte of them the whiche euery synner deserued in commyttynge mortall synne we knowe that all the pe+naunce that we haue done in tyme paste and that we may doo tyll vnto the ende of the worlde it is a ryght lytell thynge and also as no thynge yf we+re not the meryte of the blessyd passyon in comparyson of our synnes.
Also we sholde enforce vs of body of soule to holde suche lyf by the whiche we may escape ye paynes beforsayd ye whiche ben more greter than man may tell or thynke so as wytnesseth saynt Austyn.
These .xiij. reasons ben noted drawen out of ye boke of ye lyf of Jhesu cryst in grete shortnes.
For ye spyryte deuoute contemplatyf vnto this proprete as we fewe wordes dyuyned he can rede vnderstande grete meruayllous senten+ces.
And this is done by the ayde vertue of ye holy goost the whiche lyfteth ye soule vpwarde from the puyssau~ces naturelles hym maketh to taste and to sauour the worde of god what so euer it be.
For it is the meete spyrytuell the whi+che gyueth nourysshynge force augmentacyon and puyssau~ce vnto euery persone the whiche hath in hym the helte of grace.
Also it is to be noted that the resolucyon ende and conclusyon of euery one of these .xiij. reasons aboue sayd is in two poyntes.
The fyrst is to the ende that the persone the whiche this present aduysement well reded de+noutly studyed may in trewe humylyte haue clere knowlege of the lytelnes and imperfeccyon of all his werkes what so euer they be by the whiche kno+wlege he hym shall defende from all vayne glory and shall see the grete foly and derkenes of ypocresye vayne glorye and folysshe thoughtes.
The seconde poynt is yt the persone the whiche wyll here founde his medytacyon may ought to take feruour desyre to profyte in graces.
in viues in clymmynge from steyre to steyre without euer hym to contempte tyll vnto that that she may come vnto the vysyon of god in the royalme of para+dyse.
The whiche by his blessyd grace vnto vs wyl gyue the fader and the sone and the holy goost one god in trynyte of persones.
¬∂Here foloweth the thyrde partye of this booke in the whiche is made mencyon of the seuen werkes of mercy and it conteyneth fyue chapytres.
AFter the treatyse of haptem of the artycles of the fayth of the co~maundementes of the lawe with the seuen deedly synnes here foloweth the .vij. werkes of mercy suche is the reason of this ordre.
For after saynt Gregory as moche as the persone hath of fayth of hope as moche and no more hath of charyte and as moche as he hath of charyte he hath of the werkes of mercy.
That is to knowe yf he haue lytell of charyte he hath lytell of good werkes.
By the werkes than shal be knowen the fayth the hope and the charyte.
For as it is sayd before the fayth is deed the whiche bereth not the werkes of mercy.
By the whiche it is for to knowe that mercy is a noble vertue by the whiche a man hath compassyon and pyte of his neyghbour and of his mysery and necessyte.
For whan it is so that by the commaundement of god euery creature ought for to loue his neyghbour as hymself it foloweth that the ylle of an other ought for to be the pyte and compassyon of a true crysten man obedyent vnto the co~maundementes of god of nature.
And for as moche as man is of two na+tures that is to knowe corporall and spyrytuall in euery of these two partyes he there may haue pouerte sykenes or other necessyte.
There are two maners of mercyes that is for to knowe corporell and spyrytuell.
THe werkes of mercy corporall ben comprysed vnderstande in these verses here.
Of corporell shall be spoken fyrst of the spyrytuell con+sequently in procedynge fron the lest vnto gretest to do accomplysshe the werkes of mercy corporel ayenst his neyghbour a thynge of grete profyte a thynge due a thynge necessary vnto saluacyon.
Fyrst it is a thynge of grete profyte for as wytnes+seth the holy scrypture in lyke wyse as the water quenched the fyre in lyky wyse almesdede mercy putteth awaye the synnes nor it may not be done that the soule the whiche truely hath done mercy in this worlde gooth vnto payne torment in the other.
For god of mercy infynyte loued as well eue+ry poore humayne the whiche hath pacyence in his pouerte mysery or necessyte where that the whiche vnto hym is done of goodes and of pleasure for the loue of hym and of charyte it is reputed for to be done vnto hymselfe.
And god god the whiche defended the synne of vnkyndenes the whiche is not to knowe the goodnes and pleasure yt man hath receyued of an other wyll grau~t the good the whiche hath ben done for the loue of hym after as it apperteyned vnto his dyuyne maieste.
And for that he promyseth mercy and the realme of paradyse vnto all them the whiche accom+plysshe the werkes of mercy and dampnacyon eternall the whiche in place and in tyme due them do not accomplysshe.
By the whiche it appyreth that to excercyse hym in the werkes of mercy is a thynge of grete and inestymable prouffyte and for to do the contrary it is the perdycyon of all goodnes.
Also it is a thynge oblygatorye for all that that man may haue in this worlde be it the body the soule or the goodes worldely he holdeth all of god ben they temporell or spyrytuell.
Who co~maundeth vpon the payne of deth that a man do mercy vnto his neyghbour for elles a man shall not fynde the mercy of god without the whiche no creature may haue saluacyon.
And here appyreth the excellent mercy and bounte infynyte of god ayenst nature humayne vnto whome he gyueth the goodes worldely and temporall by the whiche she may purchase the goodes of glorye the whiche ben eternall.
But here may be demaunded of hym the whiche hath desyre hym for to saue by what commaundement and by what lawe he is bounde for to do mercy and in what maner he ought for to seche it.
By the whiche it is for to vnderstande that for to do mercy it is commaunded in the lawe of nature in the lawe dyuyne and in the lawe Canon.
The lawe of nature commaunded for to loue his neyghbour for naturally euery thynge loueth his semblable.
Now it is so that yf true loue be in the herte she is sheweth by werkes outwarde yf it be possyble for elles there is no loue.
Also the lawe dyuyne co~maunded for to loue his neygh+bour as hymselfe and in that doynge promytteth god the lyf of glorye and vnto them that do it not the deth eternall.
The seuen werkes of mercy ben vnderstande to be co~maunded in the fourth commaundement the whiche is for to honour fader moder.
Also the lawe Canon co~maunded to do socour vnto thy neyghbour in necessyte who so euer loued god loued that that loueth hym and therfore sayth a man comenly he that loued me loued my hounde.
Now is it so that god loued euery erthely persone as it appyreth by the gospell the same of his traytour Judas.
Or elles he vnto hym he sholde not gyue lyfe beynge nor no substaunce and he sholde not tarye for to penaunce.
By the whiche it behoueth for to conclude that who so lo+ueth not his neyghbour loueth not god in lyke wyse as he commaundeth hym.
But reste for to see whan and in what maner a man ought to accomplysshe the commaundement to do mercy vpon payne of deedly synne.
By the whiche it is to be noted that whan ony persone hath of the goodes of this worlde after the necessyte of his estate and of his condycyon and more ouer hath habon+daunce of goodes of the whiche he it may well spa+re and his neyghbour it requyre in his grete necessyte that he hym ayde by lone or other wyse of his habondaunce the whiche he entendeth nor for to leue as well or better in other werkes of charyte than yf that he by his coueytousnesse defaute of charyte he it refuseth vnto his neyghbours he syn+neth there in mortally.
In the whiche it appyreth clerely that the synne and the peryll of dampnacyon of them the whiche haue habondau~ce of worl+dely goodes and they see from daye to daye grete multytude of poore people in trybulacyon necessyte without yeldynge and payenge them that that they vnto them sholde by the ryght of nature and the commaundement of god that is for to do vnto them almesse and charyte.
And therfore sayth Jhesu cryste in the gospell that they that haue ha+bondaunce of worldely goodes with grete payne shall haue the realme of paradyse.
By the whiche Thobye replete with the holy goost requyred of god that he wolde not gyue hym in this worlde grete habondau~ce of rychesses but all oonly vnto the necessyte of this lyf.
The whiche thynge is mo+che contrarye vnto the couetyse of these worldely people the whiche haue neuer suffycent for ony ha+bondaunce but alwayes desyren to haue more not all oonly for to gyue habondauntly but for ye appetyte insacyable to fede.
Reste than to see of euery werke of mercy in partyculer.
THe fyrste werke of mercy that is to gyue meete vnto hym the whiche is in necessyte for without mete no man may lyue nor longe endu+re.
The seconde is to gyue drynke. for without dryn+ke no man may dygeste nor conserue the helth of the body humayne and it ought for to be vnderstande of them the whiche ben in pouerte in sykenes in age or other necessyte wherfor they may not gette theyr lyuynge and they haue none other the whiche vnto them mynystreth.
Or of those the whiche haue auouwed pouerte euangelyke and not of other the whiche may well gete theyr lyuynge but by theyr slouth and trewandyse they wolde lyue of almesse without labour.
The thyrde is for to and to couer the poore humayne bodyes of his neyghbours.
The fourth is for to gadre in to his hous these poore pylgrymes and them the whiche haue not where for to harborowe them.
The fyfth is by pyte and compassyon for to vysyte the syke people in doynge vnto them ayde consolacyon.
The sixt is to ayde the poore pry+soners to delyuer them put them at lyberte.
The seuenth is to burye them that ben deed in dede or in wyll yf other is accomplysshe not.
For the good wyll suffyseth before god whan a man may not do it in werke outwarde or that other the whiche hath more greter dysposycyon it putteth in execucyon.
Here foloweth the circu~stau~ces for to accomplys+she the werkes of mercy merytoryously.
IN that yt these werkes of mercy beforsayd ben vnto god pleasau~t merytoryous vnto saluacyon they ought to be done Joyfully charytably lyberally and faythfully.
Fyrst they ought for to be done Joyfully sythen that god promytteth that for one peny gyuen he hym shall yelde an hondred.
That is for to saye for these lytell worldely temporall goodes dystrybuted and gyuen for the loue of hym he shall gyue the goodes spyrytuell of grace in this worlde and the royalme of glorye in paradyse.
The whiche ben more greter thynges in regarde of goodes temporall than is the nombre of an hondred for to see an hondred myllyons in comparyson of one.
And this vnderstanden ryght euyll these worldely people the whiche ryght Joyously gyuen¬∑ vnto the deuyll grete thynges by large dyspenses done in pompes in boostynges and in excedynge of dyuers abylymen+tes and grete gyftes vnto the ryche worldely people but with grete payne and with grutchynge they gyuen an half peny or a peny vnto Jhesu cry+ste.
Seco~dely almesdede ought to be done charytably that is that a man hath loue vnto god and vn+to his neyghbours.
And of this haue we an example in Cayn and Abell and for that that Abell was in charyte his oblacyons sacryfyces and almesdedes were to god acceptable and not those of Cayn for that that he hated his neyghbour.
And therfore sayth our lorde in the gospell yf thou offre ony thynge vnto god haue fyrste charyte vnto thy neyghbour for otherwyse it is not vnto god pleasau~t nor profytable vnto saluacyon.
Thyrdly almesdede ought to be done lyberally that is to saye with good wyll after thy power in lyke wyse as Thobye taught his sone.
Yf yu haue grete abon+daunce gyue abondauntly yf thou haue lytell gyue lytell yf thou haue meane gyue meane for Jhesu cryst wylled co~maundeth that his almesdedes ben prudent and dyscrete.
And that is ayenst them the whiche gyuen vnto bastelours. vnto trewandes other dysceyuers of the people the whiche haue no good tytle for to begge or the whiche sholde la+bour and gete theyr lyuynge.
Fourthly almesdede ought to be done faythfully that is to vnderstande of a thynge of valour at tyme place where it ought to be done.
Also almesdede ought to be done of the propre substau~ce of hym the whiche doth it and not of an other ma~nes goodes and of that the whiche ought for to be restored.
Also it ought for to be done ordynatly that is for to knowe vnto hym selfe fyrste and folowyngly vnto theym vnto whome a man is moost beholden by the lawe of nature as is fader and moder syster and and so of other.
For otherwyse it is to vndersta~de to dysprayse his neyghbour in necessyte and to ayde hym the whiche sholde be a straunger it sholde be cruelte more than it sholde be mercy or charyte.
How be it they ben grete these werkes done and accomplysshed in the estate of grace vnto god pleasaunte and prouffytable vnto the soule it appyreth by the gospell where god vs techeth that of that he sholde holde his Jugement in sayenge vnto them the whiche haue accomplysshed the sayd werkes of mercy.
Come you ye blessyd of god my fader and receyue the realme of paradyse the whiche is made redy vnto you from the begyn+nynge of the worlde.
haue hadde hongre and thorste and ye haue gyuen me meete and drynke haue ben a pylgryme and ye haue herborowed me.
And than these blessyd shall demaunde not by Ignoraunce but by admyracyon.
Our mayster kynge and lorde whan we see the to haue thorste and hon+gre we the recomforted.
Trewely saye you that that the whiche ye haue done vnto one of the leste of my bredern it repute for to be done as vnto my self.
Also he shall saye vnto theym the whiche shall be on the lyfte hande the whiche haue done no werkes of mercy.
Departe you fro me acursyd of god and ye shall go to the fyre of helle eternall the whiche vnto you is made redy with the deuylles.
haue had hongre and thorste and ye haue not gyuen me that myght drynke and
Lorde whan we see the to haue hongre and thorste demaundynge lodgynge syke and in necessyte we haue not comforted the.
saye you in that that ye ha+ue not had wyll to doo vnto the poore for the loue of me ye me haue to do.
And sythen that it is so that ye wolde not lodge me in your houses in the persone of my poore people.
ought not you nor wyll not lodge you in the royalme of paradyse.
And therfore go you with all the deuylles in to the fyre of helle eternall.
And here is the sentence and consummacyon of all the worlde and of the grete Jugement that all folke abydes.
By the whiche sentence it apyreth that moche more noble more sure and more dygne is the estate of holy pouerte or of lyfe contemplatyfe than of rychesses worldely the whiche is the lyfe actyfe.
Also euery creature ought well to take hede in his herte yf he be poore ryche or meane.
The poore by what tytle in what necessyte and by what intencyon he requyreth and taketh almesse for yf in beggynge he maketh hym poore or impotent for to wynne his lyuynge he synned ryght greuously as a theef and is bou~de to make restytucyon.
In the whiche it appyreth the theeft and dampnacyon of many the which renne thrugh crystendom which after men theyr lesynges and falsenes that many abbayes chirches hospytalles colleges and monaste ryes that they namen may not be susteyned reedyfyed nor the poore people to be comforted without the almesdede of people of whome they demaunden oftentymes for to enryche themself.
The meane is he the whiche is neyther ryche nor poore but all oonly hath his necessyte that he receyueth for suffysaunce.
And he is in as grete surete as the ryche is in grete daunger.
For to gyue vnduely it is a thynge of punycyon and not to gyue what charyte it co~maunded and necessyte it requyred it is ayenst god and he synned and this is as now vnto the werkes of mercy corporall.
HEre foloweth of the werkes of mercy spyrytuell of the whiche it is for to vnderstande that durynge this lyf there ben two estates or two maner of lyues.
That is the estate of the lyf actyf as ben people maryed or not maryed ben they noblesse burgeyses marchaundes labourers or of ony oter crafte of the whome the vocacyon and occupacyon ben in these thynges worldely and erthely.
The other estate is of them of the lyfe contemplatyfe as ben the people of the chirche and pryncypally relygyous men who sholde take hede vnto the seruyce of god and vnto thynges spyrytuall as well for them as for those of the lyf acty¬∑ By the meane of whome they be susteyned in theyr necessytees corporelles that notwithstandynge it is ryght conuenyent that the one estate take parte with the other for none ought for to be all oonly actyue but that he haue some thynge of the lyue contemplatyue.
And in lyke wyse the contemplatyue hym ought for to excercyse in some occupacyon corporell in place and in tyme after good dyscrecyon and for as moche as the lyfe actyue is good and also that the lyfe contemplatyue is moche more better he that myght perfaytly haue these tweyne he sholde be ryght parfyte for the estate of this presente lyfe.
But for to haue parfaytly these two thynges it is the synguler preuylege of the holy blessyd virgyn Mary and of Jhesu cryste her oonly sone in as moche as he is man.
For two lyues vnto vs were full well sygnyfyed and fygured in Martha and in Mary Mawdelayne as it is sayd before with the whiche women systers and dwellers in one selfe house the blessyd Jhesu cryste wt his apostles toke his lodgynge shewynge vnto vs yt he wolde be dwelle in the house of holy chirch co~posid vnyed of these two lyues beforsayd in lyke wyse as ye body the soule ben but one {per}sone.
And for as moche yt no man may come from yt lyf vnto ye realme of paradyse but by ye way of In lyke wyse as these actyues ben pryncypally bou~ de vnto ye werkes of mercy corporall so as it hath ben made mencyon before for as moche as they ha+ue ye goodes worldely corporall.
Euen in lyke wy+se those of ye lyf conte~platyf the~ pryncypaly occupy and excercyse these werkes of mercy spirytuell.
For of as moche as the soule is a more gretter thynge than the body of as moche these pouertees syknes+ses indygence of the soule may be more gretter than those of the body.
There was but late an holy heremyte excellent in contemplaco~n in the exercyte or vsynge of lyf spyrytuall the whiche yt not wt standynge he cou~seylled wt an other holy abbot tou+chynge the dede of conscyence vnto hym declarynge yt he hath yet such pouerte defaute of perfecco~n that whan he seeth the synnes imperfeceyons of some of his crysten broder he hym myght well and Joyously receyue in his company.
But ryght gladly he receyueth those in whome he knoweth grete goodnes them he socoureth Joyously in theyr necessytees.
And than the holy abbot seynge the imperfeccyon of hym the whiche sholde haue dyscrecyon of necessytees humayne more to peyse the spyrytuelles than the corporelles he began to wepe in sayenge.
Alas wel we sholde ameruayle innocence of humayne bodyes for ayenst the grete mercy of our neyghbours we ben dulled auenged more cruelly than bestes.
For hogges other bestes byrdes sayenge theyr semblable cryenge in some necessyte them enforce to socour the~ to shewe them the sygne of compassyon.
And therfore answere the vnto yt yt yu hast purposed vnto me in re+ceyuynge Joyously the good {per}sone yu doost a lytell good but yf yu receyue pyteously in co~passyon the poore synner in shewynge hy~ his saluacyon yu dost a more gretter almesdede in as moche as he is in more greter necessyte than the good persone.
He sholde be ryght dulle full of grete cruelte ye whiche seeth his very broder almoost rotten of mesellery deye in anguysshe of hongre of thorste bou~de imprysoned in the pryson of his mortall enemyes yf he hym may ayde conforte he hym le+ued before he deyed without hauynge of hym pyte compassyon.
Now is it than so that mortall syn+ne in the soule of our crysten broder is moche horryble mesellery more greter pouerte wretchydnes than is the necessyte corporell before sayd.
By the whiche it appyreth in what pyte compassyon sholde be the whiche see from daye to daye so many of synnes so horryble as well in our self as in our broder crysten men.
And therfore ought well to take hede euery creature in ryght of hymself the meane to acquyte hym in accomplysshynge ye werkes of mercy spyrytuell the whiche ben pryncypaly seuen vnderstanden by the latyn that foloweth.
That is to saye that euery man is bou~de in place in tyme to cou~seyll to teche his neyghbour.
And for his necessyte vnto god vnto his sayntes to make deuou+te orysons.
AFter some doctours mercy spyrytuell is dyuysed in .xij. brau~ches.
The fyrst is whan a man pardonned whylfully for ye loue of god them the whiche haue offended.
And it is vnderstanden whan they them repente requyre pardonne or where a man is redy appareylled that to do as many tymes as often as they wyll requyre pardonne.
How moche suche werke is vnto god pleasau~te it appyreth by the gospell by the whiche our lorde sayth promytted that yf we pardonne parfectly for the loue of hym vnto our neyghbours the offence that they haue co~mytted ayenst vs he vnto vs pardonned the grete offences infynyte that we haue done ayenst hym as oftentymes as ma+ny as we trespassen his co~maundement and it is that that we hym requere from daye to daye whan we saye our Pater noster.
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.
That is for to saye god our fader wyll ye pardonne vs our grete and infynyte defautes that we haue co~mytted ayenst you.
In lyke wyse as for the loue of you we pardonne our neyghbours the lytell offences that they haue co~mytted ayenst vs The peryll not to accomplysshe this werke and commaundement appyreth clerely by that that Jhesu cryste sayth in the gospell that yf we pardonne not with herte vnto those the whiche hath vs offended god the fader shall neuer pardonne vs the grete offences that we vnto hym haue done.
And soo for to do vnto vs he wolde well gyue an example on the tree of the crosse whan he pardonned them the whiche made hym to deye in prayenge swetly god ye fader for them.
We sholde put out the rancoure ylle wyll of mysdede shewe in dede in wordes tokens of loue vnto hym the whiche duely hym repented But vnto hy~ the whiche requyred not pardon it suffysed to pardon ye rancoure to shewe hy~ tokens of loue in wordes or other wyse And this is of perfeccyon of necessyte of saluacy on after as Bonauenture sayth saynt Thomas And in lyke wyse is vnderstande worde of Jhesu cryste yt sayth pardon thy neyghbour whiche the hath offended.
And we sholde not pardon one tyme alonely but as many tymes often as of that to do we ben duely requyred for the loue of god ne+uertheles we may Justely requyre satysfaccyon of the Iniurye or da~mage ye whiche vnto vs hath ben done or sayd.
For yt is not ayenst charyte but there to is bou~den he the whiche hath offended.
The seconde maner of mercy is to correcte charytably the synnes and defautes that a man hath perceyued in his neyghbour.
And for as moche as these synnes ben grete meruayllous and open in many people who so euer desyred to do the commaundement of god and the saluacyon of his soule may make suche a questyon.
That is to knowe whan in what maner a man is bounde to correcte his neyghbour vpon ye payne of deedly synne the answere.
The one is of necessyte of Justyce the other of necessyte of charyte.
Correccyon of Justyce apertayned alonely vnto them ye whiche hath ony prelaco~n vpon a nother as is ye good man of the house in his house the whiche may haue his wyfe his childern his seruau~tes vnto whome he sholde do correccyon after as it aperteyned vnto his Jurisdiccyon not all oonly by charyte but wt yt by Justyce to the ende to acquyte hym to gyue example.
Also these curat{is} these abbottes bysshoppes other prelates ayenst theyr subgectes after as it apertayned vnto theyr Jurisdiccyon.
Also kynges dukes erles other no+bles theyr offycers after the Jurisdiccyon offy+ce yt vnto them apertayned in the whiche they shol+de hepe do mercy vnto those the whiche them re+pente promyttynge correccion rygour of Justy+ce vnto obstynates perseuerynge theyr malyce For yf they paye not yt yt they sholde that is to kno+we mercy Justyce they dyspose them vnto damp+nacyon.
The seconde correccion ye whiche is of the necessyte of true charyte apertayned not all oonly vnto the prelates of holy chirche or vnto these lor+des erthely but with vnto all them vnto whome god co~mau~ded to loue theyr neyghbours as them self.
And for as moche as euery man is bou~de hym to repente correcte of his owne propre synne it foloweth yt he ye whiche is bou~de to loue his neygh+bour as hymself that he ought to do his power hy~ to correcte amende or elles there is not in hym true charyte in lyke wyse as god commaunded vpon payne of deedly synne.
But it is well to be noted that after as sayen these doctours of theologye six condycyons ben requysyte before that a man synned mortally in not correctynge his neyghbour of the whiche thre ben in the regarde of hym the whiche ought for to correcte and these other thre ben in regarde of hym the whiche ough+te for be corrected.
The fyrste is whan that he the whiche ought to corecte is certayne of ye synne of his neyghbour. for of sy~nes secrete a man is not bounde so straytly.
The seconde is that the correccyon be swete or pyteous syns yt it ought to procede of charyte.
The thyrde is yt there is none other vnto whome it appertayned more couenably for to correcte.
For yf an other do it it shall acquyte suffycyently them the whiche elles had ben holden to correcte.
The fyrst condycyon of the partye of the synner is that he haue in hym suche dysposycyon that a man may hope that for the correccyon he is the lesse worth as it may be a persone dronken a lecherous man a man of grete turour or of obstynate yt a man may not truste correcco~n than a ma~ ought to dyfferre abyde the place tyme oportu+nyte to do it.
The seconde condycyon is whe+re the synne of hym that a man ought to corecte is mortall or that is may be very semblable.
For as for venyall synne a man is not bounde to correcte vpon the payne of deedly synne.
But is bou~de all oonly for to counseyll and after good congruyte and this gyueth well to vnderstande the gospell the whiche sayth.
Correcte thy neyghbour and yf by thy correccyon he be conuerted thou hast wonne hym.
By the whiche it foloweth after as sayth saynt Gregory that the synne wherof he hath ben corrected was mortall.
For for a lytell synne a man is not loste and dampned.
Also yf a man were bounde for to correcte euery defaute or feblenes venyell the whiche contynually is in many full fewe it sholde sauour and yf it were not that the transgressyon of that commaundement were in euery dede of theyr conscyence.
The thyrde condycyon that he there haue place tyme oportunyte.
That who so euer knoweth ye mortall synne of his neyghbour the peryll of his dampnaco~n hath place tyme oportunyte for to correcte there is none other ye whiche dooth by oblygacyon or other wyse it is very lyke yt yf he were correcte so he hy~ sholde amende.
Than and not elles a man is holden vpon the payne of deedly synne hym to aduyse swetly and charytably for elles a man trespasseth the co~+maundement of god of nature the whiche is to loue god his creatoure with all his herte abone all thynges and in lyke wyse his neyghbour as hymselfe.
Whan it is so than that the moost grettest mysery that may be in man is the estate of deedly synne how may it than be that ony man loueth his neyghbour as hymself yf he socoure not hym vnto his power in suche necessyte.
Also saynt John sayth in his Canon that he the whiche loueth not his neyghbour may not loue god faythfully loue may not be hydde.
For yf ony man haue true loue he shall shewe it in werkes by accomplysshynge the werkes of mercy in doynge thynges grete or lytell after the quantyte of his loue in lyke wyse as wytnesseth saynt Gregory.
And therfore he the whiche hath trewely the loue of god in his herte dyspayreth not lyghtely the correccyon of his neyghbour and hym enforceth for to correcte hym in the vertue of the holy goost the whiche may all thynges.
The thyrde maner of mercy spyrytuell is to teche them the whiche ben ignoraunt by the whiche techynge the soule is fedde with the brede of holy doctryne.
In lyke wyse as the body is nou+rysshed and susteyned with meete corporell.
And yf it be so than that for to gyue meete and drynke vnto the poore for the necessyte of the body god promytteth the royalme of paradyse.
For by the more gretter reason he shall gyue his glorye vnto them the whiche for the loue of hym gyuen vnto the soules good and holy techynge.
For of as moche as the soule is more dygne than the body of as moche the meete and the refeccyon spyrytuell is more noble than that of the body.
Sythen it is so than that the moost partye of our neyghbours ben in languore of ignorau~ce that the horryble famyne inuadeth all moost all the worlde for the defaute of brede spyrytuell that is for to vnderstan+de of holy doctryne as it may be to saue hym the whiche hath scyence and knowlege of thynges the whiche apperteynen vnto the saluacyon of ye soule seeth his neyghbour deye in languysshynge for the defaute of this doctryne certayne with grete payne may he be excused before god of the co~mau~+dement to accomplysse mercy.
Some ben bounde to teche to departe the meete holy docryne by+cause of theyr offyce as these prelates of holy chir+che and these prechours the whiche for suche vocacyons they ben called the lyght of the worlde and the salt of the erthe.
For they gyuen lyght and techen the people symple and ignoraunt and vnto theym gyuen good sauour and deuocyon in preseruynge them to theyr power from the stenche and corrupcyon of all synne by good example of lyf by good doctryne and good exortacyon and in so doynge the holy fader of mercy vnto them promysed to make the~ grete in ye reame of paradyse.
Also curates faders and moders godfaders and godmoders auncyent people maysters of scole and other ought them to acquyte ayenst theym of whome they haue charge in techynge them and repreuynge theym of theyr defautes after as it is sayd before in the mater of correccyon as well fraternall as of Jurysdyccyon.
The fourth maner of mercy spyrytuall is to recomforte them discomforted this werke is moche necessary.
For by heuynes desolacyon oftymes a man falleth in to dyspayre from dyspayre vnto eternall dampnaco~n And therfore who so euer charytably conforted the dyscomforted he draweth hym backe from helle as moche as in hym is.
The whiche thynge is as moche pleasau~t vnto god as moche as is ye grete loue of the whiche he loued his creature for whome to saue preserue from dampnacyon he hath wylled to deye.
By ye whiche it foloweth yt to comforte these dyscomforted is a werke of ryght excellent mery+te before god.
To cou~seyll to comforte is ye offyce ryght synguler as well of the blessyd Jhesu cryst as of the blessyd holy goost.
By the whiche it apyreth that he the whiche accomplysshed not the wer+ke of recomforte ye dyscomforted whan there is pla+ce tyme co~mytted as moche grete ylle as it is to do grete good merytoryous pleasau~t vnto god.
The fyfth maner of almesdede spyrytuall is to co~+forte to enhardy those to do well the whiche ben weke in spyryte many there ben the whiche done grete thynges vertuous and merytoryous but by the vyce synne of pusyllanymyte or cowardyse they are not vndertake to come vnto so grete goodnes.
Wherfor them to enhardy them to gyue cou+rage to do vndertake these thynges the whiche ben vnto the glorye of god of the saluacyon of theyr soules is the werke of moche grete charyte moche pleasaunt and merytoryous before god by the consequent the defaute of that to do and ac+complysshe is moche peryllous and dyspleasaunt vnto god specyally in them vnto whome it appertayned by theyr offyce the estate vocacyons to make stronge exorte the comen people to do well as ben the people of the chirche ben they prelates curates relygyous or other.
And whan it shal hap+pen that they sholde as to make stronge susteyne to ayde these other for to vndertake werkes merytoryous in wekynge them dyscouragynge be it by theyr euyll example or otherwyse well nere al shall be lost wasted.
The sixt maner of almesde de spyrytuell is to supporte the feblenesses of his neyghbours the whiche thynge he ought to do by very compassyon by oryson by good dyscrecyon of correccyon in preseruynge them from the occasyon of synne and fyndynge the remedyes mea+nes theym to reduce amende after as it may be possyble by the maner beforsayd of correccyon fra+ternall.
For sythen it is so yt all the blood of Jhesu cryste had ben gyuen shedde for the precyousnes of the soule the whiche is the ymage of the blessyd trynyte the temple habytacyon of the holy goost the loue and the delytes of Jhesu cryste and the whiche may come vnto the beatytude eternall of paradyse as may the true catholyke the seruaunt of Jhesu cryste seen knowen without grete compassyon and without effusyon of teeres so noble a creature consecrated of god by the holy creame and the espouse of Jhesu cryste put and abandonned vnto the foule lykenes of deuylles fylthy vyle and dysfygured by synne some more than deuylles by the whiche the blood and passyon of Jhesu cryste ben moche more dyspraysed than the thynge foyled and troden vnder the feet of all maner of beestes.
Alas more than a thousande tyme alas alas how thynke we to be faythfull vnto Jhesu cry+ste to see suche pyte suche deluge of soules specyally crysten men wtout anguysshe compassyon the whiche is no thynge yf it be not shewed in the werkes of mercy.
The .vij. maner of almesdede spyrytuall is to hydde to couer and to anguysshe the ylle and dyffame of his neyghbour not to publysshe and shewe it by enuye or ony other cursyd entencyon.
For sythen it is so that good renowne is a grete goodnes noble and spyrytuall as how may it be done that ony man loueth god and his neyghbour yf he vnto hym yelde not and conserue his good renowne in couerynge his synnes his defautes and his fragylytees.
Certes it is impossyble and in as moche as the synne of our neyghbour is moche grete of as meche haue we the more gretter mater for to accomplysshe ayenst hym the more gretter mercy and for to haue ayenst god humylyte fere and loue in byleuynge certaynely that neuer creature dyde synne so grete or detestable but that we may do more gretter or semblable yf god kepe vs not and the seruyce of these blessyd angeles.
And in lyke wyse as of suche synne shol de haue wyll it for to hydde.
In lyke wyse euery man it ought to do ayen his neyghbour by very co~+passyon and charyte.
The .viij. maner of almesde de spyrytuall is to exhorte and meoue the good to prouffyte from good vnto better in shewynge them that they them kepe to presume folysshly of theyr good werkes of the whiche the honour and the glorye apperteyned all oonly vnto god.
Also that they haue in fere and in hate the fauour and the prayse of the worldely people the whiche often tymes taken and magnyfyen that the whiche god reproueth and punyssheth.
Of suche fauours maketh oftentymes the deuyll his darte or his arowe the whiche he casteth in the mydde daye that is the vayne glorye the whiche taken these grete foyles and full lytell well auysed of good werkes.
Also ben they aduysed that for ony lyf or penau~ce of tyme passed they be not of all assured for to be per+faytely acquyted before god.
And therfore watchen they vpon theyr warde in full grete fere and in humylyte in bryngynge oftentymes to mynde the estate and the feruour from whens saynt Peter felle the whiche so pyteously forsoke his creato+re.
and other many excellent in merytes and in hyghenes of lyf comtemplatyfe of the whome is made mencyon of the lyues of sayntes ben fallen in grete and py+teous inconuenyences.
And comenly the rote and the foundacyon of theyr temptacyons hath ben to presume of themself to dysprayse poore synners for one of the grettest temptacyons vnto people of deuocyon is to compare theyr lyf of penau~ce grete noble and excellent vnto the pouerte vnto the mysery feblenes of theyr neyghbours the whiche ben in grete horryble synnes.
And by this meane felle and hym enpryded the pharysee of whome maked mencyon the holy texte of the gospell.
But those the whiche ben taught inspyred prouffyten gretly vnto the occasyon of the synnes of theyr neyghbours.
For of that they humble them vnto god en knowlechynge that it is more greter gyfte of god to preserue ony from the fallynge vnto syn+ne than hym for to areyse after that he is fallen.
And yf it be so that the lyf and the merytes of ma+ny relygyous and other the whiche yet ben at this daye is a lytell thynge in comparyson of the lyfe and holynes of them beforsayd.
Who oftentymes haue so gretely fayled what is he the whiche ough+te to truste in hymself or his merytes.
The .ix. ma+ner of almesdede spyrytuall is to gyue good counseyll in thynges spyrytuell this werke is moche pleasau~t vnto god and of grete meryte vnto them that it may do in confermynge hym vnto the bles+syd Jhesu cryste the whiche for his example and doctryne is named the tongue of greate counseyll.
The gretenes of this werke and the meryte may be consydered in the hyghenes and dyffyculte of the cause of the Juge and of the partye aduersary.
The cause is for to lese or for to wynne paradyse.
The Juge is god almyghty and all knowynge by the whiche fals excusacyon cautelles cauyl+lacyons appellacyons dylacyons fere fauours gyftes or promysses haue no place in this courte for to peruerte Justyce.
The aduersarye is the deuyll of whome the malycyous cautell to excuse his practyse and longe experyence surmounten all naturall intendement of humayne creature.
And therfore whan a man seeth that the deuyll dysceyued enmused and entysed the poore creature humayne for to dampne hym and for to make hym to lese paradyse it is a moche excellent werke of charyte to counseyll hym the meane for to withstande the malyce of the deuyll and hym for to ayde for to come to wynne and to possede so noble an herytage as is the royalme of paradyse.
But euery intendement ought well for to haue in hym meruayllous pyte and compassyon of the moost grettest partye of them lyuynge the whiche an hon+dred thousande tymes ben more dylygent to suche counseyll to purchase or for to defende theyr ryght in twoo or thre feet of londe of dwellynges than they do for to purchase the royalme of paradyse the whiche vnto theym apperteyned by true ryght of herytage.
The whiche vnto vs hath playnely and ryght lawfully purchased our fader Jhesu cry+ste.
And of that folye hath other tymes founde the experyence the whiche foloweth.
The yeres a thou+sande foure hondred foure score and thre a noble man of the royalme of Fraunce vnto his goostly fader reknowleged and confessed vpon the loyalte of his fayth that he pleated by thre yeres in the grande or grete assyse in the Cyte of Bourgeys for the ryght that belened to haue thre halfe pens of rente by the yere and he was not yet at the fyne nor ende of his cause but he abode in doubte for to lese or to wynne he affermed that with his costes and his dyspenses as well of his moeuable as of his herytage he hath taken the beste counseyll that vnto hym was possyble for to fynde and after the relacyon and the whiche me semed very semblable he myght haue made more than an hondred myles vpon londe.
And a semblable thyn+ge make many of other worldely people the whiche make not one myle nor yet halfe a myle for to seche one good cou~seyll of conscyence.
By the whiche it behoued for to conclude that cause of many done ylle is for that they renne from the grete and infynyte Justyce of Jhesu cryste.
The .x. maner of almesdede is for to pacyfye and accorde them the whiche ben in dyscorde.
And how be it it is grete this werke and merytoryous before god it appyreth that it is for to vndo that that the deuyll hath done and for to do that that Jhesu cryste is comen for to do in this worlde and hath shewed by his example and commaundement for to do.
The labour and operacyon of the deuyll is for to put noyses debates warres and dyuysyons in all esta+tes for the whiche cometh pletynges hates debates and oftentymes murdres grete losse of goodes and of bodyes and of soules for who that hated his neyghbour lesed god the whiche may not abyde but in the conscyence of hym the whiche hath peas with his neyghbour.
And therfore whan our lorde was borne for to fyght and for to destroye the puyssaunce of the deuyll he dyde do crye with the sounde of trompettes of paradyse peas in erthe And therfore of good ryght he is named kynge of Jherusalem and prynce of peas.
By the whiche it appyreth that for to put peas and vnyte bytwene them the whiche ben at dyscorde debate or dyuysyon it is for to do as moche grete seruyce vnto the kynge of peas in hym prepayrynge the chambre and the habytacyon where he wyll enhabyte and reste the whiche seruyce and offyce may not be done without grete retrybucyon.
And by the contrarye for to put dyuysyon warre and debate bytwene ony persones is proprely the offyce of the deuyll and of his membres.
And therfore sayth holy scrypture that there ben .vi. thynges that god hateth moche but the seuenth he hateth soueraynly.
The thyrde is crudelyte for he is swete benygne and mercyfull.
The fourth is enuye cautelle or trechery for he is bonte without faynynge.
The fyfth is vnfaythfulnes ayenst Justyce for he is the Juge of Justyce infynyte.
The sixte is fals wytnes the whiche is contrarye as well vnto the trought as vnto charyte but aboue all these thynges before sayd he hath in horrour or in hate hym the whiche soweth hatred debate dyscorde and dyuysyon bytwene them the whi+che ben and ought for be frendes and therfore they the whiche ben peasyble of good ryght ben called in the gospell the childern of god.
And by the contrarye may a man saye that they the whiche sowen hates warres dyscordes dyuysyons and debates that ben the childern of the deuyll of helle.
The .xi. maner of almesdede spyrytuall is for to praye vnto god for his neyghbours.
And this almesse prouffyteth vnto the body and vnto the soule in all maner necessyte.
For by this almesse or ayde vnto his neyghbours hath purchased sapyence vertues and merytes and fynably the royal me of paradyse the whiche noo man may haue and gete of hymselfe.
By the whiche it behoueth that by humylyte and by prayer a man them requyre of god the whiche so for to do vs hath warned.
Where of sayth well the holy doctour saynt Austyn that noo maner man may come vnto saluacyon yf that god calle hym not nor noo maner of man may come yf that god ayde hym not nor also he wyll not ayde hym yf that a man requyre it not.
The whiche thynge is done by deuoute prayers that is for to lyfte vp his herte vnto god by true fayth without ony maner of thynge or artycle for to doubte that he is more puyssaunt for to gyue moche more gretter thynges than ony maner of man can thynke or demaunde.
Also a man ought for to byleue stedfastly that wyll make his prayers auaylable the whiche is the fontayne and depnesse of mercy of pyte and of swetnesse infyfynyte and he the whiche may not fayle nother lye.
And alwayes sayth he in the gospell that yf two or thre persones ben vnyed in good charyte he them shall gyue that that they of hym requyre prouffytable for the glorye of god and for theyr saluacyon.
If it than a thynge dygne moche holy and moche pleasaunt vnto god as for to praye one for an other.
For oftentymes god pardonned the one by the request supplycacyon of the other.
In lyke wyse as it appyred by the holy scrypture where god sayth vnto Moyses.
Suffre me shal destroye this people for the synne of ydolatrye as yf he wolde saye that yf it were not for thy prayer the whiche holded me and taryed.
Also by the prayers of Danyel the people of god were delyuered from the captyuyte of Babylon.
Also by the prayers of Danyd the aungell the whiche by the commaundement of god put the people vnto deth and destrucco~n incontynent cessyd.
Also by the prayer of holy chirche that is to knowe of those the whiche were baptysed.
For it is wryten in the dedes of the appostles that the chirche prayed for hym without cessynge and it was fygured how that by the deuoute orysons of holy chirche poore synners the whiche them submytten vnto the sacramentes and prayers of them ben de+lyuered from prysons and boundes of the deuyll of helle the whiche holdeth them bounden by the cordes of theyr synnes.
Also by the prayyrs of holy persones the whiche than were present.
Saynt Poule receyued the syght the whiche he had loste and was baptysed.
By the vertue of prayers these deuylles ben vaynquysshed fortunes sykenesses warres and pestylences cessen.
By prayer these pa+tryarkes these prophetes martyrs and other sayn+tes haue chasyd these deuylles helyd the syke reysed the deed conuerted these ydolatrers.
To praye for his enemyes is a thynge of grete perfeccyon and he foloweth Jhesu cryste the whiche in deynge prayed god the fader to pardonne them that made hym to deye and in this folowed hym saynt Stephen.
And who so is well enlumyned he shall kno+we clerely that euery good crysten man ought for to praye for them vnto hym done Iniurye as for them the whiche vnto hym gyuen mater to entre with Jhesu cryste in to the realme of paradyse in to the whiche none may entre wtout trybulacyon.
The .xij. maner of almesdede spyrytuell is to offre or to make offrynge vnto god the fader the blessyd Jhesu cryste his sone wt the ryght holy sacrament of the awter and this almesdede here surmounted syngulerly in two thynges all these other good dedes that may be sayd or thought that is in dygny+te in generalyte.
In dygnyte for than is offred the very sone of god vnto whome ben all the treasours of the dyuynyte and all goodes ben they of nature of grace or of glorye.
There is the brede and the wyne flesshe and blood the ryght holy re+feccyon of crysten soules.
Also this almesdede is ryght generall as well vnto ye quycke as vnto them that ben departed for it is the pryce the redempcyon for an hondred worldes yf there were so many the whiche wolde vnto that submytte theyr fayth and theyr hope.
This medycyne is not all oonly of soules but with that of bodyes and of all sykenesses.
It is he the whiche for gyue example of of all perfeccyon hath made and accomplysshed all werkes of mercy as well corporal as spyrytual.
For fyrste he vs hath gyuen his ryght holy flesshe vigynale for to eete and his precyous blood for to drynke.
Also he so is dyspoyled on the tree of the crosse for to clothe vs with vertues and with glory He hath wylled that his syde were opened for to lodge vs.
He vs hath vysyted from daye to daye our sykenesses as well spyrytuall as corporall.
He vs hath delyuered from the harde prysons of the deuyll.
He hath wylled to be buryed by the water of baptem by the whiche we sholde deye as vnto the desyres seculer and worldely and shall lyue with hym arysen.
By this oblygacyon he is broken the deuylles surmounted the vertues purchased and gyuen the holy goost sente and the yate of paradyse opened and by the werkes of the infy+nyte mercy of the blessyd Jhesu cryste.
¬∂Here foloweth the fourth partye of this boke in the whiche is fou~de ye maner hy~ well to confesse it conteyneth .xxx. chapytres.
The whiche well stu+dyed and put in practyse may be the meane for to make a true and a parfyte confessyon.
And by the consequent to haue absolucyon and remyssyon specyally saluacyon with the company of faythfull crysten men.
[Figure: EVery persone that wylled desyred to make good examinacyon of his conscyence for en+terly perfectly hy~ to confesse he hy~ ought examyne by the doctryne drawen in these thre partyes pre+cedentes.
That is to knowe of the artycles of the fayth.
For in these thre poyntes is conteyned the dede of the conscyence by the whi+che a man shall be fynably Juged vnto saluacion or vnto dampnacyon.
And therfore to the entente that symple people may haue mater and doctryne of well surely to examyne the dede of theyr conscyence there shall be fyrst put some thynges gene+rall touchynge the sacrament of confessyon.
¬∂Here folowen .iiij. reasons for to shewe yt yt Justy fycacyon of one synner is more greater thyng tha~ the creacyon of the worlde.
AFter the sentence of gloryous saynt austen to reduce a synner from the estate of mortall synne vnto the estate of grace is a more grea+ter thynge after some consyderacyon thanne was the creacyon of heuen and of erth and that may a man shewe by foure reasons.
The fyrst is for the soule yewhiche is by his synne in ye estate of damp+nacyon and perdycyon is more noble and more dygne syngulerly For as moche as he is create vn+to the ymage of the blyssed trynyte the whiche is not the sonne the skye and all the erth by the whi+che it foloweth that to brynge one suche creature from the estate of maledyccyon of dampnacyon vnto saluacyon and vnto the royalme of para+dyse is a more greater thynge than is the creacyon of the thynges before sayd.
The seconde is suche for as moche as god demaundeth not to be ayded vnto the creacyon of the soule nor of all the world but he myght not nor wolde not vs reduce frome dedely synne vnto the estate of grace without the ayde and consent of our free wyll.
The thyrde rea+son is For in the creacyon of the worlde god fou~de no lettynge nor resystence but vnto the Justyfycacyon of the conscyence the synne repugnethe vnto the grace of god: The fourth reason is for whan god created all the worlde he sayd that heuen and erthe be made And at his sayenge and pleasure al was made and formed for too reduce oure soules frome synne vnto grace he is excessyuely humylyed And by the space of two and thyrty yeres and thre monethes he hath endured fastynges prayers paynes swetynges. and labours hath ben boun+de spytte on stryken and crucyfyed And fynally hath shedde all his precyous blode And hath wyl+led to dye on the crosse And all that hath he done for to delyuer oure soules from synne And for to brynge them vnto saluacyon.
Here foloweth a profytable exortacyon for to do wylfully penaunce.
Man ought well to note that there is not so greate a synner in the worlde but that he may recouer the grace of god yf he wyll do that that is in hym for god is of so greate pyte mercy that he may not fayle vnto his creatour the whi+che doth that yt in hym is wherfore it is to knowe that by the lyght of reason naturall.
And specy+ally of that the whiche is ayded with fayth and en+formed That is to vnderstonde that the synner whiche is contrary and dyspleasaunt vnto all rea+son Also he may consyder the Justyce dyuyne the whiche may not sufferre but ye synne were ponys+shed And of this consyderacyon and comparyso~ of synne vnto the Justyce dyuyne the whiche is in fynyte And by the consygnet to offende infynytly by synne procedeth and comyth fere vnto ye crea+tour reasonable culpable and subgecte vnto synne But howe be it he ought not alwayes to abyde in that consyderacyon for that sholde be meter hym too dyspayre As were Cayme and Judas But more ouer he ought to consyder the bonte pyte mercy the whiche ben in god infynyte by the why+che he abydeth the synner and defferreth his deth to the ende that he may vse yf he wyll of the consyderacyon beforesayd and that he may do penau~+ce And of this consyderacyon of mercy comyth an hope agayn god our fader the whiche is fountayne of mercye and of all consolacyon And by the meane of these two thynges That is to knowe fe+re on that one partye and hope on the other comyth a purpose and desyre to do penaunce the whi+che purpose comyth pry~cypally of god by a remorce of conscyence that god gyueth vnto the persone or by a lytell and inclynacyon naturall or by a pre+dycacyon or by the counseyll of a gode confessour or by other vocacyon semblable And thenne they the whiche dyspose them to receyue and obey vnto that inspyracyon receyuen true contrycyon of theyr synnes And by the consyguent the grace of the ho+ly gooste But they the whiche it refusen in dyferrynge from daye to daye from month to month from yere to yere makynge a defe eere the whiche by so often tymes And also contynually stryketh at the yate of theyr conscyence yelde them vnkyn+de indygne of the loue of god of his royalme by the whiche they abyde in the temptacyon of the deuell Justely reseruyd vnto the fyre of hell.
For it is a thynge certayn that there was neuer creatour dampned but by his owne defaute.
Here foloweth the .xii. fruytes the which cometh of trewe penaunce.
Man may shewe .xii. fruytes cometh and procedeth of trewe penaunce.
The fyrst is illumynacyon of the soule for thre thynges fyrste for the confessyon is not true yf the synner take no payne to thynke on his synnes and to knowlege his defaute and his blame And therfore sayth a man comenly he that loketh in a glasse seeth hym selfe well and he that seeth hymself well knoweth hymself well And he that kneweth hymself well preyseth hymself lytell And he that preyseth hym+selfe lytell is a wyse man Secondly for that that the synner hym humbleth before the preest for the loue of god some tyme the kynge the pope before a poore chapelayne by the which god hym geueth the lyght of grace Thyrdly for the instructyon yt the good confessour geueth vnto the synner for ma+ny ymagen of venyall synne that it be mortall or some tyme of mortall that it be venyall or that it be no synne The seconde fruyte is ye mercy of god of the whiche sayth saynt Barnardyne that god hath two courtes That is to knowe the courte of mercy And that other of Justyce That of mercy is moche swete and gracyous in comparyson of yt of Justyce for foure reasons The fyrste is for as moche as the Juge of this court is swete and amya+ble ageyn the synner the whiche is culpable The seconde for in this court a man byleueth withoute ony thynge agayne sayenge vnto culpable The thyrde for alwayes in this court is gyuen lyberte and delyuerau~ce.
The fourth for that that he whiche had deserued the gybet of hell is assured of the royalme of paradyse.
Also for as moche that from the court of Justyce a man may apele vnto the court of mercy durynge this present lyfe and not after an example of dauyd of mary Maudelayn of say~t peter and many other synners.
And also it cou~sey+leth saynt Austen and many other holy scryptures.
The thyrde fruyte is that the synner is arysen from deth spyrytuall vnto the lyfe of grace For after that a man hath synned mortally man may neuer retorne vnto grace but by the meane of con+fessyon and how be it that he the which hath true contrycyon and dyspleasur of his synnes he is by that in the estate of grace before that he hath made actuell confessyon.
Neuerthelesse it behoueth yt he haue purpose that to do in place and in tyme or elles he may not haue grace.
The fourth fruyte is delyuer from the puyssaunce from the bondes of the deuyll of hell the whiche holdeth ye synner in his mouthe the whiche is moche large in the entre but ryght strayte as vnto ye comynge out.
The fyft fruyte is purgacyon of ryght horryble detestable mesellery spyrytuall yt is from dedely synne the whiche purgacyon may be made in lytyll tyme du+rynge the greate dayes of mercy as well of sy~nes dedely as of venyall but after this mortall lyf mo+che otherwyse shall be forme maner of pledy~g The .vi: fruyte is a lyghtynge of yt conscyence for none other thynge is so heuy as yt the whiche hath made these deuylles to fal other dampned in to the depnesse of hell that is dedely synne the which by other meane than by true confessyon penaunce he may not be deposed this alleuacyon they fyn+de by certayn operacyons grete horryble synners after yt that they ben lawfully confessed.
The .vii. fruyte is peas and vnyte with god for in dysobeynge vnto god the synner maketh warre agayne the maieste dyuyne agayne whose power to resyste it is a thynge impossyble by the whiche the synner ought soueraynly to seche the meane of peas that is true penau~ce.
The .viii. fruyte is by true confessyon the deuyll all his labour is put to confusy+on and oftymes by ye of good confessours some embusshement his cautelles and decepcyons ben dyscouerde The whiche thynge hym dysplea+seth and the lette of his fals intencyon ryght syn+gulerly.
The .ix. fruyte is that oftymes it happeneth that he the whiche hath not playne contrycy+on but hath alonely attrycyon the whiche is a ma+ner of contrycyon vnparfyte and vn suffycyent for to haue the grace of god But by the vertue of the absolucyon sacramentall with that attrycyon the synner receyueth the grace of the holy goost yf the+re be none other lettynge.
The .x. fruyte is reuelacyon of grete parte of the payne due for ye synnes yt a man hath co~mytte as well for the vertu puy sau~ce of the keyes of the sacrament of holy chirche as also of ye shame yt a man hath to tell his sy~+ne.
The .xi. fruyte is augmentacyon of grace for often it may happen yt the greate contrycyon and dyspleasure that the synner hath he hym arayseth from synne in to the more greater grace and loue of god than euer he hath ben tofore and more wa+re to resyst and more humble before god and before man in lyke wyse as it is red of many sayntes that haue synned.
The .xii. fruyt is that the synner by his true confessyon geueth glory praysynge to god for that that he hym knowlegeth and confesseth a synner before god and by the consequent he knowlegeth the Justyce dyuyne to be true and in fallyble in the whiche he gyueth glory praysynge vnto god vnto whome alonely it is due in heuen in erth.
¬∂Here foloweth the dyfference of werkes done in synne or in the grace of god.
AFter true confessyon the goode werkes the whiche before were deed and without meryte ben lyuely merytoryous They the whiche ben done in the estate of grace ben sayd to be loue+ly for as moche that they shall be rewarded eternal+ly yf the persone be fynably saued yf after such good werkes he fall in to dedely synne.
For why+che afterwarde he doeth true penaunce the meryte of those good werkes the whiche weren mortyfyed and effaced by reason of the sayd synne vnto hym is yelden and restored by the vertu of true penau~ce.
But so is it not of good werkes done in dedely fy~ne as shall be fastynges almesdedys prayers or o+ther goodnesses for notwithstandynge that ye syn+ner shall do penaunce and shall be fynably saued.
he shall not be rewarded of meryte essencyall for those werkes done in dedely synne.
For they were neuer lyuely nor pleasaunt vnto god and by the co~+sequent they may not be araysed by the whiche a man may certaynly say that it is more worth vnto a persone for to gyue a peny in the estate of grace or to fast one daye for the loue of god than to gyue all the golde of the worlde in the estate of dedely sy~+ne or to fast all the dayes of his lyfe with brede with water.
In the whiche apereth a merueylous dyfferrence bytwene the estate of dedely synne and the estate of grace.
But that not with stondynge where as the synner hath many of synnes of asmo+che he hym ought to enforce to do good werkes for by that he is often preseruyd for to fall into other synnes also it hym dysposeth ableth to contynue in good werkes and lyfe vertuous Also yf suche vnto hym haue ben enioyned by penau~ce it hym acquy+teth of that penaunce after the moost hole opynyon Also he occupyeth the tyme fruytfully hym maketh som what takynge parte with these good persones Also it auoydeth paynes temporall the whiche oftymes comen by cause of synnes he deser+ueth agayne the grete lyberalyte of god prosperyte godes te~porall also they letten ye deuyll yt he hath not so grete puyssau~ce to noye ye synner also they re+lesen ye paynes of hell or purgatory is to knowe yt a man shall not beso moche punysshed as at such tyme yt a man shold do suche good dedes he hath ben ydell they prouoken the mercy dyuyne for to gyue grace by whiche a man may go from his sy~ne yf suche persones be fynably saued he shall haue ioye eternall of those goodnesses done in the estate of dedely synne not as suche nor soo greate as yf that he hadde theym done in the estate of gra+ce.
For good werkes that be done for ye loue of god stere put and knocke at the yate of mercy dyuyne after as it is sayd in the gospell And this mater de+clareth ryght a longe saynt Bernardyn in the thre score and foure sermon of the somme the whiche is intytled de contracti{bus}.
¬∂Here foloweth .vi. reasons shewynge that no sin+ner ne ought to tary hym to confesse.
THe fyrst reason is wherfore no man ought to tary hym to confesse is for the condycyon of synne for it is lyke vnto fyre bre~nynge the why+che may not be quenched but by trewe co~fessyon in the whiche he ought to haue abundaunce of teerys at the leest spyrytuell the whiche ben sorowe and dyspleasure to haue offended god by synne And in lyke wyse as he sholde be holden a fole the whiche seeth his house brennynge and he it may remedye by the castynge on of water and he nothynge wyl do soo is it of them the whiche ben in dedely synne and putteth not theyr dylygence to purge them by trewe confessyon.
The seconde is for as moche that synne is a ryght perylous syknesse and confessyon is a ryght certayne medycyne and proufytable by the whiche it apperyth that full fewe prey+se the helthe of theyr soule the whiche seeth hym selfe syke and nere deed and fyndeth not the reme+dyes to make hymself hole The thyrde reason is for as moche as the dethe is nere the whiche in all places vs purseweth and there is no persone that may knowe ye houre after the comen lawe ne the houre ne the day the maner or how he ought to dye And ryght often it happeneth that the deth taketh the synner wherof he taketh no hede.
And certayn yf ony knewe the daye of his deth he sholde be mo+re assured than he that knoweth not the daye nor the hour.
And euer more he the whiche knowyth yt he shall haue no more but one yere in this presente lyfe he sholde aredy hym to dye well and by true and entyre confessyon in makynge restytucyon in requyrynge pardon in pardonnynge.
In the why+che it apperyth clerely the grace begylynge and de+cepcyon as well of the worlde as of the deuyll the whiche bryngeth a slepe the people in synne.
The fourth reason is for that that the synner is now in the mouth of the lyon of hell the whiche in an hor+ryble rayge desyreth hym to deuoure from ye whyche peryll he may be delyuerde by true confessyon.
The fyfte reason is for that ye synner by his synne hath lost ye godes spyrytuall ye godes of glory infynyte eternall with yt he lo+seth his tyme his body his soule and that he doth as to purchase meryte essencyall all these godes before sayd may he recouer by true confessyon.
But the deuyll of hell dosyth his eeres hy~ pro+myttynge falsely in greate treason yt he shal lyue longe and that he shall amende by true confessyo~ this hangynge cometh vpon the dethe.
And tha~ many of these do~me people wolde them confesse haue true repentaunce the whiche cometh pryncypally of ye grace of god of whiche grace they ben indygne or vnworthy for whan god the~ called ta+ryed they haue refused to come by ye whiche of gode ryght he theym refuseth in theyr necessyte and theym sendeth vnto the galowes of helle for theyr irreuerence and iniquyte for of as moche that he them hath the more longely abyden of as moche ought they to be dampned the more greuously therfore sayth well holy scrypture that god holdeth his bowe bent and draweth agayne the synners ye whiche taryen them to confesse.
The .vi. reason is as vnto the regarde of mercy swete pyte of oure saueour Jhesu cryst the which not alonely abydeth at the yate of oure conscyence.
But with that puttyth knockyth and callyth from daye to daye yt is to knowe by inspyracyons of gode wylles by pre+dycacyons by gyftes and benyfyces and somtyme by syknesses losses of godes warres and other flagellacyons.
But in lyke wyse as the deuyll bly~ deth the synner so he hym maketh to lose the hery~+ge of the vocacyon that oure lorde vnto hym maketh.
By ye whiche of gode ryght he vnto hym shal say at the deth haue called the thou haste not wylled to come Nowe thou callest me and the re+co~mende vnto the deuyll.
By these .vi. reasons apperyth clerely the peryll the whiche is to defferre longely abyde hym to confesse for by yt many can not them confesse as in generall for yt that they ha+ue forgoten ther synnes ye whiche thynge may not be suffycyent excusacyo~ whan neclygence conte~p+te of theyr helth is cause of theyr ygnoraunce and many doctours dowten ryghte greatly that suche confessyon is not suffycyent vnto saluasyon and vnto thatpurpose som maken a questyon That is for to knowe yf that ony synner be bounde hym for too confesse in contynente after that he hathe synned mortally and that he hathe place and tyme and a chapelayne that hath power for to assoyle The answere vnto that no man is bounde regu+lerly And by the commaundement of holy chirche but one tyme in the yere that is at tyme of ester excepte in .v. cases The fyrst is whan a man wyll receyue the holy sacrament of the awter and that a man hath presbiteru~ idonium for to assoyle hym For as sayth a doctour named Rycardus de media vylla suche a caas may be come that some the whiche hath comytted mortall synne and hath the presence of ony preest non idoniu~ may receyue with out synne the holy sacrament of the awter with co~+trycyon without other confessyon in attendynge place and tyme and confessoure more couenable The seconde caas dependeth ynough of the fyrste that is for as moche as holy chirche commau~deth that euery crysten man the whiche hath age competent ought to receyue his creature at the tyme of Ester by the whiche it foloweth that he oughte to be trewly confessed and repentaunce The thyrde is whan suche persone shall be in the artycle of dethe and may haue place and oportunyte to make confessyon The fourth shall be whan ony hath suche synne of the whiche he may not be assoyled but of hym of whome he sholde haue the presence of ye whiche presence is it semblable that he nor she shall not it recouere but of the yere The fyfte shall be whan the conscyence of ony man hym prycketh or warneth that he is holden hym to confesse incontynent after that he hath co~mytted his synne mortall that he hath oportunyte that to doo for it is ryght good cou~seyll and sure so to do as it it sayd before in the commau~dementes of holy chirche al+so another questyon that is to knowe yf curate be bounde to here the confessyons of his parysshyn+ges as oftymes as they hym requyre.
The answer he is holden of necessyte to here theyr confessyon whan they hym requyre at the tyme yt they be boun+den them to confesse by necessyte as is one tyme of the yere after the co~maundement of holy chirche or in the artycle of deth but yf it be more often or in other cases not necessary he shal not be bou~de~ of necessyte but alonely of congruyte as he the whyche syngulerly ought to desyre theyr welth theyr prouffyte But alwayes whan he is requyred and he them wyll not or may not here or vnto them as+sygne not another confessour than they haue lycence for to prouyde of a confessour for that tyme or for many tymes whan the it shall requyre that confessour in lyke wyse hath power them to as+soyle of the case as may the sayd curate also whan ony is in hate dyscencyon with his neyghboure or wyll not doo dygne penaunce for his synnes he is bounde to shewe it in secrete wyse or byfore wytnesse after as the case it requyreth.
And yf by suche admonycyon he wyll not be corrected he it oughte to renou~ce vnto his souerayne as is the bysshop of the dyoses or vnto his offycyall also he ought to praye for hym and hym ought to reco~maunde vnto the prayers of his other parysshynges and hym to name after good descressyon that it may be vnto his prouffyte and vnto ye edifycacyon of his neyghbours and whan he hath done suffycyently these shynges before sayd.
Than he may be excused before god of the charge and of the gouernyng that he hath of the sayd parysshynges not other wyse In lyke wyse as it appereth by the ryght other holy scryptures.
¬∂Here foloweth the practyse that the confessoure ought to holde as well agayne hymself as agayne them that he confesseth.
HOr as moch as the practyse and experyence without grete connynge ys somty me more prouff ytable than is the scyence without experyen+ce.
Here foloweth a ryght prouffytable insygneme~t of the practyse that the confessour ought to holde as well for the saluacyon of his soule as of them that he confesseth.
Fyrst he ought to knowlege and fele in hymself that the excusacyon of the offyce of the confessour may not be duely done nor accomplysshed as vnto theffecte of the sacrament why+che is to brynge agayne the synner from the estate of synne to ye grace of god from deth spyrytuall to lyfe spyrytuall but alonely by the vertu ayde of ye creatour where as it is so as for to iustefy these sy~ners it is not lesse than ye creacyon of ye world as it appereth before By the whiche the confessoure ought well to examyne his conscyence in requyryn+ge the ayde of the holy goost For yf he were bou~de from dedely synne he myght not vnto his saluacy on vnbynde the synner yt he confesseth nor haue ye ayde knowlege the whiche vnto yt is necessary in token of this thynge whan our lorde gaue vnto his appostles the execusyon to confesse he vnto the~ sayd.
Take receyue the holy goost they yt you as+soyle shall be assoyled And those that ye wyll not assoyle shall not be assoyled. therfore sayen these doctours of theologie ye they the whiche admynystren solemly the holy sacramentes as is ye baptem confessyon or other in the estate of dedely synne sy~+nen dedely.
Also be ye confessour warned yt in suche mynystracyon he seche pryncypally ye honour glo+ry of god the prouffyte saluacyon of soules not ye preyse fauoure or agayn temporall or some other thynge sinistre not purposynge ye ryche vnto the poore the wyse worldly man vnto these symple creatures the fayre vnto the foule the noble vnto them not noble but by good iuste cause for asmo+che yt of one may come more grete good vnto holy chirche or vnto the saluacyon of soules than of the other for yf he haue poornesse of intencyon hym it shall enayde.
But otherwyse he shall be lyke vn to the candell brenneth in she wynge the waye vn+to other Also be he aduysed yt the admynystracyon of ye sacrament is meruayllous amonge other grete dyffyculte By the whiche he therin ought to procede demeurely dyscretly without preceptacy on in chastysynge be it to here the synnes to suche or to knytte satysfactyon and penaunce for mo+che better it is to examyne one or tweyne vnto saluacyon than twenty and foure noughtely.
Also it is ryght expedyent specyally at this daye that whan these confessours haue the cases the whyche with good cause were other tymes reserued vnto the prelates for the correccyon of synners. for with grete payne may a man make ony fruyte in confessyon for the dyuersyte and habundaunce of grete and horryble synnes and of cases the whiche of them cometh as well in olde as in yonge as wel for the sentences of excomyny~g of restytucyons of blasfemynges of ydolatryes of other cases newe and in estymables the whiche neuer hath ben her+de or founde by scrypture the whiche ben at this daye founde and taken from synners by the syngu+ler grace of god and the meryte and good dylygen+ce of confessours and there ben fou~de many sy~ners that neuer wolde consent to be sent vnto the prelates though that they sholde be euer without confessyon so as many sayen and affermen.
By the why+che it is not to be vnderstande that that the which other tymes hath ben ordayned for ye charyte and saluacyon of soules as ben the sacramentes and ordenau~ces of holy chirche ought to be kept vnto the preiudyce of the saluacyon of synners the whyche thynges shall come whan the prelates the why+che haue to answere of dede spyrytuall of theyr sub+gectes they wyll not co~mytte theyr case and puyssaunce in suche necessyte vnto chapelayns wyse dyscrete how be it that at this daye with grete payne there ben founde chapelayns suffycyent in all thynges vnto suche offyce by the which defaute ma+ny of the poore synners go vnto dampnacyon Also ought the confessour subtylly aduyse the qualyte the offence and other dysposycyons of the synner And then he ought to enquyre of the synnes of the whiche he may be culpable and yf he perceyue that the persone be yonge or other ellys he is or to moche ferefull he ought to shewe it swetely affyably and there he ought to perswade from con+fessyon And how he sholde chese more soner to dye than euer to say or ony thynge declare of the synne the whiche vnto hym hath ben confessed.
For it vn+to hym hath ben tolde in as moche as he is the vp care of god pryncypally and not as vnto a man Also he ought to declare of as moche that he hym confesseth the more playnly and the more longful+ly of as moche he shall loue hym the better.
Also that by suche confessyon he is put out of the bondes of the deuyll and auoydeth the paynes of helle and retorneth vnto Jhesu cryste for to lyue eternal+ly. oftymes it happeneth that by suche Admonycy on man gyueth courage vnto the poore synners the deuyll of helle holdeth in fere to confesse them poorly entyerly.
And the confessour ought to labour specyally agayne yonge people or other symple persones and rude to tell theyr synnes.
Fyrst in generall and afterwarde moeuynge the ayde of ye holy goost he ought to dyscende vnto the partyculers after that he shall haue the cause and occacyon by that the whiche is sayd in generall.
And the~ he may demau~de yf they wyll well that he them ex+amyne to the ende that theyr confessyon may be ho+le vnto theyr saluacyon in she wynge them that yf by ypocrysye or euyll thynkynge they saye not trouth in theyr confessyon they lye vnto god whi+che all can and knoweth and that suche confessyon sholde be more dampnable than merytoryous. and whanne that a man fyndeth ony suche symple people the whiche promytten to say and to answe+re truely and requyren wyllyng that a man them examen after that they haue sayd that that they can a man may not make a more brefe and sure expedycyon than by the commaundementes of god as shall be sayd here after.
And a man ought to ad+uertyse the synner that he answere not to haue done that thynge that he hath not done.
As done ma+ny the whiche answer yes syre vnto that yt a man them demaundeth be it trouth or lesynge And for to knowe better to procede in suche interrogacyons the confessour ought to demaunde the estate of the persone yf he knowe it not.
That is to knowe yf he be in the estate of maryage or in the estate of the chirche reguler or seculer clerke or laye noble or not noble prelate or subiecte and of other vocacyons.
And than he may forme his interrogacyons after the synnes the whiche moost comenly aboun+den in suche people as vnto the people of the chirch of symony of irregularyte of sacrylege of euyll dyspendynge of the patrymonye of Jhesu cryste these ben the goodes of the chirche.
Also of noble pe+ple and offycers of rauayn vnto people marchau~+des offrandes and of lyenges vnto borges vsury vnto yonge people of temptacyons carnalles and of touchynge dyshoneste and of the cyrcumstaunces the whiche greuen moche¬∑ and of the maners and dyuers espyces the whiche may be in one self synne and of the nomber.
That is to knowe by hewe oftymes aman is fallen in to the same synne For the synner it ought to tell and confesse yf vnto hym it be possyble or as nere as vnto hym it may be very semblable.
And so of other thynges after the dyscrecyon and medyfycacyon before sayd. by the whiche it appereth that the confessour ought to haue thre thynges scyence cautelle and dyscrecyon scyence for to dyscerne the dyuersytees of the ma+ner of synnes cautelle for to enquyre and to axe questyons dyscrecyon for to gyue and enioyne penaunce or ellys he hym dysposeth vnto grete peryl as well of his saluacyon as of them that he confes+seth.
Also he ought to warne hy~ that he confesseth that he name not or acuse another persone thanne hymself yf the synne were not of suche condycyon that otherwyse it may not be sayd or declared he ought not to dyscende to moche in partyculer in the cyrcumstaunces of synnes and specyally of the synne of lechery For of that may come the letty~ge of conscyence as well in hymselfe as in other or to moche grete shame vnto hym the whiche is confes+sed how be it a man may hym warne to declare his synne so parfytly that his conscyence grutche hym not afterwarde in that that he hath not enty+erly confessed hym and with the cyrcumstau~ces whiche weren of necessyte and whan it cometh vn+to the ende of the confessyon that the synner hath parfytly tolde and declared his synnes by interrogacyons or other wyse than the confessour oughte hym to shewe the errour and the greuousnesse of his synnes.
And also the grace that god vnto hym hath done in that that he hath abyden hym to do penaunce and hym to loue fynally in good purpose yf vnto hym it be possyble And in good hope of the mercy of god and for some case or ceason he may not hym assoyle as for the case of excomyny~+ge or that he wyll not pardonne or seche pardonne or make restytucyon or other cases he hym ought to counseyll the forme and the manere to fynde his remedy and hym to reco~maunde vnto the sacred vyrgyn mary fou~tayne of pyte of mercy and of doynge ony good dedys.
For in soo doynge god hym shall the more soner helpe to fynde his remedyes.
Also yf confessour knoweth by ony sygnes or lokynges coniectures or by other waye that the synner sayeth not suffysauntly his synnes he hym ought than to warne not alonely one tyme but ma+ny that yf he leue ony thynge vnto his wyttynge his confessyon is no confessyon and synneth greuously.
And hym ought to warne to go to another confessour or to retorne to hym another tyme that he may haue other dyspocysyon.
Also be the confessour wyse and dyscrete that he enioyne not penaunce vnto the synner he wyll not receyue wylfully and the whiche is very semblable that he shal accomplysshe shewynge hym that yf by forgytful nesse or otherwyse he it wyll not accomplysshe af+ter that that he it excepteth and that he it may wel do he synneth greuously and is bounden in suche case to confesse hym Also neuer for synne secrete he ought not to gyue open penaunce.
And those the whiche ben confessed ought to kepe them well that by mockery malyce or other cursyd cause thenne they shewe not the secrete of confessyon for in soo doynge they synne greuously yf ony persone hy~ fele strongly roted in ony synne he may be bounde after good dyscrecyon vnto soules payne temporall in case that he retorne vnto his synne as is to swere without cause of lechery or of other syn+ne for somtyme many kepe theym well to retorne vnto synne for fere of the losse of .x. shelynges ye a peny or a halfe peny the whiche he kepeth not for the loue of god how be it it is a thynge pleasaunt vnto god whan the persone secheth the wayes and maners to correcte hym to punysshe his synnes for to please god his creatour but many ben blyndyd in the knowlege of the loue of god of the gre+uousnesse of synne and of the peryll of euyll custome of the payn of hell and of the glory of parady+se the whiche shall be more dylygent hym to make hole of the ache of a tothe than they do to remedy the thynge on the whiche hangeth theyr dampnacyon.
By the whiche it happeneth oftymes that su+che can not fynde remedy whan they it desyre and wolde for whan they it may well fynde they wyll not.
By these thynges before sayd it appereth clere+ly that the arte and scyence of well and Justly to examyne theyr conscyence vnto saluacyon as well of the confessour as of hym the whiche is confessed is of so hygh subtylyte and so strayt that it is not to byleue as by scyence humayne alonely or by stu+dy or clergy.
a man may well and iustley acquyte without synguler ayde of the blessed holy goost the whiche aydeth and techeth them the whiche by the ordynau~ce of the holy chirche ben in fere and in hu+mylyte for the charyte of poore soules receyuen the offyce of a confessour by ye contrary they the whiche by presumpcyon couetyse or ther other cause them iugen vnto suche offyce fallen in an in conuenyent of the whiche sayth our lorde that yf one blynde man ledeth an other both tweyne fallen in the dyche.
HEre foloweth more of the scyence and cyrcumspeccyon that he ought to haue the whiche excercyseth the offyce of a confessoure where as it is so ye the confessour is iuge of the co~scyence of ye synner before that he may gyue good sentence it behoueth that he haue knowlege dyscrecyon in aduysynge yf the synne be mortall or ve+nyall.
And therfore some what to vnderstonde the dyfference of synne it is well to be noted that holy chirche hath two maner of co~maundementes.
The fyrst maner vnto vs is ordeyned duely as well agey+ne god as agayne his neyghbour And they ben na+med the .x. commaundementes of the lawe of the whiche hath ben treatyd before of the whiche it is to knowe that euery persone the which hath wytte age and dyscressyon and that by delyberacyon fully consentynge or equyualent trespasseth ony of the .x. commaundementes synneth mortally For he breketh charyte the whiche is the lyfe spyrytuall of the soule and the meane to loue god and oure neyghbour And he may not be excused by ygnoraunce for yf he doute in ony case partyculer touchynge the commaundementes of god he ought to be enformed by the~ the whiche haue the fere of god and knowlege of the lawe and not to put hym in ye peryll of transgressyon and to synne mortally. for other wyse sayen these doctours of holy scrypture that suche a persone dyspyseth god and his saluacyon.
The whiche thynge may not be in creature resonable without gylt of dedely synne.
The se+conde maner of the commaundementes ben ordynaunces and statutes humayne.
As of prelates of holy chirche or other lordes the whiche may haue auctoryte to make lawes and ordynaunces yt these subiectes ought to kepe and accomplysshe after ye true intencyon of theyr souerayns.
But the transgressyon of suche ordynau~ces shall not be alwayes dedely synne yf it were not for the dyspysynge of them the whiche haue made the sayd ordynaunces or commaundement or for to moche grete nota+ble exces in thynge the whiche of hymself is but ve+nyall synne yf it were not the sayd exces or conte~ne+ment.
And therfore ryght syngulerly it is to be noted that neuer man ne ought to Juge that ony syn+ne be mortall yf it be not co~myttyd by delyberacyon full consent as sayth his equyualent.
And say equyualent for as moche that many synnen by habytacyon of custome or of a contempte in the whi+che they ben blyndyd by such maner that it semeth not vnto them that they dyspose them or that they gyue theyr consent in many thynges whiche ben vnprouffytable The whiche alwayes after some doctours ben sy~nes dedely. as ye custome to swere for no thyng and without cause resonable or to do vn+dyscretly agayne the co~maundementes of the souerayns And this is for a rule generall as well for these thynges before sayd as for these that folowen also the confessour ought to dyscerne aduyse yf the synner be fallen in to sentence excome~+ged or interdyted for in that may ry~ne as well cler+kes as laye people or yf he be suspended or irreguler the whiche is alonely as vnto clerkes For yf he be excomenged the confessour may not hym assoyle sacramentally tyll vnto that that he be losed and assoyled of the sayd sentence¬∑ And therfore the con+fessour ought to take hede yf he haue auctoryte or not or yf the absolucyon appertayn vnto the pope or vnto the bysshop or vnto a nother Juge ecclesy astycall to the entent to counseyll the synner as he ought to fynde his remedy Also he ought to dyscerne bytwene the dyuers espyces and maners of synne mortall.
For it suffyseth not hym to confesse in generall but hym behoueth to tell the cyrcu~stau~+ces of them the whiche may gretely greue or chau~+ge the synne in to dyuers espyces.
That yf the confessour is soo lytell knowynge that he fuffyseth not to dyscerne the synnes and the cyrcumstau~ces of theym as it is sayd the synner ought to confesse hym to another yf he be not in suche wyse lettred or by other meane soo dyscrete that he may supply the in suffysau~ce of his confessour.
Also more ouer it is sayd that the confessour ought to conne dyscerne and knowe yf these bataylles of prynces ben Juste or vniuste And also of taxes imposycyons subsydes or other exaccyons yf it be rauen or not Also of sellynges of byenges or other contractes yf they ben Just or vniuste.
For otherwyse he may not Justely enioy ne restytucyon the whiche is of the ne+cessyte of the true absolucyon.
Also he ought to ha+ue knowlege of of testame~tes of cases of sy+mony vseryes and of other dyffycultes the whyche oftymes come in the dede of confessyon.
And if he be not suffycyent to know dyscerne and Juge of thynges before sayd and enforme or replenysshe the synner vnto more knowynge for to shewe hys remedyes.
For ellys it is vnto ye grete peryll of da~p+nacyon as well of hymself as of them that he co~fesseth as also of them the whiche hym gaue the of fyce or the whiche may or sholde proue yf he excer+cyse confessyons.
Therfore sayth the holy euangelyst that yf one blynde man lede another both two fallen in to the dyche.
And it is to vnderstonde yt how be it that by the consecracyon of presthode eue+ry preste receyueth the keyes of the Jurysdyccyon and of the puyssau~ce to assoyle how be it he may not them excercyse yf he haue not mater subgecte that is the people of holy chirche.
And therfore¬∑ it behoueth that he haue auctoryte of comen ryght as is our holy fader ye pope these bysshoppes or their diocesains these curates in theyr parysshynges or that he hath the sayd auctoryte by preuylege or ly+cence of one of these thre before sayd or that the sy~+ner hath lycence or preuylege to these a confessour wyse and dyscrete or elles yf the absolucyon be ma+de without iurysdyccyon that sholde not be a true absolucyon but they synnen mortally as well the prest as he the whiche is confessed whan they it holely.
Also it is good to be noted yt after a doctour named Austen of anchone or presumpcyon of the wyll of hym vnto whiche it aper+teyneth to gyue Jurysdyccyon to confesse hath not power nor place in suche case for it sholde folowe that the absolucyon of the synnes sholde dyspence of a thynge the whiche may be or not be the whiche in certaynte may not be a true absolucyon.
In lyke wyse as it appereth by the reasons of ye sayd doctour here put and noted in wytnes of this layd boke.
Here folowen cases of the whiche the absolucyon is reserued vnto the pope the whiche they ought to knowe and to note the whiche heren the confessyons.
AFter the resolucyon of doctours euery persone the whiche stryketh malycyously ony clerke relygyous man or relegyous woman in su+che maner that the stroke or the betynge after the ryght may be sayd cruell and wrongfull is excomunycate of sentence papall.
Also who so bre~neth ony holy place or of relegyon falleth and renneth in sentence papall after that the bysshoppe dyocesayn hym denou~ceth excomunycate but before the sayd denou~cyacyon the bysshop hym may assoyle who soo brenneth places or houses prophanes is not excomunycate tyll vnto the tyme that the bysshop hym maketh to be denou~ced for suche causes and afterwarde he may not be assoyled but by the auctoryte of the pope.
Also yf it be to falsefye the letters of the pope in theym puttynge or takynge out one letter one poynt or one mynyme or so vse suche letters malycyously is excomunycate of the sentence papall.
Also all those the whiche ben parteners vnto a cryme by the which ony persone hath ronne in sentence papall in geuynge ayde co~forte or fauour vnto the sayd cryme they renne in sembla+ble sentence and also ben those that them receyuen wyttyngly vnto the sacramentes of the chirche or vnto sepulture ecclesyastycall.
Also all they the whi+che maken or promesses with money for to haue Justyce or ony graces be it for hymself or for other be it in causes or in Jugementes or for to obteyne letters of the holy syege apostolycall or who so vseth or Joyeth wyttyngly of letters or of graces so graunted is acursyd of sentence papall by the extrauagant of Bonyface the .viii.
Also who so receyueth the benefyces of holy chirche or holy orders by symonye is cursyd is the case of the po+pe by ye extrauagant of ye pope Martin Also who so goth vnto ye holy by deuocyon or other without lycence of the pope is acursyd is the case of the pope.
Also those the whiche cutte bake or melte the body of ony deed persone without lycence of ye pope ben acursyd of sentence papall by ye extraua+gant of Bonyface.
Also they the whiche enforce ony prest to synge in place interdyted or the which calleth them that ben interdyted or acursyd to here ye masse or to receyue the sacrament or the whiche prohibyton defenden that they the whiche ben excomunycate or interdyted goo not oute of the chirche after the commaundement that vnto them is made ben excomynynge.
And also those the whi+che ben warned and go not out and is the case of the pope.
Also all relegyous men the whiche admy+nystren vnto seculers the sacramentes of the awter of maryage or of the laste vnccyon without the ly+cence of hym vnto whome it aperteyneth ben excomynynge and is the case of the pope Also the in quesytor of the fayth the whiche by hate or by loue or by fauour or otherwyse letteth to procede after god and good conscyence agayne ony heretyke or the whiche putteth cursydly the cryme of heresy vn+to ony man or ellys who some euer that letteth ma+lycyously the offyce of the sayd inquysycyon ben all excomunycate and is the case of the pope.
Also yf ony relegyous professed in the order of beggers without dyspensacyon hym putteth in to another relygyon excepte of the chartre is acursyd of ye pope by the constytucyon of constaunce.
And also the sethe whiche wyttyngly hym receyuen. also euery clerke whiche with his good wyll vnto his know+lege co~moneth in ony of the sacramentes of holy chirche with them the whiche ben acursyd of the se~tence of the pope.
Also who so euer taketh parte vn+to a cryme by whiche ony persone is excomunyca+te by ony of the maners before sayd or in the sacramentes of holy chirche rennen in semblable sen+tence.
Also who so euer hym maketh to be assoyled in the artycle of deth of ony sentence of cursynge or of other payne canonycall be it of the pope or of the bysshop or of other Juge ecclesyastycall and escapeth from the sayd peryll artycle he is boun de hym to represent vnto hym whiche hym may assoyle as some that after the sayd artycle or peryll he shall haue oportunyte vnto that he dothe in the case of the sayd sentence after the Jugement and dyscrecyon of the absoluant or other wyse he agayne falleth in to the same maner of sentence wherof he hath ben assoyled in the sayd artycle of deth But another thynge it sholde be of the absolucyon sacramentall of synnes of whiche he hath ben assoyled in the sayd artycle For he shall not be bounde of necessyte hym to reconfesse notwithstan+dynge that the absolutyon apparteyne vnto the po+pe or vnto the bysshop.
Also these herytykes and they the whiche vnto them gyuen ayde socours or comfort ben acursyd and is the case of the pope.
Also all preestes ben they regulers or seculers the whiche warnen ony persone to swere to vowe or to promes in good fayth or otherwyse that he shall chese his sepulture in theyr chirche or that neuer he shall neuer reuoke he lately bounde to chese ben ex+comunycate and may not be assoyled but of auctoryte of our holy fader the pope excepte in the artycle of deth mo and many other sentences papal+les ben in ryght and in customes of the whiche he+re passe as at this tyme for by cause of shortnes and also for the pyteous hope that haue that our moder holy chirche therin shall fynde remedy and that in short tyme For he that well shall practyse an hundreth thyrty and foure cases of excomunycacyon the whiche ben in ryght after as reherseth rectoriu~ Juris and them conferme with the symo+nyacles and other excomunycacyons for the twenty fulmynacyons that they make at this daye comen+ly.
Also thorowe all crystyante as well for the losse of goodes temporalles as for other occasyons may he knowe clerely that the whiche the apostle sayth vpon the apocalypse.
That is to knowe that in ye tyme of Antecryste well nere all the worlde shalbe acursyd and that that the whiche other tymes ha+the ben ordeyned for remedy for the correccyon of synners.
That is at this days conuerted in the occasyon of ye dampnacyon of humayne By these thynges before sayd appereth how those the whyche herynge confessyons ought to haue grete dyscre+cyon and for the whiche cases they ought to consyder with these iurystes with these theologyens.
OF the cases reserued vnto the bysshop as well of ryght as of au~cyent custome there ben .ix.
That is to knowe foure of ryght and .v. of auncyent custome.
The fyrst is the synne by the which ony derke sholde be irryguler the whiche may come in four maners fyrst whan ony man receyueth vnto his knowlege holy orders by symonye in suche case the pope and none other may dyspence.
Secondely whan ony clerke receyueth holy orders as he the whiche is not of the dyoses nor hath not loue of his dyocesayn suche is irryguler yf the bysshop hath defended vpon payn of cursy~+ge none other dyoses receyue orders of hym than suche irryguler may be dyspenced but of ye auctory of the pope but yf the bysshop hath not hym de+fended he there may than dyspence.
Thyrdly whan ony clerke excercyseth the offyce yt he hath not yet receyued.
Fourthly whan ony preest acursyd of the grete curfynge suspended or enterdyted syngeth masse in suche estate.
The seconde case reserued to these byssoppes is of them the whiche brennen ma+lycyously ony chirche or there make the brekynge of ony dores or the wyndowes of the vestry of the walle or of couerture the whiche the bysshop may assoyle yf that before he them hath not denou~ced or made to denou~ce cursynge for yf it were so they may not be assoyled but of the auctoryte of ye pope The thyrde case of synne is wherfore the penau~ce ought to be ioyned alonely for synne grete horry+ble they shall be dynulged as man slawghter af+ter the custome of some dyoses the synne of ye frendes by dyffaulte wherof theyr chyldern dyen perysshynge or ben strangled in the bedde or otherwyse The fourth case reserued vnto the bysshoppes after the ryght is the synne by the which a man renneth in the sentence of cursynge as to smyte a clerke ma+lycyously not wrongfully for than the absolucyon sholde aperteyne vnto the pope other cases ther ben many of the whiche the confessour ought to be well aduysed hy~ enforme desyrously as well by studye as by cou~seyl practyse of these lawers.
The fyrst of the .v. cases of auncyent customes is homicide vo+lu~tary the .ii. of those whiche falsen ye letters of ye pope or wyttyngly vsen of suche letters false the thyrde of them whiche breken lybertes of holy chirche as those the whiche enforce the people of ye chirche to pay taxes watches subsydes or passages agayne theyr wyll without leue ordynau~ce of prelates.
The fourth of them the whiche breken innunyte preuylege of ye chirche in place halowed as done they the¬∑ whiche taken wylfully ony persone in the chirche or chirchyerde in takynge hym out of the frau~chyse wtout the ordynau~ce of Justyce or the whiche there maken ony fraccyon as it is sayd before.
The fyfth is of sorcyers and denyns a doctour named John~ Andrew sayth that many other cases ben reserued vnto bysshoppes as is to blasfeme god and his sayntes of them also whi+che maken maryages is to say agayn the prohibycyon of holy chirche and without sole~p+nyte that vnto that appertayneth.
Also of all grete and horryble cases after that they ben publysshed Also of fals wytnesses in Jugementes of synne dy~+ceste as to haue company carnal of his moder or of his kynred or affynyte it is a semblable thy~ge of the woman as of ye man Also of the synne of lechery with a nonne or with a woman that hath auowed ony relygyon approued or with bestes Al+so of them that breken theyr maryages in lyke wyse other cases yt the bysshoppes may retayne for good cause but as sayth hostyence to reserue many cases it is vnto ye preiudyce of curates there may come more grete lettynge of saluacyon of soules grete prouffyte therfore he concludeth that these curates may assoyle of all cases excepte these .ix. be+fore sayd and that it vnto them be not defended in ryght by some specyal inhybycyon or custome ap+proued but as to regarde of these freers minours or prechours the whiche ben lawfully presented noo man ought to doubte but that they may assoyle of all cases excepte these .ix. before sayd the whiche ben reserued of ryght or of custome for gloses or opiny+ons dyuerses of doctours they ought not to be receyued ne to haue place in this mater agayne the wyll and expresse declaracyon of the holy syege ap+postolycall.
For it is clere and ryghtfull that ye leste and the moost was may not restrayne ordyuynys she the preuylege statute and ordynaunce of hys souerayne.
Now is it so that the pope Benedic. the xi. and Eugeny the fourth they haue confermed the opynyon of Raymunde the whiche putteth foure cases of ryght and fyue of custome as it is sayd that that he hath wryten in the .vii. of the decretalles.
That is to vnderstonde that these relygyous may not assoyle of cases reserued vnto these bysshoppes that ought to be vnderstonde of them that ben reserued of ryght.
In lyke wyse as it appereth by the decretal the whiche begynneth.
Dudum. but yf these concilles sinodaux or by the statutes or ordynaunces prouyncyalles some synne was defended vpon the payne of cursynge these freers before sayd may not them assoyle.
For the absolucyon of cursynge apperteyneth of ryght vnto these bysshop+pes excepte these the whiche ben reserued vnto the holy fader.
Also it is well to be noted that the preste the whiche receyueth wyttyngly the persone acursed of the grete cursynge to here the offyce of ye chirche or ony of the sacramentes or sepulture ecclesyastycall synne mortally and is suspended of all ad+mynystracyon ecclesyastycall and he is enterdyted of the entre of the chirche and yf he synge in suche estate he is irryguler and yf he so dye he ought not to be buryed in holy place.
Also yf ony take parte with these excomunycate in spekynge or in etyng or in drynkynge or in gretynge them in dyspysy~ge the prohybycyon of holy chirche he synneth mor+tally is acursyd of the lasse cursynge of the why+che sentence he may well be assoyled of his curate yf of suche case he hath contrycyon suffycyent and these doctours sayen that suche absolucyon of the lasse excomunytate ought to procede the absolucyo~ sacramentall of other synnes vnder suche forme Ego te absoluo a sentencia minoris excomunicaci+onis siue minorum excomunicacionum et hocsi sit plures Item eadem auctoritate Ego absoluo te a peccatis tuis In patris et fil et spiritus san+ti amen) And the reason to holde this forme is for as moche that they the whiche ben in some sentence be not parteners of the sacramentes of holy chir+che from whome the sacrament is enhybyt tyl vn+to that that they ben loused of the sayd sentence In lyke wyse as it appereth by the ryght.
Also it is to be noted yt some may well be assoyled of paynes canonycalles as ben excomunye suspencyon interdyte or irrygularyte without that he were as+soyled sacramentally of his synnes of the one of the sayd paynes abydynge bou~de of other yf he were bounde of many but so is it not of the absolucyon sacramentall In the whiche he behoueth to be assoyled of all his synnes or of one The causes and reasons wherfore a man may not comen with these that ben acursyd without in ye sentence be conteyned in this vers.
Hec anathema quidem fa unt ne possit obesse) That is to say for the grete vti+lite be it of hym that is a cursyd or of hym yt speketh wt hym or for the bonde of maryage or wha~ ony is subiecte vnto the cursynge or whan a man hathe not knowlege of hym that is acursyd or wha~ there is necessyte couenable to speke or to comyne with these cursyd it is not defended vpon payne of synne ne of other sentence.
THre maner of penau~ce ben as well in ryght as in custome.
That is to vnderstonde ope~ penaunce solempne penau~ce and penau~ce secrete or sacramentall penaunce open penau~ce is that whiche is done openly for synnes grete vnlawfull the whiche hath ben co~mytte openly but suche penaunce ought not at this daye to be enioyned yf it be not done alonely in the towne or cyte in the whiche than he shall recede the court of Rome or the holy concylle after as sayth mayster wyllyam Durande the scot for as moche that of suche penau~ce may sooner come sclander than prouffyte edyfycacyon of soules therfore a man shold pu+nysshe them whiche for to begge trewande go thorowe the worlde all naked betynge hym self be+fore the people affermynge yt vnto the~ it hath ben enioyned by penau~ce in whiche they lyen falsely cursydly penau~ce sole~pne is yt a man begy~neth the assewenesdaye with grete mysterys the which ought not to be gyuen but for grete synnes open wrongfull and it apperteyneth alonely vnto the bysshop for to gyue it or vnto hym the whiche hym representeth.
The forme and maner to enioyne also to do suche penaunce is wryten in the ryght But oftymes the custome hurteth the ryghtes: and therfore in some dyocyses men vse not suche penau~+ce And in these other men vse them in many and dyuers maners.
They whiche geuen open penau~+ce or solempne for synne the whiche is knowen yt is to vnderstonde the whiche is not comen vnto the knowlege of all them of the towne or of the more parte aren and fayllen gretly as other tymes it ha+the ben sayd of these poore nouryces the which fyn+den theyr chylde dede by them or in the cradyll wt out that that they may knowe the cause or lest of suche aduenture the whiche oftymes may happen without the gylte of the fader or of the moder penaunce sacramentall is done secretly and of all ma+ner of synnes ben they open or secrete and it maye be with drawen by as many tymes as the synner a bydynge in this present lyfe falleth agayne in sy~ne And it is the pryncypall intencyon of this fourth partye of this presentbook.
And of this penaunce sayth saynt Austen. that it is more worth to a perso+ne the whiche is in synne to make a good and an entyer confessyon than to go in pylgrymage vnto all the holy places that ben vpon erth.
For without that no creature may recouer saluacyon nor also with that to goo vnto dampnacyon.
And therfore take hede desyrously euery poore synner the which is in the domynacyon of the deuyll in the mater and in these chapytres the whiche folowen.
¬∂Here foloweth four thynges that the synner ought to do for to begynne well his confessyon.
THe persone the whiche desyreth so excellent a werke as is to puryfye hym from fynne. and to be reduced vnto god by true and entyer con+fessyon ought to do foure thynges In lyke wyse as techeth mayster Peter de aquila and also done these other theologyens comenly.
The fyrst is effectuously to thynke on his lyfe after as sayeth ho+ly scrypture.
shall me remembre shall thyn+ke on my lyfe before the face of my god in bytter+nes and dyspleasure that haue hym offended euery persone ought to put also grete dylygence payne to remembre hym of all his synnes for to haue dyspleasure as he sholde be for to thy~ke a gre+te gayne temporall or as he sholde be to kepe him from losse for yf by sloweth neglygence to thyn+ke of his synnes he leueth one or many with oute confessynge and yf he dye in suche estate there is ex+treme peryll of dampnacyon nother thynge it shall be whan he hathe done his delygence after ye debylyte of stragylyte humayn to remembre hym of all his synnes and¬∑ that notwithstondynge suche dylygence he forgetteth one or many for it is a conclucyon certayne that euery persone the why+che doth that that in hym is to remembre hym of his synnes for to haue dyspleasure god hym shall gyue knowlege or the~ hym shall pardon as vnto the peryll of dampnacyon eternall In the whiche it appereth that no persone is dampned but by his owne defaute.
The seconde thynge that synner ought to do before his confessyon is to haue dyspleasure of euery synne yt he hath co~mytted ageyn god his creatour and he ought to be certayne that the offence of euery dedely synne is as grete as is the maieste and bou~te of hym the whiche is pryncy+pally offended that is god the whiche is good in fynyte.
The thyrde thyng is that the synner ought to haue purpose moeuynge the ayde of god neuer to co~mytte dedely synne for in lyke wyse as he the whiche hath true contrycyon of his synnes pryncy+pally for the loue of god and in purpose to confesse hym in place and in tyme dewe and competent is in the estate of grace In lyke wyse by the contrary yf ony creature hadde done all the good dedys of the worlde and neuer durynge his lyfe hath co~mytted dedely synne other than to haue alonely intencyon to sy~ne in tyme to come he shall be forth with by that cursyd wyll in the estate of dedely syn+ne and in the waye of dampnacyon.
The fourth thynge is that the synner ought to make prayer to god his creatour that he hym gyue to haue knowlege of his synnes and grace for to make confessy+on the whiche vnto hym may be pleasaunt vnto the helth of his soule prouffytable.
Here foloweth of them the whiche may lawful+ly assoyle as also of them the whiche may chose a confessour.
THe synner the whiche desyreth to do so excellent a werke as is to puryfye hym from all synne by true confessyon and hym reduce vnto god his creatour after these foure thynges before sayd done and accomplysshed he ought to seche chese a confessoure the whiche is suffycyent for to declare hym the dyffycultes of his cases as many be of bequestes of vowes of testamentes of restytucyons of sentence of excomunycacyon of irrygu+larytes of suspensyons or of interdytynges and so of other agayne the cases the whiche oftymes is fou~de in the dede of For as saynt Austen sayeth the synner sholde at the leste do for the lyfe and helth of his soule that that he doth ryght dylygently for the helth of his body nowe is it soo that they the whiche ben syke corporally and pry~cypally they that a man certefyeth to be in dau~ger of deth sechen the best medycyne and the moost experte that they may fynde for to recouer theyr helthe and for to escape the deth by the whiche it appe+reth the syke hurte spyrytually of tymes of more than of a thousande mortall synnes sholde be desy+rous to fynde a good medycyne spyrytuall for to eschewe the deth of helle the whiche is eternall su+che medycyne spyrytuall is a gostely fader or a co~fessour the whiche hath cunnynge suffycyent hym to examen of dyuers cases as it is sayd.
Also that he hath Jurysdyccyon and puyssaunce to assoyle the synner for elles yf he haue not Jurysdyccyon puyssaunce he synneth ryght greuously in assoy+lynge And also doethe he the whiche hathe with hym suche a folysshe chapelayn hym confessynge wyttyngly and there he hath not the true absolucyon.
Also it is to be noted that vacabons the why+che haue no resydence marchau~tes the whiche ben out of theyr contree pylgrymes or they the which passen the contree for to seche dwellynge may be as+soyled of the curate of the parysshe in whome they haue deuocyon to confesse them for in suche cases they ben of that parysshe where they abyde as for to receyue the sacrament of confessyon and absolucyon of all these cases of the whiche these curates may assoyle theyr subiectes by the conseque~t these freres mynours or prechours the whiche lawfully be presented vnto the bysshoppes as yf it soo be that they haue of comen ryght in that power to assoyle as haue these curates.
Also in lyke wyse as the curate may assoyle his subiecte as well in hys parysshe as with out In semblable wyse may doo these aboue sayd relegyons agayne them of the dio+cyse where they haue be presented otherwyse theyr preuylege shall be restaynt the whiche thynge the ryght wyll not suffre than whan the synner is dys+posed as it is sayd and he hath fou~de a chapelay+ne the whiche hath iurysdyccyon and power to assoyle as sholde oure holy fader the pope the whyche hath power pleanere and generall to assoyle all them of crystyente and of all cases without ony to be except or the bysshop vpon all them of his bysshopryche of all cases except those the whiche ben reserued vnto the pope or curate the whiche may assoyle his parysshynges of all cases the whiche be not reserued by ryght or by custome vnto the pope or vnto the bysshop or vnto other preestes reguler or seculer the whiche by co~myssyon generall or spe+cyally and auctoryte with lycence of the one of thre before sayd.
That is to knowe of the pope of the bysshop or of the curate Also that the sayd sy~+ner hath loue or preuylege generall or specyall to chese a confessour idoniu~ than he ought to tell and declare vnto confessour all his synnes euery one in pertyculer so as god vnto hym shall gyue know+lege and also the cyrcumstaunces the whiche may chaunge the synne in to dyuers maners.
As in the synne of thefte a man ought to take hede yf he be culpable of vseryes of symonyes of fals weyghtes of mesures of rauens or sacryleges for they whiche wyttyngly and by malyce alonely accuse them alonely of thefte and they haue co~mytted sa+crylege extorcyon or vsery they be not well confes+sed but they synne mortally In lyke wyse is it of the synne of lechery for who so hym accuseth of for+nycacyon hath co~mytted auoutry or incest defloracyon or sacrylege so of these other espyces they be not confessed they synnen mortally and therfore the persone the whiche is confessed ought to tell clerely his case yf he be sy~ple confessour hy~ ought to declare his greef hardnes of hys case Here folowen .x. poyntes by one of the whiche or many the confessyon may be no thynge also instruccyon for to examen well hym the whiche is in the sacrament of maryage.
AFter these thynges before sayd the persone that wyll make good confessyon vnto the helth of his souleought well to take hede vnto the+se .x. poyntes that folowen for by one of them or by many co~fessyon may be no thynge.
The fyrst is yt he be not in ye sentence of cursyng for yf it we+re so holy chirche hath no power hym to assoyle of ony mortall synne tyll vnto that that he be loused For otherwyse he is not partener of the sacramentes of holy chirche.
The seconde poynt is yt the syn+ner ought to take hede to make conscyence there it ought to be made and not to make it where it ou+ght not to be made.
i¬∑ poyntes the confessyon may be nothynge and oft tymes it happeneth vnto many that they make no conscyence in the case of vseryes of symonyes of gyftes the whiche they make otherwyse than by ly+berall loue.
Also of cursyd wylles dysposed to synne mortall whan they haue not put them in effect nor that they haue lefte that to do for the loue or fe+re of god but alonely for fere worldely or fere tobe dampned or elles that they haue not had place tyme oportunyte Also as not to haue co~plysshed the werkes of mercy in place in tyme as a man is bou~de by the co~maundement of god and vpon the payne of dedely synne ye whiche thynge is har+de vnto symple people to vnderstonde but by dys+crecyon good aduysement of the co~fessours after the doctryne of the treatyse precedent of the werkes of mercy.
Also he hath taught and corrected them that a man is bounde to correcte in place and in tyme.
Also whan a man oweth lawfully ony thynge And that a man hath well power to pay it and he vnto whome a man oweth it willeth and requyreth to be payed the dettour hath not of Justyce excusacyon that he sholde not and may paye than suche redeuable is contynually in the estate of dedely synne and may not be assoyled yf he haue not wyll to acquyte hym as sone as he may And here appereth the culpe of many symple and ygnoraunt confessours the whiche of these cases other semblables they do not make conscyence vn+to them that they assoylen who many and ofte ty+mes owen to poore people the whiche by the defau+te of theyr payment ben gretely da~maged In the whiche case they be to recompense theym The thyrde poynt is that the synner ought to take hede that the confessyon be entyer in leuynge no+thynge to his wyttynge or by defaute to doo that that is in hym after as it hath ben sayd here befo+re for he that dooth not his deuoyre after as it is in the flagelyte humayne and soo by his defaute forgoten one or many of his synnes the whiche he ought to confesse all in partyculer his confessyon is not hole And in this poynt make grete doubte of the confessyon of them the whiche by theyr de+faute take no hede vnto the co~maundementes of god for to acco~plysshe them for to kepe hy~ from synne also hym to accuse co~fesse of transgres+syon of them the whiche they myght haue lerned vnderstonde in one daye or in tweyne for well and suffycyently them to confesse for euer all theyr lyfe. for the more clerely to vnderstonde this peryll this defaute a man may consyder ye persone whi+che is of .xxx. yere hath a.
M. v. c. thre score so~da+yes in the whiche he hath ben defended all erthely werkes that hym may lette to thynke on god and of his benefyces for to thanke hym.
And also he ought to lerne these thynges necessary vnto his sou+le and to thynke on his conscyence and on his syn+nes for to confesse hym worthely.
And for as moche as the more grete party of bodely people done yll theyr deuoure on the sondayes and the feestes to thynke on theyr co~scyences they can not be confessed as in generall where they sholde be co~+fessed in partyculer yf he holde it not in theyr defau+te.
Nowe is it wryten as well in ryght as in reaso~ that none ought to haue prouffyte of his cryme defaute And therfore it excedeth myn vnderstan+dynge reason yf suche confessyons ben vylable be+fore god the whiche thynge leue in the depnesses of Jugementes dyuyne.
The fourth poynt that synner ought to take hede that he tell all that wher+of he hath mynde vnto one confessour and not vn+to tweyne or vnto many for yf vnto his wytrynge he one parte vnto one and parte vnto another malycyouslly he synneth mortally and he shall not be assoyled of the one ne of the other.
But yf by ony case he were sent agayne vnto the souerayne it shall suffyce to tell the case wherfore he hath ben sent agayne so that he hath all tolde vnto the fyrst The fyfth poynt is that he ought to be aduysed parfytly yf he be redy to pardon with good herte the yll wyll vnto them yt haue hym offended For as sayth oure sauyour in euangelyste. yf we pardon not vnto oure malefactours the rancour that we haue agayn the~ god shal not pardon vs in lyke wyse he that hath offended ony persone in worde or in dede he oughte to requyre pardon in dede yf he be present or to be in ferme purpose that to do it place and in tyme whan he shall fynde oportuny+te.
The .vi. poynt as vnto regarde of people why+che ben in maryage as in two poyntes.
The fyrst is how they haue receyued the sacrament of marya+ge.
The seconde is of the maner how they ben go+uerned as vnto the fyrst it is to knowe that after the ordenau~ce holy chirche none may take in ma+ryage his kynnesman or his kynneswoman but that one of the party be at the leest at the fyght degre of the whiche degrees the broder and syster make ye fyrst the chyldern whiche ben germay~s make the seconde.
The chylder of these germay~s the whiche ben called remoued maketh the thyrde.
And the remoued from the remoued maketh the fyfth and he that is sayd fyfth may haue in ma+ryage her of the seconde of the thyrde and of the fourth and so consequently in lyne for neuer may ony haue in maryage hym or her the whiche is in ryght lyne be it in assendynge or dys+cendynge and yf ony be maryed wyttyngly wyth ony of his lygnage vnder the degrees before sayd he synneth mortally and more ouer he is acursyd And it is to be noted that by habycyon carnall in fornycacyon is of affynyte with all them of the lynage as well of the one parte as of the other in the same degre the whiche appertayne the~ the whiche co~mytten suche fornycacyon an example.
Thou conyt test fornycacyon with a woma~ all hyr systers naturalles ben thy systers by affyny+te her neces ben thy neces her germayns ben thy germayns.
And so of other and a lyke thynge is it of the woman as in regarde of a fornycatour they may neuer mary with the frendes of the one ne of the other and yf they mary them wyttyngly they ben acursyd they ought to be departed notwithstondynge ony space of tyme or of what soo euer lyne that he be comen from suche maryage a+nother thynge it sholde be yf after the maryage le+gytyme of some they haue company carnall the woman of the kynred of her husbonde or the husbonde of the kynred of his wyfe for the maryage shall not be departed.
But the partye culpable fal+leth in to suche inconuenyent that he may neuer re+quyre the deuoyr of maryage vnto the partye yf he be not fyrst dyspenced with of the auctoryte of the pope but that he synne mortally.
But the party the whiche is not culpable hym ought to yelde with the dyspleasaunce the whiche may fall in suche ca+se and than the partye culpable synneth not mortally yf he haue not other dysordynau~ce and so it is good counseyll that suche persone conspable suche is dyspensacyon of the pope for to eschew the peryl+les the whiche may come by cause of suche lettynge Also he ought to take hede vnto the lygnage spyry+tuall the whiche cometh amonge many persones by cause of the sacrament of baptem or of confyrmacyon that is to knowe bytwene the chylde bap+tysed and them the whiche holden and bytwene these chyldern naturall ben they borne before or af+ter For the sone or the doughter of ony persone may neuer be maryed or marye with the chyldern naturalles of theyr godfader or godmoder but the godfaders and godmoders well may mary theyr other chyldern togyder of whome the gossypred is not comen many other cases he may haue by cau+se of cognacyon legall and of the affynyte yt men call Justyce dyshoneste openly the whiche passe by cause of shortnes.
Also a man ought not to ma+ry from the begynnynge of the aduent tyll vnto ye vtas of the epephanie.
Also from the septuagesime tyll vnto the vtas of Ester.
Also from ye thre days before ye Assencyon tyll vnto the vtas of Pentecost And he yt dooth other wyse without dyspensacyon he synneth mortallly and this is as vnto the fyrst poynt of the sacrament of maryage.
AS vnto the seconde poynt the whiche is of the gouernynge of the persone maryed in regarde of his sacrament of maryage it is to vnderstonde that after as these doctours declaren the werke of maryage may be accomplysshed in fyue maners some tyme merytoryously somtyme with out synne somtyme with synne venyall somtyme with suche cyrcu~staunces that these theologyens doubten of mortall or venyall somtyme it is mor+tall synne fyrst the werke of maryage may be acco~+plysshed merytoryously whan ye one of ye partyes or both .ii. togyder ben in ye estate of grace theyr intencyo~ is to haue lyne or to yelde ye maryage ye one with the other or to eschewe the peryll of auoutry in hym or in her partye and in kepynge the cyrcu~staunces the whiche appertayne vnto the honeste of maryage whan it is synne there is doute of mor+tall or venyall the good and suffycyent confessour it may comprehende by the cyrcu~staunces of the de+de of the intencyon and of the confessyon of people maryed.
But in seuen maners a man may syn+ne mortally with her party after as declaren these doctours.
The fyrst is suche whan the man also ye woman ben so moche dysordynate that they wyllen by delyberacyon accomplysshe the werke of ma+ryage with party the whiche is not his by maryage and this case is here harde to Juge as vnto iu+gement humayn But god the whiche is Juge of conscyence seeth clerely the troweth.
The seconde case in the whiche he is in daunger of synne mortal is whan the one partye refuseth the other withoute excusacyon lefull.
The thyrde case is whan ye man abused of his partye for to seche more greter pleasure carnall.
The fourth whan the woman is not in dyspocysyon of her body that she sholde yelde the deuoyre of maryage and his partye the whiche hath of it knowlege is so moche vnresonable that he wyll not hym abstayn than synneth he mortal+ly after as sayen comenly these doctours but the woman the whiche obeyeth agayne her wyll for to eschewe the daungers of incontynence or other yl les the whiche may come in maryage synneth not The fyfth is whan these people maryed goo vnto theyr wyues in these grete festes after as sayen some doctours how be it saynt Thomas sayeth the synne is not mortall and the deuoute doctour Bonauenture and also the doctour subtyle the scotte holden that opynyon for the chirche he defendeth not the werke of maryage in these feestes but alo+nely counseylleth that a man absteyn hym to the ende that they be the better dysposed to praye vnto god for of as moche as a man putteth the more his herte in pleasures carnalles of as moche is a man the lesse dysposed to praye vnto god and the more ferther fro~ his loue they ought to make suche ab+stynence of a comen assent In lyke wyse as techeth saynt Poul and yf the one of the sayd partyes wyll not absteyne the other partye there ought to obe ye without fermynge conscyence erronyous as yf the partye beleueth that it were dedely synne to obeye in her partye in the dede of maryage in the tyme of grete solempnyte and neuerthelesse that notwith+standynge hym she obeyeth than she synneth mor+tally alonely for as moche as she dooth contrary to her conscyence the whiche is erronyous to byleue as to obeye in her partye in the sayd tyme is dedely synne.
The .vi. whan the werke of maryage is commytted in place halowed as is the chirche or chirchyerde yf these partyes maryed may otherwyse company togyders and yf the case were kno+wen the chirche or chirchyarde sholde be reconsyled after the ryght.
The seuenth is whan the woman is with chylde and nere her tyme and they haue by some experyence or true semblable that the chylde may renne in ony peryll neuerthelesse by theyr incontynence they dyspose them vnto suche pareyl they synnen mortally after some doctours and vn to that purpose haue founde other tymes a man maryed that by sorowe and remors of conscyence sought remedy and counseyll of that that his wy+fe hath hadde foure or fyue chyldern all deed fayr grete and well formed the whiche knowe not the cause ne ye occasyon of ye dethe of sayd chyldern nor other cause they coude not Juge vnder the Jugement of god but theyr incontynence. for so as he sayd they absteyn them not for ony dysposycyon or nerenesse of chyldynge that was the party and so it appereth in many maners the estate and honeste of maryage is euyll kept of many people vy+le and carnall the whiche oftymes there co~mytten the case of the bysshop and many wronges of the which they make not ony conscyence nor make not ony confessyon and oftymes god them ponyssheth in theyr lyue by as moche that they begete chyldern wronge croked lame blynde messelles or fallyn+ge on the grete yll. so as sayen these holy doctours and therfore a man sholde take hede and teche yo~+ge people of the honoure and reuerence of the fere and of the obedyence that they ought to kepe in ye sacrament of maryage and how they sholde mary them pryncypally for the entencyon to haue lyne whiche may come vnto the holy seruyce of god of holy chirche. after ye example of yonge Thobye vnto whome the angell of god taught that as wel he as his wyfe sarra them sholde absteyne from ye dede of maryage after theyr benedyccyon the espa+ce of thre dayes and thre nyghtes In the whiche ty+me they sholde gyue them vnto holy orysons and so he dyde by the whiche he was delyuered from al pareyll and from the temptacyon of the deuyll the whiche hadde before strangled seuen husbondes whiche hadde espousyd the one after the other the sayd Sara not alonely for the loue of lyne and of the sacrament of maryage but for the beaute of ye doughter and to accomplysshe theyr pleasures car+nalles.
And this doctryne and techynge haue kepte syns many good crysten men and well taught of whome they ben founde in the greate benediccion of good lyne of Joye of consolacyon and of longe lyfe.
The seuenth poynt is that the confessyon is not merytoryous nor suffycyent for to aske new+ly the grace of god whan it is done pryncypally by custome or for fere worldely and not pryncypally for the loue of god and of the saluacyon of ye soule the whiche thynge is done moost comenly so as it may be comprehended and arguyde by the lyfe of the more parte the whiche with grete payne them represent one tyme in the yere and ryght late before theyr confessoure.
The .viii. poynt is whan the sy~+ner hath no wyll nor ferme purpose to ceas and to put ende in his synne for the tyme to come and to fle the occasyons of mortall synne.
The .ix. is wha~ the synner cheseth vnto his wyttynge for his confessour a symple chapelayne the whiche is not suffycyent nor idoniu~ for to redresse the dede of his co~+scyence after the vocacyon and estate of the whyche the synner may be or the whiche hath not power to assoyle.
The .x. is whanne that the synner hathe forgoten by his neclygence his penaunce enioyned or elles he wyll not do it be it to requyre pardonne or to pardon be it to restore another to faste or to make prayer for in suche case the confessyon is none and ought to be withdrawen and so it is good counseyll a man accomplysshe hys penaunce in the estate of grace for in soo doynge he grete meryte agayne god and with that a man acquyteth hym of temporall payne.
Here foloweth the practyse that he ought to holde the whiche entyerly hym wyll confesse and examen after the order of the .x. commaundementes of the lawe after the mooste sure maner that there may be founde.
WHo so euer wyll well and parfaytly exame~ his conscyence in partyculer he ought to rule hym after the .x. commaundementes of the lawe.
For so as wytnesseth saynt Austen a man may not fynde a more certayne practyse to ex+amen well his conscyence.
Also sayth well saynt Gregorye that .x. commaundementes ben as ten myrrours In the whiche the soule crystened may clerely see and knowe the fylth of his synne and of the dysordynaunce of his conscyence.
Also sayth the ryall prophete Dauyd shall confesse me well and ryghtly for as moche as haue lerned the ten commau~dementes of god by the whiche it is well to be noted that no persone is bounde hym to confesse regulerly and of necessyte but onely of dedely synne the whiche is not other thynge but the trans+gressyon of ony of the .x. co~maundementes in the whiche ben defended the seuen deedly synnes Al+so there be conteyned the seuen werkes of mercy the trouth of the artycles of oure holy fayth.
In whiche thynges that is to vnderstonde in the com+maundementes of the lawe in the artycles of the fayth and in the seuen werkes of mercy is compre+hended and co~teyned all the dede of the conscyence in lyke wyse as it hath ben sayd before And therfore who so euer wyll hym well examen and make parfyte hole confessyon after these thynges sayd he ought to take hede how he hath kepte and acco~plysshed the ten co~maundementes of god as well in the thynge co~maunded that is in sechynge vertues and in accomplysshynge the werkes of mercy as also in the thynge defended as ben the seuen de+dely synnes.
That is to know pryde enuy wrath couetyse glotonye slouth and lechery In whiche seuen maner of synnes a man may falle often mortally and dampnably And somtyme venyall alonely for it is to byleue that euery passyon or mo+uynge of Ire of enuy of vayne glorye and soo of other synnes before sayd ben alwayes deedly synne But whan suche passyons or wylles abyden in the termes of venyall synne or that they exceden tyll vnto mortall synne.
That thynge is ryght harde vnto Jugement humayne and it is not possyble therin to gyue a rule generall suffycyent for to Ju+ge of euery case inpartyculer wheder it be mortall or venyall after as it hath ben sayd before in the seuenth chapytre of this partye and therfore as nowe reste to see in partyculer some case after ordre of the ten co~maundementes.
OUer these thynges sayd in the fyrste co~maun+dement he the whiche wyll well purge his co~scyence ought to take hede vnto these poyntes that folowen.
Fyrste vnto the brekynge of his vowes yf ony haue ben broken as who sayth not carynge by dyspysynge and inobedyence agayne god the whiche was lawfull to holde and to accomplysshe it is dedely synne yf a man co~mytte suche fraccy on by delyberacyon or equyualente after the rule put in the chapytre of the scyence that a confessour ought to haue the whiche oughte well to be noted for all these cases the whiche folowen in this mater of all the ten commaundementes.
Also it is to be noted that for as moche that there hath ben ma+de mencyon in the treatyse of the co~maundemen tes of all the seuen deedly synnes.
He the whiche by the studye of this boke wyll examen his consey+ence ought for to truste the thynges the whiche there hath ben sayd be it in generall in especyall with them that folowen in this recapitulacy on of the co~maundementes in partyculer yf ony by syknes forgetfulnes or other cause excusable breketh hys vowe that is no synne or it is alonely venyall yf he hath auowed a thynge vnlefull he ne sholde accomplysshe it but without other dyspense ought more sooner to do all the contrary and hym to confesse of soo folysshely to haue auowed thynge the whiche is not lefull or honeste yf he haue taryed to accomplysshe his vowes in suche wyse that he the~ hath forgoten or by to moche taryenge falleth in to suche inconuenyent that he ne them may accomplysshe some grete theologyens wyll saye and susteyne yt it is deedly synne yf he haue made auo+we to faste or to do other thynge lefull for ony cur+syd ende as for to come to co~mytte thefte auoutry or other synne he hath synned mortally yf he hath made auowe of chastyte or of relegyon and after+warde hym maryeth it is deedly synne and as ma+ny tymes and often as he requyreth on his partye the deuoure of maryage he synneth mortally but yf he were requyred he may acquyte hym in yeldyn+ge the deuoyre of maryage without deedly synne by suche wyse that he loueth better after the wyll of reason hym to content and not to accomplysshe the werke of maryage The whiche thynge is yl to kepe all the tyme of his lyfe and therfore they yt ben in suche inconuenyent they sholde make dyspense of theyr vowe and be assoyled of the synne And it is to be noted that a curate may assoyle his subiecte of the brekynge of his vowes but he may not dyspence or them chaunge without specyall ly+cence of the pope or of the bysshop after as the case it requyreth.
The dyspensacyon or co~mutacyon of the vowe of chastyte of pylgrymage vnto Jherusalem of Rome of saynt James ben reserued to the pope.
But the dyspence or commutacyons of other vowes appertayne vnto the prelates.
Also it is to be noted that yonge people that is to knowe ye doughter vnder the yeres of .xii. accomplysshed the sone vnder the yeres of .xiiii. may not vowe or entre in to relegyon of theyr owne auctoryte not withstondynge what dyscrecyon so euer they may haue.
Also auowe is not oblygatory yf it be not made by delyberacyon and full consent.
Also a wo+man maryed may not vowe or obserue the vowe yt she hath made before the maryage yf her husbond wyll not so consent and yf she hath auowed after or before the maryage the husbonde her may make it to leue without other dyspense and withoute the synne of ye one or of the other yf husbonde we+re not ony tyme consentynge The man may well vowe without lycence of his partye the whiche be not vnto the preiudyce of maryage.
Also they the whiche vowen neuer to kembe them on the fryday or not to spynne on the satyrdaye or other sembla+bles superstytucyons ought to leue suche vowes symple and full of vanytees But doo after the ordenaunce of theyr wyse and dyscrete confessour. and other holy faders.
Secondly the synner oughte well for to take hede yf he be culpable of sorce+ryes of wytchcraftes of charmes of inuocacyons of the deuyll or of adoracyons or of paccyon with hym and with his dyabolykes.
Also yf yt he haue vsed ony euyll crafte or yf he haue kepte or retayned bokes of the same.
Also yf he haue Jugyd of the deth or of the lyfe of the aduentures of ony persone by the constellacyons and knowlege of the planettes on the skye or by phylosephye.
Also yf he haue vsed of sorte for to knowe ony thynge yf he hath byleued ouer moche and stedfastly in the aduentures of ony dremes yf that he hath lokyd or causyd to loke in the tokens of the hande for to knowe the aduentures of hymself or of other yf he for ony syknes hath vsed lytell scrowes or of charmes yf he hath put dystyncyon in certayne dayes As the tewesdaye and the we~nysdaye or other dayes for to begynne ony werke for to make waye in beleuynge that by one daye he shall profyte better than by a nother yf he hath put fayth for ony ad+uentures in songe or in cryes of ony byrdes or in the metynge of ony beestes or of other thynges in all these cases before sayd oftymes it is dedely syn+ne and ryght selden venyall synne.
OVer these thynges before sayd in the seconde commaundement the synner onght to take hede vnto the poyntes the whiche folowen yf he hath sworne in certayne the thynge the whiche is in doubte It is mortall synne specyally in Jugemente yf he hath sworne to do thynge the whiche of it selfe is yll as it sholde be to do synne he hath synned mortally nor suche othe ought not to be kep+te nor accomplysshed yf he hath shewed wyttyng+ly the secrete or the counseyll that he hath sworne to holde secrete It is dedely synne as well in hym that swereth as in hym the whiche wyttyngly maketh suche reuelacyon knowynge well that it was gyuen hym for to kepe it secrete yf he hath sworne detestably as by ye blode by yt deth or by the wom+be of our lorde it is dedely synne And in suche ma+ner to swere is reputyd also as to blaspheme and in lyke wyse to dysplease by Ire god and his sayntes yf he hath promysed sworne to do ony thynge lefull and he there trespasseth without excusary on resonable and vnto his wyttynge it is dedely synne but the thynge sworne may be suche as to be te his chylde or other thynge semblable the whiche is not accomplysshed it is but synne venyall yf he hath constrayned hym to swere that he byleueth he shall be forsworne it is deedly synne except the Iuge the whiche by the order of ryghte maketh to swere ony in Justice yf in songes vnhoneste tryfylles and talkynges of langage he swereth god or his sayntes it is deedly synne also to swere troweth with out cause and for no thynge.
And also as at euery worde he may with grete payne be done without the contenement of the lawe of god by the consequent it is deedly synne.
OVer these thynges spoken in the thyrde com+maundement the synner ought to take hede vnto the poyntes the whiche folowen yf he occupy hymselfe his seruantes or his chyldern in worldly werkes and cursyd on the sonday or on other festes gyuen by the commaundement by couetousnes without constraynt of necessyte it is dedely synne as well in hym that commaundeth as in hym the whiche obeyth and consenteth yf he hath gone vn+to fayres or vnto markettes by his couetousnesse in the sayd feestes he there may synne mortally.: Other thynge it shall be after masse herde yf he it may goodly here he gooth vnto the fayrres or vnto the markettes As these prelates of holy chir+che suffren without makynge specyall prohybycyo~ or without the makynge of ony punysshement yf he be occupyed all the daye in dysportes in feestyn+ges in goynge on huntynge and hawkynge with out herynge masse and somtyme they occupye the se other it is deedly synne comenly here sholde they take hede and seche good counseyll tauerners bakers hocsters potycaryes bayllyues and in lyke wyse sergeau~tes and other offycers Also tayllers cordyners and generally all maner of people of labour and of noblesse of what so euer degree that they ben for euery man hym ought to examen after the vocacyon and estate in the whiche he lyueth and to take hede for what occasyon and with what cyrcumstaunces yf he be occupyed on the holydaye in worldly werkes for yf that hath ben pryncypal+ly by his couetousnes it is dedely synne.
Also fraw+des euyll thoughtes clamacyons pariurynges and other tryfylles the whiche oftymes they co~mytten in all maner of marchau~dyse be it in weyght in mesure in pryce in substau~ce or in qualyte is mo+re greuous synne on the holydaye than it sholde be another daye for as moche that in so doynge there is the transgressyon of the co~maundementes yt is of the thyrde the whiche is to halowe the feestes in the whiche is pryncypally the werke of synne also of the seuenth the whiche defendeth all thefte as shall be sayd here after.
OVer these thynges sayd in the fourth co~mau~dement the synner ought to take hede vnto these poyntes folowen fyrst yf he hath spoken wor+des vnlefull vnto fader or vnto moder yf he hath cursyd them yf he hath mockyd them yf he them hath put or stryken yf he theym hath prouoked to wrathe and he in the wronge it is dedely synne yf he theym wolde not obeye in thynge the whiche was good and lawfull it is deedly synne whan in that there is a contempt for another thynge it shol+de be yf by ouer syght or in ony neclygence or in thynge of lytell reputacyon yf he ne them hath pur+ueyde of theyr necessytes after as he may ought to do yf he vnto them borne honoure and reueren+ce in place and in tyme it is comenly dedely synne yf he them hath not acquyte after theyr deth and accomplysshe theyr laste wylles and testamentes af+ter as he may and ought well to do it is deedly syn+ne yf he hath ben Irreuerende vnto his other fren+des vnto his souerayns as vnto people of the chir+che vnto offycers and vnto his lordes yf he hath not taught his chyldern and other of his houshold in makynge them to kepe the co~maundementes of god to receyue the sacramentes in place in tyme in prouydynge them of meete and of drynke of clo+the and hosynge honestly after his power and hys estate yf he them hath causyd to leue pryde bosty~ges and vanytes yf he them hath suffred to be fou~+de in dau~ces in companyes peryllous vnhoneste yf he hath made his seruant or seruantes to werke on the holydayes in all these thynges may haue deedly synne after the cyrcumstaunces mody+fycacyon of mortall synne the whiche hath ben spo+ken here tofore.
OVer these thynges before¬∑ sayd in the fyfth commaundement the synner ought to take hede vnto these poyntes folowen fyrste yf he hath done manslawghter of ony persone be it in dede in thought or by yll doynge in vsynge thynges vn+lefull as it sholde be to caste stones without dyscre+cyon or draught or in doynge thynge vnleful and aduyseth not them the whiche may be in dau~ger or by necessyte euytable or not In the whiche necessyte he sholde be fallen by his culpe as yf in hymself defendyng he kylleth the husbonde of ony woman with whome he sholde be fou~de vnhonestly in all these cases it is dedely synne.
Also yf ony Iuge gyue sentence of deth by enuy by Ire or by his couetousnes vpon the whiche he hath deserued to dye or not.
It is deedly synne yf a woman with chylde take ony thynge to procure the dethe of her fruyte and they the whiche counseyllynge or therto consenten synnen mortally folowe the dede of the deth of ye chylde or not and yf ye fruyte hath soule that sholde be homycyde and the case of the bysshop in all them the whiche gynen cou~seyll consentyng or aydynge yf fader or moder or nouryce stop the breth of a lytyll chylde by ouersyght or otherwyse there may be deedly synne by theyr neclyge~ce and defaute of good kepynge yf a woman with chylde by to moche laboure by her auaryce for to holde acquaynted for to daunce or for other ordynaunces leseth hyr fruyte she synneth mortally yf ony smyte or shoue a woman with chylde by suche Jurysdyccyon that she leseth her fruyte it is dedely synne yf manor woman enforce them to fynde wa+yes or maners by the whiche he may lette that ye woman conceyue not a chylde it is deedly synne yf ony smyte or hurte an other in takynge from hy~ ony of his membres or of the vsage of them with out the order of Justyce it is deedly synne yf he gy+ue counseyll co~maundement or ratifye and hath excepte that ony be kylled or beten agayne ye ordre of Justice and of charyte it is deedly synne not withstandynge that the dede folowe not yf he desy+re the deth of a nother with delyberacyon be it for hate for enuy or for ony other cursyd cause it is deedly synne another thynge it sholde be to desyre the deth of ony malefactours for as moche as they hurte the goodes of ony good man after the Jugement humayne yf he smyte and wounde wrongefully ony in the chirche or in the chirchyarde it is sacrylege and the place halowed polutyde yf he hath made make or causeth to be made Justes in the whiche there may be peryll of deth it is synne many other cases partyculers may come touchynge the mater of the fyfth commaundement of the whiche those vnto whome they comen them ought to aduyse and pourge.
OVer these thynges before sayd in the. com+maundement in the whiche suffycyently yn+oughe hath ben spoken of dyuers maners of lechery the synner sholde take hede vnto these poyntes the whiche folowen.
Fyrste yf he hath touched vnhonestly or kyssed for to drawe the persone vnto the synne of lechery it is deedly synne notwithstandy~+ge that none other thynge folowe yf he hath wry+ten borne or sente letters vnto his knowlege for to prouoke ony persone vnto the synne of lechery it is deedly synne yf he hath made songes spoken or herde the whiche sholde be vyle and prouokynge vnto the synne of lechery pryncypally for to enduce hym or other vnto synne it is deedly synne yf he hath accompanyed ony or yf he hath gyuen fauoure of assembles or yf he hath made messages or presentes for to drawe vnto the synne of lechery it is deedly synne And in lyke wyse of those the whiche vnto suche intencyon receyuen gyftes or promysses yf he hath taken delectacyon to thynke on the dede of lechery the whiche is deedly synne he synneth mortally whan there is delyberacyon yf that he hath hadde cursyd wyll and consented vnto the dede of lechery and of suche wyll proceden lokynges spekynges touchynges in hym or in other it is deely synne In lyke wyse as the wyll wherof suche thynges proceden not that suche a wyll and the dede that foloweth ben two synnes but they ben but one alonely here ought they full well to take hede euery good persone that by hys prayer by his lokes or by his abyllymentes he ne gyueth occasyon vnto another of folysshe thought or of cursyd wyll for the occasyon may be suche yt it sholde be dedely synne.
Also it is to be noted that of the synne of lechery proceden many passyons by the meane of whome a man falleth oftymes vnto synne and in to grete inconuenyens that is to kno+we offuscacyon of the very knowlege of vnderstandynge preceptacyon inco~syderacyon inconscy+ence loue dysordynate of his owne sensualyte loue of this present lyfe hate of ye Justyce and ordenau~+ce of god And therfore the synner ought to exame~ yf for his synne of lechery he is in suche wyse occupyed that he hath lefte to thynke on god on hys saluacyon yf he hath ben precypytant and without delyberacyon in his werkes and besynes. yf he hath ben without due examynacyon of that that he hath done or for to do yf he hath chau~ged his good pur+pose and it hath lefte aboue all to doo yf he hath excessyuely sought the pleasures and cases of hys body yf he hath to moche loued this present lyfe or the delytes of the flesshe yf he hadde in dysplea+sure the lawe of god for as moche as it defendeth the concupyscence of the worlde and of the flesshe and in euery of these thynges to haue so grete exces that it is deedly synne after as declareth saynt Gregorye.
OVer these thynges before sayd in the seuenth co~maundement vnto the synne of couetyse ye synner sholde take hede vnto these poyntes that fo+lowen.
The thyrde is of fraudes and decepcyons The fourth is of iniquyte agayne Justyce.
The syxte of chanons of curates and of other benefyced.
The seuenth of ini+quyte or defaute of Justyce in lordshyppes seculer.
The .viii. of Juges ben they of the chirche or of secularyte.
The .ix. of aduocacyons of procurers of notaryes be it in courte of the chirche or the secu+laryte.
AS vnto the fyrste the whiche is of symony the synner sholde take hede yf he hath gyuen moneye or other thynge by paccyon and with his good wyll for to haue or to receyue ony of the sacramentes of holy chirche or other benedyccyon hauynge intencyon them to bye or to obteyne for by cause of suche thynge gyuen it is symony and deedly synne another thynge it sholde be of hys good wyll for almes or for the reuerence of the sacrament or of the benedyccyon or for ony custome vnto the whiche to kepe he shall not be enforced and yf he co~mytte the synne of symonye as well of hym that selleth these thynges spyrytuall as also of hym that them byeth suche thynges and the whiche ben cause and meane that to doo yf he gyue ony thynge temporall for to obteyne chapell personage prebende or other benefyce of the chirche or for to be presented vnto ony offyce of chirche it is symony and deedly synne. for to paye the taxe of the courte of Rome for to obteyn bulles of benefyces or other letters apostolycalles it is not reputyd symony yf he hath bought or solde the sepulture of holy chirche it is symony yf he hath sol+de or bought vnto his wyttynge the ryght of a patronage of personage or of chapell or of other benefyce ecclesyastycall it is symony yf he hath made prayers and vnto prelates of the chirche for to benefyce ony the whiche of that was indygne as the whiche hath not cunnynge suffycyent for the excucyon of the offyce or the whiche is not of honest lyfe or the whiche hath not aege co~petent it is symony yf ony foundatour of chirch or patron hath receyued gyftes or promysses for to present ony vnto the benefyce by cause of the whiche gyftes he hath ben presentyd it is symony and deedly synne yf he hath receyued gyftes or promys+ses for to be meane to procure vnto ony clerke ordre or benefyce of the chirche it is symony in both .ii. yf he hath made paccyon to receyue of ony thyng temporall for to preche the worde of god it is symonye in the one and in the other yf he hath made couenaunte of certayne so~me for hym or for other for to be receyued in to relegyon the whiche is of grete and suffycyent foundacyon for to sustayn the membre of relegyous men or relegyous wome~ it is symonye in both two partyes another it shall be after these doctours whan the foundacyon of monastery is not suffycyent for than a man may make couenaunt of the quantyte of gyftes not hauynge intencyon to bye ony thynge spyrytuall yf he hath procured by his owne prayers and supplyca+cyons to obteyne benefyces vnto whiche he hath cure of soules some doctours wyll say that he is a symonyacle for as moch as he hym sheweth indyg+ne and meke prayer made for good intencyon with that intencyon to haue syluer for to do with suche syluer other good werke suche intencyon is not euyll nor corrupte for two good endes be not co~+traryes knowe ye that syluer may not be the self ende or pryncypall to make prayers or predycacyo~ prayers made in intencyon pryncypally for to haue syluer to put it vnto folysshe vsages it is deedly synne symony and sacrylege lyke vnto the synne of Judas as vnto the regarde of the masse of the whiche some taken .xii. pens the whiche ben worth thyrty pens for to put them in folysshe vsage as it may be to wexe ryche by auaryce or with other ma+ners indeuyde and yf the sayd prayer be made by synners in other thynges soo moche the lesse it is worth knowe ye agayne thew the whiche make su+che preestes to synge wyttyngly yf he hath renou~cyd vnto ony benefyce by suche paccyon yt it sholde be gyuen vnto his kynnysman or vnto ony other the whiche for so doynge hym hath promysed ony thynge temporall it is symony in the one and in the other mo and many other cases of symonye there may be founde as well in prelates of the chir+che as in lordes temporall as in all other degrees of persones of whome passe ouer as at this tyme by cause of shortnes notwithstondynge be the clerke well aduysed the whiche in receyuynge ordres or benefyces is fallen in symony that he is irregu+ler and synneth mortally in executynge offyces of holy ordres before that he be dyspensyd with.
Here foloweth of vsury the whiche is co~myttyd as well in dede as in wyll.
AS vnto the seconde the whiche is of vsurers the synner ought to take hede yf he hath le~+te money or other thynge wherof the vsage is con+sumpcyon of that as sholde be corne or wyne by paccyon or intencyon pryncypall for to receyue mo+re than he gaue that is vsury and deedly synne yf he hath lente vpon gage of thynge moeuable or al+so of herytage by suche condycyon or pryncypall intencyon that he shall haue the vsage or the fruy+tes and leue of the sayd charge without deductyn+ge and rebaytynge of the somme lente it is vsury excepte the gendred kynnysman the whiche taketh ony wages in attendynge the promysse the whiche vnto hym hath ben made by cause of the maryage of his wyfe by suche wyse that he her mayntene as a husbonde ought to mayntene his espouse And it is well to be notyd in this mater that there ben two maners of vsuryes.
The other is hyd and is commytte in dyuers maners yf that he hath bought londes and possessyons for lytyll and mynyssheth the pryce for as moche that the seller putteth in his bargayne that he may bye agayne his herytage wt in certayne tyme he co~mytteth vsurye yf he rebate not that that he hath receyued ouer the costes and layenges of ye sayd herytage yf he sell many tymes the more harder for that that he leneth in abaytynge his payment tyll vnto a certayne tyme how be it some what he may sewe more specyally whan he loueth better to haue vpon the ower a lesse pryce than to tarye Also whan he hath bought certay~ ware as corne or wyne the whiche ben yet for to gadre and for as moche that he hath auauncyd yc payment he gyueth lesse than the thynge is worthe at the ower or at the tyme that he it sholde receyue it is vsery.
Also whan he leneth pryncypally for the intencyon to haue presentes money ayde or other thynge temporall it is vsurye yf he hath betaken bestyall vnto haluys by suche condycyon yt yf there happen mortallyte or other aduenture of losse wherof he the whiche them taken is not the cause neuertheles his catyll shal be euer more sauf and entyer it is vsury and for a rewle generall al+wayes as in suche contractys be it of shepe of la~bes of the hyre of oxen or of other bestes that the one of the partyes maketh his pryce and paccyon in suche maner that he is assured to wynne or nothynge to lese what so euer that there happen and the other partye abydeth in doubte and subiecte to the aduentures of fortune suche co~tracte is agayn reason and agayne Justyce but whan the exces of the one partye or of the other is suche that with greate payne he may be in losse or in gayns soo yt they entende no fraude the one vnto the other.
put that euery of them awayte vnto his owne prof+fyte here is none vsurye yf the procurer or tuter of ony faderles chyldern gyueth theyr fynau~ce vnto vsury to the ende yt the sayd fynau~ce vnto them shall prouffyte and that by that meane they were nourysshed or theyr maryages augmented and also that poore marchaundes by suche meane that them myght auantage that notwithstondynge it sholde be deedly synne and to the sayd procurou+re or tutour is bounde to restore the sayd vsurye in case yf they the whiche haue hadde the prouffyte wyll not restore.
Also it is well to be noted yt many sellers and byers ben full of vsurye before god and after good conscyence as well for the cause of the entencyon of the beynge as also of the sellyn+ge the whiche alwayes semen to be lawfully solde after the forme of the contracte and of the wordes as for example Martyn hath necessyte to fynde an hundreth crownes for to lene but he seynge and knowynge that no man hym wyll do that pleasur he cometh vnto Petyr vnto hym she wynge his ne+cessyte by the whiche he is dysposed to selle hym. shelynges of rente vpon his herytage by suche con+dycyon that tyll vnto the terme of seuen yeres as many tymes and as often that he shall yelde the somme lent that is an hundreth crownes Peter is hounde hym to delyuer his herytage In suche cases and semblables the intencyon and the condycy ons of the seller and of the byer sholde be weyed consydered for yf the seller hadde not intencyon yt these .xl. shelynges sholde abyde for euer vnto the byer the whiche entencyon ye byer knoweth or vnto hym it is very semblable by some meane.
Also of his party he wylled and desyred that the contrac+te were made vnder the forme of sale and not of wynnynge vnto that without knowlege of vsury his hundreth crownes he may purchase vpon hym of suche contracte and semblable may a man say that it is a wulfe couerde with a shepes skynne.
That is to knowe vsury the whiche cometh of wnnynge hyd specyally whan the seller was indy+gent or nedy and a persone dygne of mercy.
For in suche case the somme taken lened by cause of the sayd sale is suche that he sholde rebate as many ty+mes and as often as the seller shall yelde his money In this mater to dyscende vnto all cases con+dycyons and cyrcumstaunces in partyculer for to Juge certaynly that there is vsury and deedly synne or venyall it is a thynge ryght harde withoute the grace especyall of god for the malycyous auaryce of erthely people hath so many founde of eauil lacyons that with grete payne there may go out of the waye all the moost gretest and moost yllumyned doctours for the whiche cause passe ouer fro~ my other cases partyculers.
Also it is holden for a rule generall as to lene money it may be done in fyue maners.
The fyrste lyberally without ony in tencyon of ony retrybucyon corporall or temporal ouer the somme gyuen and that maner is good and charytable.
Secondly with suche condycyon that he the whiche receyueth that londe of money in marchaundysynge vnto the halfe of losse or of gayne and suche contracte may well be made and he the whiche hath lente may receyue a more greater somme than he hath gyuen But for the condy+cyon of persones or for the aduersyte of the intencyon of auaryce¬∑ or of other he there may haue lettynge.
Thyrdly in puttynge the chatell that is the somme gyuen in certaynte and the gayn in certay+ne that is to vnderstande that lese or wynne he whiche receyueth vnder suche forme he shall yelde alwayes the sayd so~me and yf he wynne ye bayllye takyth auantage here is vsury manifeste.
That is to vnderstande in puttynge the gayn in certayne and the chatell vnder incertayne as for An example lene the an hondreth crownes wher with thou shalte marchaundyse at my pareyll with all the somme by suche wyse that after a yere or another thou shall yelde me syx crownes. or .x. or mo or lesse and yf thou lese by fortune the sayd hondreth crownes vpon me it is al and yf it be sauyd he it shall yelde with the somme spoken suche con+tracte is full of vsury after the ryghte the cause is suche for the hope that suche a lener hath more is more to wynne than lese.
lene the an hundreth crownes by suche wyse that after the yere paste thou me shalte yelde an hondreth .x. here is vsury manyfeste vnto these v. maner to lene may be broughte all these other But more ouer these doctours make a questyon yf it be lawfull in ony case to receyue ony thynge be+cause of the lone.
Fyrst a man may well receyue a thynge spyrytual as is the lone the good grace of hym vnto whome he hath lente.
Also yf of free wyll he gyueth ony thynge or it may receyue so that the lone hath not be made to suche intencyon.
Secondely by reason of dysda~mage as yf the lone hath ben made vnder a certayne payne it for to yelde at a certayne tyme and that by the defaute of that for to do the lender were in dammage without ficcyon in this caas he may for by cause of the dysda~mage take the sayd payne with his pryncypall yf that the sayd payne were not excessyue and vnreasonable.
Thyrdely by reason and cause of the doubte vnto the whiche the lender is submysed in lyke wyse as it appyreth in the seconde caas of the notable before sayd in lendynge vnto the halfe of losse or of gayns.
Fourthely by reason of the dammage that he renneth in the whiche lended by cause of the sayd redy.
At your gre+te request lende you an hondred crownes for a yere in the whiche after god and good conscyence shall be in dammage in the somme of ten or twenty crownes.
Than yf he the whiche borowed seeth that it sholde be better vnto his prouffyte to take the sayd somme and to restore the da~mage of the lendynge he it may do the other it receyue ouer the pryncypall for to kepe hym to recompen+se hym the da~mage.
Fyfthtly by reason of the hyre of a thynge the whiche he may hyre as oxen horses and other thynges that a man may receyue some tymes more in valour that they were at the tyme of the hyre and with the hyre.
But for to re+ceyue more than a man hath lente in ony other maner wyse than here before hath ben sayd or do+ne ayenst the co~maundement and a man selleth the thynge imprecyable and the whiche proprely may not be solde.
That is to vnderstande the plea+sure the charyte that euery creature ought vnto his neyghbour as well by ye lawe of nature as by the lawe of holy scrypture the whiche lawes all other ben they Canons or Cyuyles defenden ye syn+ne of vsurye.
Also yf ony gyne olde corne or other thynge semblable for to renewe it hauynge intencyon pryncypall that the newe shall be more worth and elles he wolde not gyue it he co~mytted vsurye But yf he do that pryncypally to the intente that his thynge perysshe not or for to do a pleasure vn+to his neyghbour or in trewe semblable doubte yf that the thynge be more worthy or lesse at the tyme that it shall be yelded agayne in suche a caas it is none vsurye.
The payne of vsurers publysshed is suche that they ben exco~munycate of ryght wherfore the holy chirche defended that vnto suche there be not gyuen the precyous body of Jhesu cry+ste.
Also that theyr oblacyon be not receyued in the holy chirche.
Also that after theyr deth theyr bo+dyes ben cast in a voyde grounde and not receyued in the place holy and blessyd.
For a man ought not to doubte but that the soules of theym the whiche deyen in suche estate ben dampned with the deuylles in helle wherfore the bodyes sholde not be put to reste with the faythfull crysten men.
And yf in theyr laste dayes they requyre penaunce they may not be assoyled but in doynge yt yt in them is possyble to restore all these vsuryes yt they haue receyued in all theyr lyf it suffysed not to be receyued vnto ye sacrament{is} of holy chirche assoyled to orden by theyr testament yt after theyr dethes these vsuryes ben restored but it behoued to dyspose mouable herytage tyll vnto ye somme the whiche may amou~te the sayd vsuryes yf they vnto whome he ought to make restytuco~n ben present hy~ behoued them to make full satysfaccion in yeldynge it all be it by fynau~ce maruell by gage or assygnaco~n.
And yf they ben absent ye Juge of ye court or his lyuetenau~t or ye bysshop deane or curate sholden represent ye persones in receyuynge the sayd satysfac+cyon in caas yt mouables herytag{is} suffyse not¬∑ as often it happened after yt they haue all layde mouables herytages as it is sayd they sholde requyre mercy of god of holy chirche of them vnto whome they ben redyuables than a man may them assoyle not elles.
For the testament that they make in ony maner wyse is of no valour nor effecte after the ryght.
Vnto that peryll is bounden wyues childern neuewes nyces or enherytoures the whiche wyttyngly retaynen the goodes mo+uables or herytages of vsurers the whiche haue not made in theyr lyf suffycyent restytucyon or satysfaccyon and it ought to be restored yf that it be possyble not all oonly the somme of that hath ben receyued by vsurye but with that the da~mage that they myght haue hadde by cause of theym the whiche haue payed the sayd vsuryes by the whiche it apyreth clerely that full fewe of vsurers escapen the deuyll.
In lyke wyse also it appyreth the peryll of those whiche receyuen in theyr chir+ches or chircheyerdes vnto sepulture the body of an vsurer suche as hath ben spoken.
For the preestes the whiche do it wyttyngly ben exco~munycate ipso facto after the newe ryght.
Also it is to be noted that he the whiche taketh vnto vsurye for his grete necessyte of hym the whiche is an vsurer renommed and is redy that for to do synned not in takynge vnto vsurye but to take vnto vsurye for auaryce or for to dyspende folysshely or for to enduce ony to gyue vnto vsurye the whiche it hath not accustomed it is a synne moche greuous.
AS vnto the thyrde poynt the whiche is of fraudes and of decepcyons the whiche is co~mytted of dyuers maners of people and in dyuers maners the synner sholde take hede.
Fyrste in dede of marchaundyse ouer the thynges sayd of vsurye yf he hath done fraude by fals weyghtes or ony fals mesures or in the sellynge of ony fals thynge corrupte or meddled in affermynge that it is good and pure be it metalles appotecaryes wyne oyle or ony other ware by the whiche the byer is notably defrauded it is deedly synne syns in a lytell thynge it is venyall synne.
How be it it is well to be noted that yf ony man defraude and dysceyued his neyghbour in a lytell thynge that he hym wolde well dysceyue in a more greter thynge yf he myght suche synnen mortally.
For god that seeth all weyeth more the good wyll than the werke withoutforth.
If he hath frauded reteyned taxes serches passages or other imposicy+ons made by the ordynau~ce of Justyce it is deedly synne.
Also yf people of seygnourye of Justyce haue made prestes taxes imposicyons by auaryce or tyrannye not for the comen wele it is mor+tall synne.
Also yf he hath falsed bookes of receyte or other lettres vnto the notable da~mage of an other it is deedly synne.
Also yf the marchau~t mar+chau~dyse pryncypally for auaryce or for to encrea+se his catell not for to lyue honestly after his vocacyon or for to ayde the poore or for the welth of the comunalte it is deedly synne whan in suche gayns he putteth his pryncypall entente.

Also yf they haue made paccyon bytwene them for to selle theyr ware rudely and at a pry+ce not competent by the whiche the comons be constayned for to bye it at theyr pryce it is deedly synne.
Also yf he be payed with one ware for an other by the whiche that seynge he hath aboue ma+de his owne and mynysseth and hurteth the other mortally it is deedly synne.
Also yf he hath payed symple people in fals moneye it is fraude and decepcyon and deedly synne.
Also yf he hath vsed fla+terynge speche and of swerynges to selle indyfferently at the daye of the feste co~maunded or in ha+lowed place often there is deedly synne.
Also yf he hath bought of robbers of theues where that he byleued the thynge to be suche that it apperteyned vnto them Justely it is deedly synne.
Also yf he hath ben the meane of ony that he byleued to be vniuste as of vsurye in byenge of herytage or in corsynge of hors or in treatynge of ma+ryage seynge and knowynge the greuous da~mage of the one of the partyes it is deedly synne.

And therfore they sholde consyder theyr estate occupacyons as well by them as by the ayde of theyr confessour declare the fraudes that they knowen well to do to speke more subtylly no clerke by wrytynge may them declare they shold telle wheder they were for to leue suche maners of fraudes or not it shewe confesse playnly for yf they haue intencyon to retorne in co~tynuynge theyr dysceyuable maners to vse they ne ought to be assoyled.
Also yf ony hym medle of offyce or crafte the whiche he may not do without deedly synne as to at house steues syde to do seruyce vnto these vsurers to meue warre the whiche is not Juste to make these mixions wherwt women paynte theyr vysages so of other vocacyons suche ought not to be assoyled yf they haue not wyll neuer for to retorne vnto the sayd offyce.
Also people whiche geten by theyr Journeys them faynen sparen to werke or whiche in euyll wyse done theyr wer+ke yt notwithstandynge wyll be well payed they ben theues bou~de to make restytucyon.
They haue promysse of .xij. pens for the Journey put yt a man thynketh it suffycyent how be it after god good co~scyence they gete not but .x. pens for as moche as they do not theyr Jour+neye lawfully they ben theues of .ij. pens vpon the Journeye ye which amou~ted at the ende of the yere yt a man hath made .cc. suche Journeys ye somme of .xvi. .viij. of the whiche somme they ought make restitucyon.

Also he ought to be the lyght example vnto his subgectes in all thynges in fewe wordes of thynges prouffytable in quenchyn+ge dyscordes in reprouynge detraccyons or grutchynges fals reportes mockeryes fo+lysshe langages.
Also he ought to be circonspect in all thynges specyally in holdynge secrete ye caas the whiche happened after as it is of ryght of charyte.

For yf he be not entred regulerly as before hath ben sayd he is a theef in lyke wyse as our lorde sayth in the gospell.

If he hath lefte ony thynge to do or to saye the whiche is of the essence of the sacrament of holy ordres hym behoued all to go backe for as moche as in suche sacrament it is create of god gyueth a token spyrytuall named caractere.
An other thynge it sholde be yf he lefte a thynge the whiche sholde not be essencyall how be it a man sholde supplye in these other ordres yt the whiche is forgoten ha~gynge the clerke so ordened shol not offyce nor there ne may ignorau~ce vycyous excuse suche defautes.
Yf he hath not caused to make examen of the age of the holy lyfe of the scyence of other thynges whiche ben requysyte of ryght in them the whiche sholde be ordeyned it is deedly synne.

Yf they haue procured dyspenses to op+teyne many benefyces pryncypally for ambicyon by auaryce.

By the whiche it folo+weth moreouer yt suche persone may neuer be assoy+led sacramentally but in ye artycle of deth yf he be not fyrst vnbounde of the sayd sentence.

Also yf he hath assoy+led of the sentence exco~munycacyons or in the caas and persones vpon whome he hath not power nor auctoryte or hath made dyspense of vowes or yf he hath shewed the synne of the persone the whiche he hath herde in confessyon or hath enioyned penaunces of almesse the whiche by his inducynge cometh vnto his prouffyte temporall or hath be notably vndyscrete in assoylynge them the whiche weren indygne for as moche as they wolde not par+donne or requyre pardonne or make restytucon after as it was of reason or they wolde not leue ony synne or yf he hath enquyred malycyously of the name of the persones with whome they haue synned those the whiche them vnto hym or hath done his deuour to examen the dede of the co~+scyence of poore symple synners or hath not ben desyrous it to enquyre of clerkes and more experte than he was of the dyffycultees perplexitees the whiche often is fou~de in the dede of the conscyence or hath assoyled in deedly synne without true contrycyon.
In all these cases beforsayd there is co+monly mortal synne.
Yf he hath broken ye vowe of chastyte the whiche he hath done solemply ouer the pryncypall promysse made vnto the sacrament of baptem.
That is to vnderstande whan he receyued the holy ordre of subdeacon.
And afterwarde in receyuyng ye ryght holy sacred ordre of prestho+de.
And therfore the trangressyon of suche vowe is horryble sacrylege dygne of eternall deth.
Also yf he hath knowen carnally his paryshens vnto who me he hath other tymes admynystred the sacrame~+tes of holy chirche or his doughter or her the whiche he hath holden in confyrmacyon or also his godmoder his kynneswoman or his affynyte ouer the grete detestable synne mortall ben ordeyned dyuers paynes after the ryght{is} for suche cases.
Also yf he hath gyuen benedyccyon vnto those the whiche other tymes it hath receyued he is suspended of ye offyce of the benefyce of ye whiche he may not be releued but of ye holy fader.
And yf he admynystre ony of the sacramentes before that he there be remedyed ouer the payne beforsayd he is irreguler in so berynge hym vnto the sacrame~+tes in suche estate he synned alwayes mortally.
To nombre in partyculer all these cases the dyuersy+te of synnes the whiche may come vnto bysshops deanes chanons curates chapellayns other peo+ple of the thirche of relygyon by cause of theyr dygnytees offyces euyll kept it is a thynge ryght harde vnto all lawyers theologyens.
But the ho+ly scrypture the whiche teched all trouth the whiche is necessarye vnto all saluacyon it suffyseth well vnto the conscyence of euery man of the chirche the whiche hym enforced to do that the whiche is in hym for to please god and for to kepe well and Justely the degree and for to execute the offyce that god and holy chirche vnto hym hath commytted.
Here foloweth of the defaute of Justyce in domynacyon seculer or temporall.
AS vnto the .vij. poynt the whiche is of the seygnourye seculer it is to vnderstande yt kynges dukes cou~tes all other degrees of seygnourye sholde fyrste take hede how they be comen vnto the sayd seygnourye.
That is to vnderstand yf by ryght of lygne or by other waye of Justyce for than they theyr may purchase saluacyon.
But yf they it holden by vsurpacyon or tyra~nye ayenst ryght Justyce they them dampnen they haue no power there to co~mytte offycers in ony degree or auctoryte but in so doynge they synne mortally the offycers in lyke wyse in excecutynge theyr other oppressyons by force of armer or otherwy+se in lyke as it was possyble it is deedly synne.
For for yt cause seruyce to do vnto ye comons they holden theyr seygnouryes these rentes these trybutes. these taxes.
If he hath Juste tytle to make warre but in doynge his affeccyon is vnordynate by aua+ryce or other wyse he there may haue deedly synne as well in hym as in them the whiche executen the sayd warre.
Wherefore it is to be noted as to do yt wherof ony warre may be made Justely it behoued that he there haue .vi. condyons that is to vndstande a good wyll desyre to do Justyce wt aucto+ryte of to do this is of the partye of the prynce Also in them ye whiche executen the dede of ye sayd warre ought to be intencyon condycyon.
Intency+on not pryncypally for auaryce or for his propre ve~+geau~ce.
Condycyon yt is to vnderstande yt the persone the whiche maketh suche warre be laye or seculer not clerke in holy ordres.
Also in them ayenst whome a man maketh warre ought to haue some gylte or defaute by the whiche they haue deserued to be punysshed for wtout these .vi. causes warre may not be Juste.
Also it is to be noted yt these subgectes of prynces the whiche ben men of warre be not bou~den to haue all knowlege yf the warre be Juste or vniuste but vnto them it suffysed not to be certayne that the warre yt they make by co~mau~dement be contrarye vnto reason vnto Justyce.
If he hath suffred wyttyngly capytaynes or other offycers that he knowed to be pyllers oppressours of the people he synned mortally is holden with all da~mages oppressyons the whiche by defaute of correccyon ben felonyed.
If he hath suffred co~+mau~ded homycydes mutilacyons flagellacyons or pryson ayenst ryght Justyce or not wtstandyn+ge yt ye cause were Juste he it hath done or made to be done pry~cypally by hate or vengeau~ce it is deed+ly sy~ne moche greuo{us}.
If he hath made or suffred duellaco~ns or ye fyght of two men playes or p~sentaco~ns whiche of theyr condyco~n oftymes ben thyng{is} noysau~tes to ye body to ye soule whiche he myght defende make to cesse it is mortall syn+ne.
If he haue co~mytte ayenst ye chirche caas wherfore a man hy~ may lawfull suspende enterdyte or exco~munycate yt notwtstandynge he hath made masse to be songe in his presence in sustaynynge censures of holy chirche it is mortal sy~ne moche greuo{us}.
If he hath taken co~mau~ded or approued yt clerke or persone relygyous were taken beten or inprysoned in dede not in ryght wtout ye lycence Juste permyssyon of the chirche ouer ye deedly synne he is exco~munycate.
If he hath suffred lawes or statut{is} in his seygnourye ye whiche weren co~tra+ryous to ye lybertees of holy chirche ouer ye mortall synne he is exco~munycate.
Also in lyke wyse yf wt out lycence of the pope concessyon Jurisdycall he hath co~mytte and suffred to be put and imposed vpon the people of the chirche the whiche is not suffred of ryght taxes subsydyes watches serches or other exaccyons after he hath admonycyon to cesse despysed so to do ouer the mortall synne he renned in the sentence of exco~munycacyon yf he hym correcte not within the space of the tyme ordeyned in ryght that soo for to doo.
And also yf by his cryme the cyte the towne or the cou~tre fallen in enterdyte he is culpable of the cessacyon of all the good dedes whiche myght be done had ben done yf it had not ben enterdyted.
Also yf for the censures ecclesiastycalles done to hy~ or to his after ye ordre of ryght he enda~maged or gyued vexa+cyon vnto Juges or mynystres of ye chirche ouer the mortall synne he is exco~munycate.
Also yf he hath receyued suffred open vsurers of an other regyon to dwelle enhabyte in his seygnourye to vse theyr vsuryes hath put no dilygence them to expelle wt in the tyme yt to do¬∑ is ordeyned is exco~munycate And in suffrynge them of his seygnourye to excer+cyse the sayd vsuryes in gyuynge vnto ye permyssyon or consentynge it is mortall synne.
Also yf he extorcyon or dystresse or gyued ayde or consentyng that to do vpon marchau~des or pylgrymes vpon see he is exco~munycate absolucyon reserued to the pope.
Also yf he take retayne the goodes of them which haue had lettynge in torment perdy+cyon of theyr goodes fraccyon brekynge of ves+selles shyppes vpon the see he synned deedly.
Also yf he make to sette on fyre chirches monasteryes or other holy places.
Or yf he do or make to be done wronges fraccyons wtout ye ordre of ryght of Justyce ouer the mortall synne he is exco~munycate yf he be denou~ced for suche by ye dyocesayne the absoluco~n is reserued vnto ye pope.
If he haue letted ye eleccyon of ony to prelat{is} ecclesyastycall malycyously by fere by vyolence or by other cursyd meanes or also to {pro}cure yt ony were chosen ayenst the lyrtees ordynau~ces of ryght or hath gyuen greef or vexaco~n vnto college or vnto ony of them for as moche as men to hy~ hath not obeyed in chosynge after his wyll ouer ye mortall synne he is exco~munycate.
If he hath broken fyled preuyleg{is} of chirche in makynge by vyolence to take ony {per} sone in ye chirche or other place preuylged wtout per+myssyon of ryght he co~mytted sacrylege mortall hym may a man denounce exco~munycate aftr yt he hath ben warned duely to repayre ye forfayte.
If he pylle ye people of the chirche or rauysshe thyng{is} the whiche aperteynen to ye chirche or taked for to mar+ke people of the chirche he sy~ned mortally.
If he hath presented as patron of ye chirche or hath {pro}cured by other yt he which was indygne after ryght were receyued to benefyce ecclesyastycall it is mortall synne.
If he haue taken moneye gyftes or pro+mysses for to present ony vnto benefyce of ye or hath wryten made supplycaco~n vnto the pope or vnto other prelate to benefyce ony whiche of was vnworthy he is symonyacle in mortall syn+ne.
If he hath gyuen ayde fauour or defence to he+retykes or scismatykes in asmoche yt they be suche he is exco~munycate.
If he appropre thyng{is} whiche aperteynen to an other or letted wyttyngly the preuyleg{is} or lybertees of ony it is mortall sy~ne.
If he haue letted by hy~ or by his offycers ony cause were not drawen in ye courte of the chirche in lyke wyse as it aperteyned of ryght he is exco~munycate.
If he hath made or imposed nouelte of lawes whiche ben contraryous to ryght to Justyce it is mortal sy~ne.
he be messenger of an other seyg forthwith hastely sence for to knowe how her lady maystres dyde ye sayd Lou~tesse it was fou~de that at that houre that she vnto her apyred she was deed pyteously.
And this vysyon reherced the sayd lady vnto many in her lyf in ye whiche it apyred yt it is truely sayd yt a fole byleued not soo moche that he receyued.
And vnto that purpose sayth Eusebius in the epystle of ye deth of saynt Ierome that euery persone the whiche exceded in robes in yssues or in other abylymentes worldely be it that the sayd exces be to prayse it may be so grete the affeccyon so moche vndrdyna that it is mortall synne to determyne how moche how the sayd exces is mortall or venyall vnto the regarde of ony persone in partyeuler it is a chyng ryght harde as vnto Jugement humayne.
But as sayth a lawyer named Monaldus the blessyd holy goost teched ma+ny tymes them the whiche ben dysposed that that may not do the subtylyte of the entendeme~t or vn+derstandynge humayne for as moche that it is he the whiche teched all trouth necessarye vnto salua+cyon.
Also sayth our lorde in the gospell vnto the purpose of the horyble dampnacyon of hym the whiche exceded in abylymentes that he the~ whiche hath two gownes is bounde by the lawe of charyte for to gyue one vnto hym the whiche hath none And it ought also to be vnderstanden that he the whiche ouer suffysaunce hath haboundaunce he ought for to ayde charytably vnto chose the whiche ben nedy.
Also ladyes and gentyl women or other women the whiche them appareyle to please men carnall worldely and to the entent that they them coueyten dysordynatly synnen mortally in lyke wyse may it be spoken of men.
By these thyn+ges beforsayd apyred the peryll of those vnto who me it aperteyned to yelde kepe defende Justyce of the grete ylles the whiche may come by theyr defaute as well in them as in theyr subgect{is}.
And therfore sayth well saynt Austyn that grete seygnourye is none other thynge but grete theftes and pyllers yf Justyce reygne not gouerne.
And for a conclusyon to put in this mater cometh vnto my purpose the questyon the whiche saynt Thomas made.
That is to vnderstande yf he ye whiche doth ony thynge contraryous vnto Justyce synned mortally.
For as moche as Justyce ordey+ned these creatures the one ayenst the other after that it is of reason in yeldynge to euery man that that vnto hym apperteyned to do the contrarye wyttyngly it is ayenst the charyte of his neyghbour by the consequent mortall synne for as moche as paradyse is promysed vnto Juste men these vnlawfull vniuste dwellen in helle.
Here foloweth of Juges be they of the chirche or of secularyte.
AS vnto the .viij. poynt which is of them the whiche haue offyce Jurysdyccyon to gyue sentences to make Jugementes.
It is to be no+ted that they sholde take hede ben they of the chir+che or of the secularyte vnto the poyntes folowen Yf he be entred in the sayd offyce by symonye by fraude or by vsurpacyon for than he hath none auctoryte to Juge but in so doynge he synned mor+tally If he haue exceded wyttyngly ye besynes of his co~maundement or of his Jurysdyccyon he synned mortally and ignoraunce vycyous may not hym excuse.
If he by fere by coueytyse by loue dysordynate or other cursyd cause he gyueth sentence ayenst ryght and Justyce wyttyngly it is mortall synne and is bounde for to restore the partye in dammage in caas that he for whome he hath ben Juged wyll not restore hym.
If by his ignoraunce vycyous he hath gyuen fals sentence he ought to dysdammage the partye and synned mortally.
If he haue ben neclygent for to studye and to en quyre the trouth for to yelde and gyue lawfull sen+tence by the whiche neclygence he hath Juged falsely it is mortall synne and is holden vnto the partye as before hath ben sayd.
An other thynge it sholde be of a Juge ouerseen the whiche hath do+ne his deuour for to haue the counseyll of lawyers and clerkes and that not withstandynge hath gyuen fals sentence by symplenesse and not vnto his wyttynge nor by no malyce.
For obedyence ayenst hym the whiche in that hath ben ouerseen and the grete dylygence that he hath done for to enquyre the trouth hym may excuse before god.
And this the whiche is sayd of Jugement contencyons and in outwarde thynges may a man saye of the Jugement of the conscyence the whiche is made in confessyon for euery confessour is Juge ecclesyastycall and spyrytuall.
put that some wyll saye that as well he the whiche enioyneth the offyce of of the confessour as he the whiche it receyued and is not suffycyent that for to do synnen mortally.
But that sholde be vnderstande of those that auaryce and presumpcyon induced that to do and for not of those that charyte inclyned vnto saluaco~n of soules.
put that after good holy intencion in re+ceyuynge or in enioynynge the offyce he may haue so grete dylygence to studye or to enquyre ye trouth yt in gyuynge fals sentence of absolucyon he there sholde haue mortall synne.
If the cou~seyller of the Juge ye whiche Juged is symple of good wyll cou~+seylled ylle by ignorau~ce vicyous or by other maly+ce Juge may be excused in gyuyng fals sentence the which he byleued to be good but the cou~seyller synned mortally in affermyng falsyte for veryte so is holden to restore or to procure restytuco~n to be made vnto the partye.
But yf it be very sembla+ble vnto the Juge that his cou~seyller is not experte in lawes or in customes or hath no reno~me of gre+te Justyce they be not excused one ne the other of mortall sy~ne in gyuynge fals sentence not wtstandynh they byleue yt it be good euery of them is bou~de to restytuco~n not double restytuco~n ought to be made to partye but yf the one restore not other is bou~de to restore If the Juge ordinarye take money or other thynge to yelde Jugeme~t it is mor+tal synne may come in foure maners.
The fyrst for to take moneye to Juge falsely to repayre su+che synne the thynge the which for suche occasyon hath ben gyuen aperteynen after ye ryght{is} vnto the partye whiche is hurte.
Secondly to take moneye to Juge Justele the moore sooner.
Thyrdly to Ju+ge notwtstange that of to do he hath none Juris¬∑ diccyon or puyssaunce.
In all these foure maners testytucyon ought for to be made vnto hym the whiche hath gyuen or vnto the poore after good cou~seyll. and vnto the dede of conscyence.
If he hath not wylled to do sentence notwithstandynge that he it may sholde do it is mortall synne and he is hol+den to restore the partye.
If he were Juge ordynarye hath taken of the partyes other thynge than vytayle the whiche was offred gyuen lyberally and moderatly he there may haue auaryce euyll example mortall synne.
But the Juge deluded the whiche hath not somtyme grete rychesse and hym behoued to ryde and to go out for hym to informe or other wyse by the whiche he may the mo+re largely dyspende than he sholde yf the sayd charge were not suche may take salarye moderate after theyr labours other consyderacyons of the mater subiecte.
If the Juge of the chirche gyue sen+tence of exco~munycacyon of suspencyon or of enterdyte to lyghtly or wtout ordre of ryght or pryncypally by hate by vengeau~ce by fauour or by other cursyd occasyon ayenst Justyce vnto the da~mage of an other ouer the mortall synne he is sus+pende of the execucyon of his offyce and he ought to be condampned after the estymacyon of the da~+made made vnto the partye yf he in suche estate mysbere hym vnto the sacramentes he renned in irregularyte of the whiche he may not be releuyd but by auctoryte of our holy fader the pope.
If he hath suffred wyttyngly to calle before hym aduocates the whiche weren heretykes exco~munycate or paynems.
Yf he hath suffred receyued dylacyons ayenst the ordre of Justyce yf he hath not kept the termes of ryght.
If he haue fauoured the one partye vnto the greef da~mage vnto the other yf he hath made questyons vnto the culpable yt weren impertynentes after the order of ryght yf he hath refused to receyue appellaco~ns yf he ma+lycyously hath gyuen oportunyte for to calle.
If after the legittime appellacyon he hath proceded in cause yf he hath not sought cou~seyll sure certay+ne after as he it may ought to do yf he hath receyued allegacyons scornfull impertynentes yf vnto poore people as wydowes childern faderles moderles myserable persones he hath not gyuen comforte prouysyon of cou~seyll.
In all these thyn+ges other semblables he there may haue mortall sy~ne.
If he hath not punysshed these malefactours or ylle doers after as the ryght the caas it requy+red.
In that may he haue gylte synne in thre ma+ners.
Fyrst for as moche as that to do he hath not puysau~ce or co~myssyon of the prynce but all oonly hath power to Juge after the lawes and customes.
Secondely yf in so doynge he hath done wronge vnto the partye.
Or thrydely yf he haue pardo~ned the caas the whiche ought to be punysshed.
For not withstandynge that of that to do he hath power that the partye so sholde consente yf he myght he synned mortally in pardonynge the caas without punycyon.
In lyke wyse as sayth saynt Thomas in his quodlibet{is} for in pardonynge the caas the whiche is vnto the grete sclaunder of the people fo+loweth defaute of Justyce of reparacyon vnto the comon wele yf he hath augmented diminysshed malycyously the payne or punycyon ye whiche was of ryght he there may haue mortall synne.
Also it is to be noted that caas may happen yt he shall Ju+ge hym yt he knoweth to be innocent in so doyn+ge he synned not mortally.
man proued bereth fals wytnes ayenstony in Jugeme~t of the whiche falsyte ye Juge is ryght certayne so he may not by dylaco~n of sente~ce nor by other meane persuade to the wytnesses for to prouyde vnto theyr conscyence.
Nor may also Justely inno+cent ye whiche is falsely excused wtout doynge manyfeste Iniurye vnto the wytnesses.
Also he may not constytute or ordeyne lyuetenau~t nor to ye souerayne when all these condycyons shall be togyder concurrentes he shall be constrayned to gyue sen+tence after these thyng{is} alledged approued falsely ayenst hym the whiche is innocent in so doyn+ge by his offyce he synned not but may haue mery+te.
And of that opynyon holdeth mayster Frau~ces de maronis saynt Thomas Rycharde de villa noua.
Some holden ye contrarye affermynge yt the Juge sholde sooner suffre deth than to gyue suche sentence.
But ne consente to ye fyrste opynyon in the cause pecuniarie to seconde in the cause of deth or of mutilaco~n.
For as for to lese ye goodes of fortune is oftyme to grete prouffyte of the soule but holy scrypture whiche may not lye forbydeth symply the deth of hym ye whiche is innocent.
By these thynges beforsayd of prelates of prynces of Juges appyred the trouth of the scrypture ye whiche sayth that Jugement ryght meruayllos shall be gyuen vnto them whiche preceden.
That is to vnderstande yf they kepe not ye lygne the purete of Justyce of equyte therfore they ought to fere them humy+le before god the Juge of Juges hynge of kyng{is}. euery creature as moche more as he hath ye mo+re grete charyte of seygnourye of Justyce.
After as sayen these scryptures holy doctrynes of yt to do hath gyuen example the blessyd sone of god the fader Jhesus nazarenus ordynarye Juge of the deed the quyke.
And therfore whan a man wolde take hym for to make constytute hym kynge he fledde in to a mou~tayne to praye vnto god the fader but whan man hym sought for to Juge to put hym vnto deth he hym yelded presented vnto the towne vnto the place where he knowe wel that men hym sholde cause to deye.
In lyke wyse as he wolde saye by an example that moche more Joyously sholde many receyue the deth than prela+cyon offyce benefyce or seygnourye.
By the occasyon of seygnourye of prelacyon cometh many tymes vnto them of suche estate foure ylles.
The fyrst is pryde and elacyon by the whiche proude men of good ryght be compared vnto bestes.
For of the thynge wherof he hym sholde humyle he hym enhaunced and enpryded.
The seconde ylle is the occasyon of the more grete dampnacyon for as it is sayd before the Jugement of those the whiche haue had prelacyon shalbe ryght strayte.
The thyrde is in receyuyng prelaco~n he hy~ byndeth to answere to yelde accompte of his synnes of his subiect{is} The fourth is the slau~der of his subiect{is} the whiche cometh whan ye Juge or the prelate gyueth not the correcco~n doctryne ye whiche aperteyned vnto the offyce or seygnourye.
And therfore sayth well saynt Gregory yt yf these men resonable knowen ye charge the whiche is ye prelacyon they fere neuer haue appetyte it to receyue for as it apyred by the fygure the whiche is in the .xxv. chapytre of ye boke of nombres. xxiiij. thousande men of the pryncypal les of the people of god deyed in one daye for the defaute of good presydentes of good correccyon.
The whiche thynge was fygured of all those whi+che after the example doctryne of Jhesu cryst pre+sumed in pryde in abusynge of theyr vocato~n in the whiche is reserued moche cruell dampnacyon.
But also by the contrarye those the whiche in fere humylyte there do that the whiche vnto them is possyble after god and good ordre of Justyce they shalbe ryght excellently rewarded.
And this suffysed as now of the holy estate of prelacyon.
Here foloweth of aduocat{is} {pro}curours notaryes. ben they in ye courte of the chirche or of secularyte.
AS vnto the .ix. poynt whiche is of these aduocates sergcau~tes prentyses notaryes.
It is to vnderstande yt they sholde fyrst take hede specyally these aduocat{is}.
If they ben of suche co~+dycyon yt the offyce for to be aduocate vnto them be defended by ryght or by custome as sholde those be yt ben exco~munycate heretykes or religyous but for theyr monasterye of the co~mau~dement lycence of theyr prelate.
For suche people the whiche myshere them for to aduocacyer synnen gretely also done they ye whiche vnto yt them receyuen wyttyngly.
If he be in holy ordres or in lesse wt benefyce it is to hy~ enterdyte ye aduocacyer in laye courte except in his owne cause or for his chirche or in ca+se of pyte in ye cause of them yt ben poore.
Also the Juge may not aduocacyer in the cause yt he ought to Juge.
Also an aduocate beuefyced in ony chirche may not after ye ryght aduocacyer ayenst his chirche wtout it be for some the whiche sholde be of the sayd chirche yf otherwyse do to his wyttynge that may be mortall synne by reason of ye contemnement.
If aduocate or procurour sustaynen wyttyngly cause vniuste it is mortall sy~ne is holden to restore vnto ye partye all the da~mage the whiche vnto hym cometh by cause of that or to induce the partye yt he susteyned to restore in dede ryally.
If he enterpryse to sustayne cause yt he byleued somwhat to be good Juste but in procedynge he it knowed to be fals he ought incontynent to cesse not in shewynge the trouth vnto the partye aduersarye but vnto hym for whome he hath pleated in inducynge hym to apoynte with the partye.
For yf by his cou~seyll or ayde the partye is enda~maged or leseth the cause ye whiche was good Juste he is holden to make restytuco~n or to enduce hy~ of whome he sustayned the cause yt to do.
But durynge yt the cau+se was doubtfull a man it may sustayne pleate wtout synne.
If in pleatynge he hach co~mytte falsy te as in producynge fals wytnesses or consented yt to do or hath cou~seylled his partye for to lye or to alledge a thynge the whiche was fals or is ayded falsely of lawes the whiche were not to purpose or also of probaco~ns be it in ye waye of ryght or of de de.
If he hath sought dylaco~ns cauyllaco~ns ayen ryght or for to gyue costes vexaco~ns to ye partye in the cause ye whiche was not Juste yf he hath ap+peled of Juste sente~s wytty~gly.
If he hath ben slouthfull to studye to susteyne to kepe ye good cause by his de+faute by slouth partye hath ben in da~mage he there may haue mortall synne is bou~de to make restytuco~n.
If he hath shewed enalycyously ye secrete of his partye to ye partye aduersarye by yt whiche cometh costes damag{is} it is mortall sy~ne ought to make restytuco~n.
If he hath lost ye good cause by neclygence by vnfaythfulnes or by his vycyous ig+norau~ce is holden to restore all ye da~mages whiche by cause of yt cometh to ye partye.
If he see knowe poore peple which may not pursue defende theyr good cause for as moche as they ben poore seeth yt none vnto them gyueth socour ye whiche thynge he may well do than he synned mortally yf he do not vnto them as he wolde yt a man dyde vnto hy~ in caas semblable after the lawe of charyte.
If he haue taken excelsyue salarye he there may haue mortall synne the salarye may be Juged excessyue or competent after the cause ye labour the faconde of the aduocate also after ye custome of the contracte may make couenau~t of the pryce wt hy~ the whiche vnto hym toke cause before yt the cause is co~menced or after yt it be fynyed.
Not after yt it is co~menced hangynge in ryght so as sayen ye ryghtes it is not lawfull to make couenau~t that the aduocate haue the tenneth or the hondreth or other partye determyned but all oonly of ye pryce named certayne.
If ony lawyer gyue counseyll how ony cause yt whiche he knoweth vniuste may be wonne he synned mortally yf it so happen he is bou~de to restore ye partye as it is sayd of ye aduocate.

Also as vnto these procurours yt is to vndstande yf he haue procured wyttyngly in the fals cause or by neclygence hath lette lose the good yf he hath not gyuen ayde comforte to the poore yf he hath ben excessyue in salarye be it sayd as of the aduocate.
Also as vnto bayllyfes notaryes yf he hath done treason in his offyce as in falsefyenge a good lettre or not wyllynge to shewe lettres certaynes or regystres or hath not wylled to teche in lyke wyse as he sholde or hath taught yt that he sholde not or hath ben ignorau~t to regestre or to endyte by the whiche cometh often processe debates by the whiche the partyes rennen in grete da~mages or hath ben neclygent or slouthfull for to spede yelde his actes.
In all these thynges he there may haue mortall synne is holden to resto+re the da~mages the whiche ben come by his defaute.

If he hath not kept ye solemnyte requysyte as wytnesses of othes these other thynges the whiche ben of ryght he breketh his othe sy~ned mortally more ouer is holden to restore ye da~mages that folowen.
If he passe the testament of an vsurer or symonya+cle he is forsworne synned mortally.
If he be suf+fycyantly waged in courte or in co~munyte yt not wt standynge he taketh salarye of the partye or yf he be waged yf he be excessyue in salarye or wryteth on the festes or holy dayes by auaryce to gete without necessyte suffycyante he there may haue mortall synne.
If he hath spoken or wryten statutes ayenst the lybertees of the chirche ouer the mortall sy~ne he is exco~munycate.
If he be notarye of the bysshop waged suffycyantly yt not wt stan+dynge he taketh salarye for these lettres of ordres he is symonyacle in lyke wyse in losse gaynse in the moneye that the bysshop taketh by symonye If ony doctours in lawes or in physyke hath receyued in his scoles lectures wyttyngly relygyous or preestes seculers or other clerkes in offyce of dygnyte of the chirche as well he as the sayd scolers ben exco~munycate.
Also what so euer doctour yt receyued wyttyngly any relygyous yt whiche hath not lycence of his prclate is exco~munycate.
Also yf he hath made paccyon to rede by suche wyse that a man vnto hy~ shall gyue a chau~trye he is symonya+cle how be it a man may ordeyne yt the chau~trye whiche than sholde be vacante shall haue from now forth suche charge that he the whiche shall ha+ue it shalbe bou~de for to rede.
Also yf a man ensure or yf a man promytte ony pryce for lycence for to rede it is mortall synne theyr falled pryuaco~n of offyce of benefyce.
How be it yt it is not propre+ly symonye after as sayth Hostience.
Also to take or to gyue moneye for lycence for to leue ye lecture in ony daye of feest ye whiche is of ye co~mau~dement of the chirche it is symonye.
If he hath wages or be nefyce suffycyent for to rede yt not wt standyng he taketh salarye it is symonye is bou~de to restytuco~n but yf he haue not salarye suffycyent he may take salarye of his scolers by suche wyse yt he be suf+fycyent in the faculte yt he enterprysed yf he hath receyued maystershyp offyce to rede he is not suffycyent.
In that he there may haue so grete insuffysau~ce yt it is mortall synne.
And specyally in the scyence faculte of theologye for the peryll of soules.
For a man putted fayth in a doctour by rea+son of degree of offyce.
And more ouer those the whiche hym receyuen or Justely in suche degree or offyce ben cause of ye ylles whiche therof may come he there may haue mortall synne.
If he hath appe+tyted ye degre offyce to rede by ambyco~n or for auaryce or for other cursyd cause he there may haue mortall sy~ne.

And ther+fore euery man sholde studye to knowe hymselfe for to correcte hym amende and it suffysed as now of the mater of the scolers.
Here foloweth of phisicye~s many other vocaco~ns AS vnto the .x. poynt the whiche is of phisycyens it is to vnderstande yt the physycyen may synne in many maners ye whiche folowen.
If he be put to excercyse the offyce whereof he hath not the scyence.
For it is vnto the grete peryll of the helth or of the lyf of his neyghbour.
Also in gyuynge cou~seyll for the helth of the body the whiche is con+traryous vnto the helth of the soule.
Also in not kepynge by the co~maundement of the chirche the whiche is suche that is that he ought to shewe the syke persone after the dysposycyon in the whiche he is to seche pryncypally fyrst the medecyne spy+rytuell.
Also in not aydynge the poore after the ne+cessyte in the whiche he them seeth yt he it may sholde do after the lawe of charyte.
Also in geuynge medecyne vndyscrete vnto the grete auenture of deth.
In all these thynges many other as sholde be in auauntynge hymself in dyspraysynge other of his vocacyon there he may haue suche exces that it is mortall senne or so lytell yt it shall not be but venyall.
And lyke Jugement ought to be of potyca+ryes also of those ye whiche sellen wt weyghtes or other mesure ye whiche mixte medlen theyr stuf in doynge there decepcyon cursydnes oftyme there falleth restytuco~n.
If the tauerner or hosteler hath done fraude decepcyon in geuynge one ma+ner of wyne for an other or hath put water in it gyued to vndstande the contrarye where there is a medled thynge ye whiche may be noyous vnto the helth of them the whiche it drynked or hath made fals mesure or hath myscou~ted to his wyttynge or hath receyued wyttyngly rybaudes men women players of the dyce or of other game or gyued his wyne vnto them yt he seeth well that they wyll be dro~ken or also vnto theues or wasters or blasphemers of god the whiche he may well put out of his house.
And generally in all craftes all marchau~+dyses in all estates degree of euery vocacyon of secularyte or of the chirche he may bete downe cur+syd auaryce in lyke wyse as sayth holy scrypture the whiche is none other thynge but to loue wt out ordre those thynges worldely temporall.
And for as moche as it is impossyble vnto nature humayne to lyue in this worlde without loue all those the whiche loue not god soueraynly as it is sayd in the fyrste commaundement fallen necessaryly in loue dysordynate of thynges erthely and temporall.
Of the whiche loue also as the lyuely fontayne pceden all these ryuers of symonye ot vsury of rauayne of theeft of fraudes decepcyons in dyuerse marchau~dyses fals pletynges exaccyons pylleryes other dyuers inuencyons whiche bet+ter semen to be deuylshe than humayns wtout no~+bre wt out mesure of whiche inco~uenynce syn+nes the soule may not be loused repayred ayenst his creatoure yf he retorne not from suche loue by true repentau~ce in makynge restytucyon of the whiche it foloweth here after.
¬∂Here foloweth of restytucyon necessarye vnto sal+uacyon of those the whiche withholden from an other.
FOr as moche as to restore an other it is necessarye to saluacyon of soules the whiche thynge seche vnderstande pryncypally in al the processe of this present boke it behoued to saye some thynge.
And fyrst it is to be noted yt to put out to take to rauysshe or to wholde ony thynge ayen the good Juste wyll of hy~ to whome suche thyng aperteyned it is to do a thynge ayenst charyte by the consequent mortall synne.
For after lawe dyuyne also of nature noo man ought to do to his neyghbour yt yt he wolde not or wyll not vnto hym sholde be done.
More ouer it is to be noted yt there is thre maner of goodes of whiche some may be inda~maged that is to vnderstande goodes of the soule as ben graces vertues spyrytuelles good renowne.
These other goodes ben those of nature as helth beaute of body.
And the thyrde goodes be named goodes of fortune as ben good{is} erthely and temporall be it golde syluer or other goodes meouables or herytag{is}.
And in euery of these thre maner of goodes cometh by defaute of reason of charyte yt oftymes vnto hy~ enda~maged ye other by the whiche he behoued to make restytucyon due or to be vniuste before god by yt consequent culpable of deth eternall for whiche deth da~pnaco~n to eshewe ouer these thyng{is} beforsayd as well in the viij. co~mau~dement as in the mater of vsurye of sy+monye of dyuers estates vocaco~ns here before put folowen some caas of the sayd restytuco~n mo+re in partyculer.
Here foloweth of restytuco~n of ye goodes of ye soule AS vnto ye restytuco~n of ye goodes of ye soule is fyrst to be noted yt suche good{is} may not be lost but in geuynge them consentyngly to sy~ne And therfore he ye whiche induced my persone vn+to synne in geuynge hy~ cou~seyll co~mau~dement example or occasyon to synne by ye whiche he leseth the goodes of soule is of as moche the more bou~+de to restore as vnto yt maner of da~mage of as mo+che as goodes of the soule ben more worthe than those of the body or of the worlde.
The maner of restytuco~n ought to haue conformyte to ye maner of ye da~mager for yf he hath ylle cou~seylled he ought it to reuoke to gyue good cou~seyll.
If he haue gy+uen euyll example he ouggt to gyue good.
Also he ought to praye for ye conuersaco~n of ye persone yt he hath made to synne in reco~mau~dynge hym or her vnto god to these holy persones for in suche case a man hath more sooner stryken downe than releued.
And saynt Austyn sayth yt he the whiche doth not his deuoure for to restore in caas in the ma+ner beforsayd may not haue remyssyon.
If he hath dyffamed his neyghbour in puttynge on hy~ cryme whiche is not trewe he it ought to reuoke before persones to whome he hath tolde sayd cryme specyally yf he byleue yt by his wordes they be sclau~drers of persone to whome he hath imposed cry+me also yt he may do it conuenyently.
For in dyffamynge his neyghbour by suche maner he is moche more greuously enda~maged as yf he had lost myllyons of gold of syluer.
If he hath spoken of an other the cryme whiche was trewe but yt notwtstandynge it was secrete he it ought to reuoke not in saynge yt he hath lyed spoken falsely for than he lyed vnto his wyttynge whiche thynge he shol de not do for to saue lyf of all those yt ben lyuynge but he sholde saye yt he hath ylle sayd yt he it re+pented.
And he ought to induce those to whome he hath spoken dyffame of his neyghbour not to beleue it by the whiche it appyred ynough yt this case here is neuer the lesse harde to repayre well notwt+standynge yt the dyffame imposed is not trewe.
If he haue wtsayd or denyed ony of that that he vnto hym imposed in ony cryme in open audyence the whiche was trewe but wtstandynge it was secrete.
Than he is the imposau~t knowynge of the cryme of the sclau~dre the whiche is moche grete ylle infamye suche caas is ryght harde to repayre for both tweyne ben fallen in to inco~uenyent the one in imposynge openly theyr caas whiche was secrete that he myght not proue the other in agayne sayenge it the imposau~t knowynge that he is amys thynker.
And saynt Gregorye sayth yt notwtstandynge that he ye whiche is accused openly of the thynge whiche is secrete he it may denye after the maner that suche caas vnto hym is imposed.
How be it so he it ought to confesse to make satysfaccyon and so he ought to repayre the honour of the imposau~t vnto his power not in auowynge that he hath sayd trouth for a man may well some tyme holde his peas of the trouth but not to telle a lye.
But he may and sholde speke seme wor+des sobre and couered as in besechynge the herers that they be not euyll dysposed or euyll content of the imposau~t for he ymagyned to haue power to proue cryme that he imposed.
And for to abredge this mater it suffysed as now for these grete and subtyle doctours with grete payne and dyffyculte determynen the mater of the myserable synne of fals enuyous langage.
But many confessours ta+ken but lytell hede and therfore they put not the re+medye and the restytucyon the whiche is necessarye that proceded of theyr ignoraunce of the synne of detraccyon the whiche is at this daye to moche comon.
And therfore sayth well the holy scrypture that by the synne of fals langage almoost all the worlde perysshed for with grete payne and also as of the lest parte of that is made trewe restytucyon.
These thynges beforsayd sholde be vndersta~+de of cryme the whiche is a grete mortall synne for yf ony man hath despysed his neyghboure by the whiche he myght be the lesse praysed he hym ought to prayse honoure dyscretly as well ayenst hym as ayenst other.
And this may suffyse for to repayre the dyspysynge that he vnto hym hath do ne before.
Here foloweth of the restytucyon of goodes as vnto the body.
AS vnto the restytucyon of the goodes of na+ture is to be noted that some may be enda~+mage in his body in thre maners.
The fyrste is whan a man taketh from hym his lyf.
The secon+de whan a man taketh from hym ony or many of his membres.
The thyrde is in betynge hym hur+tynge wtout sleynge hym or wtout depryuynge hy~ from the vsage of his membres.
Restytucyon for the deth of ony persone may not be fou~de more su+re or more certaynet han yt the which is ordeyned taxed of god in these holy scryptures as well of the auncyent testament as of the newe.
That is to vn+derstande he the whiche hath done homycyde recey+ue in gree inpacyence the deth the whiche vnto hy~ shall be gyuen by Justyce.
But yf suche penaunce vnto hy~ be not gyuen or for as moche yt the dede is secrete or for as moche yt he asketh his grace of the prynce the whiche vnto hym it may do gyue.
The moost certayne penau~ce after that beforsayd shall be yt he amende his lyfe in desyrynge to deye for the fayth comonly ayenst these myscreau~tes by suche dyscrecyon euermore yt he slee not hymself or cause to be slayne vnto his wyttynge.
For yf he so sholde do he sholde be the sleer of hymself.
And in caas that he take not suche penau~ce as it is sayd that in geuynge lyf for lyf neuer may he all holy be acquyte in this worlde as vnto the payne deyte But well ayenst god as vnto the regarde of ye gylte not for to be fynally dampned.
And yf the per+sone were slayne of suche condycyon that he sustey+ned nourysshed fader moder or childern or other housholde the moder is holden yf vnto hym it be possyble them to susteyne mary the doughters supplye as vnto that all other charges that the persone susteyned after that it is well possyble in suche
In this dyffyculte of restytu+cyon appyred the lytell oyscrecyon of many confessours the whiche oftymes assoylen more lyghtly for the deth of a man than they sholde do for the deth of an hou~de or other beest in lykewyse as declared the Scotte in the .xv. dystynccyon of his quart.
And than for as moche that wt grete payne may he bere so grete charge it is there expedyent vnto saluacyon to take the deth in gree after the ordynau~ce of Justyce.
Restytucyon for the mayme of ony persone ought to be done after the exces of the sayd mayme the whiche is so named for as mo+che as ye persone maymed leseth all holy the vsage of some or of many of his membres.
Also in suche restytucyon a man ought to consydre the state of persone enda~maged for the poore labourer the whi+che by that hath lost his hande sholde haue more grete harme than sholde a man gretely ryche.
Also yf he lye in bedde the stryker ought for to paye the Journeys of the surgyne wt these other necessytees so as sayen the ryghtes or elles the restytucyon is not suffycyent.
AS vnto restytuco~n for these thynges tem+porelles it is to be noted yt in lyke wyse as to take fro~ an other malycyously it is deedly sy~ne transgressyon of ye co~mau~dement of god.
In lyke wyse to wholde fro~ an other ayenst ye good ordynate wyll of hy~ to whome ye thynge apperteyned it is mortall synne.
By the whiche it foloweth yt durynge the wyle in suche wyse to retayne from an other there is no power in heuen nor in erthe ye whiche hym may assoyle for ye co~mau~dement{is} of god may not be chau~ged or varyed by dyspensacyon or other wyse by the whiche more ouer it appyred yt it is truely sayd of good ryght.
Yelde or hange whe+re the deth of helle shall abyde.
In this mater of restytucyon ye whiche is moche necessarye ben to see to note foure thynges by ordre.
The fyrst is whi+che is he that ought to restore The seconde is what thynge he ought to restore.
Here foloweth of hym ye whiche ought to restore AS vnto the fyrst is to vndstande not alone+ly he ye whiche hath taken fro~ the other ayenst reason Justyce is holden to restore but wt yt many other maner of persones as he ye whiche gaue co~mau~dement that to do wtout the whiche co~+mau~dement takynge had not be done.
Also yf he hath gyuen cou~seyll comfort ayde defence or yf he hath hydden thynge taken stolen or rauyshed wt these malefactours or yt he hath taken gayns or parte vnto the sayd theeft he is holden to restore.
Also yf he sholde prohybyte may defende by the auctoryte of his offyce as these lordes prelat{is} to the regarde of theyr subiect{is} or theyr offyeers or he the whiche sholde be lawfully requyred to saye the trouh of the theeft wyll not it confesse.
All these condycyons of persones be named flaterers consenters euery of theym is holden to make hole re+stytucyon by suche wyse yt yf they were many one restored all holy they ben all acquyted ayenst hy~ vnto whome ye da~mage hath ben done as in regar+de to make restytuco~n but euery of them is bou~de vnto hy~ the whiche them hath acquyted of the por+cyon the whiche vnto hym may apperteynen.
Here foloweth what thynge ought to be restored AS vnto the seconde poynt ye which is what thynge ought to be restored it is to be vnd+stande that yf the thynge stolen is of suche condycyon that it may bere fruyte as is londe or beest{is} it ought to be restored with the fruytes ouer the da~+mages other partes that myght haue ronne vnto hym vnto whome the sayd thynge apperteyned An other thynge it sholde be to haue purchased he rytages or possessyons with syluer stolen for it shall suffyse to restore the somme of moneye with the da~mages Justely estemed that he myght haue ronne in da~mage.
AS vnto thyrde it is vnto whome restytucyon ought to be made it is to vndstande after ryght reason it ought to be made vnto hym the whiche hath ben endamaged or vnto his next enherytours yf he were or yf suche restytu+cyon sholde be made so longe yt the dyspenses shol+de amou~te more or as moche as thynge stolen vn+to whome he wolde go for to seche ye places the or yt a man knoweth not to whome to re+store than a man sholde gyue to poore ye thynge or the value the whiche ought to be restored for the spyrytuell welth as well quycke as of them yt ben deed vnto whome myght apperteyne the sayd restytucyon.
Some hath wylled to saye yt the restytucyon of suche thynges to the partye incertayne ought to be made by the ordynau~ce of prelat{is} or other Justycyers.
But saynt Thomas the Scotte sayen that it is not of necessyte but it may be done by the good dyscrecyon of hym ye whiche is bou~de to restore be it by hymself or by other.
Also it is to be noted that yf ony stele from a theef the thynge that he hath stolen a man it sholde restore vnto hy~ vnto whome it apperteyned of ryght or ye whiche it wtholdeth vnder ye forme of preste or of gage.
Here foloweth wha~ a ma~ ought to make AS vnto the fourth the whiche is to knowe whan a man is holden to restore it is to vnderstande that it is not lawfull to reteyne fro~ an other houre ne moment whan he vnto whome he ought to make restytucyon wolde Justely that yt sayd restytucyon vnto hym be made allo the withholder hath place tyme space and puyssau~+ce that to do for it shall be well lawfull for some circu~staunces to dyfferre to make restytucyon as whan he vnto whome it ought to be made wolde or sholde wyll after good reason that it be dyfferred or for as moche that it sholde be vnto the grete preiudyce of the comen wele.
He the whiche sholde be in the warre in the seruyce of the kynge the whiche hath dystressed ony lawfull marchaunde of the so~me of an hondred crownes the whiche may not be restored without sellyn+ge hors harneys of armes by the whiche it shall be vnprouffytable vnto the welthe of the comon people and that restytucyon may be occasyon of ryght grete ylle in all the royalme.
For by the defaute of one nayle a man leseth a shoe by a shoe an horse by an horse a man by a man a bataylle by a bataylle a royalme.
By the whiche it appyreth that the marchaunde sholde more loue that restytucyon were dyfferred for the greate comon welth than his owne wyll were accomplysshed for his lytell welth partyculer.
And therfore in suche caas and other semblable he may well dyfferre restytucyon with purpose to restore in place and in tyme.
Also restytucyon may somtyme be vnto the grete peryll and da~mage of hym vnto whome it is done as the glayne to a man at the houre that by fury he wolde kylle an other.
Also some may be of suche condycyon that yf he restored vpon ye houre he sholde renne in grete shame or in grete da~ma+ge he vnto whome he sholde make restytucyon nothyng or lytel of profyte sholde haue.
By ye whi+che it appyred yt after charyte reason he ought to attende place tyme oportunyte in that that resty+tucyon vnto hym be made after good charyte rea+son in lyke wyse as it apperteyned.
By these thyn+ges beforsayd appyred ynough yt yf the thynge wtholden hath ben taken secretly it ought to be yelde secretly as vnto hym ye whiche hath no power to restore vnto hym it suffysed vnto saluacyon to haue dyspleasure of the caas with purpose to yelde as many tymes often as he shall haue oportunyte as it is sayd he may reteyne his necessyte corporell as of drynke of meete of cloth not to lyue delycyously or to holde grete estate habou~dau~ce of an other mannes goodes.
If ony were in extreme necessyte by the whiche he sholde take ony thyn+ge fruytefully for to ayde hym in suche necessyte he shall not be holden to yelde it notwtstandynge that afterwarde he hath well the power but yf he hath taken before suche necessyte in the whiche he falleth afterwarde durynge the tyme of that necessyte he shall not be holden to restore but afterwarde yf he haue power than he shall be bou~de to restore.
If a woman maryed conceyue of an other than of her husbonde caas is stronge to remedye of yt may come grete ylle da~mage as well vnto the husbonde as to ye very enherytours by ye which it foloweth that the woman may not recouer salua+cyon yf she make not restytucyon.
But of maner many grete theologyens lawyers it determen dy+uersely.
The Scotte is of the opynyon that suche woman is not holden to declare herself neyther vn+to her childe but it ought to shewe dyscretly be it sone or doughter for to put hym in the estate of the chirche and to leue the herytage vnto other or yf she may not vnto that come and that she be ryche of meouables and of herytages she ought with out her to declare testament or other wyse to recompense as moche the husbonde the whiche hath had the charge of the auoutrye as also the enherytours after as she may goodly.
Raymonde sayth that yf it were very semblable that suche infante fered and loued god and were persuasyble the moder myght make suche processe that is to vnderstande that before her confessour the moder the childe now hauynge age dyscrecyon them sholde present that that the confessour make the chil+de to swere that he shall holde secrete the thynge that he vnto hym wyll declare vnto the prouffyte of his soule.
Also to make the moder to swere that she shall saye without ony malyce the trouth.
And than these thyng{is} done sayd mod may well swere yf she be well certayne yt the sayd infante is not of her husbonde ye whiche thynge alwayes sayd infant is not bou~de to byleue in suche maner yt by that he is bou~de to forsake his herytage.
But yf he it byleue he it forsake he dooth well and merytoryously.
Other hath wylled to saye that yf the woman the husbonde were of suche condycyons that she were also as gouernouresse that vnto hy~ were very semblable yt she hym sholde pacyfye than for the surete of conscyence she it myght declare manyfeste more ouer to remedye caas for the best yt it sholde be possyble.
By these thynges before sayd appyred as to gyue true sure remedye in that caas it is a thynge ryght harde consyderynge the varyaco~ns of ye circu~staunces the dyuerse con+dycyons of the persones.
Appyred also ye horrybyly te of ye synne of the brekynge of maryage ye grete theeft dampnaco~n of men wo+men.
If ony lette draweth backe an other to entre in to good relygyon approued wtout Juste cause resonable he synned mortally.
If he do ony vyolence to the persone late entred in to religyon ouer the mortall synne he is exco~munycate so is bou~de to enduce that persone that he hath withdrawen myscou~seylled or other to entre in the sayd rely+gyon and in caas that he may not make suche induccyon he there sholde entre hymself yf he haue not lettynge suffycyent lawfull for elles he maketh not restytucyon suffycyent vnto relygyon.
If he haue letted ony to come vnto benefyce of the chirche vnto maryage vnto the purchase of herytage or of other thynge he that do pryncypally for to anoye hym or pryncypally for his synguler prouffyte wt yt in awaytynge to anoye an other by suche condyco~n yt he hath not done ye sayd lettyn+ge but for to anoye an other he is bou~de to restore after the arbytracyon of people of reason and of good conscyence.
But yf he haue letted an other not by intencyon and wyll to anoye hym but for the prouffyte of hym or of his he is not in nothy~+ge holden to restore for euery man may procure his prouffyte by wayes and meanes lawfull and honeste notwithstondynge by the occasyon of that cometh some lettynge in da~mage vnto his neygh bour yf he hath stolen a lytell hogge of ony lytell valour from the houre that he hym taketh and afterwarde hym nouryssheth tyll vnto the valoure of ony grete somme he is not holden in dede of conscyence for to restore but onely vnto the valour of the beste at the tyme that he hym toke And alyke thynge it sholde be of a colte or other beestes or to haue helyd or nourysshed or elles to better the thyn+ge stolen or rauysshed and by the thynge contrary yf the thynge stolen be impeyred he ought it to re+payre and so is holden of the da~mages the whiche may be comen vnto hym vnto whome aperteyneth the thynge stolen for by cause of the sayd theft.
Also yf suche thynge stolen perysshe by fortune or ellys yf it abyde alwayes he the whiche hath stolen is bounde yf he hath not done his deuoyre to offre restytucyon before that the thynge perysshe.
The whiche restytucyon he that is enda~maged hath not wyll it to receyue yf he hath boughte wyttyngly the thynge stolen or rauysshed the whiche other wy+se aperteyneth not vnto the seller and hath inten+cyon to bye it and retayne for hym selfe ouer the mortall synne he is holden it to restore vnto hym vnto whome apertayneth the thynge so bought or vnto the inherytours or vnto the poore as it hath ben sayd before without power to repute the pryse that he hath gyuen but onely vnto hym the which hym hath made suche sale.
Also more ouer he is holden to kepe harmeles and warande hym vnto whome appertayneth the thynge stolen where soo euer that he become but yf he it boughte in good intencyon that is to knowe for to yelde it and vn+to that that it were not all loste he there may Just+ly repute the somme gyuen or yelde alonely the sur+plus that it may be worth and yf he can not fyn+de hym vnto whome suche thynge appertyneth yt so~me of the surplus ought to be gyuen vnto the pore. but yf he hath bought thynge the whiche hath ben stolen the whiche he byleueth to be of loyalte he is not holden it to restore tyll vnto that that he be certefyed of the trouth but after that he is duely certefyed than he is holden it to restore and that durynge the tyme that he byleueth that the thynge was of loyalte it peryssheth or were consumed in parte or in all he is bounde to restore alonely the party with the fruytes that he hath in tyme that he byleued that the thynge was solde truely Also they that eten and drynken of the rauen of the thefte be~+holden to restore vnto the estymacyon that they ha+ue taken excepte those the whiche ben in grete necessyte and vnto whome it may be very semblable that it shall please well those vnto whome ye sayd thynge rauysshed or stolen appertayneth as it shol+de be prechers or other the whiche entende to endu+ce these theuys to amendement vnto restytucyon also the wyse chyldren the seruau~tes of those the whiche haue all theyr goodes of thefte as is that of vsury of symony or of rauen ben holde~ to restore after the valour that they may haue of the sayd thefte be it in drynke meete to hose to cloth or otherwyse but onely in as moche as they haue laboured and take payne by ammonycion or other wyse that restytucyon were made vnto the partye Also yf with the goodes the whiche were euyll go+ten there hath some the whiche were truely goten they may adresse theyr intencyon to lyue of those goodes and not of the thefte or they may lyue wt theyr laboure or they sholde demau~de prouysyon of Justyce yf they may not lyue by ony of the wayes before sayd they sholde more sooner demau~+de almes than to lyue of thefte but alonely in the case of extreme necessyte.
Also ignorau~ce may excuse as moche the persones before sayd as also ye poore the whiche receyuen and demau~den almes Also yf he haue founde ony thynge the whiche ap+pertayneth vnto a nother he co~mytteth thefte in it agayne reason agayn the good wyll ordeyned of hym vnto whome suche thynge may appertayne and therfore yf he know not vnto whome it appertayneth.
he it ought to ma+ke to be cryed in open places and yf the partye be not founde after the taryenge suffycyent it ought to be departyd vnto the poore by good dyscrecyon And fynder may abyde by longe tyme with gode and prompte conscyence it to restore as oftymes as many as the partye shall be fou~de another thy~+ge it shall be of thynges founde the whiche hath not other tymes be in the possessyon and domyna+cyon of ony persone for than he that fyndeth may retayne in ony place where as yf it sholde be olde auncyent tresours fou~de in ye herytage of another For after the lawe cyuyle the halfe apertayneth vn+to the lorde of the herytage and the other parte vn+to hym the whiche hath founde it.
And vnto that purpose it semeth to besayd in the parable of the euangelyste that yf ony fynde a tresoure in a felde he goth and byeth the well of the herytage in the whiche the tresoure is hydde and than he is lorde of the tresoure as well by the reason that he it fou~+de as by reason of the possessyon of the herytage. Also the fynder may be so poore that he may after the good counseyll of his prelate or confessour retayne the thynge founde specially whan he knoweth not vnto whome to restore it Also the thynge founde may be of so lytell valoure that a man ought not to forme conscyence of it to restore.
but whan the wyll shall be suche that a man shall take wylfully a more grete thynge or that suche lytell thynge a man byleueth to do iniury and dysple+sure vnto hym vnto whome it appertayneth than he there may haue mortall sy~ne were it for a thorne for a nedyll or for a nother lytell thynge for his wyll is more weyed before god than is the werke outwarde yf he hath taken theuysshly of godes of hym the whiche vnto hym oweth ony somme tyll vnto the pryce of the dette or lesse after good co~scyence consyderynge more ouer that he can not well paye hym without plee or other lettynge the maner of that to do it is yll and synne for by the fere of god pacyence in his da~mage he may purchase grete meryte.
But neuertheles in suche case he is not holden and bounde to restore hym more ouer some sayen that yf for suche maner of takynge theuysshely the sentence of excomunycate were caste he the whiche hath taken as it is sayd is not acursyd for holy chirche intendeth not to bynde by suche sentence but those the which witholdeth fro another agayne reason malycyously The whiche thynge doth not he the whiche is payed as it is sayd notwithstondynge that after the lawe ciuyle he sholde be culpable and punysshed how be it it foloweth not that he falleth in the sayd sentence he sholde take hede vnto whome suche case sholde come that he gyue not in that doynge sclaunder or euyll example vnto his neyghbours yf he be an offycer and he take gyftes or seruyces for to do ple+ser vnto ony vnto the preiudyce of Justyce and to the dammage of another it is deedly synne.
Also yf by thretenynges or otherwyse he extorcyoneth gyftes promysses Journeys. or other thynge notable he ought it to restore how be it for his payne or some pleasure done resonably he may receyue that that he vnto hym shall gyue lyberally The+se lordes of the chirch or of secularyte may receyue the amendes after yt they ben taxed in theyr courtes be it by ryght or by good custome soo that it be not done by hate or by couetyse or by other cursyd occasyon and it is good counseyll to departe suche amendes vnto the power specyall whan the amen+des surmonteth the da~mage yf he hath vsyd wyt+tyngly of a thynge lent ouer the termes and wyll of the lener he synneth mortally and is holden to make satysfaccyon yf the thynge lente impeyre or is all loste he is holden it for to restore yf that he hath lente wyttyngly ony thynge As a tonne that is musty to put in wyne or an horse another thynge by the whiche cometh da~mage vnto hym the whiche borowed The lener is holden to kepe hym harmeles.
Also he the whiche is hyred for to wynne in Journey to do ony werke as he ye whi+che vndertaketh to carye to~nes of wyne or voweth to do other thynge he is holden to restore the da~ mages the whiche cometh vnto the sayd werke by his defaute and notellys yf he haue taken to kepe ony thynge he it ought to yelde excepte some case The fyrste whan it shall be yelde vnto the grete yl or da~mage of hym vnto whome a man sholde yelde as it sholde be to yelde the glayue vnto a man furyous The seconde whan a thefe hath gyuen to kepe his thefte a man it sholde yelde more sooner vnto the very lorde.
The thyrde whan the gyuer it sholde forfayte by the whiche his goodes shold be in lyke wyse forfayte In a nother maner he whiche taketh it to kepe ought it to restore how be it that the thynge perysshe or were losse by his defaute or by case of fortune yf he take salarye for the kepynge or yf he were vnto that bounde or for that that he yelde it not at the terme that he sholde yelde it and for a rule generall in this mater it is to vnderstonde that the thynge lente put in kepynge or hyred abyde vnto the peryll of hym the whiche it gyueth yf it be not by bergayne made bytwene the gyuer and the receyuer or for the gylte and the defaute of hym the whiche it receyueth or for his longe abydynge.
And also euery man is holden for to restore that that he hath receyued by bequeste or by ony playe of those the whiche hath loste theyr wyttes naturall or that ben wasters chyldern faderles and moderles and yonge folke vnder the yeres of .xxv. or the whiche were in fra~ne+sye or dcef do~me blynde or in syknes perpetuall for all these before sayd be not proprely lordes of theyr goodes by maner that they them may alyen without the ordynau~ce of them vnto whome it ap+pertayneth ordenarely and in lyke wyse the seruy tour the chylde the whiche is in the housholde and gouernaunce of his fader the woman maryed the monke and he the whiche hath the admynystracyon of the goodes of the chirche as those whi+che haue the rentes and benefyces of the chirche
All these maner of people may not Justely alyen the goodes in the whiche they ben subiectes to theyr souerayns agayne the Juste wyll and resonable of them be it of the mayster of the good man of the house of the husbonde of the abbot or of the pope And these the whiche wyttyngly receyuen vnduely of suche maner of persones ben holden to make re+stytucyon.
Also all those that wynnen in playes of the dyse or the cardys ben holden for to restore whan by cursyd couetyse by fraudes by force or by Importunyte they haue enducyd theyr partye to playe or that they haue made decepcyon in the ma+ner of playe another thynge it sholde be to playe fordysporte or for recreacyon in playes honeste not defended for some lytell thynges after the con+dycyons of the persones as for the dyner or for souper amonge lordes or ryche people the whiche attende more the dysporte recreacyon than they do the gayns or losse for in suche case there shal not fall no restytucyon put that he there may ha+ue there venyall synne.
Also it is to be noted that pyllers rauysshars of goodes the whiche pyllers ben knowen and publysshed the whiche hath ben warnyd duely it to restore and they haue no wyl it to do whan they sholde and may yf in suche estate they comen vnto the dethe and than they wolde well make restytucyon but they may not nor sholde not be buryed in halowed grounde notwithston+dynge that they haue ben assoyled and receyued the body of oure lorde.
Also those the whiche recey+uen gyftes and knowen well that they done more by fere than for loue or the gyuers ben deceyued in wenynge to gyue vnto one and they gyuen vnto another as yf ony by mysthynkynge or fyccyon hym calleth the kynnysman of ony or affermeth to be poore and indygent and is not so as ben ma+ny trewandes and dronken beggers the whiche oftymes demaunden almes and it receyuen of ma+ny the whiche ben more nedy than they ben.
Also suche maner of people ben holden to make restytucyon for the gyuers ben co~strayned for fere of mo+re losse or deceyued by ignoraunce.
By the whiche it foloweth that that the whiche they gyuen is not proprely gyuen for euery gyfte ought to procede pryncypally from the fontayne of loue.
Also these the whiche maken and edefyen waremes douue houses vnto the grete da~mage preiudyce of hys neyghbour wyll not repayre da~mage whyche foloweth synnen mortally Of weremes and douue houses auncyent some sayen that whan it is very se~blable yt they which kepe herytage ner hest and neyghbours they ben caste vnder in that for as moche as they holden theyr herytages of lesse pryce or for other good cause.
Than the lordes of these douue howres and of these waremes be not holde~ them to restore.
Also those the whiche holden and nourysshe bestes noyous as sholde be a wulfe a be+re or a dogge the whiche byteth ye people or estran+gleth ony fame beestes or an oxe the whiche stryketh with his hornes ben holden to repayre the da~mages the whiche the sayd bestes done.
Also those the whiche by huntynges enda~magen gretely cornes grasse or other labourages in brekynge hedges closynges ageyne the wyll of the labourers ben hol+den it to repayre And those the whiche without ne+cessyte lefull or suffycyent leuen the offyce of holy chirche in festes and dayes co~maunded to halowe. synnen mortally.
And also those the whiche them obeyen of theyr good wyll so to do.
Also those ye whiche haue the patrymonye of Jhesu cryste that is to vnderstonde the goodes the whiche comen of ony benefyce of the chirche the whiche ouer the sustentacyon resonable of the mynystres of the chirch apperteynynge vnto the poore geuynge and depar+ten the sayd good vnduely as in pompes in exces of clothes of wynes or of meetes or them gyuen or dystrybuten vnto theyr ryche frendes for them to augment or ennoble or in other folysshe vsages agayne the wyll and ordynaunce of holy chirche co~+mytten sacrylege and ben holden to restore for the sayd goodes be not vnto them otherwyse than it is sayd and for to admynystre theym in werkes of charyte and of pyte.
And it is well to be noted yt the restytucyon the whiche he ought to make of suche goodes euyll dyspendyd may not be made of the sayd patrymonye for yt sholde be of anothers But yf they the whiche ben fallen in to suche inco~+uenyent haue patrymonye in secularyte or dyspose them to wynne by other maner they may them acquyte of the goodes the whiche vnto them shall co+me of the other partye as of chirche or he ought to restrayne tyll vnto the valour of that the which ought to be restored of the thynge the whiche vnto them was well lauwfull to take for them in pita~ce and in vestymens yf they were not fallen into sayd inconuenyent more ouer sayen the ryght that those the whiche haue patrymonye in secularyte may well haue patrymoneye in yt holy chirche not for to do with it theyr propre wyll but alonely for to departe them vnto the poore Also folysshe women ryche Also iogelers the whiche haue receyued vnduely as it is sayd the goodes of holy chirche ben holden them to restore not vnto the persone of the chirche the whiche them hath gyuen but vnto the prouffyte of that chirche whiche by that was endammaged or ellys they ben sacryleges.
Also those the whiche receyuen the goodes of holy chirch without there doynge the seruyse the whiche apper+teyneth be holden to restore.
for these goodes temporall ben gyuen for them the whiche done the ser+uyce dyuyne in holy chirche.
And therfore sayth ye holy scrypture That the whiche laboureth not sholde not ete And also it sayth blyssed ben they ye whiche wynne theyr lyuynge in labourynge with theyr handes.
By this thy~ges beforesayd appereth the malediccyon of those the whiche haue ye godes of the chirche without there doynge the seruyce of nobles the whiche haue re~tys and renownes taxes and subsydes without defendynge kepynge and conseruynge theyr people of freres beggers why+che haue the habyte and not the obseruau~ce of holy relygyon of trewandes knauys other questours the whiche by euyll thynkynges and ficcyons abusen the people by theyr auaryce For all these maner of people ben holden to make restytu+cyon after the good ordenaunce and dyscrecyon of confessours vnto whome submytte as well these thynges before sayd in the exposycyon of the co~maundementes as in this present mater of restytucyon.
Also it is more ouer to be notyd for the tyme the whiche is nowe that in lyke wyse as in the tyme of Noe regned and abounded lechery the whiche was by the Justyce dyuyne punysshed.
And in the tyme of Abraham and of Loth regnyd ye horryble and stynkynge synne agayne nature.
And in the tyme of Moyses and of Aaron murmuracyon agayne god also ydolatrye.
Also in the tyme of souerayne bysshoppes scrybes pharisees ouer these euylles regnyd enuy cursyd auaryce whiche thynges were the occasyon of the deth of our sa+uyour Jhesu cryste.
Also in lyke wyse who answereth of ryall veryte to ye fygure of olde seynge the+se euylles regne togyders eche of the~ more euyll than euer were afore by ye whiche it faylleth not to bry~ge in doubte ye crystyente dyffygured is not co+me in these dayes holy scrypture sayth which be~ soueraynly to redoubte for as moche as it is certayne that god shall do suche punycyon and shor+tely that there was neuer thynge lyke for it apper+tayneth vnto the Justyce in fynyte to gyue the payne of sy~ne who answereth vnto the gylte of vnky~+denes and iniquyte.
Jhesu cryste the mayster and lorde of trouth hath taught vnto crysten men and women soueraynly humylyte and the worlde vn+to the contrary hath taken pryde bostynge vanyte Also he hath shewed soueraynly pouerte and these worldly people hath auaryce of whome proceden vsury symony rauens fraudes trecheryes and theftes without nombre and without ende.
Also vnto vs he hath shewed souerayne obedyence and drede and the worlde by the contrarye hath taken all rebellyon agayne his holy co~maun+dementes in lechery and in carnalyte without hy~ reknowlegynge and without retournynge hym to the fruyte of very penaunce and of pyte and of co~+passyon after the forme maner that those dayes were clerely shewed in the holy euangelyste by the whiche of good ryght he entytleth and nameth the syxte estate of holy chirche as vnto the congregacyon of those that ben acursyd.
The grete Babylonye moder of these fornycacyons and of these ab+homynables of the erth.
Babylonye is by interpretacyon confusyon the whiche was neuer so grete in the transgressyon publysshed and manyfested of holy dyuynys co~maundementes and by the con+sequent the dampnacyon of soules and specyally by cursyd auaryce and of defaute of correccyon and of parfyte restytucyon for as men sayen comenly hym behoueth to yelde or to hange or the deth of helle to abyde.
OVer these thynges before sayd in the .viii. co~+maundement the synner ought to take hede vnto these poyntes that folowen.
The fourth is of pariurynge As the fyrste it is to vnderstonde that there ben thre maner of lyenges as to speke ge+nerally.
The fyrste is yt the whiche beryth noysau~+ce vnto ony personel and is alwayes mortall sy~ne whan a man doth it wyttyngly for suche an ente~te and is co~mytte in thre maners of the whiche the fyrste is yll The seconde is wors The thyrde is worste of all.
The fyrste is the lye by the whiche a man doth noysau~ce vnto one and doth prouffyte vnto another The seconde is that by the whiche a man doth noysaunce vnto another without prouf+fytynge another.
The thyrde maner is that whi+che is contrary vnto the holy fayth catholyque as ben herytykes the whiche sowen errours and fals doctrynes somtyme for to come vnto theyr lecheryes as those the whiche affermynge that symple fornycacyon is not mortall synne or that the synne of lechery is not so grete or so greuous In lyke wy+se as sayth these holyscryptures these prechers the whiche it co~dampnen somtyme suche is commytte by suche lyenge couetyse As ben those the whiche prechen vnto ye sy~ple people as for to gyue some syluer or other thynge temporall in takyng theyr indulgencis they purchasen theyr absoluco~n a pena et aculpa in hydynge from them the trouthe and geuynge them to vnderstonde that by the vertue of the indulgence he is pardonned a pena aculpa the whiche thynge is false for the vertue of these indulgences may not be vnderstonde but vnto the payne temporall of those the whiche ben in the estate of grace and by the co~sequent without the gylte of mortall synne and of suche prechers there ben at this daye without nombre thorowout crystyente after as the gloryous saynt Petyr hath lately prenounced.
The seconde maner of lyenge is that the whiche is done by dysporte and is commytte in two maners.
The fyrste by dysordynate pleasure that a man taketh in tryfylles talkynges.
The seconde by a desyred dysordynate and to please the herers rehersynge fables or dysportes in these two maners may he haue mortall synne or venyall after the cyrcumstaunces of the dysordenaunce and of the mater of whiche a man speketh or of the persones of the whiche a man speketh or vnto whome suche lyes ben tolde.
The thyrde maner of lyenges is that by the whiche a man prouffyteth vnto ony persone in sauynge him his goodes temporall as golde syluer or other thyn+ge or to chastyse his body or his lyfe corporall. and it is to be noted yt for asmoche as to lye it is to saye some thy~ge to byleue or vnderstonde yt it is not so as a man sayth affermeth it is impossyble to lye wytty~gly in ony maner wtout mortall synne or venyall the whiche thynge he sholde not do for to saue all those yt ben lyuynge.
man may some tyme hyde the trouth but not to lye without grete synne to saye false for dysportynge or for to prouf+fyte vnto ony persone without noysau~ce vnto another it may be venyall synne in lay people and seculers.
But with grete payne is lyenge in people of perfeccyon wtout mortall synne as sayth Bona+uenture fra~coys de maro~nes vpon ye thyrde of sentences of the whiche the reason is asmoche for sclandre of theyr as for the perfeccyon of the estate of relegyon by the whiche ryght desy+rously euery relegyous ought to kepe hym from the tellynge of lesynges yf it vnto hym be very sembla+ble yt in so doynge he gyueth euyll example ma+ter of sclandre specyally vnto people feble and sellers the whiche lyghtly maken of a lytell occasyon theyr euyll prouffyte another thynge it is to go a backe with ony fable.
The whiche as well in the intencyon of the saynge as in the maner and vnto the purpose to speke it semeth well to be rehercyd for a fable for in suche maner of lyenge is not pro+prely to lye for as to lye it is to speke agayne hys conscyence in gyuynge falsely to vnderstonde vnto the herers and in the recytacyon of suthe fables where the speker wylleth for suche to be vnderston+de it is not mortall synne after Thomas mayster Alexandre and the Scot.
Also in another place sayth saynt Thomas that a man may lye mortally as well by wrytynge by abylemens by to+kenes and by operacyon.
as a man doth in wordes For a man that is do~me may well synne mortally in his maner to lye Also lyenge is pryncypally in speche In lyke wyse symulacyon and fyccyon ben in operacyons Ypocresye is one maner of symula+cyon but all symulacyon is not ypocresye as to kneele to ioyne the handes to stryke his breste in to+ken of deuocyon the whiche is not in the persone but the dede for some euyll ende as for to be hyred and preysed for to come vnto offyce or vnto benefyce of the whiche he is not worthy it is mortall synne after the Sootte and saynt Thomas.
speche in paraboles or by symylytudes as to saye one thynge for to gyue to vnderstande vnto a nother it is not of hym the lye or synne for our lorde the whiche may not lye nor synne fayned before hys dyscyples that wolde go forth from thens in fygurynge and wyllynge to gyue to vnderstonde yt yet was he ferre from theyr vnderstondynge by ve+ry knowlege of the true fayth Also forto hyde the trouth in wordes couerte he may do wtout ly~ne spe+cyally mortall.
For the holy scrypture reherseth of the holy patryarche Abraham that he counseylled his wyfe that she sholde saye vnto the Egypcyens that she was his syster and in that doynge there was trouth hydde and trouth wrapped for as moche as she was his wyfe ryally and his syster in na+ture humayne or also for as moche as au~cyently those of one selfe lygne as were Abraham and his wyfe callyd eche other brothers and systers and in lyke maner to saye is founde in many other places of holy scryptures.
Also a man fyndeth another maner of lyenge ye whiche may be called iactance is commytted in spekynge or ymagenynge of hym+selfe more grete thynges than there is of goodnes of nobles of prowesse or of vertues and after the greuousnes of the circu~staunces it is oftyme mortall synne.
Also to saye of hymselfe ony thynge of his feblesses and necessytes or of his synnes or to take vestemens of ab eccyon to ye ende that a man be renommed and reputed humble abiecte grete thynge in merytes and deuocyons before god the whiche thynge is not suche as a man it sheweth yt may be mortall synne and suche synne is named yronie not that the whiche is of gra~mare by the whiche a man sayth one and gyueth to vnderstonde the contrary for the maner and for the purpose in the whiche a man speketh the wordes as to saye alas that thou arte a good man or thynge sembla+ble ye whiche is asmoche to saye that he is nothy~ge worth and there he may haue synne yf suche thy~ge be sayd malycyously for to de fame another it sholde be yf for to repreue or for to teche a man vsech in suche maner to speke a man may more ouer doubte of a preest or of another persone the whiche is in the estate of grace and sayth his confyteor in aduouynge that he is a synner in dede in worde and in thought and in all maner of synnes to knowe yf he saye trouth or lye and yf he oughte so to assent or otherwyse The answere the preste speketh in the persone of all them that ben crystenyd in whome be it in one or in another ben all maner of synnes Also sayth saynt Austen that in one only synne a man may truely consyder many synnes For he that synneth mortally is a man kyl ler For asmoche as he putteth his soule the which is the doughter of god with all the blyssed trynyte by creacyon vnto deth spyrytuall.
Also he co~mytteth thefte or sacrylege for as moche that he taketh as well from god as from the holy chirche ye thyn+ge the whiche vnto them appertayneth agayne ye wyll of the souerayne lorde That is to vnderston+de hym selfe and the honoure and obedyence that he oweth vnto god.
Also he co~mytteth baudrye auorye for as moche as he gyueth and subdueth the soule the whiche by the of the passyon and of holy baptem was the of Jhesu crist vnto the rybaudrye and auowtry of soules.
That is to vnderstonde of the ennemy of humayne lygnage.
Also he lyeth and breketh the fayth promysed vnto baptesme and is apostate of the holy catholyque also of other synnes by suche maners spyrytually to vnderstonde that who so co~mytteth one mortall synne he hym may knowe in all with out lye after these thynges before sayd is to be no ted that euery true crysten man ought to be verytable as well before god as before man.
And also in his owne conscyence in dedes in wdes and in abyllementes and in his countenau~ces In lyke wyse as in all these thynges he may co~mytte lyenge fyccyon and duplycyte of the whiche thynges yf they ben come a man ought him to repente purge confesse Also yf he hath ben called for to bere wytnes before a Justyce he wyll not saye trouth the whiche vnto hym was demaunded or to lye to his wyttynge vnto the da~mage of another and in doynge irreuerence vnto the Justyce ouer ye mortal synne and the payn of infamye he is holden to dyl da~mage the party yf he hath lyed in confessyon of that the whiche was nedefull of confessyon it is mortall synne and is not assoyled of that he hath confessed yf he hath accusyd ony falsely agayne the ordre of charyte agayn the Justyce or agayne the prelates it is mortall synne yf in prechynge he hath sayd false wyttyngly it is mortall synne ano+ther thynge it sholde be yf by surrectyon sodenly he sayth a thynge false.
AS vnto the seconde poynt the whiche is of detraccyon it is to vnderstond that detrac+cyon is to reherce yll of ony in his absence and to the ende and intencyon to mynysshe his good reno~+me or vnto that he be the lesse praysed And for as moche that good reno~me is the moost grete good that persone may haue in these thynges temporalles it foloweth that to take the good reno~me from ony it is agayne the ordre of charyte as whan it is by pryde by enuy or by vengeau~ce or other cursyd cause it is mortall synne and aman is holden to restore the good reno~me so as it may be possyble and as it hath ben spoken before and therfore ought well to take hede the whiche wyll well hym co~+fesse yf he haue imposed vnto ony the thynge the whiche ought be mortall synne the whiche thyng was not true or yf it were true it was secrete For than yf he it publysshe it is mortall synne not wt stondynge that the synne were publysshed as oftymes as he it reherseth by hatered or by enuy it is mortall synne how be it he is not holden to restore yf he haue rehersed the yll or synne of his neygh boure by the maner of comen langage not hauyn+ge intencyon hym to defame or hym for to annoye it is comenly ven yall synne yf he hath reherced fraylte and imperfeccyon the whiche is of it selfe venyall yf he do.
it not agayne charyte as for to defame or to lette his neyghboure from ony good yf he haue wylfully herde the detractoure or hym enducyd wyttyngly that to do or vnto hym hath shewed by ony token that langage hym plesed or hath not hym repreuyd whan it was a persone the whiche he myght and sholde do it is mortall synne another thynge it sholde be yf he lefte hym to repreue by a maner of fere humayne or that vnto hym it appertayneth not yf he hath causyd wrytynges dyffamatyues for to be founde in place openly or hath made or spoken songys rymes or mockeryes for to dyffame or to mocke ony persone it is deedly synne yf he hath sayd that the good werkes that ony persone doth that it is by fantasy or by ypocresye or hath not wylled to saye or to co~+fesse the goodnes the whiche was in another hym to excuse or to delyuer frome ony opprobe whan there was place and tyme it is a defaute of chary te And by the consequent it is mortall synne.
To tell and reherce the yll of another by compassyon vnto these prelates or vnto other the whiche that may remedy it is no detraccyon but charyte and of tymes necessary vnto saluacyon for who loueth his neyghboure he ought to remedy his inconueny+ens.
AS vnto the thyrde the whiche is of the syn+ne of adulacyon or of flaterynge it is to be noted that somtyme it is venyall synne and some mortall synne and is defendyd in this present com+maundement and it may be co~mytte in thre maners Fyrste whan a man preyseth ony persone for to please hym in that the whiche is mortall synne for that sholde be agayne the honoure of god and the goodnes and charyte of his neyghbour.
Seco~dely for the reason of the intencyon of the flaterer it is to vnderstonde whan by his adulacyon flate rynge he entendeth to dysceyue his neyghbour and hy~ for to anoye corporally spyrytually.
Thyrdly whan the flaterer gyueth mater or occasyon by his adulacyon to synne mortally And how be it yt he intendyth not by suche manere of flaterynge to make his neyghbour fall in to mortall sy~ne: Neuer theles the thynge in whiche he flatereth may be of suche condycion that that notwithstondynge he sholde synne mortally In other maners of adula+cyon and flaterynge is comenly venyall synne AS vnto the fourth poynt the whiche is of periurynge it is to vnderstonde that periu+ryng is none other thynge but to swere falsely the whiche thynge he may do in thre maners.
The fyrste whan the thynge that a man swereth is not true or a man byleueth that the thynge is not soo as a man affermeth by his othe and also it is a lye to afferme by othe and therfore to swere it is none other thynge but to calle the trouth of god to wyt+nes that the thynge that a man affermeth or that a man denyeth is suche as he sayth hymselfe to per+iury is asmoche to saye as god is wytnes of the fal+syte the whiche thynge to saye or assent is moche horryble blasphemynge and irreuerence done vnto god the whiche is trouth infynyte and therfore it is mortall synne whan he doth it by delyberaco~n Secondly whan the thynge that a man swereth is contrary vnto reason and vnto Justyce as it shold be to swere to do synne or thynge vnlefull in so do ynge it is irreuerence to doo vnto god the whiche wyll not approue the yll and also it is mortall syn+ne as in the maner precedent.
Thyrdly whan with+out cause and reason good and suffycyent a man accomplyssheth not that that he hath Justly promysed by oth and therfore it is mortall synne wha~ it is done by delyberacyon for yf by precypytacyo~ or surrepcyon in worde wtout consentynge of wyll a man swereth false or thynge unlefull that is no mortall synne¬∑ the whiche is neuer co~mytte but by delyberacyon and consent of wyll.
But here is well to be notyd that in lyke wyse as an harper stry+keth the strynges of his harpe by delyberacyon and the one after the other in dyuerse alteracyon me+lodye Also as without arestynge or thynkynge on that he doth and he maketh suche delyberacyon by his habytuacyon and maieste of the whiche he is to prayse In lyke wyse is it of the delyberacyon that a man hath to do well or to do yll for in lytel tyme also as imperceptyble a man may haue de lyberacyon suffycyent to co~mytte mortall synne in cursyd werkes as is to swere in vayne and hymself to forswere or also for to seche merytes in good werkes as is to praysed god By the whiche many grete and solempne doctours in holy theologie aftermen and shewen that to swere without prouffy+te and necessyte in comen langage notwithstondynge that the thynge that a man swereth be true and that a man is not dysposed otherwyse as it is sayd be it by custome vnto the whiche a man putteth no payne to resyste as a man sholde it is the transgressyon of the co~maundement of god and by the consequent mortall synne for it is not lefull to swere That is to vnderstonde to calle the trouth of god vnto wytnes yf there be not thre co~dycyons The fyrste is that the thynge that a man swereth be verytable.
The seconde that it be a thynge Just and lawfull for euery true thynge is not Juste ne good to speke morally.
The thyrde that notwith+stondynge that yf ony be true Juste as it is true and Juste that the daye the whiche was yesterdaye is paste and that the daye of the morowe is comy~+ge.
How be it it suffyseth not of suche trouth for to swere well surely but with that it behoueth that swerynge be made in Jugement.
That is to vnder stonde with dyscrecyon in aduysynge yf there be ne+cessyte or prouffyte for hymselfe or for his neyghboure suche that the trouth infynyte oughte to be called to wytnes by othe what so euer it be. for who that swereth by these sayntes or other creatures heswereth alwayes pryncypally by god the whyche hath made and mayntenyth suche creatures And therfore sayen as well these doctours of theo+logye as of the trouth and ryght whan of these thre condycyons before sayd or many That is to vnderstonde veryte Justyce Jugement or dyscresyon dyffayllyng it is to swere in vayne agayn the co~maundemente of god and abusynge is to swere but whan an othe is made with these thre condycyons a man may well swere surely and the+re he may haue meryte In lyke wyse as by the faute of the one or of many it is grete irreuerence done vnto god and transgressyon of his lawe by the whiche it appereth clerely ye grete perell of da~p+nacyon vnto those that can but in swerynge also as at euery worde for a thynge of nought but they sayen that it is not but of custome and that they do it not by delyberacyon the which is none other thynge to saye but to excuse and encreasynge of theyr synne How be it well it may happen that he the whiche hath very dyspleaser of suche cursyd custome and purpose hym to absteyne in tyme to come that yf he swere by ouersyght and by labytuacyon of his cursyd custome of the whiche thynge he sholde be dyspleasau~t whan he knoweth it for to swere Than it is not to saye that in wyle to swere in vayne were synne or at the is not but venyall synne but it is not to doubte that those the whiche hauen suche purpose.
and dyspleasau~ce shall be in shorte tyme as in half a yere or lesse moeuynge ye ayde of god hym to dys+custome vnto the whiche dysacustomau~ce be not many comen in the espace of. xx. or. xxx. yeres but for the contrary many that ben aged gone from yll vnto wors notwithstondynge and inspyracyons god vnto them sendeth from yere to yere and from moneth to moneth By the whiche can not ymagen that suche crysten people ben in the waye of nor that they may perfytly resyste vnto the deuyll ne resyste vnto theyr cursyd custome yf they laboure not fyrste parfytly to put them in the estate of grace without the whi+che a man may not begyn to do well and therfore sayth well the wyse Lathon that he is the frende of god the whiche can gouerne well his tonge and suche is begynnynge of all holynes of lyfe And for to shewe that the holy goost apperyd inse~blaunce of tongys vpon the appostles the whiche ben and were the pyllers and the foundars of holy chirche after Thesu cryste and the swete vyrgyn his moder in she wynge in lyke wyse that yf the holy goost gouerne not the tonge with payne may it be but that it be the instrument of the deuyll embracyd with the fyre of helle as wytnesseth saynt James in his canon who so hath not begynnyng of good lyfe That is well and holely to vse with his tonge may not haue good meane that is to vn+derstonde the grace of god for to come vnto the ho+ly ende the whiche is the glorye of paradyse wher fore sayth well holy scrypture that he the whiche swereth often shall be fulfylled with iniquyte and that fynably the punycyon of god shall come vpo~+hym.
Some doctours of our tyme seynge ye multy tude of chose the whiche were often in theyr come~ langages without prouffyte and necessyte and mo+re ouer consyderynge theyr estates theyr scyences and theyr degrees as ben many people of the chirthe as well regulers as seculers and some doctours in dyuynyte in lawes Lyuiles and in decret{is}.
Also noble people aduocates and other indyuers esta+tes amonge whome there hen many the whiche ha+ue grete tolrenes to fere and to god haue made grete admyracyon in this mater and haue fere to gyue sentence that suche people ben all in way of perdycyon for theyr abusynge to swere in vayn and without dyscrecyon but the honoure sauyd of werlres¬∑ pyteous lesse admyracyon in that ought to be made that in the sentence of blyssed Thesu cryst irreuocall the whiche is suche Multi sunt vocati pai vero electi.
And is as moche to saye many of the people ben called ryght fewe there are that ben saued or in another maner and vnto oure purpose many there ben that ben baptysed and the whiche sholde neuer swere in vayne and ryght fewe there are that it wyll kepe Also it is a comen sentence and a conclusyon certayne yt as oftymes and as many as in the of the fayth or of good maners these doctours holden dy+uers oppynyons of the whiche the one certayne and sure to holde for to kepe hym from synne and that the other oppynyon conteyneth in hym doubte hogely where that it is synne.
a man is holden in suche case vpon payne of mortall synne to holde party certayne and to leue the doubtous for it is he dysposeth vnto the peryll of mortall synne and by the consequent dyspyseth his saluacyon. /: Now is it so that some hath wylled to saye that to in vayne as it is to swere in comen langage the thynge the whiche is not necessary nor table it is not but ynne.
That is to vnderstonde to swere without dyscrecyon and for thynge of no prouffyte it is the transgressyon of the co~maundement of god by the consequent mortall synne after the forme the which hath ben before put and declared Of the whiche opynyons the one is ryght sure and ryght certayne that is to eschewe suche swerynge in holdynge the doctryne of oure sauyoure and redemptour.
Thesu cryste put in the gospell there where it is sayd that oure maner of speche is harde or not without other maner of swerynge yf there be no necessyte.
The other oppynyon the whiche sayth suche maner of swerynge in comen langage that the whiche is true put that it were not prouffytable or necessyte it is but venyall synne it is hogely doubtous.
Specyal+ly after as Thesu cryste vnto vs hath declared in this mater his holy wyl as it is sayd By the whi+che to do the contrary indyfferently it concludeth in it selfe the dyspysynge of god and of his conscy+ence and for as moche after the sentence of the doc+tours to holde suche oppynyon and it to vse it is for to synne mortally And yet for the more certay+ne to shewe that suche maner of swerynge vpon co+men langage by custome and without necessyte it is a thynge ryght peryllous and reprouable.

BY these thynges sygnifyed in these conclusyons and auctorytes as well of holy scrypture as by doctours before sayd alleged appereth cle+rely that all those the whiche haue suche cursyd custome to swere for nothynge and without necessyte And wyll not labour to correcte theym dyspysen god and theyr saluacyon and by the consequent synnen mortally and me semeth also as Impossy+ble to byleue that the persone the whiche is in mortall synne may leue the euyll custome to swere with out cause and necessyte for the deuyll of hell ye why+che tormenteth spyrytually suche maner of people he aydeth the more easely from theyr membres for euen in lyke wyse as a man putteth a bytte of a bry+dell in the mouth and vpon the tonge of a greate stronge and terryble hors by the meane of the whi+che a chylde lytell of aege and in myght hym torneth and retorneth and holdeth stedfaste.
In lyke wyse doth the deuyllin puttynge cursyd custome to swere and offalse langage in the tonges of those that he possedeth by the whiche he them ledeth and bryngeth agayne from synne to sy~ne all at his wyl by suche maner yt there is no doctryne excused nor puyssaunce humayne yt whiche may or can stoppe and refrayne suche tonges so enfla~med and gouer+ned by the spyryte of deuyll that they doo not the operacyon of hym the whiche them gouerneth as is to lye to backbyte to fors were hym to mocke and all other maner of folysshe and abhomynable langages of whome proceden other ylles innumerable.
In lyke wyse as it appereth by thyrde cha+pytre or the canon of saynt James and this is as at this tyme as vnto the synne to swere and to for swere folysshely the whiche thynge weyed and ad+uysed a man hym may well confesse.
OVer these thynges spoken in the .ix. co~maan+dement the synner ought to take hede vnto the poyntes the whiche folowen.
That is kno+we yf he hath desyred by consentynge and delyberacyon to accomplysshe the synne of lechery or yf he haue delyted in carnall thoughtes and for to vn+derstonde and well to Juge of suche wylles whan it is mortall synne or alonely venyall The whyche thynge is ryght harde it behoueth fyrste to vnderstonde thre thynges the whiche ben in vs defferences The fyrst is sensualyte the whiche is none other thynge but the .v. wyttes of nature with theyr operacyons as is the syght the taste the herynge the smellynge and the touchynge In these fyue thynges we and these bestes ben comen The seco~de thynge the whiche is in vs is the lawe porcyon of reason the whiche is a lyght of knowledge of our operacyons and dyscrecyon naturall of thynges sensybles in the whiche we surmou~t these bestes. /: The thyrde thynge is the souerayn porcyon of rea+son the whiche is a lyght by whiche we haue dys+posycyon to vnderstonde these thynges spyrytuall¬∑ dyuyne and eternall the whiche porcyon may be anormed of the noble vertu of the fayth catholyque and enformed of the trouth of the co~maundementes of god and than she may and ought to haue do mynacyon and rule as well the sensualyte as the lawe porcyon of reason and all theyr operacyons or yf there be defaute or neclygence of the deuyll of hell allyed of the sensualyte and of the mondanyte of this present lyfe putteth in oftymes the con+cupyscence carnall and temporall by ye wyndowes of the soules the whiche the fyue wyttes of nature before sayd to the ende that the lawe porcyon of reason there taketh pleasure dysordenate be it in drynke or meete or melodye of sou~dys or in towchynges or other pleasures sensualles and that she induceth the hyghe porcyan to gyue consente in su+che pleasure dysordenate is dyspleasau~ce vnto god after the forme that tho dayes Eue presented vn to Adam the beaute of the apple and the swetnes of the taste vnto the whiche thynge he condystendyd and consented agayne the co~maundement of god by the whiche all humayne lygnage was dam+ned yf god by his mercy infynyte hadde not reme+dyed.
By Eue a man sholde vnderstonde as well the sensualyte as the lawe frayle porcyon of reason and by Adam the souerayne porcyon this is the foundacyon to vnderstonde whan these sy~nes whiche be co~mytted alonely in the wyll ben mortal or venyall for in the oonly pleasure of the sensualyte he may not haue mortall synne But yf the pleasure of the thynge deffended as is lechery thef+te or propre vengeau~ce cometh tyll vnto the lawe porcyon of reason and in that doynge aresteth and abydeth in hym there in delytynge before that souerayne reason may or ought to haue suffycyente aduertyssement it is venyall synne comenly But yf souerayne reason is notally neclygente to repreue and agayn saye suche pleasure dysordenate by the whiche neclygence and defaute the reason inwarde abydeth and delyteth in sayd dysordenau~te how be it that the accomplysshynge of the dede hym dyspleaseth and it agayne sayth than is that mortall synne after the comen sente~ce of doctours for hye porcyon of reason is in blame for as moche as she hath not ben inough dylygent to repreue and to put out the peryllous pleasure the whiche was comen into the inwarde reason suche nec+lygence may be named consentyngly by interpretacyon Bonauenture sayth in this mater that many suche thoughtes to be alonely venyall synne The whiche hath ben well Juged they ben mortall synnes wherfore in suche doubte a man hym ought delygently to examen and hym to confesse as of mortall synne. for in all cases of conscyence the whiche ben doubtous a man is bounde to chese the moost sure partye.
Also it is to be noted that oonly wyll fully determyned and dysposed to acco~+plysshe ony mortall synne is mortall synne of suche condycyon as hadde be the the synne yf that it hadde ben accomplysshed by werke.
As for an example yf ony hadde wyll to haue company carnall of a vyrgyn he co~mytteth the synne of defflo racyon yf with ony of his kynred it is inceste yf with ony relegyous it is sacrylege and so vnto the synne of thefte and of other commaundementes But in that vnto suche dyfference that the synne the whiche abydeth alonely in the wyll is not punysshed of the payne canon or Cyuyle as sholde be the wyll with the dede An example oonly wyl to bete a clerke or to slee hym agayne the ordre of charyte suffyceth not for to renne in the sentence of excomunycacyon or for to be reserued vnto ye pope or vnto the bysshop and therfore a symple curate hym may assoyle and so of other case.
Also it is to be notyd that yf ony persone hath wyll to accomplysshe mortall synne suche wyll may be interrept and deuysed in many maners.
Fyrste by wyll con+traryous as is true contrycion and dyspleaser to haue hadde suche wyll and after suche contrycion of newe retorneth vnto that cursyd wyll of synne.
And than they ben two mortall synnes in asmoche that suche wyll drowe backe in the maner spoken.
Secondly she may be interrupte by dyuerse thoughtes and occupacyons woldly as for to slepe to drynke or to ete or for to speke with other per+sones by suche wyse that as many tymes often the temptacyon retorneth vnto the mynde the wyll is dysposed to accomplysshe the synne and than af+ter some doctours they ben as many of mortall sy~+nes as the sayd wyll hath ben interrupted oftymes Other wyll saye that it is but one mortall synne of as moche the more greuous as it hath ben by lo~+ge tyme contynued and therfore the longe abydy~+ge and frequentacyon of suche temptacyon ought to be confessed and dysclosed after that it is possyble vnto the fraylte of the mynde humayne by su+che maner that the confessour dyscrete may vnderstonde the multytude or the greuousnes of suche synne for ellys the confessyon sholde not be suffycyent for that that a man is bounde to tell all his synnes as vnto the nombre.
Also yf suche cursyd wyll were applyed agayne many persones agayn one after vnto another they sholde be as many synnes mortalles as they sholde be of persones but yf suche wyll be applyed vnto many persones by one oonely operacyon that sholde not be but one synne as to the operacyon of the wyll but it shold be many as vnto oblygacyon of payne and vnto ye deformyte of synne as for example.
Some harlot seeth .vi. wymen of the whiche the one is in wydo hode the other in maryage the other a vyrgyn so in other dyuers degrees and that he hath hadde a wyll and consentynge to desyre to haue theyr co~pany carnall vnto the regarde of one that sholde be auowtry and vnto the other defloraco~n and so of other dyuers degrees And a man ought to vnderstonde these thynges spoken of cursyd wyll as well of the concupyscence carnall defended in the ix. co~maundementes as of the concupyscence of couetyse defended in the .x. Here foloweth of the .x. co~maundement.
Ouer these thynges spoken in the .x. co~maundement it is to be notyd that oonely wyll to stele is thefte and mortall synne. and of that espyce and maner as yf the dede had ben accomplysshed in lyke wyse as hath ben sayd of the wyll of the co~+cupyscence carnall in the .ix. co~maundement.
Also more ouer it is to be noted that he the whiche enda~mageth his neyghboure in a lytell thynge be it in byenge or in sellynge or ellys he hym wolde enda~mage gladly of a more gretter thy~ge yf he myght he synneth mortally for god loketh more pryncypally vnto the wyll than vnto the werke outwarde and vnto that is vnhappy sholde well take hede the whiche ouer sellen theyr marchaundyse in lytell pryce for as moche that they may not nor sholde not ouersell in more greter pryce of the whiche thy~ge to do they haue well the wyll ye whiche is damp+nable and also mortall synne.
By these thynges before sayd clerely appereth that it is a ryght harde thynge to Juge well of wylles humayns: And with moche grete payne it suffyseth the moost gre+test clerke of the wlde well to Juge deserue and weye his owne wylles in the whiche more ouer may a man knowe the presumpcyon of those the whiche Jugen lyghtly of the conscyence of theyr neyghbours.
The whiche suffyse not to Juge wel them selfe alonely and none other.
And therfore it is necessary vnto euery creature erthely the whiche yet is witholden in the derkenesses of this lyfe to dyspose hymselfe by humylyte mekenes and prayers agayne the lyght and clerenes without ende the whiche illumyneth and adresseth euery creature the whiche ben in this worlde create so as it appertayneth and as a man it shall deserue and wyn+ne well and merytoryously.
That is to saye the blyssed Jhesus vnto whome by honoure and glory of this worlde and rewarde vs for our laboure in the eternall blysse Amen.
¬∂Here foloweth how fastynge ought to be made and whan and of whome.
FOr as moche as oftentymes a man is enioyned in penaunce for to do almesdede fa+stynge and prayer And that of almesdede it hath ben treatyd in the thyrde partye of this boke reste we as nowe to see somethynge and in fewe wordes of fastynge.
As vnto the fyrste it is to be noted yt some may be bounde to faste other by co~maundemente generall of holy chirche or by penaunce enioyned or for as moche that he hath vowed to fast As vnto the fastynges of the chirche it is to vnder+stonde that the .xl. dayes the foure Imbres that is to vnderstonde the wenysdaye the frydaye and ye saterdaye nexte after Whytsontyde and those exaltacyon of the holy crosse in the moneth of Septembre and those after saynt Luce in decembre and those after assh wenysdaye Also the mondaye the tewysdaye and the wenysdaye before the Assencyon the vigiles of apostles excepte saynt Jamis saynt Phelip and saynt John~ the Euangelyste.
Also the vigiles of Crystemas of Whytsontyde of the Assumpcyon of ourelady of saynt John~ Baptyst of saynt Laurence and of All halowen ben fasted of the co~maundement of chirche how be it the fast of the thre dayes of roga cyons is not proprely co~maunded yf it were not for the generall custome of the regyon but it is cou~seyll admonycyon of good deuocyon.
The custo+me generall to faste in euery regyon or bysshopryche byndeth them the whiche than enhabyte in it yf they haue not excusacyon lefull for the law of ryght posytyf intendeth not to bynde ony persone the whiche hath exculacyon resonable to faste all the lent or other fastynge dayes as ben wymen wt chylde or nourysshes labourers the whiche traua+len gretely poore people ye whiche haue not wherof to take suffycyently theyr refeccyon olde people people that haue the goute yonge people vnder yeres of. xxi. lyke people and pylgrymes the whiche haue necessyte to spede and delygent theyr way how be it yonge people whiche ben of. x. or of. xii. or of. xv. yeres after theyr compleccyon sholde of good congruyte faste more or lesse after as they fy~+de by the cou~seyll of theyr confessours of theyr gode inspyracyons.
Also many poore people and labourers enforce them to faste in so doynge they may purchase grete meryte notwithstondynge yt they be not bounde after the requyre of co~maunde+ment euery other persone the whiche without excusacyon resonable trespasseth vnto his wetynge. and by contempt the fastynge the whiche ben of co~maundement of the chirche or of good custome approuyd mortall synne mortally nor may not be excused of one onely daye in gyuynge an hundreth thousande crownes for to redeme the sayd faste. nother thynge it is of a faste put in penaunce or that a man hath it by vowe for he vnto whome it shall appertayne it may chaunge or dyspence. also put that a woman maryed may leue by the commaundement of her husbande the fastes that she hath by vowe before that she was his wyfe how be it she may not by suche commaundement without other excusacyon breke the fastes of the chirche but that she synne Also it is to be notyd that¬∑ whan Crystmas daye cometh on the frydaye a man may ete flesshe excepte those whiche haue the frydaye by vowe or by penaunce.
These other the whiche wyllen the~ abstey~e without Jugynge theyr neygh+bours they do not yll.
Also to ete spyces or confec+tures to drynke wyne or ale or other drynkes before dyner or after is no brekynge of the faste yf it be not done in fraudynge the faste that is to vnderstonde that a man taketh suche thynges not for necessyte of thorste or of debylyte of stomake but for to kepe hym from hu~ger or in takynge ye sayd thynges in quantyte excessyuely.
Also to ete flesshe on the saterdaye it may be done without synne yf it were the custome of the countree.
Also the bysshop dyocesayn may and ought to dyspence wyth syke people to ete flesshe in the lente or the frydaye and on other fastynge dayes and in lyke wyse wt the people in tyme of necessyte and of grete famy+ne for necessyte is not subiecte vnto the lawes for to absteyn on ye frydaye to ete flesshe it is good cou~+seyll and a thynge to prayse but not co~maundeme~t To faste the aduent or not the custome of the cou~tree ought to be obserued.
The houre of dyner the ryght is thre houres after the myddaye but custo+me obtayneth at the myddaye seruauntes may af+ter theyr offyces taste the meetes one after they ha+ue broken theyr faste to bere some messes and afterwarde make an ende of theyr dyner wtout of theyr faste.
To holde lo~ge table excessyuely for to passe the tyme to the ende that faste be not to moche costable to bere it is fraude of the intencyon of the statute of holy chirche And here may he haue suche exces that it is the brekynge of ye fast Also one dronken body on the daye of fastynge sy~+neth somtyme more greuously than he hadde done in brekynge his faste symply wtout makynge him selfe dronken to ete many tymes on the fastynge daye he breketh his faste it is also agreuau~ce of sy~+ne more or lesse of asmoche that a man eteth many tymes.
¬∂Here foloweth the seconde poynt the whiche is of prayer.
AS vnto the seconde poynt the whiche is of prayer that is to vnderstonde that euery cre+ture resonable the whiche hath age and dyscrecyon competent is bounde by the ryght of nature to ma+ke prayer vnto god his creatour for prayer as vnto that purpose is to lyfte vp his herte vnto god in reknowlegynge hym his creatour mayster lorde In requyrynge hym prouysyon of thynges necessary vnto this present lyfe and ayde agayne all oure aduersaryes and of dyuers temptacyons the why+che cometh on all partes to the ende that by ye mea+ne of his ayde and of his blyssed grace we may come vnto his blyssed royame.
Nature vnto vs sayth that we sholde seche the thynge without the whiche we may not be as is the ayde of god The whiche ayde is not vnto vs duely regnoure of Justyce nor we haue not wherof we may it suffycyently bye by ye whiche we muste sholde abyde in yt necessyte to demaunde that ayde humbly and deuoutly by prayers and orysons and therfore in all places and at all houres the ayde of god vnto vs is necessarye. for other wyse we may not endure or vnto oure ad+uersaryes resyste.
So vnto vs of necessyte euer mo+re to praye in lyke wyse as sayth Jhesu cryste in ye gospell.
That is to vnderstonde that after oryson vocall or mentall made in place and in tyme after good congruyte holdeth vs euermore in the loue and fere of god holely occupyed and in so doyn+ge we praye god without cessynge for the good desyre of the herte is before god an hyghe clamoure. Also saynt Austen declareth that we may not nor we sholde not come to god yf he called vs not and we may not come yf he ayde vs not and we deserue not to be ayded but onely by deuoute prayers therfore at the begynnynge of the seuen houres canonicales we requyre ye ayde of god whan we saye deus in adiutorium.
To berethe laboure Joyously vnto the whiche god the calleth.
The to conferme and make stronge to do the wyll of thy creature.
To come vnto holy contemplacyon and thou too come with god.
Also more ouer it is to be noted that some may be holden bou~de to prayer vocall or for by cause of his offyce as ben people of the chirche or for penaunce inioyned or for as moche that he hath auowed suche prayer or for suche ordenau~ce generall of holy chirche by the whiche the people is bou~+de to here the dyuyne seruyce on the sondayes and grete solempnyte yf they haue not excusacyon lefull and vnto them it suffyseth not for to acquyte and for to seche meryte before god to be in the chirche and to here alonely with the eeres corporalles the offyce of ye masse but they sholde lyfte vp theyr hertes vnto god in lyke wyse as the preeste the whi+che vnto them representeth Jhesu cryste them commau~deth sayenge (Sursum corda) That is to say haue your hertes vpwarde that is to knowe the vn+derstondynge and the wyll towarde god and ther fore answereth the clergye as well for them as for the people (habemus ad dn~m) That is to saye we haue our hertes with god and suche thynge that is to vnderstonde to haue his herte his vnderstondynge and his wyll towarde god is a ryall and ve+rytable prayer after as sayth a doctour named Da+mascene vnto yt purpose sayth Bonauenture yt he hereth truely the masse and none other the whiche with that that he hereth the wordes he hym co~uerteth by deuocyon and by the vnderstondynge to consyder the mystery of the blessed passyon by the whiche it is to be noted that he the whiche is bounde to make oryson vocall by vowe by penaunce or otherwyse and wyttyngly durynge that oryson he is occupyed in other werkes or thoughtes lettynges or contraryous vnto the sayd oryson synneth moche greuously and is not acquyte another thyn+ge it is whan suche thoughtes and occupacyons co+men agayne the wyll and yt a man doth his payn to put them oute after the fragelyte humayne vnto this artycle sholde those desyrously take hede the whiche ben bounde vnto the houres canonyales For the holy chirche co~maundeth in the vertue of holy obedye~ce that they ben sayd deuoutly and atte~+tyuely for god taketh more of pleaser and of loue in the deuocyon of the herte than he dothe in the voyce and modulacyon of the mouth.
Also oryson made with thre condycyons that is to vnderstonde prouffytably faythfully and with perseueraunce is euer more fynally exalted of our lorde. prouffytably yt is to demau~de the thynge yt is vnto the glorye of god vnto the saluacyon of the soule.
Fayth+fully that is whan he the whiche maketh the oryson hath true fayth hope and charyte towarde god wt perseuerau~ce whan the prayer the affeccyon and good lyfe and good operacyon perseueren and it it is that lorde sayth in the gospell axe seche and knocke axe by prayer seche by affeccyon and knocke by good operacyon for all those that soo done shall receyue that that they wolde. many ma+ken prayers oblacyons pylgrymages processyons the whiche god exalteth not be it for hym selfe or for other for they haue not the condycyons before sayd.
As vnto the regarde of goodes and prospery+tes temporall the whiche many demau~den and requyren in theyr prayers happeneth oftymes that god them graunteth vnto grete and horryble synners and in hydynge it vnto his frendes the which ben in the estate of grace so as it appereth of ye cursyd ryche man vnto whome Abraham answered after the deth.
Remembre the that god the rewar+de of thy goodes as thou haste done in ye other worl+de And therfore sayth Job. that oftymes that the uys people of euyll lyfe haue abou~dance of godes of this worlde for god grau~teth oftymes ye godes worldly vnto those agayne whome he is wroth gyueth aduersytes and trybulacyons vnto those the whiche that he holdeth in his loue In lyke wy+se as he sayth by saynt John~ in his appocalypse.
These holy scryptures vnto vs declaren in many places ryght playnly what condycyons and cyrcu~stau~ces true prayer ought to haue amonge ye whiche there are thyrty specyalles of the whiche agay~ the forme of this treatyse folowen the auctorytes lyne by lyne after theyr ordre with the frensshe.
The fyrste condycyon of prayers is that she ought to be made in true fayth.

By these thynges before sayd appereth the necessy+te the noblesse and the prouffyte of the true oryson for as sayth John~ Crisostum we shall speke and may spede with god by holy oryson as oftymes as we wyll in marchaundysynge and in askynge all the thynges the whiche vnto vs be necessarye and prouffytable and in this fayth requyre the mercy of the blyssed swete Jhesus as well for me as ye necessyte with all oure moder holy chirche that it hym please vs to pardon and vs to reforme and to brynge in the true obseruau~ce of his blyssed co~mau~dementes and of his holy grace and benedyccyon by the merytes of oure lady his gloryous moder and of all other blyssed sayntes oure poore sou+les yllumyne to ye ende that fynally we may come vnto his blyssed fruccyon amen.
Here foloweth a ryght prouffytable applicacyon of the arte of a phesecyan with the practyse ye whiche the phesecyan spyrytuall ought to holde with the interrogacyons that a man ought to make vnto hym the whiche is in the artycle of deth.
AS for to seche and conserue the lyfe helth corporall many stodyen ryght desyrouslye as well the theorique as the practyser of the arte of phesyke by more greter reason of as moche as the soule is more noble than the body and the lyfe of glorye more dygne than te~porall euery true crysten man sholde studye in the scyence by the whiche he may purchase and conserue in his soule the lyfe of grace without the whiche a man may not come vn to lyfe eternall And therfore to the ende that we may know and eschewe synne the whiche is the syk+nes of the soule and the cause of deth eternall foloweth brefe recolleccyon of the arte of physyke spy+rytuall founded in the twelue rules of the scyence of physyke corporall for in lyke wyse as vs techeth the ryght gloryous apostle saynt Poul by meane manduccyon of thynges corporalles sensybles a man may come vnto the contemplacyon of spyrytualles And therfore vnto vs hath gyuen the swete Ihesu cryste the true saumarytayn and physy+cyans of oursoules the physyke of his holy sacramentes vnder the forme of thynges corporall in fe+re who answereth as well of the syknes as of the medecyne and also as of the syke body.
For for as+moche that for the occasyon of the fyrst synne was the etynge of the apple the whiche was a thynge corporall.
Ihesu cryste vnto vs hath gyuen his pre+cyous body and his ryght holy blood vnder the for me and semblaunce of brede and of wyne and so of baptysme and of other sacramentes in lyke wy+se as well agayne the metynge of synne orygenall as of other As vnto the regarde of the physycyan it is Ihesu cryste the whiche is god and a man togy+ders and the syke body that is a man and woman in body materyall and spyrytuall by the whiche of good ryght appereth that by the physyke corporall a man may treate and gyue to vnderstonde spyrytuall.
THe fyrste rule of a physecyan is that he ought to vnderstonde what helth is what syknes is.
Or ellys he may not enduce the one and put out the other In lyke wyse ought the physycyan spyrytuall.
That is to vnderstonde the confessour to know what synne is the whiche is the syke+nes of the soule and what it is to be in the estate of the grace of god the whiche is the helth of that sou+le: wherfore it is to be noted that helth corporall is good dysposycyon the whiche cometh of an armony and consyderacyon of the foure humours. that is to vnderstonde of the blode of the coler of the fleume and of the malancoly For whan all these foure kepe his degree wtout excedynge or hauynge rule after ye co~plexyon of ye supposau~t there is helth corporall by the contrary exces or defaute or tri+bulacyon in ye one or in many of ye sayd humours causeth syknes applycacyon In lyke wyse whan the foure pryncypall passyons of the soule.
That is to vnderstonde Ire concupyscence fere heuy+nes benduely ordeyned amodered than the soule is well dysposed in helth spyrytuall.
But by ye contrary whan they ben dysordenate and troubled there is syknes playnly to vnderstonde this mater that is to know yt whan the passyon of Ire is vnto regarde of thynges ye whiche we may soner from ye loue of ye creatour whan our co~cupyscence desyre is to regarde of goodes of glory fere is vnto ye regarde of da~pnacyon heuynes is vnto the regarde of synnes the whiche we haue commyt Than the soule is well dysposed and in helth spyrytuall And thanne by the contrary whan that these foure passyons ben dysordenate and vnto regarde of thynges erthely the soule falleth in langoure and in to excessyue syknes.
THe seconde rule of a phesecyan is that he ought to enquyre the causes of helth and of syknesses for euery thy~ge produceth bryngeth forth and nouryssheth his effecte By the whiche it is to be notyd that whan the foure qualytes that is to vnderstonde hete colde drye and moystour ben in certayne and in good porcyon vnto the regarde and suppost: Than they causen armonye helth In lyke wyse the exces or diminucyon or perturba cyon the one agayne ye other causen syknes applycacyon In lyke wyse is it vnto the soule.
By he te vnto vs is sygnyfyed loue the whiche may be well ordeyned agayne god or dysordynate agayne those thynges erthely and than it causeth in ye soule helth or syknes more or lesse after the ordenaunce or dysordenaunce.
By colde is sygnyfyed fere the whiche may be worldely humayne seriule vycyous and than that causeth syknes spyrytuall or it may be helth and fylyale and the begynnyng of true sapyence and she causeth helth by drynes is sygnyfyed heuynes the whiche may be dysordynate in moche and in lytell as is to be to moche he+uy of aduersytes worldly and lytell of the offence and dyshonour of god moystnes sygnyfyeth delytes and pleaser without the whiche soule resonable may not lyue yf they ben worldely carnall they causen syknes yf they ben in god and in thynges spyrytuall they causen helth spyrytuall.
THe thyrde rule of a physycyan is that by thyng contraryous he sholde chase thother as yf the syknes be hote he ought to gyue a medy+cyne colde yf it be by cause of coldenes he oughte to gyue medycyne of hete and soo of other causes applycacyon.
In lyke wyse in the physyke spyrytuall for in lyke wyse as Ihesu cryste techeth and the whiche saynt Gregorye declareth agayne lechery a man sholde put to abstynau~ce in drynke and in meete in vsynge in takynge hede agayn couetyse agayne Ire and furour pacyence heuynes agayne pryde humylyte The whiche maner to remedy ought to be vnderstonde whan there is no cause suffycyent wherfore resonably a man sholde other wyse do.
THe fourth rule of the physycyan is to conserue the helth recoueryd the whiche thyng is done in foure maners.
Fourthly in holdynge hym in good ayre In lyke wyse is it vnto the dede spyrytuall.
Se condly to desyre alwayes to do better to be more worth.
Thyrdly in occupyenge hym in holy operacyons forellys at longe goynge a man may not eschewe these euylles.
Fourthly in perseuerynge in good werkes for without perseuerau~ce in good ly+fe a man may neuer come to the hyre or rewarde.
THe fyfth rule of the physycyan is dylyge~ce for to remedye at the begynnynge of syk+nesses.
For with more greate payne is the thorne areched of as moche as she putteth her rote the mo+re in depnes applycacyon a lyke thynge it is of synne who so hym wyll plante in the soule be it Ire enuy pryde lechery or other synne for who wyll resyste at the begynnynge he therto may come easely but who that it deffereth by longe tyme wt grete payne he therto cometh And therfore sayth well holy scrypture that he hath the blessynge of god the whiche casteth his lytelnes and yongth nou+rysshed and it chaseth agayne the stone by thesely tell yonge and newely borne ben sygnyfyed these euyll thoughtes and moeuynges of synne the why che ben casten agayne the stone whanne a man re+quyreth the ayde of Ihesu cryste the whiche is named the true stone for as moche as he is the foundacyon of the holy fayth catholyque and of all holy chirche.
THe syxte rule a phesycyan is yt he ought to know the tokenes of the sykenes the whi+che ben foure.
The seconde whan he eteth and forth with he it auoydeth by waye that he hath it receyued.
The thyrde whan he appetyteth not but thynges the whiche vnto hym be contraryous. applycacyon Alyke thynge it is vnto the dede of the soule whan she enioyneth not to receyue good doc tryne it is the fyrste token of his sykenes or whan she herkeneth gladly euoweth but nothynge she reteyneth that is as vnto the seconde or whan shere ceyueth and retayneth but she putteth nothynge in werke by good dygestyon is as vnto the thyrde as euyll token or whan she desyreth not but thynges worldly and erthly and without mesure as by symony or vsury.
THe seuenth rule of a phesycyan is to know the tokenes of helth the whiche ben foure contrary vnto the foure tokenes of syknes before sayd. applycacyon. whan the soule appetyteth to here good doctryne and putteth payne to retayne and to put it in werke by good lyfe and eschewe euyll langage and folysshe co~panyes.
Than she is nourysshed with remembraunce by holy medytacy+ons those thynges the whiche vnto her may prouffyte and by that she encreaseth and fortyfyeth in euery benediccion.
THe .viii. rule of a phesycyan yt is to auoyde payne and heuynes vnto the pacyent in gyuynge good medycyne.
Example grete abstynen+ce and dyete for to hele feuers with porcyon of herbes bytter to perce and cleue in dyuers maners bot+ches swellynges and apostumes to gyue pylles or triacle made of venym and of porsons and of bit+ter thynges for to auoyde these euyll humours for to breke bones synewes vaynes in membres euyll sette crokyd for to brynge them agayne the~ re+mytte in theyr ryght poynt soof many other me+decines. applicato~.
so is it in medicine spiritua¬∑ for who that suffreth the brennynge of cursyd concupyscence carnall he ought to make dyete who that hath botche and swellynge of pryde ought to consyder the humylyte of the kynge of glorye his lyfe and his passyon and humble hymselfe he that is in Ire or in enuy the tryacle of bytter compassyon vnto hym is necessary and hym behoueth to make fraccyon of the hardenes of his herte.
Also as he hath one membre crokyd dysordoned from his place in requyrynge pardon and in humblynge hy~ to warde those that he myght offende and by suche wyse he hym shall redresse and shall lyue with his neyghbour.
THe .ix. rule is lytell and lytell and by succes syon of tyme he sholde gyue medycynes pur gatyues for nature may not werke sodeynly and therfore to gyue medycyne without dysposycyon is aduenture to lese all applycacyon.
This forme ought the physycyan spyrytuall to kepe for at the begynnynge of the reduccyon of the syke body that is to vnderstonde of the synner he ought not to en+ioyne thynges of hye perfeccyon or stronge or harde restytucyons or sodeyne but ought hym to redu+ce from lytell vnto more greater for to come vnto correccyon and amendement And suche doctryne holdeth and techeth saynt Poul the true medycyne spyrytuall as it appereth by his wrytynges.
THe. x. rule is to haue good knowlege to purge the body of his euyll humours for of as moche as they abounde they co~uerten the good mee+tes in to them selfe wherfore it is to vnderstonde that in four maners he may make purgaryon of euyll for somtyme he doeth it byneth another tyme by the mouth another tyme by bledynge or by sethynge and by force of fyre. applycacyon lyke chynge is it in the dede of the soule for his purgacyon is made byneth whan the synner co~+sydereth the grete and horryble paynes of helle the whiche ben maderedy vnto syuners somtyme it is made by the opper¬∑ parte by a co~syderacyon that he leseth the blyssed royalme of paradyse by the whi+che the synner is moeued to make an entyere and parfyte contessyon somtyme it is made by almes dede in puttynge out from hym of his goodes and of his substau~ce another tyme by the sethynge and by the fyre of trybulacyon taken and endured in good pacyence.
THe .xi. rule of a phesycyan is to knowe the tokenes of deth to the ende that he may denou~ce as well vnto the pacyence as vnto his frendes that they puruayen of the surplus for than the physycyan is at the ende of his knowlege may ne+uer brynge agayne helth wherfore it is to be noted that in a syke body there may be foure tokenes of deth corporall.
The fyrste is whan he felyth not his sykenes for thenne nature is to moche lowe.
The seconde whan he hath noshame that a man seeth all this membres for shame is the token of good dysposycyon in blode of persone resonable the whiche dysposycyon is than dystroyed.
The thyrde whan he knoweth no more those persones the whiche other tymes he knewe for that is a token that the brayne and the pryncypall organes ben lately dede or excessyuely troubled.
The .iiii. is whan he is in franesye for thenne not alonely the brayne but with that the herte is in tormente. applycacyon.
In lyke wyse may a man haue foure tokenes of the deth spyrytuall of the soule And of the conscyence of the synner.
The fyrste whan the synner knoweth not his gylte and his synne it is a token euydent that of suche syknes he may not escape but that he go vnto the deth eternall The seconde whanne he hath no shame to synne openly The thyrde is whanne his affeccyon is in suche wy+se dysordynate and applyed vnto yll that he hath no knowlege of his dede nor of his peryll of his sou+le dampnacyon.
The fourth whan the sensualyte ruleth so in hym that he hath no reason nor strength for to resyste vnto the passyons of Ire of enuy of wrath of lechery or other ye whiche vpon hym cometh.
By these foure tokenes a man may knowe that the syke body spyrytually is dysposed vnto the deth of helle.
THe .xii. rule of the physycyan is to knowe the tokenes of lyfe and of helth for to denou~ce it vnto the pacyent to the ende that it hym may enioye and recomforte in his spyryte the whiche thynge helpeth moche vnto the helth corporall By the whiche it is to be noted that the tokenes for to mowe recouer helth ben foure The fyrste wha~ the sykenes is mynysshed and that nature is streng+thed those ben tweyne tokenes of helth.
The thyrde whan the mater of the syknes begynneth to dygeste.
The fourth whan by ony maner of euacuacyon a man putteth out humours and maters the whiche causen the syknes. applycacyon.
These foure tokenes to recouer helth spyrytuall be~ shewed spyrytually.
The seconde whan be hym enforseth to purchasse vertues and good habytuacyons for to resyste.
The thyrde whanne reason argueth and comprehendeth the inconuenyens ye whiche may folowe to obey vnto his pas+syons sensualles.
By the whiche she requyreth ayde of god of his blyssed sayntes for to resyste agayne them.
The fourth whan he fleeth vnto his power the occasyons of synne as from the place from the tyme from the persones soo of other thynges the whiche hym may enduce vnto synne. By these thynges before sayd appereth in brefe the applycacyon of medycyne spyrytuall vnto the medycyne corporall and who answereth of the one vn+to the other who so well doth vnto his prouffyte helth muste he haue eternall amen.
Here foloweth some brefe interrogacyons that a man may make to euery good crysten man that a man seeth labourynge in the artycle of deth or the whiche yf he can or may and fyrste ought for to do.
CRysten man or crysten woman byleue you sted fastly all ye artycles of the fayth.
That is to vnderstonde in god the fader ye whiche is crea+tour of heuen and of the erth and of all other thyn+ges vysyble and inuysyble: Also in Jhesu cryste his sone the whiche for vs hath be conceyued and borne of the vyrgyn Mary.
The whiche for vs to teche and to agayne bye hath soo moche suffred of payne and fynally the deth ryght cruell and the thyrde daye arose and the whiche is styed into heuen and shall come agayne to Juge the quycke the deed for to yelde vnto euery creatour that that he hath deserued.
Byleue you that by the grace of the holy goost the holy chirche is sustayned nourysshed and the holy sacrame~tes ordened and that after our descesse we all shall aryse.
Be not ye well Joyfull to dye in the crysten fayth and in the vnyte and obedyence of our moder the holy chirche The answere yes.
Confesse ye to haue so poorely lyued that you haue not deserued ony meryte of goodnes yt ye better sholde haue lyued than ye haue done The answere yes Knowlege ye that ye haue offended your god your creatur ryght often and ryght greuously The answere yes.
Haue not you sorowe and dyspleaser of all the synnes that ye haue done and of the godenes that ye haue lefte to do of the gyftes and of the graces of god the whiche ye haue not well vsed an+swere yes haue not ye good purpose and wyll you to amende yf god you graunt to come vnto helth. answere yes pardon you not with good herte for the loue of god all them that you haue offended an+swere yes requyre not you also demau~de ryghte humbly pardon and mercy generally of all those yt ye haue offended answere yes Byleue you well yt for you our lorde wolde dye and that otherwyse than by his blessyd passyon ye may not be saued answere yes Of this and of other innumerable graces that he vnto you hath done and vnto all the worlde yelde ye not hym graces and mercy wt hert as moche as ye maye yf the persone may speke wt very fayth and good conscyence with herte alone+ly or wt herte and with mouth togyders these thyn+ges before sayd and answere in lyke wyse as it is sayd and in suche estate desseaceth it is a ryght gre+te token of saluacyon.
Than the persone the whi+che in suche wyse is dysposed all holely hym ought to reco~mau~de and to co~mytte vnto the blyssed passyon of our lorde in puttynge therto his hope and not in other meryte or good dede and theron ought he to thynke contynually in as moche that the syk+nes he may endure and bere for by that ben surmou~ted and beten downe the dyuerse temptacyo~s of the deuyll of helle And than a man ought bytwene god the fader the greuousnes of ye gylte of his synnes put oppose the deth of his swete chyld without otherwyse to pleade or aledge and also for the merytes that he ought to haue and that he hath not he ought to offre the merytes of oure sauyoure Jhesu cryste the whiche ben infynyte comen vnto all those the whiche duely them axe and reclayme and thynke on hym Or a man sholde calle vnto his mynde the story of ye good thefe how he knowle+ged his gylte and his synne and the swetnes pyte of our lorde the whiche requyred god the fader for the synne of those the whiche hym put and helde in tormentes and in deseases of deth by the whiche¬∑ co~+syderacyon he was inspyred to requyre the ayde of Jhesu cryste sayenge (Memento meidn~e) That is to saye lorde haue pyte and mynde of me.
The whi+che thynge ought he to saye vnto his power ye why+che laboureth in the extremetes of deth and also ought to saye his confyteor and after to make pro+testacyon that he wyll dye in the trouth of the holy fayth catholyque what so euer illusyon or freuesaye vnto hym come in the artycle of deth.
And afterwarde saye in manus tuas dn~e co~mendo spiritum meum &c. Here folowen. vi. aduysementes ryght prouffyta+ble for to enduce them that be lyuynge for to dye. HOr as moche as in ye consystorye of the blys+sed trynyte is determyned irreuocably that it vs behoueth all to dye and before god at ye houre of deth vs represent all and that euery creatour in pertyculer for Jugement and fynall sen+tence of saluacyon or of da~pnasyon after at euery of them hath deserued it is souerayne wysdome for hym to study to dye well.
Than for to haue some knowlege of peryllous thynges ye whiche comen vnto euery creatour at the houre of deth and for to haue mater exitacyon vs to prepayre from daye to daye so that contynually we approche vnto that houre ryght doubfull.
Here folowen syx aduyseme~+tes for to conceyue fere by the whiche we may dysprayse this present worlde and for to prepayre vs to departe surely from this present lyfe.
THe fyrste auysement is that at the houre of deth of euery creature is the ende of the worl+de and the grete Jugement as vnto regarde of the sentence and of thynges the whiche theder comen and ben done vnto the case partyculer of the creature resonable for in yt estate in the whiche a man is founde in that estate and houre a man is Jugyd and sentence irreuocably vnto the whiche sentence he may not resyste lette or it dyffer by scyence by puyssau~ce by loue or by fauour.
Dukes Erles Barons and all other of what so euer preemynence or condycyons be it a man or a woman olde or yonge all by the condycyouegalle we be nowe acyted for to appere vnto suche and soo meruaylous Jugement And full fewe there are the whiche on it thynketh duely The whiche thynge these worldely people shewen clerely by theyr lyfe that they holden and leden the (whiche is dampnable for the more parte of them ben begyled by the temptacyon of the deuyll the whiche the~ maketh ymagen that they haue true repentau~ce be+fore that they ben presented vnto the Jugement of god and vnto the houre of the deth as it is sayd wherfore they doubte not to contynewe theyr vayn lyfe seculer worldly and whan they comen vnto the ende they fallen by Justice secrete and infynyte in to dyspayre and by the consequent with Judas in eternall dampnacyon.
By the whiche it is well and truely sayd of good lyfe good ende of euyll co+meth neuer good.
That is to vnderstonde yf the persone ye whiche hath ledde euyll lyfe tyll vnto the syknes or vnto the tyme of the deth may come vnto good ende haue saluacyon The answere.
After saynt Austen it is not possyble but that he the whiche hath ben of euyll lyfe may haue a good ende but it is ryght harde for as sayth Eusebius in one of his epystles of an hundred.
persones the whiche haue contynued an euyll lyfe cometh there one vnto a good ende.
And vnto that purpose sayth Richarde de media villa that the penaunce is suffycyent vnto saluacyon whan the synner hath dyspleaser of his synne and in purpo+se neuer to consent vnto mortall synne and of tyme paste maketh a true confessyon and an hole or in purpose that to do in place and in tyme and that vnto all these thynges before sayd it is moued and enduced pryncypally for the loue of god not pryn+cypally for fere to be da~pned or for other occasyon seuile or temporall or ellys the penaunce that a ma~ doeth in the artycle of deth suffyseth not to gete sal+uacyon and for as moche that ryght fewe of those the whiche haue ben of euyll lyfe haue the condycyons before sayd at the houre of deth it foloweth that of those the whiche dyfferre~ and taryen to do true penaunce tyll the bedde and at ye tyme of deth full fewe there aren that be saued For yf it be soo that they haue not wyll to loue god faythfully durynge the tyme that he vnto them gyueth so moch of his goodes and of his graces as may be body and the soule helth prosperyte of wytte of mynde of goodes erthly thynges how may they hym loue and reclayme with herte pyteous tayth full whan he them shall holde in grete dysti esle in the pryson of greuous syknes in takynge from the~ helth playes dysportes Joyes and gladnesses and all pleasures worldly In the whiche they haue put theyr hertes and theyr studye.
That is to vnderstonde that than they loue god by true charyte the whiche prouen these doctours by many reasons the fyrste is for the grete and horiyble passyon of the syknes and of a fere seruyle hatefull in whiche talleth than the espyryte humayn the whiche hath not god with hym by grace whan there come suche necessy+te as yf ony hadde the fote in the tyre or in ye water sethynge he may not fynde his vnderstondynge Than for to reknowlege his synnes for the grete so rowe that he suffreth and by the consequente may not haue ye dyspleaser ye whiche is necessary before yt god pardoneth ye synnet he gyueth his grace therfore sayth well holy scrypture as vnto suche people they thynke not on god suffycyantly for to fynde grace whan the houre of deth cometh For Justyce and reason requyren he the whiche hath no wyll to recorne vnto god by promesses and by gyftes by thretenynges by increpacyons yt god hath contynued towarde some by thyrty or by fyf+ty yeres more or lesse As ben predycacyo~s remors of conscyence prosperytes worldly examples and Jugementes of god they ben comen as in theyr ty+me as of the deth of those the whiche they knowen And parauenture them in estate and in maner of lyuynge in other maners without no~bre vnto god called be not in wyll to retorne durynge yt he hadde the tyme the houre by ye which god them suffreth Justly to fall into dampnacion eternall for he seeth knoweth in his scyence dyui+ne infynyte yt where by.
M. of dayes of yeres he the~ taryeth yet euer more they abyden in their obstynacyon therfore notwtstondynge yt whan the ende cometh theyr necessyte they them wolde co~fesse amende it is to late for to abyde.
Also as in all case comenly suche penau~ce procedeth of fere seruyle as is ye fere pryncypally to be da~pned. and therfore sayth and byleueth saynt Jerome that of suche there aren ryght fewe saued By the whiche it appereth clerely ynough he the whiche dyfferreth true parfyte penau~ce tyll vnto tyme of deth he hym dysposeth vnto da~pnacyon doth agayn the admonicyon of holy goost.
The seconde lettynge to do true penan~ce whan the ende of the lyfe cometh it is an habytuacyon of sy~ne the whiche is in the soule of them the whiche haue longely contynued an euyll lyfe.
By the which it sholde be a ryght harde thynge it for to breke dystroye put awaye whan it cometh vnto the ende consu~macyon of the lyfe there where the persone hath so lytell of tyme so many of lettynges that to do.
The thyrde lettynge is the temptacyon of deuyl the whiche tempteth the persone at the tyme of the deth more than euer he hadde done in the dayes of his lyfe the persone hym resyste not with tymes paste in the tyme of his greate knowlege of his helth whiche hath not deseruyd so moch agayn god as blyssed sayntes of paradyse to fynde ayde in yt laste necessyte what may he do in suche shortenes of tyme and in suche oppresse of paynes of te~ptacyons whiche cometh on all partyes.
The fourth lettynge is dyffaylynge of wytte humayne For in as moche ye the synner hath put his herte his vnderstondynge in thynges erthly transytoryes the whiche faylen at nede ben they women chyldren rychesses delytes pleasures and other goodes of this lyfe they fallen in a confusyon of vnderstondynge and is in a dyspleaser of the Jugement of god.
By the whiche he theym maketh to lese and to leue the thynge in the whiche they ha+ue put theyr loue and theyr pleasaunce and by su+che passyons as well in the vnderstondynge as in the wyll they forgeten god and theyr saluacyon By the which god suffreth tyght Justly that they fallen and abyden amonge the handes of theyr en (nemyes many page duplicate] page duplicate] other greate and also as innumerable lettynges co+men vnto synners at the houre of the deth whan they haue ben of euyll lyfe And so appereth the trouth of the questyon.
That is to vnderstonde yf the synner the whiche hath ledde an euyll lyfe tyll vnto the tyme of his syknes mortall may come vn+to saluacyon and this is as vnto the fyrste aduysement.
THe seconde aduysement is of the mysterye of the two angelles of the creature the whiche sholde dye That is to vnderstonde of the good and of the euyll for euery persone the whiche hath good and resonable vnderstondynge oughte to be aduysed he hath a good angell the whiche hath the offyce and co~maundement of god hym to purge illumyne and enduce to come vnto perfeccyon.
And also hym to defende from the deuyll of helle.
And to kepe hym from the of the creacyon of the soule tyll vnto the departynge from ye body the whiche is the houre of deth.
And in lyke wyse he hath an euyll spyryte for to tempte hym and en+duce vnto all yll and fynably vnto dampnacyon yf he may And a man ought to vnderstonde that as the good angell as the euyll haue greter know+lege naturall than euer myght haue phylosopher astronomyer or physycyan by the whiche it foloweth that they may know naturally complexion the causes and the greef of the syknes of the perso+ne of whome they haue the charge and the cure¬∑ That is to vnderstonde the good to enduce hym vnto saluacyon.
And therfore wha~ the good angell seeth and knoweth the ende and the houre of the deth of suche persone to be comen and knoweth not what shall be the sentence of the Jugement of god he sheweth and bryngeth this mater with the blyssed and gloryous archangell saynt Michell vnto whome god hath gyuen offyce to receyue the soules the whiche haue obeyed vnto the good inspyracyons of the blyssed angelles and than the sayd archangell gyueth and assygneth certayne nombre of the chyualry of paradyse vnto the sayd angell for to and to come vnto ye Jugement of the lytell worlde.
That is to vndersto~de of man and of woman the whiche of good ryght is named and called the lytell worlde for it is the co~clusyon and co~su~macyon of all the grete worlde than the angell so nobly accompanyed more or lesse after dygnyte of offyce or the prelacyon of the persone whiche ought to be Juged descendeth hym presenteth on the ryght syde.
And in lyke wy+se the euyll spyryte whiche hath had ye offyce to tempte that persone maketh grete dylygence to fetche vnto Lucyfer ende the Jugement of ye perso+ne yt he hath tempted to be come hath not than certayne knowlege yf he shall be saued or da~pned for ony yll or sy~ne yt he hym hath made to do.
And tha~ Lucyfer vnto hy~ gyueth co~pany of deuylles mo+re or lesse after ye vocacyon the degre of ye persone in lyke wyse as it is sayd of ye good angell. than deuyl so accompanyed cometh hym presenteth on lefte syde of champyon be it man or woma~ yt is bataylled than cometh as well vnto body as vnto soule of suche persone so grete so Im+compreuable batayle of dysease of sorowe and of fere yt there is no tonge nor wrytynge yt it may declare tell for there was neuer soo holy a persone by the waye of nature of comen cours may be assured of his case what shall be the ende of his Jugement.
And therfore those ye which ben present at suche departyng sholde praye with the company of holy creatures the whiche ben presented for the poore creature the whiche is in the moost grete necessyte dystresse yt euer vnto hy~ ¬∑may come in this worlde and hym they sholden recomforte enduce vnto hope in she wynge hym token of ryghtt py+teous passyon of our blyssed sauyoure rede~ptour Jhesu cryste the whiche is the confusyon of deuylles of helle in namynge hym or make to speke the name of Jhesus for tha~ it is no tyme to brynge vn+to theyr mynde dettes restytucyons or the grete ha+tes and synnes for that ought to haue be made before yt they were come~ vnto suche extremyte of pay+nes of dyseases whiche than them holden in al partes.
Also it is to be noted by preuylege syngu+ler god sheweth vnto some holy persones theyr go de holy departynge before the houre of theyr deth By which they be not more ferefull as it is sayd But they ben in one peas and gladnes spyrytuall the whiche vnto them is nowe a begynnyge of glo+rye very fader omnipotent what haue we thys houre and this batayll before our eyes of our vnderstondynge for to arme vs with merytes with vertues and for to dyspose vs and to deserue agay~ the sayntes of paradyse and syngulerly agayne virgin Mary to mo we haue socours and ayde for tha~ shall prouffyte nothynge golde syluer townes nor castelles offyces dygnytes ne preemynences But of all suche thynges it shall behoue to yelde acompte ryght straytly as shall be sayd here after+warde.
THe thyrde aduysement is that euery creatu+re ben they good or euyll shall se at houre of the deth the blyssed swete Jhesu cryste the which is Juge generall of the quyche and of the deed and hym they shall see in the forme and maner that he was on good fryday whan he hongelvpon crosse sayen vnto god the fader (Pater in manus tuas co~+mendo spiritum meum) wherfore it is well to be noted that the persone so approchynge vnto deth cometh vnto suche passage that he leseth the vsage of his fyue wyttes of nature all holly for yf all the bellys and bombardes of the worlde sowned in his ere he them hereth not and so of the syght and of other wyttes vnto regarde of syght of felynge of smellynge and of tastynge and than in that moment yt the yates of the body.
That is to vnderston+de the fyue wyttes ben closed the yates of his sou+le yet beynge in his body ben open for than the sou+le seeth all clerely the blyssed Jhesu cryste in the for+me and estate as it is sayd before Also she seeth her holy angell with grete company of gloryous spyrytes And also seeth the deuyll and his the whiche all abyden the sentence dyuyne be if¬∑ of saluacyon or of dampnacyon and than the bokesben open for the soule be it good or euyll seyng the blyssed Ihesu cryste the whiche is named truely the boke of lyfe wryteth within and without seeth than clerely all processe of his lyfe for neuer had he thought in his lyfe but than therof than she ha+the clere knowlege of all togyders and of euery of them in partyculer weren they good or euyll.
And in lyke wyse of delyres of wyiles and of wordes by a more greter reason of all his werkes ben they good or yll and of the good dedes of the whiche a man hath hadde oportunyte to do and that aman hath not done and also in lyke wyse of the euyll. all these thynges shall be weyed and examyned by the Iuste balau~ce of the Iustyce dyuyne. and than many thynges the whiche semeth to be golde syluer precyous stones after the Iugement humayne shall not be but donge erth and caryn.
That is to saye that many semen vnto ye worlde to be of grete deuocyon and of grete perfeccyon shall be than knowen to be full of ypocresye and of abhomynacyon here rynnen to socours ye ryght gloryous virgyn mary and the holy sayntes of paradyse vnto whome the persone hath done honour and seruyce in his lyfe and also the good werkes and merytes that a man hath purchased durynge that a man hath hadde tyme and space.
And those the whiche haue not deseruyd to be ayded suffysen not to answere or them to excuse.
very god the whiche sercheste and examynest the hertes the synewes ye vaynes and the mouynges of the bones of humayns.
That is to saye the causes ye reasons and the intencyons and these other cyrcu~staunces of dedes humayns what shall he be that may tha~ answere before thyn ryght holy face before the ho+ly angelles and before the deuylles.
Also shall be demaunded reason and a compte of all the tyme of our lyfe and so tyll vnto the shettynge of the eye.
And of all the goodes ye whiche vnto vs hath ben gyuen in our lyfe ben they gyftes of grace of nature or of fortune as we them haue vsed be it in prosperyte or aduersyte.
M. tymes alas Alas what may than answere those the whiche so folysshely and so vaynly passen and so lesen the tyme of mercy and therfore at ye houre of deth the soule be it good or euyll shall see knowe by the puyssaunce dyuyne all the proces of hys lyfe for the boke of his conscyence vnto hym shall be shewed so clerely that by the bou~te pyte mercy of god she is of the nombre of the saued or that by the Iustyce dyuyne she ought to be Iustly condampned and delyuered vnto the deuylles for his defaute and ryght cursyd lyfe.
THe fourth aduysement is of the sentence of the Iuge for than our lorde shall appere so terrye vnto them that haue not deserued saluacy on that none vnderstondy~ge suffyseth it to ymage~ And therfore sayth well saynt Austen that there is no torment in the worlde that is so harde to endure as is to be presented before ye face of Ihesu cryste and hath deserued his Ire his maledyccyon for he shall reproche vnto the cursyd theyr synnes grete horryble geuyng vnto them clere knowlege of theyr vnkyndenes and how they haue hym crucy+fyed of newe As done all those the whiche after baptem after the sacrament of confessyon after the recepcyon of his ryght precyous sacramente in the whiche he gyueth his flesshe and his blode they ben retorned vnto theyr sy~nes from yere to yere. without there makynge an ende.
And vnto them he shall shewe clerely the of his blyssed in carnacyon and of his passyon and the tyme and how longe he them hath abyden vnto mercy all whiche thynges they haue dyspraysed in as moche that they haue not them vsed vnto saluacyon. and therfore in that laste houre ryght Iustly he theym dyspraysynge in gyuynge vpon them his sentence so terryble that the heuen and ye erth shall tremble That is to vnderstonde nature angelyke and nature humayne in sayenge vnto the soule dampned Departe thou forthwith with thy body cursyd cre+ature and go thou vnto the fyre of helle and vnto the tormentes eternall the whiche vnto the ben made redye and the whiche thou hast¬∑ Iustly deser+ued with the spyrytes dampned vnto temptacyons of whome thou haste wylled to obeye Than the soule accursyd is constrayned to departe from the body and seynge that she is in the bonde and maledyccyon of god and more ouer seeth the cruel best enraged that is the deuyll of hell whiche is redy in awaytynge her to receyue.
Than fynably she her torneth and co~uerteth towarde her holy angell the whiche alwayes tyll vnto yt houre hath her defended from yt euyll enemye in desyrynge natural+ly yet to haue socoure defence.
But the good angell in approuynge ye ryght Iuste sentence of god vnto hym sayth Go thou wt the deuyll acursyd by the sentence of the blyssed Trynyte of all the co~pany of heuen for thou haste not in tyme passed wylled for to knowe thy creatour the yt to the hath be done by his co~mau~dement in defendyn+ge from the aduersytes in procurynge the to re+mors of co~scyence inspyracyons to doo well to leue synne but yu haste refused therfore nowe of good ryght god euery holy creature ye oughte well to refuse and there with all ye to leue vnto tho+se vnto whome thou haste obeyed and than ye poore soule seynge that she hath not socours nor ayde in heuen nor in erth that she may not flee nor auoy de the hande and puyssaunce of deuylles the which ben present as these slawghter men of helle for to execute the sentence dyuyne maketh so grete acrye spyrytuall and maketh so grete sorowe and so gre+te complaynt as sayth the booke of angelles that there is no torment in this worlde that a man or a woman ne bereth more easely than to see the pyteous departynge of the soule and of his holy angell Opyteous hertes humayns why haue not you regarde in this mater that may haue remedye vnto suche in conuenyent for yf a persone had done all the synnes that euer were done soo may she duryn+ge the tyme of mercy doo penaunce and amendemente By the whiche she may euade escape ye and hath deserued his Ire his maledyccyon for he shall reproche vnto the cursyd theyr synnes grete horryble geuyng vnto them clere knowlege of theyr vnkyndenes and how they haue hym crucy+fyed of newe As done all those the whiche after baptem after the sacrament of confessyon after the recepcyon of his ryght precyous sacramente in the whiche he gyueth his flesshe and his blode they ben retorned vnto theyr sy~nes from yere to yere¬∑ without there makynge an ende.
And vnto them he shall shewe clerely the mysterye of his blyssed in carnacyon and of his passyon and the tyme and how longe he them hath abyden vnto mercy all whiche thynges they haue dyspraysed in as moche that they haue not them vsed vnto saluacyon. and therfore in that laste houre ryght Justly he theym dyspraysynge in gyuynge vpon them his sentence so terryble that the heuen and ye erth shall tremble That is to vnderstonde nature angelyke and nature humayne in sayenge vnto the soule dampned Departe thou forth with with thy body cursyd cre+ature and go thou vnto the fyre of helle and vnto the tormentes eternall the whiche vnto the ben made redye and the whiche thou hast Justly deser+ued with the spyrytes dampned vnto temptacyons of whome thou haste wylled to obeye Than the soule accursyd is constrayned to departe from the body and seynge that she is in the bonde and maledyccyon of god and more ouer seeth the cruel best enraged that is the deuyll of hell ye whiche is redy in a waytynge her to receyue.
Than fynably she her torneth and co~uerteth towarde her holy angell the whiche alwayes tyll vnto houre hath her defended from yt euyll enemye in desyrynge natural+ly yet to haue socoure defence.
But the good angell in approuynge ryght Juste sentence of god vnto hym sayth Go thou wt the deuyll acursyd by the sentence of the blyssed Trynyte of all the co~pany of heuen for thou haste not in tyme passed wylled for to knowe thy creatour the seruyce yt to the hath be done by his co~mau~dement in defendyn ge from the aduersytes in procurynge the to re+mors of co~scyence inspyracyons to doo well to leue synne but yu me haste refused therfore nowe of good ryght god euery holy creature ye oughte well to refuse and there with all to leue vnto tho+se vnto whome thou haste obeyed and than ye poore soule seynge that she hath not socours nor ayde in heuen nor in erth that she may not flee nor auoy+de the hande and puyssaunce of deuylles the which ben present as these slawghter men of helle for to execute the sentence dyuyne maketh so grete a crye spyrytuall and maketh so grete sorowe and so gre+te complaynt as sayth the booke of angelles that there is no torment in this worlde that a man or a woman ne bereth more easely than to see the pyteous departynge of the soule and of his holy angell Opyteous hertes humayns why haue not you regarde in this mater that may haue remedye vnto suche inconuenyent for yf a persone had done all the synnes that euer were done soo may she duryn+ge the tyme of mercy doo penaunce and amendemente By the whiche she may euade escape ye sentence and maledyccyon of god and to come vnto mercy vnto saluacyon.
Here foloweth the execu+cyon that the deuylles of helle done in takynge the possessyon and seasyne of the soule condemned the whiche is a thynge pyteous and also to meruayle¬∑ yt by wrytynge it can not be duely spoken nor recomp+ted for than she taketh and receyueth for herytage eternall paynes of helle declared in the treatyse fo+lowynge vnto whome it shall please also theym to see.
Alas well may she curse the houre of her creacyon whan by his defaute he leseth the royalme of paradyse and falleth in to the furoure of god and of his enemyes.
THe fyfth aduysement is vnto the regarde of the soule the whiche hath deserued salua+cyon for she beynge in the batayll of deth as it hath be sayd before.
Incontynent that she seeth the bles+sed swete Jhesu cryste in the forme and maner that hath ben sayd.
That is to vnderstonde in the estate that he was in at the houre that his ryghte holy soule was departed.
She shall knowe clerely that by the bou~te and mercy of god and ye meryte of his passyon she is of the nombre of the saued and shall see manyfestly and openly the ylles that she hath euaded and escaped and all the meanes By the whiche she shall come vnto suche ende as it shall be to haue byleue vnto good inspyracyons of his ho+ly angell and to haue fere and loue god in kepyng acco~plysshynge his holy co~man~dementes for elles it had be impossyble for to come vnto a good ende And the blyssed swete Jhesu cryste his god his loue his espouse hym shall comforte of paynes of sorowes of the fere and of the doubte and of the pe+ryll from whome she came and so shall be assured of the deuyll the whiche than shall be all confused seynge and knowynge that he hath loste his praye and that the holy persone be it man or woman hym vaynquyssed in deseruynge to haue the royal me and glorye of paradyse The whiche he hath loste by his pryde and defaute none vnderstondyn+ge ne may comprehende.
No clerke expres+se the Joye and exaltacyon the whiche than cometh vnto the soule the whiche hath deserued to be of the nombre and of the company of them that be chose~ For she her seeth and knoweth the espouse of Jhesu cryste And by the consequent quene of paradyse And therfore Jhesu cryste in her vnto her sayth ryght gracyously come you¬∑ with me myn es+pouse.
Also she her seeth so moche loued of Jhesu cryste the which hath wylled to suffre deth and pas+syon for her on the tree of the crosse and in the ma+ner in the whiche he appered than as yf he wolde saye vnto the soule Reknowlege ryght dere creatu+re that by this passyon how moche you desyre loue for no creature may not more stro~gly loue tha~ to wyll to dye wylfully for the loue of his frende. Also she seeth the humanyte vnyed with the deyte in the persone of his loue and of his espouse by the whiche she knoweth to be the doughter syster and loue of the kynge of glorye and honoured more than nature angelyque as vnto that.
And therfore Jhesu cryste in callynge yet agayne vnto her sayth Come vnto me my syster and my and than the blyssed soule so departeth vnto the voyce of her loue the which calleth so swetely she her departeth and leueth her body and her representeth vnto hy~ vnto his blyssed pleaser and co~maundement and than all the angelles and sayntes of paradyse receyuen a newe iubylacyon in gyuynge praysynges and graces vnto the creature the whiche by his mer+cy hath gyuen suche ayde comforte vnto his crea+ture that she is escaped the deuyll of helle the worlde and the fless and than the glo+ryous angelles ryght reuerently taken the doughter of god the fader and the loue of god the sone temple and habytacle of the blyssed holy goost and her conduyteth Joyously in to the possessyon eternall of the royalme of the whiche from the begynnynge of the worlde vnto hym hath ben prepared promyssed and gyuen.
faythful and pyteous and of the vertue of the fayth yllumy+ned ymagyned contemple and esmeruayll the gre+te and incompreuable dyfference the whiche is at houre of deth bytwene the good soule and the euyl For in lyke wyse as the deth is the yate of parady+se vnto the good soule.
Also is it the yate of helle vnto the euyll Come with me blyssed of god my fa+der.
And by the contrary he sayth vnto euyll Go thou vnto the deuyll acursyd and seperat from all the blyssed trynyte.
And euen in lyke wyse as the+se holy angelles taken accompanyen and comfort the good soule of Joye inestymable.
In semblable by the contrary the taken and deuouren the soule of the dampned in gyuynge vnto her fere dysease and tormentes without ende and without relesynge And this dyfference appereth more playnly vnto hym that wyll rede and consyder the treatyse of the paynes of helle and of Jo+yes of paradyse.
THe syxte aduysement is of the estate of pur+gatorye of the whiche euery man ought to that it is one parte of hell the place of ryght payne For fyrste the the whiche be~ in that torment ben boldyd taryed to see the ensence dyuyne the whiche vnto them is noysau~t incompreuable Also they ben in affleccio~ of fyre and of tormentes moche sharpe or of other paynes after the Jugement dyuyne.
Wherof sayth saynt Bernarde in his wrytynges that the payne of purgatorye of one daye surmou~teth the payne whiche all martres and other sayntes of paradyse haue suffred For the Justyce dyuyne punyssheth otherwyse in the other worlde.
And therfore sayth saynt Austen that a man may more acquyte of the payne due vnto synne by wepynge one in this present lyfe than a man sholde do in ten yeres by payne of purgatorye for as moch that a man is in the other worlde in the courte of Justyce.
And in this worlde a man is in the courte of mercy of that place and of that estate hath full fewe knowlege co~munyte of crysten people which lyuen at this daye which wyll not faste or do other penau~ce whiche lytell doth for ony maner of that they haue co~mytted. how be it it behoueth to do dygne penaunce in this worlde or in the other.
And therfore sayth well saynt Gregorye and saynt Ambro+se that a man fyndeth in paradyse more of saued the whiche haue kepte innocence of baptem than of those the whiche haue longely lyued and doeth suche penau~ce of theyr synnes that after the deth they sholde not be holden in purgatorye and notwithstondynge theyr grete payne how be it be they certayne that they shall be saued And they ben vi+syted by those angelles of paradyse and ayded ryght gretely as well by the blyssed sayntes vnto who me they haue hadde deuoeyon and done seruyce in this as by the suffrages and orysons of holy chirche for as moche as those of paradyse and of purgatorye And those the whiche yet ben in this present lyfe in the estate of grace ben one body mysticall in Jhesu cryste by the vnyon of charyte for all these before sayd haue the blyssed holy goost by grace for yf the one membre serue vnto the other naturally by more stronger reason the sayntes of paradyse may ayde as well vnto vs the which ben in this worlde for to prayse them reclayme as vn+to the~ of purgatorye the whiche haue deserued on this halue to be ayded For comenly after as some doth theyr deuoure to praye to acquyte the~ agay~ the~ yt ben departed In lyke wyse shall it be done for hy~ after his deth Also these doctours sayen that they of purgatorye prayen for vs whiche ben in this worlde yt moche of goodes corporall spyry+tuall vnto vs come~ by merytes oryso~s of fayth full people departed specyally whan we do our de uoure agayne them by the contrary those whiche them dyffrauden as done these possessours the whiche posseden laudes rentes houses be it in lytell or in grete ye whiche to them be come succede from theyr frendes predecessours departed.

Here foloweth the fyfth finall partie of this boke in the whiche is made mencyon of ye paynes of helle and of the Joyes of paradyse and fyrste of the paynes of helle.
[Figure: FOr as moche that euery good persone humaynehym ought to co~forme after as it is of reason vnto the wyl dyuyne the whiche is suche That is to know yt we eschewe all yll we vs enforce to prouffyte in vertues and in good werkes vnto the whiche thynge to do we be induced naturally by fere in regarde to purchase merites and vertues.
Here foloweth thetreatyse of ye paynes of helle and of the Joyes of paradyse the whiche is ye fyfth and the laste partye of this boke by the consyderacyon of the whiche we haue the souerayn ma+ter and occasyon the whiche may be founde or ymagened for to fere and for to loue.
That is to vnderstonde for to fere the paynes of helle and for to loue and desyre the glorye of paradyse.
The whi+che thynge to do ye holy scrypture vs hath warned the whiche sayth that yf we consyder well the thynges laste or extreme we sholde neuer do synne wher+fore it is to be noted that hell and paradyse ben na+med the extremites or the thynges laste we shold thynke and consyder that they ben ryghte extreme in comparyson of this present worlde as vnto the sytuacyon of the place and as vnto theyr qualytes as vnto the place and sytuacyon for this presente worlde is bytwene helle and paradyse and for as moche that euery thyngemeane hath comparyson and partycypacyon with his extremytes we se sen+sybly that in this worlde there are many of ylles and many of goodnesses for there are ylles as wel of culpe as of payne.
That is to vndersto~de colde and hete wyndes raynes hayles thonder lyghte+nynge other tempestes as well vpon the see as vpon the londe Also honger thruste and syknesses of dyuers condycyons As ben feuers styches goutes botches and rottynges of membres swellynges venymes and apostumes.
Also warres ba+tayles dyuysyons mortalytes famynes and other ylles innumerable the whiche ben noysome and aduersaryes of the body.
Also of the partye of the soule there are ylles of sy~ne and of culpe grete and without nomber and temptacyons the whiche comen vnto some by cause of theyr dyuers occupacyons worldely these other of the cautelle malyce of the deuyll these other by cause of oure owne inclynacyons of the corrupcyon fragylyte huma+ne.
By the whiche the esperyte humayne falleth in to heuynes thought indesmaye in Ire in enuy and in malancoly also in synnes detestables and more horryble than vnderstondynge may vnderstonde or ymagen.
And also those thynges ben+som what fygured with representacyon and royal representacyon of the extremyte of paynes of tor+mentes the whiche ben in hell without ende.
Also on the other we see in some persones of this worlde Joye gladnes helth beaute honours rychesses pleasures dysportes games and delytes¬∑ after the desyres of herte humayne and fornycacy+on of the pleaser of creatures.
As delectable odour of the sauoure of dyuers fruytes wynes meetes the delectacyon the whiche is in pleasau~t touchynges.
Also in the sounde and melodye of sou~+des as well of Instrumentes musyques as in the Ioyous modulacyon of voyce humayne and other thynges pleasauntes and delectables as well vnto the fyue wyttes of nature as vnto all the puyssau~+ces of the soule.
The whiche thynges ben the syme+lytude and representacyon of the glorye and beaty+tude of paradyse.
By the whiche it appereth clerely that in this worlde all is medled.
That is to vnder+stonde good and yll as deth and lyfe helth syke+nes pouerte and rychesse sorow and gladnes. and so of all other thynges contraryes and opposytes by suche condycyon how be it in this worlde there is no good parfayte but alonely is founde and in paradyse.
In lyke wyse the ylles and trybulacyons of this worlde be not ylles souerayns extremes but ben alonely founde of the dampned in helle and therfore the god of nature the whiche putteth ordre and reason in euery creature and yel+deth and bryngeth euery thynge vnto the ende and consummacyon taketh in this worlde the good them putteth and ordeyneth with the good vnto ye royalme of paradyse and the cursyd with the cur+syd in the pryson and in the tormentes extreme of helle.
And therfore of those two extremytes it beho+ueth some thyng to touche and recyte for to put vs in fere and loue the whiche ben the two rotes for to flee and to leue all yll and to take the payne to do well.
And fyrste of the paynes of helle. secondely of the Joyes of paradyse.
As vnto ye fyrst it is to vnderstonde yt no crysten man ne ought to doub+te but yt in helle there is prepayred payne eternall. vnto those the whiche refusen dyfferren to do yt yt is vnto theyr saluacyon in the shortenes of this ly+fe for it is the trouth anou~ced by the holy scryptures and prechynges by the mouth of Jhesu cryste a thynge confermed in the lyghte of reason.
The holy scryptures the whiche wytnessen that in helle and the eternall paynes of it the whiche ben reserued vnto the cursyd ben ynough manyfeste.
Syns it is so that god is of Justyce infynyte it is impossyble but that suche Justyce ordeneth and suffreth that euery syn+ne be ryght Justely punysshed.
The whiche thynge is not alwayes done in this worlde For of the more comen cours the moost gretest synners haue the moost of felycyte worldly.
By the whiche it be+houeth to conclude that they shall be punysshed in the other.
Of the whiche punycyon it behoueth to see fyrste in generall and afterwarde more in espe+cyall.
As vnto the generalyte of the paynes of hell comen vnto purpose the sayenge of saynt Austen in the boke named de tribus habitaculis.
In ye whi+che is declared that none vnderstondyng create suf+fyseth for to thynke or ymagen tormentes of hell and of eternall dampnacyon suche as they ben for they ben ryght more greuous excess yf than may be spoken or thought and how be it an hye and a fayre vnderstondynge may thynke paynes formentes moche to meruayll as sholde be the bytter+nes and horrybylyte to see in fyre or in metall mol+ten with out hauynge power to taste the deth the whiche is than in hell of as moche or more desyred of the dampned the whiche is not in this worlde re+doubted and of good ryght vnto them it is denyed For as moche that in this worlde they haue ye lyfe eternall dyspreysed and refused Also a man may consyder the generalyte the dyuersyte and the eter+nyte of the sayd paynes the whiche¬∑ the dampned suffren as well vnto the body as vnto all the puys+saunces of the soule in suche rayge and varyacyon mayntenau~t of colde and after of hete that euery vnderstondynge there fayleth.
Also the wepynges and the waylynges and the confusyon the whiche ben contynually in helle and other paynes innume+rable without euer there hauy~ge release and with+out that that the dampned mayen by length of eternyte be enhardened or acustumed for the lesse greffe them to endure and bere.
Also a man may co~+syder the remors and the dyspleasures that these dampned haue.
Whan they knowen certenly that they hadde ben saued yf they hadde wolde and for a momente of the pleasure of this presente worlde they ben gyuen vnto suche inco~uenyent that neuer in theyr case there is no hope nor abydyng of repa+racyon and many of other suche contemplacyons may be ymagyned by intente humayne and how be it as sayth saynt Austen in the boke before sayd that it is as nothynge in of the dede and of the royalte of that yt suffren the dampned and yt notwithstondynge yet we sholde vs enforce after our lytell obscure capacyte to vnderstonde thynke that yt by the holy scryptures vnto vs hath be gyuen shewed for the fere yt we seche by this co~+syderacyon cometh and procedeth whan a man ap+prehendeth and taketh by vnderstondynge some thynge terryble and of as moche that a man consi+dereth and that a man vnderstondeth suche thynge horryble more in specyall in partyculer of as moche conceyueth a man the more greter fere. and for as moche that in the seconde poynt the whiche is the consyderacyon of the sayd paynes in partyculer mouynge the ayde of the holy goost.
shall ten paynes pryncypalles of the partye of the body and ten other of the partye of the soule.
And euery of the twenty paynes is dyuysed in foure so there shall be foure and twenty paynes partycu+lers taken of ye paynes infynyte and without nombre that suffren and shall suffre euer without ende (these cursyd dampned soules by the consyderacyon of the whi+che the herte humayn the whiche them wyll rede or herken shall be to moche enhardened and tayde of the bondes of the fende of helle the whiche conceyueth not fere and tremblynge for to come after the shortenes of this present lyfe vnto suche so horryble tormente.
Here foloweth the ten paynes of the partye of ye body that these dampned suffren in helle and euery of the~ deuysed in foure so they ben. xl. paynes.
The thyrde grete cryes of dolour wtout ceassynge The fourth smoke the whiche may not in helle be lefte.
The fyfth odoure and stynkynge moche horryble The syxte vysyon of deuylles terryble.
The .viii. thruste which tormenteth in lyke wyse The .ix. grete shame and confusyon.
THe fyrste payne is of fyre brennynge of the whiche it is to vnderstonde yt notwithstondynge yt the fyre of helle is a thynge corporall of ye same nature as is yt of this world how be it they dyfferen in foure thynges.
The fyrste is in sharpe+nes of hete for it is more hote than is oures of as moche as oures is more hoter than yt the whiche is paynted on a wall after as sayth saynt Austen the whiche is none other thynge to vnderstonde but we be not suffycyent for to ymagen the excesse of ye fyre of helle in regarde and comparyson of oures.
Of the whiche euer more we haue so meruaylous experyens that there is no metall ne other thynge but that it melteth brenneth or altreth and therfore esmeruayll ye torment of the fyre of hell what it may be.
The seconde dyfference of the fyre of helle and of oures is as vnto the hardenes for oures is in beynge lesseth and consumeth his mater but that of hell is eternall and neuer lesseth For for euer her mater shall endure¬∑ That is to vnderstonde the body and ye soule of dampned synners them holden alwayes in one maner.
Thyrdly they dyfferen in lyght for how be it that that of helle is grete and brennynge euer more et it yeldeth no lyght the whiche is ony thynge plea saunt but all the syght and lyght the whiche is in helle it is for to torment greuously those yt ben da~pned.
Fourth+ly they dyfferen for it conserueth in beynge ye thy~ge that it brenneth and boyleth to chaunge in to as+shes or in to other nature.
By these foure thynges appereth that none vnderstondynge is suffycyent to comprehende the horrybylyte of suche tormente.
THe seconde payne is of water colde dyffereth from that of this present worlde in foure thynges.
The fyrste is oppresse of colde for lyke wyse as the brennynge of the fyre of helle sur+mounteth the brennynge of oures euen so the col+de in the other worlde surmounteth the colde in this worlde by suche maner that yf the moost gre+teste mou~tayne of the worlde were of yren massyf and embrased as was euer stele for to forge and it were put in the tormente of the ponde of yse in the coldenes of it sholde be from parte to parte yse. also as in a moment.
And therfore sayth well saynt Gregorye that suche colde is intollerable yf a man demaunde wherfore oure lorde sayth not as well in the gospell departe you from me acursed dampned and go ye in to the colde eternall as he sayth into the fyre eternall.
The answere for asomoche as the fyre amonge other elementes is moost actyf and the moost afflyctyf therfore god vnto vs gyueth example of fyre more sooner than of the yse.
put that he it gyueth ynough to vnder+stonde by other places of gospell where he sayth that these dampned shall wepe and shall grynde theyr teeth for coldenes.
The seconde dyffere~ce of ye water of helle of this worlde is for of hell ne+uer chauffeth for ony thynge hote whiche vnto it may be gyuen but euer more abydeth in one estate and degree of coldenes.
The thyrde dyfference is that yt of helle is euermore trouble full of stenche and incomparable erroure: The fourth dyfference is for that helle maketh not these dampned to dye but in lyke wyse as these fysshes lyuen in the water in this worlde so these dampned may not dye in the water in that worlde.
THe thyrde payne is to crye to braye in we+pynge and in playnynge ye whiche torment is the cause for foure thynges.
Therfore as moche that the dampned knowen that they shall neuer se god the whiche is the moost gretest payne of helle for these saued or these dampned loue better to be in helle for euer and to see god than to be in para+dyse see hym not yf suche thynge were possyble And in suche wyse yt none ne may speke nor thyn+ke the melodye the whiche is made in paradyse as well of the blyssed angelles as of holy men and wo+men yblyssed.
In lyke wyse there is none that may declare the pyteous and horryble trye and howlyn+ge the whiche is made in helle as well of deuylles as of other dampned And yf a man demaunde what they saye in cryenge.
Also they curse togy+ders as theyr fader and moder and the houre that they were begoten that they were borne and that they were put vnto nourysshynge and those them sholde correcte and teche and also those that haue ben the occasyon of theyr synnes as the baude cur+syd be the baude and also of other occasyons in dy+uers synnes.
The seconde cause of the crye of them dampned is for the consyderacyon that they haue of the tyme of mercye the whiche is paste.
In ye whi+che they may do penaunce and purchase paradyse The thyrde cause is of theyr crye for by cause of horryble paynes that they enduren.
As we may co~+sydere that yf an hundreth persones hadde euery of them one fote and one hande in the fyre or in the water sethynge without power to dye what bruyt and what crye they sholde make but that sholde be lesse than nothynge in comparyson of deuylles and of other dampned for they ben more than an hundreth thousande thousandes the whiche vnto them doeth noysau~ce and all in one thondre cryenge and brayen horrybly.
The fourth reason of suche clamoure is for as moche that they be~ dyspeyred for euer to haue remedy.
man may demaunde how that may be as after the Justyce dyuyne that for one oonly synne the whiche hath be so sone done and so lyghtly co~mytte a. soule the whiche hath ben of god so moche beloued the whi+che vnto the ymage of hymself hath be made and fermed is dampned eternally vnto so grete depnes and confusyon of paynes and tormentes.
The an+swere may be made by the example of a byeng of an herytage the whiche is done in a lytell tyme how be it he gyueth the ryght of possessyon in per+petuyte.
In lyke wyse the synner selleth his soule and the ryght that he hath vnto ye royalme of paradyse in lytell whyle.
By the whiche he is dysenheryte for euer and vnto eternyte of paynes condampned.
Also a stroke is sone stryken wherof ye deth foloweth without euer to recouer the lyfe.
Also a man is anone fallen in to suche a dytche soo yt the arysynge is impossyble.
The answere by reasons the synners the whiche in theyr ende haue be fou~de in synne mortall haue synne in eternyte for yf they hadde lyued in this worlde euer more hadde they contynued theyr sy~ne.
By the whiche of good ryghte they sholde haue payne without ende.
Also after the deth the soule and the wyll ben innuuables be it in good or in yll.
And for as moche that the cursyd wyll of those that be dampned dureth perseuereth in her iniquyte she ought for euer more to abyde in paynes also the synne in the whiche ye dampned ben deed is agayne the god of eternyte By the whiche after Justyce eternall and infynyte the payne ought to be without ende.
Also for a lytell tyme of true penaunce or of a good werke done in the estate of grace god gyueth in eternyte royalme of paradyse by the whiche Justyce it requyreth that in lyke wyse also for one oonly synne mortall of the whiche a man myght in lycell tyme do penaunce is gyuen payne eternall and of yt eternyte of paynes shall be spoke~ after more play~+ly.
By the whiche it is to vnderstonde that euen in lyke wyse as smoke herebyneth is the cause of the thyknes of the fyre from whens it sheweth derke blacke and ingendreth stenche and prycketh the eyes procureth terys letteth the syght and hurteth ye brayne So in shewynge that of all paynes possybles there are in hell abundau~ce.
The holy scrypture sayth that in helle is smoke the whiche procedeth of foure thynges fyrste of the place infecte and stynkynge where there are so many of fylthes dyrte as synnes agayne the lawe of god synnes indycybles synnes agayne nature rebellyons obstynacyons impenyta~ce cursyd example doctryne shewed vnto yonge people.
of ye whiche ylles in this worlde the smoke yt is the reno~me ye which is so moche fyl+thy dau~gerous for yt yt in hell euer more it wex+eth grene abou~deth therfore euer more ther is it encreaseth.
And how be it yt in helle there is greate fyre horryble it consumeth not the sayd smoke.
Secondly it procedeth of the mater the whiche there is brente for euen in lyke wyse as nothynge entreth in to paradyse but that is pure and clene euen so in helle entreth nothynge but stenche and dyrte wherof the smoke may not be but inuysyble and so as these synnes on this halue blyndeth letteth the vnderstondynge soo ye smoke of ye fyre of helle in ye quencheth theyr true knowlege in suche wyse that they dyspysen and dyspraysen and cursen theyr Justyce they cur+se also fader and moder and all theyr frendes. the thyrde thynge wherof the sayd smoke procedeth is of the assystence and presence in the sayd place of helle for by the experyens wese that in places whe+re ben people infecte foule and stynkynge of theyr nose of theyr bodyes of theyr clothy~ges procedeth smoke and odoure engendrynge heuynes and ma+keth hym that may to fle the place.
In lyke wyse of deuylles of the dampned procedeth for they ben full of all vnclenlynes and smoke beynge full of sorowe and the whiche engendreth derkenesses outwarde vnfelynge.
The fourth thynge wherof procedeth the habundau~ce of the sayd smoke is that in the sayd place of helle there is no waye nor other place from whens it may departe but from the tyme that the cursyd angelles were create and they rebelled agayne god that Cayme ye whiche was the fyrste dampned of men all ye smokes ben abydynge there.
Than reste that ye place is moche blynde derke dyspleasau~t noyfull THe fyfth payne is odour stynkynge and hor+ryble cause of foure partes.
The fyrste par+tye shall be for as moche yt all the stynkynge thynges that euer were or euer shall be.
Than shall be assembled and caste in to the dytche of helle.
And a body humayne the whiche rotteth in a waye or in a quarefoure of a towne without beynge buryed is so grete stynche specyally in the tyme of grete he+te that suche stynche rotteth and enpoysoneth all ye enhabytances of a cyte.
What may that be of the multytude of the bodyes of all the dampned leche+rous people ydolatres and other without nombre the whiche shall be wors than roten in the fyre and in the smoke the whiche may not out of hell auoy+de thynke who so can.
The seconde payne shall be of sulfre embrased after as sayth holy scrypture. The thyrde shall be of the flesshe humayne as it is sayd the whiche after the dyuersyte and greuous+nes of synnes shall be stynkyng more or lesse the fourth shall procede of the presence of deuylles of the stenche of whome god hath shewed many examples as it apereth in the legende of saynt Mar+tyn whan they appered in this worlde they lefte astynche intollerable.
THe syxte payne is of the vysyon of deuylles the whiche causen vnto the dampned four maner of paynes.
The fyrste is fere and trembly~ge for yf a man fere moche to see or to mete a dog+ge or a lyon enraged or other creature foule cruel and gastly what may that be to see contynually all the deuylles for a man fyndeth in wrytynge yt yf ony persone mortall see one oonly in that fygure that these dampned the~ seen it sholde suffyce for to make hym dye or for to be madde and to lese al his vnderstondynge.
The seconde payne the which gyueth suche vysyon vnto the dampned is contynuall reproche of synnes that they them haue made to acompte.
The thyrde shall be flagellacyons and tormentes inexplycables it without ende or wt out releasynge.
The fourth shall be that they shal foyle and threste all the dampned togyders and in more greter dystresse tha~ euer were stones in a wall or in other thynge by forceof engyne of pressures.
The fyrste for vnto suche hongre by no meane these dampned ne may haue remedye.
The seconde for thynge the whiche is in helle hath not dysposycyon for to be satyfyed The thyrde for the remembraunce that they haue of the delyte that they were wonte to take for to ete The fourth for as moche that they knowe suche hongre shall neuer cease and soo they knowe well that these tormentes before sayd and those the whi+che folowen ben come in nature humayne.
By the occasyon of cursyd eetynge of the fruyt yt god had defendyd vnto our fore faders.
THe. viii. payne is of thruste inestymable the whiche tormenteth not alonely the tonge the throte or the mouth but with that all the partyes of the body without and within and suche tor+ment cometh by foure thynges.
The fyrste for as moche that the dampned haue water presented of the whiche they may not taste.
The seconde for as moche that in suche thruste there is no release or hope for ony tyme to come of that torment sayth Ihesu cryste in the gospell yt the cursyd ryche man requyred the dayes of Abraham one poore and ly+tell droppe of water and neuer myghte he haue it nor neuer shall he haue it¬∑ a man fyndeth in wryty~+ge that the sayd cursyd ryche man hadde to name Tantalus and was of the people of hebryeus the whiche thynge men afferme for as moche as he called Abraham his fader¬∑ and he was foure ho~+dreth yere byfore the comynge of Ihesu cryste and in the tyme of the grete physosypher Arystole and euersyns nor neuer shall cease to dye and for to en+rage for thruste.
In the whiche it appereth how yt it is grete errour for to fall in the Iustyce dyuyne The thyrde is for a sauour that these dampned ha+ue in theyr taste the whiche is made and composed of galle and of the bytter thynges of helle the whiche holy scrypture nameth ye galle of dragons the whiche is a torment in explymable for in lyke as in this worlde it is a thynge moche pleasaunt as to taste and sauour precyous wynes and delycyous meetes.
Also in the other worlde it is a thynge mo+che cruelle as the tormente the whiche is to taste.
/: The fourth is a rage the whiche is of the teeth for in lyke wyse as the teeth haue ben somwhat an in+strument to taste they ben in the other worlde an instrument for to tormente.
THe. ix. is a payne ryght excessyue for foure reasons.
The seconde by cause of the place the whiche is ryght vyle and ryght stynkynge.
The thyrde for they shall be in seruytude of the ryght yll sauoure that is of ye deuylles and vnto the synnes the whiche they haue loued.
The fourth for the companye for euery of the dampned hath partyculer payne for the presence damp+nacyon of the other as well of deuylles as of the men and women.
THe tenth payne of those that ben dampned is as vnto the touchynge for all the partyes of the body of them dampned ben more tender as to be hurted and dyseased than they were in this worlde whan by botches and apostumes they were halfe and that notwithstondynge they shall haue agreuaunce of foure partyes.
The fyrste shall be of the ponderosyte and collygacyon from the one membre vnto the other the whiche is of as moche grete greuaunce as the helth and the good dysposycyon was the comforte and ayde of other membres in the present lyfe and more grete of as moche as the lyfe where ye estate to come excedeth in good or in yll that of this prese~t lyfe.
The ayde that the one membre doeth vnto the other may be knowen in consyderynge the operacyon and vsage of euery membre in regarde of the other as we see that the operacyon of the mouth is the cause of ye lyfe of all the other soo of the eyes soo of the fote and of euery of the other membres secrete in asmo+che that the sykenes and dystruccyon of the one is the dystruccyon of the other And soo in lyke wyse may a man saye of the dolour the whiche is in eue+ry membre of the dampned for it is suffycyent vnto the deth of all these other yf deth corporall myght be in helle recouered and so this may be vnderston+de not aloonly of the membres of the body of nature.
but with that of the membres of the body mys+tycall that is to saye that yf were in hell with out hauynge other payne than that that he seeth and knoweth in his neyghbours he sholde suffre for to dye of as many dethes as there are of persones dampned in suche wyse that as many of membres as many of dethes.
The seconde payne is for the touchynge of the place in the whiche they ben the whiche fyre enbraseth not aloonly by nature but more ouer by operacyon dyuyne for that that he is the instrument to excersyce the Iustyce of god. /: And for as moche that these operacyons dyuynes maryculousses ben moche more excellentes than those the whiche ben done symply after the cours of nature the embrasynge and the tormente of the fyre of helle excedeth the hete of all metalles molten the whiche may be ymagyned more excessyuely than herte may thynke.
And therfore whan suche fyre is in the depnes of the herte of bones of synewes and of vaynes of bloode and of the flesshe of the dampned and the whiche is more to esmeruayll in all ye puyssaunces of ye soule. who may than thynke the anguysshe of them the whiche ben in suche torment without euer to haue power to dye.
But some may make suche a questyon Yf it be so that these dampned shall be bayned in a ponde of yse after¬∑ as holy scrypture sayth and la+tely hath ben sayd before that as moche is the grete oppresse of colde as that of fyre as it may be to enioyne hete and colde in one selfe torment and in those ye whiche may not be remeuyd from one pla+ce vnto another.
The answere vnto that the grete Alberte that suche alteracyon of colde and of hete in one selfe body maketh is not made yt it is put from one place in to another.
But in lyke wyse as the¬∑ sykenes of a feuer gyueth fyrste coldenes and afterwarde meruayllous hete euyn so the tormentes of helle ben varyed amonge these dampned wt out mutacyon of the place of theyr pryson and hell perpetuall.
The thyrde payne is for the touchynge of other bodyes dampned and embrased as a man seeth sensybly that of as moche that there is moch wode in a fyre of as moche it brenneth ye more stro~+gely and therfore the fyre embrased in a towne is ryght peryllous for the multytude of the houses ye whiche ben togyders.
Not alonely to fele or for the domage that it doeth but with that vnto the regar+de of hym or of those whiche nothynge shall pos+sede in the sayd cyte for by the erroure and abhomynacyon of suche embrasynge a man may lese the wytte and the vnderstondynge Now thynke he that may what it may be of those the whiche fe+len them and vnderstonden to be dampned in the fyre of hell for euer more as longe as god shall be god. and they shall be mothan an hundreth thousande thousandes of ye whiche euery of them shall make more greter fyre than sholde that of ye moost greatest towne of the worlde yf it were embrased.
The fourth payne of the betynge and strykynge yt the deuylles make vpon ye bodyes vpon ye soules of those that ben dampned and for a brete epilogacyon of all the paynes of the partye of the body it is to be noted that all the fyue wtyttes naturalles of the da~pned shall be with thynges the whiche vnto them shall gyue tormentes aboue all estymacyons as the cyte shall see tormentes creatures deformed as the doughter shall see the moder and ye moder the doughter the systers and the broder kynnesfolke and other frendes.
Also the husbonde the wyfe and the wyfe her husbonde so of an hundreth thousande other thynges that euery of the dampned seeth and knoweth of euery thynge vnto sorowe and dysease pertyculerly so of the herynge in herynge ye crye the lyghtenyn+ge and the thondre of hete and of colde the which contynually ben assembled the one as grete as an other of the whiche assemble and presse spryngeth a co~fusyon of sou~de as somtyme we may se whan one putteth an yron embrased in the water or wha~ a cloude colde assembleth with another cloude hote Than it causeth ye lyghtenynge the thondre the whiche of tymes vnto vs is hatefull for ye errour of the grete sou~de of the cryes yf it than be so that the body of euery of the dampned be a corner of ye lyghtenynge of the tormente of helle what confusyon of crye and of thonder there may he haue thynke he that may.
Also the taste the smell and ye touchyng ben in semblables varyacyons and inno~+brables paynes and tormentes.
By the consyderacyon alonely of the paynes before sayd the whiche is a lytell thynge in comparyson of them the whiche folowen all vnderstondynge the whiche may vnto suche paynes come or hym kepe theder for to come sholde well in hymselfe conceyue on suche fe+rechat by that he hym enforce to do well and all yll for to eschewe and fle the whiche thynge is the ende vnto the which we entende in all the processe of this present boke.
Here folowen in one maner of the generalyte of the paynes of the soule dampned.
AFter forty paynes corporalles nombred and reherced before it behoueth some what to reherce of the paynes of the soule to the ende yt those the whiche wyll not or may not conceyue fere by the consyderacyon of the sayd paynes corporal+les that for the spyrytualles they may come vnto the fere of the creature the whiche hath puyssaunce to dampne body and soule in helle for the paynes spyrytualles ben more cruell and more to be doubted of as moche that the soule is more greter thyng tha~ ye body ye whiche co~paryson surmou~teth now the capacyte of vnderstondynge humayne in this (mater and by the consequent a man may not comprehende parfytly the paynes of the soule for as it hath ben before sayd after saynt Austen they be moche more greter than a man may speke or thynke.
And that notwitstondynge some thynge shall be here reherced how be it that it be lytell and fyrste in generall and secondly more in pertyculer.
As vnto the fyrst it is to vnderstonde that vnto god the fader is gyuen puyssaunce infynyte vnto god the sone sembla+ble sapyence and vnto the god the holy goost lyke bonte and bukso~nes and this blyssed trynyte one dyuynyte one selfe essence one maieste by his puys+saunce his sapyence and bonte to create soule reasonable vnto his semblau~ce vnto his ymage in gy+uynge her mynde vnderstondynge and wyll in so hyghe degree of noblesse naturall that he vnto her hath gyuen fre choyse to do well or yll soo that it shall procede of the free wyll and yf she her wyll humble in yeldynge vnto god the obedyence and ye seruyce that she knoweth by reason naturall to be due vnto the creature she her vnyeth with hym by grace beynge partener vnto the glorye of his dyuy+nyte by so hygh excellence of dyuynyte that he her calleth the doughter of god the espouse of Jhesu cryste and quene of paradyse.
And she the whiche knoweth and may all thynges in god And by the contrary whan so noble a creature her peruerteth contraryous and rebelle agayne god her creature ye whiche in suche wyse her hath autorysed endoned ennobled and yt she wyll of her propre wyll agay~ the co~maundement and ordenau~ce of her god crea+tour and redemptour.
Than she supposeth vnto god her creatour maketh of herselfe her god in presumynge and sechynge dysordenatly in all thynges her propre honoure her glorye and her prayse and for that that suche god is nothynge folye and erroure the poore soule myserable falleth abydeth aduersary and contraryous vnto god the creatoure in whome is all goodnes and all puyssaunce infynytly and he oonly vnto whome is gyuen all honoure. and therfore so as we see that derkenesses be~ contraryes vnto lyght beaute and honeste vnto foulnes and vnto all fylth pouerte rychesse helth syknes the deth vnto the lyfe and soo of all other thynges contraryous.
In lyke wyse it behoueth to saye of the soule the whiche is contraryous and ad+uersary vnto god And for as moche that in god as it is sayd is puyssaunce sapyence bonte beaute rychesse glorye honoure pleasures. delytes lyfe trouth Justyce equytes swetnes and all other per+feccyons infynytly without nombre it foloweth well that in the soule the whiche by the abusyon of his propre wyll is vnto hy~ contraryous in fermyn+ge aduersarye and contraryous vnto the wyll dyuyne is all frowarde and the contrary of the thynges before sayd.
That is to vnderstonde debylyte and myserable feblenes folye and cursydnes horryble defermyte of foulnes pouerte of all godenes so grete yt the deth or to be adnychylate hym sholde seme to be for a grete good mysery dyshonoure of all partes dyspleasau~ce dysease paynes and do lours without nombre without mesure deth eternall vnto hym is his partage and propre herytage falsete iniquyte malyce and suche crudelyte that he curseth god and all creatures in desyrynge that all the worlde were dampned as she notwithstondynge that she knoweth well that better with her it shall nothynge be but euer worse.
And for asmoche yt she hath clere vnderstondynge of herselfe and that she knoweth seeth her dysposycyon her da~p+nacyon the ylles the inco~uenye~tes before sayd the whiche folowe wtout no~bre without ende in the whiche is put gyuen by her propre wyll. also she hath knowlege of ye goodes of the glorye that she hath loste by her defaute And the whiche may neuer be recouered and seeth that of all these ylles she oonly is the culpe and defaute she hateth her+selfe and curseth aboue all thynges.
And in lyke wyse as she is dysordynatly loued she her selfe hateth and of good ryght and wolde she hadde neuer ben made but she may not haue ye thynge that she desyreth who knoweth the foulnesand dyrte that she may not dryue a waye or wasshe her dyshonour that she may not recouer her iniquyte that she may not correcte her losse that she may not recouer for the whiche thynges and for the greate rage in the whiche she is holden she byteth and eateth her han+des and her tonge hath well to vnderstonde she may not helselfe bere ne endure wherfore there is none vnderstondynge tonge ne wrytynge by ye whi+che a man may declare the payne and greuous ra+ge of the dampned and this is as vnto the generalyte of the paynes of hell of the partye of the soule.
Here foloweth of the ten paynes pryncypalles of the soule the whiche is dampned and euery of the~ dyuysed in foure.
THe seconde remors wtout ende of co~scyence The thyrde Ire rancure and murmure.
The syxte is fere that moche men noyeth The .vii. payne is torment the whiche fayleth not.
THe fyrste payne is to be depryued from the glorye of paradyse and for to vnderstonde some what the gretenes of this payne it is well to be noted that as moche grete yll is the losse of some good as is grete the value of that good loste as for example.
Yf a man demaunde how moche the gre+te yll of sykenes a man may truely answere that it is as moche grete yll as helth is grete good for as moche as the sykenes is contraryous vnto helth. al+so what yll is the deth it is as moche grete yll as lyfe is grete good.
In lyke wyse yf a man demau~de what yll is dampnacyon eternall it is as moche grete yll as the glorye of paradyse is grete good.
for as moche that ye glorye of paradyse is more gre+te good than the tormentes of payne sensytyue be+fore sayd ben grete yll it foloweth that the payne (of the dammage that these dampned soules haue that is to be depreuyd from the beatytude eter+nall is more grete yll than all the paynes corporal+les before sayd.
This payne of do~mage causeth foure greate and inco~preuables ylles vnto the da~p+ned.
The fyrste is to be depryued to see the blyssed trynyte the whiche is as moche grete yll as god is grete good after as it is declared before ymagen he that may and not ye yll of suche losse dampnacyon.
And therfore sayth well saynt Austen that there is no saynt in paradyse but that loueth better to be in the fyre and tormentes of paynes and too see god than to be in the glorye of paradyse excepte to see good.
The seconde yll is to de depreuyd from the co~solacyon and glorye that the saued haue for the company presente of blyssed angellys.
The thyrde yll is to be depryued from ye Joye and glad+nes that all sayntes haue for the presence the one of the other.
The fourth yll is to be depryued from the contree and from the royalme of paradyse the whiche of good ryght is named the lande of lyfe as this present worlde is well named the londe of deth.
Wherfore it is to be notyd that as to lese a duche or a royalme in this valee of mesery and of ye cou~tre of deth and ryght peryllous to enhabyte it is a thynge so moche ferefull and so moche playn+nynge yt for to kepe hym from suche peryll a man doeth armes bataylles assaultes as ¬∑sholde euery man in the ryght of hymselfe to doo for to eschewe the losse of suche good as the royalme of paradyse.
Wherof sayth saynt Gregorye that the leste of the saued haue entyerly and perfytly the possessyon of all paradyse for charyte by the whiche a man loueth his neyghbour as hymselfe maketh all godes to be comon specyally in the sayd royalme of paradyse.
THe seconde payne of the partye of the soule is named the worme or the remors of conscyence and a payne the whiche procedeth of clere knowlege the whiche than is in the soule by ye whiche she knoweth she hadde ben saued yf she hadde wylled whan she sholde haue wylled to do the wer+kes.
Also she knoweth that in suche losse there is no recouer and this vnto her is a dyspleaser incom+preuable as we may see some what in this worlde of them the whiche by theyr defaute or neclygence. lesen a grete good that they ben in remors and in dyspleaser agayne themselfe this payne is augmented vnto the dampned of foure partes.
The fyrste is of the mynde of all the synnes yt they euer dyde in theyr lyues haue they be pardo~ned other tymes on this behalue or not for in as moche that god them hath pardo~ned many synnes by many tymes of asmoche haue they be the more vnkynde to be retorned and fynally to dwelle in synnes. and whan they see the lytell pleaser the prouffyte the hardenes yt they haue had in sy~ne they felen the payne knowen ye eternyte thynke who so may ye rage in ye whiche they ben without ceasynge.
The seconde is of the mynde that they haue of ye good dedes that he myght haue done in lytell tyme as pe+nau~ce to purchase merytes and the royalme of pa+radyse that all is paste without euer there to haue remedy.
The thyrde is of ye mynde of ye goodes of the honours of ye rychesses yt god vnto them hath gyuen in this worlde for to prayse hym serue hy~ they haue ben abused in makynge warre dyshonoure vnto ye creature vnto the sayntes of paradyse. wherfore not aloonly the Justyce maieste dyuyne them holden offended but with yt the creatures in asmoche as ye vnkyndenes the offence is grete now is it by reason naturall yt the offence made agayne the puyssaunce sapyence bonte infynyte his malyce iniquyte folye infynyte by the whiche it behoueth the Justyce dyuyne punysshe iustely and by tormentes infynyte as afterwarde shall be shewed and this knoweth and seeth euery dampned to be done by the Justyce infynyte.
The whiche they hate soueraynly vnto whome they may not resyste in ony wyse flee or escape.
The fourth of the mynde of the goodes of grace that they haue other tymes hadde or yt they myght haue hadde of the whiche they haue loste ye meryte and retrybucyon the whiche was the vysyon of god and all the royalme and beatytude of para+dyse.
Also they haue clere knowlege of the benefyce of the Incarnacyon of oure lorde and of his blyssed passyon the whiche thynge vnto theym is as moche grete payne as the loue and the benefyce was grete and incompreuable and vpon this ymagen profoundly euery creature after the grace that the swete Jhesus vnto hym shall gyue for am ynough certayne that none vnderstondynge create ne may it comprehende all playne.
THe thyrde payne of the soule is Ire rancure incompreuable agayne foure thynges specyally.
The fyrste is agayne the puyssaunce of god vnto the whiche they maye not resyste as yt is sayd notwithstondynge that they it desyren soueraynly ben certayne to haue no power theder to come by the whiche they ben in Ire intollerable.
/: The seconde is agayne theyr mysery dampnacyon in suche wyse yt euery of them is in sorowe in anguysshe of his propre wyll do~mage more or lesse after the colour the da~mage.
for as moch the soule dampned hath clere knowlege of all her ylles she is enraged of an Ire without mesure. the thyrde is agayne the deuylles by temptacyon and suggestyon wherof they be comen vnto suche estate also yt these tormentes ben wtout remedy.
The fourth is agayne ye persones ye whiche other tymes haue consented vnto theyr synnes or the which ha+ue not done theyr deuour for to teche them or cor+recte in regarde of this ye subieccyon agayn theyr prelates ye chyldren agayne fader moder the harlotte agayne the harlotte ben in suche a rage of Ire that none may it thynke or wryte.
THe fourth payne is pryde enuenumyd and they may not it aue~ge it procedeth of. partes.
The fyrste is as vnto ye regarde of lorde+shyp dominacyon infynyte generall of crea+ture for asmoche yt the soule da~mpned it aduersary co~trarious vnto god she hath of asmoche grete dyspleaser of ye honour domynacyo~ of ye creatu+re as suche honour is excellent grete.
The secon de is vnto the regarde of ye Justyce dyuyne after whiche she her seeth aiuged vnto ye eternyte of excessyue paynes yt she feleth endureth for asmo+che yt she hath ben vniuste in vsurpynge glorye ho+nour the vsau~ce of her propre wyll she is made formed co~traryous aduersary of Justyce dyuy+ne by the whiche she abydeth Justely in ye obstyna+cyon of her pryde by consequent of her torme~t wtout ende.
The .iii. is vnto ye regarde of theyr pro+pre wyll of ye whiche they haue made theyr god for yt they haue loued suche god aboue all other thynges.
they hy~ se agayne ye co~trary tormented wtout mesure as vnto ony maner of thyng de+syred they may not come they ben in a se of anguys+she torment.
The .iiii. is vnto ye regarde of ye holynes of vertues of trouth yt she hath loste to the~ is co~traryous alwayes seeth knoweth yt trouth Justyce glorye arysen ben taken fro~ theyr tor+ment from theyr payne by the~ the whiche ben in paradyse by the whiche she enrageth of dolour.
THe fyfth payne of soule is of cruell enuy in regarde of four thy~ges.
The fyrste is of the bonte of god for syns that she is contraryous vnto god as it is sayd she hath in her the contrary of the proprytes and excellences the whiche ben in god.
Now is it certayne that in god is pyte swetenes mercy infynytly by the whiche it foloweth that in the soule dampned there is enuy crudelyte and anguysshe of all the goodnesses the whiche co+me proceden vnto creatures of the bonte. mer+cy of god.
And for as moche that suche goodes innumerables as well in nature a~gelyque as in na+ture humayne as well in heuen as in erth the torment of enuy of those dampned may not be suffycyently ymagyned.
This torme~t is shewed som+what of this present worlde in the torment yt these enuyous people suffren in the prosperyte of theyr neyghbours.
The seconde is vnto the regarde of ye noblesse excellence ye whiche is in nature angelyque.
The thyrde vnto the regarde of other blyssed men women for as it is grete and is shewed the mercy bonte infynyte vnto ye saluacyon of mul+tytude of the blyssed sayntes of as moche is it gre+te and is multyplyed ye enrage of enuy of those ben dampned.
The fourth is vnto ye regarde of ly+tell chyldre~ ye whiche ben deed in orygynall synne The whiche shall be in ye fyre of hell wtout suffry~+ge payne sensyble.
In lyke wyse as sayth these doc+tours of yt company the which shall be ryght gre+te the dampned shall be affrayed for the crudelyte of theyr enuy vnto whome all welth shall be co~tra+ryous as ynough it hath be shewed before.
THe. vi. payne of ye soule is fere immuable in the whiche they were fyrste caste in to hell co~dampned for syns in helle there is no rede~pcyon it behoueth to say yt they shall abyde in perpetuyte in ye degre of ye payne in ye whiche they ben fyrst co~+dampned.
this fere procedeth of foure thynges. the fyrste is vnto the regarde of ye Juge yt they knowe~ to be puyssau~te of iustyce infynyte.
Also they kno+wen yt theyr iniquyte is incompreuable and dampnable and of suche comparyson and knowlege pro+cedeth fere seruyle inestymable and without euer to cease.
The seconde is vnto the regarde of ye com+pany of men and of women dampned for it fauteth not to ymagen that they ben lesse ferefull in helle that they were on this halue but more in as moche that they may more suffre of fere than they haue had on this halue.
Now is it so that yf they had seen or mette one dampned on this halue they had had fere to haue ben madde thynke than who that may vnto what thynge it may be in the other worlde where these dampned an hundreth thousande myllyons The thyrde is vnto regarde of deuylles for in as moche that they haue not fe+ryd vnto them to obeye in this worlde it is ye good Justyce of god that they feren theyr presence theyr lokes and theyr tormentes in helle eternally.
This fere ouer that that it is naturall it is grauyd after the Justyce dyuyne in forme and maner iudycyble The fourth is vnto the regarde of the grete hor+ryble paynes of hell as for an example.
Yf a man shew vnto ony in this present lyfe a water hote or a metall molten and that a man hym certefye that he therin shall be put by Justyce by the espace of a moneth or of a yere he sholde haue moche greate drede greate fere aduyse euery creature after that that he may ymagen the vnderstondynge of soules dampned the whiche be not in nothynge taryed but more soner aboue all nature ayded and chosen to vnderstonde clerely as well the paynes corporal+les as spyrytualles the whiche vnto them ben made redy vnto to that thynke he that may.
THe seuenth payne of the soule dampned is certaynte yt neuer in suche payne there shall be ende terme respyte or releasynge for four thy~+ges The fyrste is for the reason of hym that she hath offended by her synne that is god the whiche is infynyte and eternall: The seconde is by reason of the nature of synne fynall That is to vnderstonde he the whiche at is founde without true repentau~ce.
The thyrde is vnto the regarde of the Justyce dyuyne.
But for as moche as of that eternyte of paynes due vnto euery synne mortall shall be a the ende of thys mater it is not as nowe necessarye other wyse to drawe these foure poyntes or payne
THe eyght payne of the soule dampned is de+faute of all consolacyon the whiche defaute vnto them cometh of foure partes The fyrste is in the regarde of the dyuyne fountayne of Joye and of consolacyon from the whiche the cursyd dampned ben put fer awaye and departed.
By the whiche they ben fallen in to the contrarye partye That is to vnderstonde in to the see and in to the depenesses of heuynesses and of all desolacyon.
/: The seconde is in regarde of nature angelyque the whiche after god is the synguler consolacyon of na+ture humayne specyally vnto the speryte and for as moche that these dampned haue not obeyed vn+to ye good inspyracyons of theyr holy angelles but more soner to ye suggestyo~s of theyr gostly enemy in stede of the kepyng and consolacyon angelyque they haue ye presence and the desolucyon inestymable of deuylles.
The thyrde is in regarde of ye holy co~pany of those that ben blyssed as is Jhesu cryste the vyrgyn Mary and all those other holy sayntes of paradyse the whiche haue not in ony maner co~passyon of those that ben dampned but they enyo+ye in the crudelyte and eternyte of theyr tormentes the whiche thynge dampned seeth and knoweth By the whiche they ben inestymably tormented dyscomforted.
The fourth is vnto the regarde of the company of the dampned for the one shal not haue compassyon of the other.
By the whiche they curse eche other and so shall be depryued from all co~passyon as well of those of paradyse as of them of helle. nor in them selfe they may not in ony wyse haue it but they it hate and curse pryncypally for they ben the cause defayllynge of all of all the tormentes vnto the whiche the ben come.
THe .ix. payne of the soule dampned is desy+re to mowe dye vnto the whiche she may ne+uer come.
Of good ryght they may not fynde the deth in the other worlde the whiche haue refused ye lyfe on this behalue.
By the whiche they desyren foure thynges vnto the whiche they may not come The fyrste is that they wolde they hadde not ben create.
The thyrde that they hadde not ben redemyd The fourth that they sholde not aryse.
For in lyke wyse as these foure thynges ben greate glorye and gladnes vnto the blyssed.
In lyke wyse it is anoysaunce and heuynes vnto those acursyd more than euer man may thynke.
THe tenth payne of the soule dampned is co~fusyble retrybuco~n for four thynges.
The fyrste is for that that the dampned ben certayne yt god the whiche is theyr aduersary seeth theyr confusyble for in lyke wyse as to se god is eternall perfyte retrybucyon vnto the blyssed In lyke wyse to be seen of god in eternall dampna+cyon is inestymable confusyon in all these dampned some what appereth the confusyon of tor+ment in this worlde for a thefe hath shame to be seen knowen in his theft of ony man notable.
but soueraynly he sholde fere to be seen of hym whiche hy~ shall Juge.
The seconde is for as moche yt the tormentes the multytude theyr greuys ben in clere vysyon knowlege of god not aloonly but wt hy~ all the court celestyn in lyke wyse as glorye of the blyssed is gretely trurstyd by ye da~pnacyon of those acursyd.
In lyke wyse da~pnacio~ of those reproued is a grauyte inestymable by cause of knowlege of those ben saued. of maner of this syght no theologie~ ne ought to doubte for they of paradyse see in god all ye thynges ye whiche ben to augmentaco~n of theyr glorye as be~ torme~tes of hell in lyke wyse as it hath ben sayd before.
and shall be more playnly in chapytre of eternyte of pay~es internalles.
Also yf ony make meruay+le how it may be a chylde sauyd shall haue as gre te Joye and as perfyte gladnes of the dampnaco~n of his fader and of his moder or of the one of the~ or the fader the moder sauyd of the dampnaco~n of theyr chylde other frendes.
The wyll of the sauyd is in suche wyse vnyed with the wyll dyuyne that all yt that god wyll is the Joye the wyll ryght parfyte of all the sauyd for yt that god wolde or sholde wyll after the puyssaunce Justyce vnto that dampnacyon for as moche is it the wyll and glorye of all those yt ben chosen.
The thyrde is of the lokes of one vpon another for euery of theym shall see the synne the the one of the other for yt that soule resonable notwtstondynge that she be dampned leseth not her propryte yt she had shame of her sy~ne of her confusyon she shal be in souerayne angre in herselfe vnto the syght of all the worlde as well of the sauyd as of ye damp+ned.
The fourth is for asmoche as she seeth clerely the multytude of her synnes the grefe and the vnkyndenes that she hath commytted agayne ye creatour and so as the sauyd haue in themselfe a Joye a gladnes of the good dedys yt they haue done in this worlde¬∑ In lyke wyse the dampned seynge all theyr synnes shall haue for euery synne partyculer shame and abhomynacyon incompreuable co~fu+syon.
Now beholde who may what it shall be of all togyders by these thynges before sayd it appereth that there are .xl. paynes partyculers of par+tye of the body in lyke wyse as many of soule And so there ben foure score paynes partyculers in euery dampned in body in soule for as it is sayd all the fyue wyttes of nature.
That is the syght herynge the smellynge the taste the touchynge Also the bones the mary the synewes the vaynes the flesshe the blode the humours qualytes corporalles shall be replenysshed with souerayne in dycybles dolours anguysshes.
Also all puyssaunces of the soule as the mynde vnderstondy~+ge and the wyll shall be in Ire and in rancure in pyrde in rebellyon in obstynacyon in profoun+dyte of souerayne eternall desolacyon of confu+syons and so inno~brables that yf all see were yn ke for to wryte and the skye and all the foure alementes parchement drawen in length all ton+ges of the blessyd sesse not in an hondreth yeres to name to nombre the partyculer paynes vnto the whiche is adiuged condampned euery dampned a man myght not speke nor wryte in an hundreth thousande yere the paynes of one dampned aloon+ly for yf for euery yere that he shall be in helle he myght wepe one oonly tere whan he hadde so mo+che wepte that it amounteth all the see yet sholde it not be but a maner to begynne his torment and his wepynge.
Also yf he were a stone a thousande tymes more greater than all the erth and that there came a byrde and from an hondreth thousand yeres vnto an hondreth thousande yeres and none of tener and for euery vyage he taketh and consumeth of the sayd stone also grete aloonly as is the tenth parte of a corne of whete.
In suche wyse that in ten hondreth thousande yeres he had not ta+ken of stone but ye mou~tenau~ce of a grayne of the sayd corne and that god had made promesse to one dampned whan the sayd stone sholde be all eten and no sooner he sholde haue than glorye of paradyse but in the releasynge of his payne the sayd da~pned sholde be now lately dyschargyd of one of the horryble tormentes of hell yt is he sholde haue hope of tyme of ye houre the stone sholde be al eeten that than he sholde haue some releasynge But alas alas a. C. thousa~de tymes alas wha~ shall be And euer more all dampned ben depry+ued put from suche truste from euery other ho+pe or remedye ben certayne yt for euer withoute ende eternally they shall be in payne in the tor+ment that they fele endure this payne is dyspayre no creature it can suffycyently thynke.
hertes pyteous thynke profou~dly where shall become your aege your tymes thynke where is your loue your vnderstondynge thynke yf ye be in the waye of glorye or of torment ymagen that there are an hondreth myllyons in helle yt yf they had fourth parte of the halfe houre to do penau~ce and to recouer mercy in suche wyse that it to do ye haue the dayes the monthes and the yeres they sholde do dylygence and suche penaunce the whiche there they shall neuer fynde whiche thynge they shall neuer recouer.
Alas thynke who that may the we pynges the waylynges the lamentacyons and ye complayntes that they make in sessybly in cursyn+ge the houre that they were euer begoten that euer they were borne of theyr moder that euer they we+re nourysshed and gyuen souke they haue contynually in the mynde and in the vnderstondynge ye grete goodes that they haue loste. the grete ylles in to ye whiche they ben come by the whiche they may saye.
Alas where is become ye tyme in whyche we myght haue ben sauyd full lytell whyle ha+ue endured our laughynges our playes our ple+surs of worlde.
Alas what haue prouffyted vs ho+nours rychesses delytes grete castelles houses dygnytes offyces all is paste more sooner than wynde with abydeth not but ye maledyccyon of god mysery torment cursyd be ye houre yt we hadde not ben famysshed deed more sooner than borne we haue loste meryte of passyon we ha+ue loste paradyse eternall benedyccyon alas god wherfore haste thou vs create cursyd be the creatu+re of creatures the houre also of ye creacyon well ben we acursyd co~fou~ded we haue fere to crye to curse blaspheme ye one may not other comfort but well awaye may eche with other sorowe.
how moche is this horryble thynge cruell to redoubte as to offende god his co~mau~dementes to trespasse but to late it is hym to aduyse repent. su+che remors other without nombre ben in songe of acursyd of ye estate of whome of theyr paynes none ne may speke nor wryte playnly in co~pa+ryson of that they suffre but yt notwithstondy~ge who well taketh hede weyeth in his herte the whiche is sayd and reherced in this treatyse he shall conceyue fere yf euer by meane of wrytynge or by other waye erthely he yt sholde conceyue and vnto that purpose is founde by scrypture that a yo geler a man excessyuely worldely and of all vanyte playnly named Fulques one tyme amonge other was layde in a fayre bedde softe pleasau~te but he myght not slepe as he desyred hym it ennoyed that the lyght of the daye came not vnto hym no sooner not for to here masse or ellys for to praye vnto god but for to excercyse his folyes and his va+nytes worldly.
And he beynge in suche ennoysau~ce thought in hymselfe profou~dly what ennoye and doloure he myght haue yf he were conda~pned hym to holde and abyde in the bedde where he laye tyll vnto espace of two or of thre yeres wtout seynge other lyght or persone conceyued in hymselfe yt for no so~me of golde or of syluer he wolde suffre to be comdampned vnto suche ennoye suche torment.
And afterwarde thought yet more profound+ly what it myght be of those the whiche haue not done suffycyently penaunce on this behalue by the whiche they ben Justely adiuged to be an hondreth yeres and some other more other lesse in tormen+tes and in the sharpe fyre of purgatorye the whiche is so harde and so anguysshous a thynge to bere endure yt none ne may it thynke and moche he meruaylled of the payne and of ennoye that they myght haue in awaytynge the daye of gladnes that they sholde be crowned in the royalme of paradyse delyuered from all the paynes for euer without ende.
But so as god wolde he thought mo+re profoundly what it myght be of those the whiche ben in helle dampned in eternyte of tormentes who awayte not nor truste not for euer to haue socours ne lyghtynge in ony space of dayes or of myl+lyons of yeres and by this consyderacyon and thy~ kynge he conceyued suche fere and so grete admyracyon that for his folysshe and cursyd lyfe he my+ght not one tyme come vnto suche confusyon where incontynent he dysposed hy~ to leue his lyfe worl+dely ryght peryllous in co~syderynge with grete payne and well late thynken these worldly peo+ple of thynges whiche vnto them ben fynally for to come after in full fewe dayes lefte worlde entred in to relegyon of cystoriencis in which he prouffyted so gretely in thynkynge on paynes of helle. the Joyes of paradyse other holy medytacyons for his grete holynes medytacyon and perfecco~n of good lyfe he was chosen ryght holely bysshop of tholouse in whiche offyce dygnyte he ended vnto glorye of god his dayes.
By this example appereth clerely the grete prouffyte whi+che came of holy medytacyon to thynke on the paynes of helle vnto the eternyte of theyr harde+nes.
And therfore to ende those whiche wyll studye in this present booke hauynge mater more habou~dantly offere to esmeruayll eternyte of the sayd paynes of helle.
Here foloweth a chapytre in whiche ben contayned many causes reasons sheweth wherfore god punyssheth synne eternally. without euer there to haue an ende.
Here foloweth the chapytre of causes reaso~s wherfore ye paynes of helle sholde be eternall.
NOtwithstondynge that some thynge hath ben touched of the eternyte of paynes tor+mentes of them reproued yet for the more greater admyracyon and also for to mete with folysshe se~+tences oppynyons yt the deuyll soweth amonge the hertes of many worldly people blynded dow+ed in theyr synnes.
Here folowen many causes and reasons by the whiche it is euydently shewed the sayd paynes ought to be eternalles wtout euer there to haue releasynge pryncypally for thre reasons generalles.
The fyrste is vnto ye regarde of condycyon of mortall synne.
The seconde vnto the regarde of the creatour the whiche is gloryous eter+nall.
AS vnto the fyrste yt is of the consyderaco~n of synne it is to vnderstonde yt for four reasons Justyce dyuyne requyreth synne be punysshed in eternyte.
The fyrste is for yt that after all Jugement of reason ye offence of sy~ne ought to be punysshed after the dygnyte grete lytell or meane of hym the whiche is offended for none ne may ymagen yt it were no grete offence to stryke vniustely a bysshop tha~ a symple chapelayne or souerayn bysshop yt is pope tha~ another man of the chirche in lesse dygnyte.
Now is it soo that by euery synne mortall god is offended soueraynly as moche greuously as his maieste is dygne infy+nyte.
By the whiche it foloweth that Justyce requy+reth payne who answereth by the consequent in+fynyte for euery mortall synne.
The seconde reason is for as moche that by mortall synne euery (creature is depryued from welth eternall the whiche is god and by suche wy+se he hym submytteth vnto his oposyte is damp nacyon eternall.
The thyrde reason is for asmoche mortall synne depryueth creature from welth paste present to come.
The welth paste yt is the passyon of blyssed Jhesu cryste without ye whiche it were vnpossyble vnto all ye worlde to mowe eua+de the bondes of deuyll and euer more by mortall synne a man hym depryueth from suche bene+fyce.
The good present yt is the meryte of holy chir+che from the whiche the synner beynge as a synner is depryued seueryd.
The goodes to come yt ben the goodes of glorye whiche by good Justyce sholde not be gyuen in ony wyse vnto those the whiche ben enemyes aduersaryes vnto the creatoure as ben all those whiche fynally abyden in mortall synne.
The fourth reason is for asmoche that mortall synne of his propre condycyon destro+yeth all the good dedes of the creature whiche he co~mytted for euery thynge destroyeth his contrary in as moche as is in hym as it appereth of fyre of water of lyght and of derkenes and so of other thynges contraryes.
Now is it ynough certayne yt there is nothynge contraryous vnto the wyll dyuyne but oonly synne and by the consequent synne destroyeth and putteth vnto nought as moche as is in hym the wyll dyuyne and so putteth all blyssed Trynyte vnto nothynge and in suche wyse he destroyeth all the worlde as well the holy men women of paradyse as also all these other creatures for it is Impossyble that creature may be to haue enduryd but in that that god hym hol+deth and conserueth and yf god be dystroyed by sy~+ne the whiche aloonly vnto hym is contrary euery creature is deed and destroyed in the deth of the creatour.
But it is a thynge impossyble ye god may not be or to dye by the whiche it foloweth beho+ueth yt synne be punysshed after ye puyssau~ce sapy+ence eternyte of his contrary yt is god yf it we+re not done there sholde be defaute of Justyce. and yf Justyce dyuyne and infynyte defayle god shold defayle Also the synner the whiche dyeth in mortall synne synneth in eternyte for yf he alwayes hadde lyued alwayes he hadde synned.
And in as moche as that he endureth in synne he oughte to endure punycyon.
Also yf the sy~ne the whiche euer endureth were not for euer punysshed the Justyce penytyue sholde be to moche vnlawfully dyuynys+shed and all trouth dyuyne defraudyd ye anoyntyd the whiche ben thynges to moche impossybles.
Also as moche grete is the transgressyon as gre+te oblygacyon.
Now is it trouth that euery creature is bounde to serue and honoure his creatour the whiche thynge he may not do the whiche is in dedely synne but more sooner doth the contrary that is to knowe to blaspheme and to dyshonoure god.
By the whiche he is the transgressour of the lawe dyuyne and of nature the whiche ben lawes eternal les.
By the whiche it foloweth that suche transgressyon ought to be punysshed eternally.
AS vnto the seconde poynt the whiche is in the comparyson of the synne and of the creature agayne whome it is done it is to vnderstonde that for foure reasons he ought to be punys+shed eternally.
The fyrste is for the grace that god hath done vnto the creature humayne For of as moche as the grace or the benefyce done vnto ony is grete of as moche is greter the offence or the for fayte of hym the whiche is redeuable or shall yelde accompte before hym whome he ought to serue honoure As for an example.
The kynge gyueth a thousande pounde of rente vnto one knyght and vnto another an hundreth thousands pounde both tweyne offende and commytte treason agayne the kynge.
Than it shall be Jugyd that the treason of hym the whiche hadde an hundreth thousande pounde is more greuous thanne is that of hym ye whiche hadde not but aloonly a thousande pounde and therfore for as moche that an hundreth thousande pounde is more greater thynge thenne a thousande pounde aloonly.
And vnto the purpose god vnto vs hath gyuen the body and the sou+le the whiche ben also as the two knyghtes vnto the body he hath gyuen syght tastynge smellynge and herynge and so of other gyftes corporalles but vnto the soule he hath gyuen vnderstondynge mynde and in creatynge her vnto his ymage and vnto his semblaunce in gyuynge vnto her hym the whiche is the good and tresour infynyte and not (withstondynge that she it forfayteth co~mytteth treason as many tymes and as often as whan she her consenteth vnto dedely synne for she withdraweth ye honoure the obe+dyence and the glory that she oweth vnto her creatoure by ye whiche it behoueth to saye as is moch grete the offence as was grete the benefyce and for as moche that he was infynyte also is the transgressyon and punycyon infynyte by so ryght Justy+ce that ony creature nedeth to doubte.
The seconde reason is by cause of the iniury done vnto god in that that the soule her consenteth vnto the gylte of mortall synne choseth and loueth better ony good create than she doeth her creatour.
Now is it so bytwene the good creatyd what soo euer that it be the good increatyd ye whiche is god vnto ye dysta~+ce infynyte of as moche yt the good that a man choseth more sooner than a man doeth god is lytel the iniury is more grete as vnto the consyderacy on by the whiche it appereth yt lecherous men and women the whiche maketh of belly and of theyr pleasure of theyr sensualyte theyr god and the couetyse men and women of theyr golde of theyr syluer proude men and women of wynde of abusyon and of vayne glorye doeth horryble in iury vnto god infynyte and may not abyde vnpunysshed after as it vnto hym appertayneth that is to knowe infynytly or elles he sholde not be the god of Justyce infynyte ye whiche is a thynge Impossyble.
The thyrde reason is by cause of the maie+ste dyuyne whiche hath be ynough shewed before That is to vnderstonde of asmoche that he ye whi+che is offended is of more grete noblesse dygnyte sapyence Jurysdyccyon and auctoryte and of as moche that a man is more holden and bounde of as moche is the offence agayne hym more greate And for as moche yt god is of maieste infynyte and yt the creature vnto hym is bou~de infynytly That is to saye asmoche as she hath beynge substaunce and other goodes ben they of nature of grace or of fortune it foloweth clerely yt the offence of mor+tall synne ought to be infynytly punysshed.
The fourth reason is by cause of the Justyce dyuyne the whiche thynge he may also shewe yf it appertay+ne vnto ye Justyce mercy dyuyne to rewarde the blessyd in eternyte of glorye for ye obedye~ce honour reuerence yt they haue done vnto theyr creatour in this worlde by yt same selfe Justyce it behoueth yt he punysshe eternally ye inobedyence dyshonour irreuerence yt these cursyd dampned haue done to god theyr creatour in this present lyfe.
AS vnto thyrde poynt pryncypall fynal the whiche is yt sy~ne ought to be punysshed in eternyte after comparyson it hath vnto the vnyuersall worlde it is to vnderstonde ye euery per sone of his propre nature condycyon desyreth to come vnto welth eternall. therfore ye soule ye whi+che her consenteth vnto mortall synne choseth some good create as ben honours in proude people rychesses in couetyse people delytes pleasurs carnalles vnto lecherous people he constytuteth hys ende and blyssednes in ye thynge yt he desyreth soueraynly all these thynges the whiche hym may serue be it god the sayntes the angelles or other thynge for to come vnto suche ende he them desyreth not but by the ende felycyte before sayd and of suche people is there without nombre yt wolde ha+ue in this worlde yt that they desyre neuer to see god or other blessydnes to haue.
And for as moche yt in suche loue suche desyre they ben fou~de at the houre of deth it is not agayne the inclynacyon na+turall of the soule.
That is to vnderstonde that she abydeth in her eternyte vnder the punycyon of the deceuable beatytude yt she hath chosen aboue god agayne god and this is for the fyrste reason of ye thyrde poynt ye whiche sheweth wherfore the puny cyon of the dampned ought to be eternall.
The se+conde reason hath ben lately touched before for perfeccyon of the worlde vnyuersall requyreth that he there hath felycyte eternall and this here is ordened by Justyce vnto them the whiche haue resys+ted and foughten in this present lyfe agayne theyr sensualyte and propre wyll agayne the worlde and the deuyll and haue perseueryd tyll vnto the ende.
And by that same selfe Justyce behoueth it that pu+nycyon eternall be prepayred reseruyd vnto them the whiche haue not wylled to fyght but haue obe+yed vnto theyr aduersaryes and soo whan euery creature shall haue Juste retrybucyon after his nie+rytes or demerytes all the worlde shall be in her perfeccyon In the whiche he shall haue no more as to adde to mynysshe or to varye for it appertayneth vnto the puyssaunce sapyence and Justy+ce dyuyne to conserue all thynges in theyr fynalle perfeccyons.
The thyrde reason for the grete vtyly te the whiche cometh of the eternyte and mysery of the dampned vnto the perfeccyon of the vnyuersall worlde for fyrste god is feryd soueraynly.
Also his commaundementes ben kepte the more humbly the more dylygently and in so doynge a man pur+chaseth fynally ferefylyale or chyldly meryte and saluacyon.
And therfore to saye that the paynes of the dampned ben and ought to be eternall it is no pyte but souerayne iniquyte and manyfeste subuer+cyon of the trouth of god conteyned and shewed in holy scryptures all the destruccyon of oure holy fayth catholyque.
The fourth reason of the eterny+te of ye paynes of the dampned yt is for ye glorye of the creatour ye whiche is ye souerayne ende wherfore all thynges ben create made formed ordeyned The whiche glorye shyneth is shewed vnto all the worlde grete noble infynyte in as moche yt multytude of ye da~pned theyr paynes dolours tormentes ben grete innumerable eternall. for in lyke wyse as the mercy infynyte of ye creatour is shewed in ye grete beatytude or blessydnes of paradyse so is manyfested ye Justyce by the eternyte of ye tormentes of dampmed and of suche manyfestacyon of mercy and of Justyce cometh and ac+cordeth a melodye of glorye wherof sayth holy scryp+ture that a man ought to synge before god the ver+sycle or the songe of mercy and of Justyce. by the whiche we may vnderstonde also it see in practyse yt melodye of musyque may not be perfyte yf the+re be not parfeccyon of tenoure and yf the tenoure were not eternall the melodye sholde not be eternal (In lyke wyse the melodye of the glorye of the blessyd shall not haue tenour yf the paynes of the dampned were not eter+nalle vnderstonde by the tenour of the gloryous melodye of paradyse the crye and the braye and horryble thondre of helle.
By ye counter tenoure ye ioye the gladnes of the blessed men women of paradyse.
By the florysshynge of that melodyous musyque vnderstonde the Joye and exaltacyon and the gladnes angelyque the whiche incompreua+ble and inenarrable for she is not aloonly in ioye corporall but with that in the of the soule.
In lyke wyse as it shall be drawen in the treatyse of the Joyes of paradyse vnto the whiche vs wyll brynge and lede the swete Jesus vnto whome be al honoure and glorye with the fader and the holy goost.
AMEN Here after foloweth the treatyse of the Joyes of paradyse and fyrste the prologue for the fyfth chapytre.
[Figure: AFter the treatyse of the paynes of helle here foloweth of the Joyes of paradyse by the consyderacyon of whome mouynge the lyght of the holy fayth catholyque the wyll the desyre and the loue of herte humayne is drawe vpwarde for in lyke wyse as by the consyderacyon of ye horryble paynes before wryten a man cometh vnto fere gre+te lytell or meane after as vnderstondynge and co~syderacyon of those paynes is grete or lytell. euen so in lyke wyse cometh a man for to loue and to de+syre the Joyes of paradyse after that they ben con+sydered moche or lytell of herte humayne wherof for to excercyse the loue and the desyre of herte mayne for to purchase the glorye of paradyse some thynge put that it be lytell is here after wryten fyrste in generall secondly more in especyall.
As vnto the fyrste it is to vnderstonde that after as sa+ynt Austen sayth a mortall man may not speke or ymagen the multytude the gretenes and ye nobles of the Ioyes of paradyse for they ben moche grea+ter than tonge ne can tell or herte ne may thynke There is founde souerayne pease without warre reste without labour Ioye without sorow infynyte rychesses faythfulnes yongth and gladnes fountayne of all goodes that vnderstondynge may thyn+ke or that herte may desyre for the blessyd see god face to face and all other thynges in god and god in them selfe.
Also they see the humanyte of Ihesu cryste they see the vyrgyn Mary and all her ho+ly company of the blessyd vyrgyns of the whiche vysyon sayth saynt Austen and also saynt Grego+rye that who so it sholde not haue but by the espace of one Iourney aloonly a man sholde for to purcha+se suche good desprayse all ye rychesses honours pleasurs and delytes that a ma~ myght haue in an hondreth myllyons of yeres in this present worlde and with that to suffre all the martyrdomes anguysses the whiche may be spoken or thought.
That is to knowe for to come vnto gode for to mowe see in so lytell espace of tyme the blessydnes the whiche is promysed vnto all the frendes of god to possede eternally.
blessyd very god eter+nall that these poore blynde worldly people may not suche meruaylles here rede or vnderstonde so+me what for than may they co~prehende certaynly that all welth erthely and worldly is not¬∑ but pure and lettynge pouerte helth is but syknes wysdome but folye gladnes ennoye and heuynes youth decrepyte and aege lyfe temporall a languor mortall and so of other thynges blynde and transytoryes in co~paryson of the goodes of eternall glorye As vnto the seconde poynt all shall be recyted ten pryncypall Ioyes of the partyes of ye soule.
And in lyke wyse ten of the body contraryes opposytes vnto the paynes and tormentes of the dampned. And euery of them shall be dyuysed in foure by the consyderacyon of the whiche Ioyes the espyryte hu+mayne shall not be aloonly a slepe but ryally dede and insensyble the whiche hym shall not moue by a feruent desyre for to come vnto welth incomparable.
The whiche thynge is the pryncypall ende and intencyon of all the processe of this present booke.
Here foloweth the ten pryncypall Ioyes of the partye of the soule.
THe fyrste Ioye of paradyse of the partye of the soule is the clere vysyon of god and of all other thynges the whiche appertayne vnto the glorye of ye sauyd.
Wherfore it is to be noted that ye blessyd shall haue thre maner of knowleges.
The fyrste is named the knowlege in the clerenes of the myddaye the whiche is none other thynge to vnderstonde but to see ryght parfytly the essence dyuyne.
The seconde is named the knowlege in the clerenes of the mornynge that isto knowe all the creatures spyrytualles or corporalles in ye myrrour of the blessyd trynyte that is to vnderstonde in the blessyd sone of god vnto whome is graunted sapy+ence eternall.
The thyrde is named the knowlege in the clerenes of the euentyde that is to knowe the creatures in theyr propre essences and natures.
By the whiche appereth that this Ioye of the clere vy+syon shall procede of foure partes.
The fyrste shal be to se the dyuynyte the whiche neuer creature seeth in this mortall lyfe but in the lyght of the fayth than he hym shall shewe ryght clerely and after as wytnesseth holy scrypture the soule shall be in suche wyse transumed in god that in her the which is vnto the ymage of the blessyd trynyte shall appere vnto all the worlde the souerayne puyssaunce sapyence and bou~te the whiche ben in god shall be than semblau~te vnto god by grace dyuyne. who shall be more shynynge than is the so~ne for her cle+renes: Of this vysyon or knowlege the whiche is in compreuable as for this present lyfe cometh and procedeth a loue the whiche is as moche grete as is that knowlege and of the loue knowlege cometh and procedeth Ioye as moche grete as ben knowle+ge loue they ben inestymables.
Also is the ioye whiche of it procedeth than whan the soule her shall see the doughter and the espouse of the kynge eternall enherytour and in ye ryall possessyon of the royalme of paradyse for euer eternally.
Who may it thynke what Ioye she may haue for in suche co~+templacyon ye derkenes of my lytyll vnderstondyn+ge defauteth.
The seconde shall be vnto the blessyd co~pany of paradyse as well angelyque as humayn of the gretenes multytude of merytes of all the sayntes the whiche thynge may be som what vnder stonde yf a man vnderstonde the perfeccyon of the charyte whiche is in paradyse.
That is to vnderstonde euery of them loueth his neyghboure as hymselfe to loue some thynge proprely that is to wyll hym good and hy~ to reioyse of his honour of his Ioye of his blessydnes of his rychesse and of his wysdome of his promesse and soo of other gyftes and perfeccyons as well of the partye of the body as of the partye of the soule.
Wherfore it behoueth to conclude yt euery of them that ben blessyd hath partyculer Ioye of all the sauyd of whome some may not be more blessyd other lesse other egally. and for to haue mater of meruaylous contemplacyon and ymagynacyon and in lyke wyse is it royally where that one sauyd seeth knoweth an hundreth thousande the whiche ben egall vnto hym in glorye it behoueth to saye yf he loue theyr welth as his owne that he hath an hundreth thousande tymes more grete Joye of theyr glorye than he hath of his owne propre and synguler ymagen we secondly that he seeth knoweth hondreth myl+lyons of whome euery of them hath more of glory by the halfe than he hath it behoueth to saye ye an hondreth myllyons of tymes in double he hath mo+re grete Joye of suche multytude of the sauyd than he hath of his synguler Joye. yf mortall man we+re neuer on this halue suffycyent for to no~bre or for to wryte ye glorye partyculer of ye leste sauyd what may it be what may a man saye of this present co~+paryson vnto suche multytude of the sauyd.
Also sayth practyseth saynt Barnardyn yt euery of ye sayntes of paradyse hath more grete ioye of glorye whiche is in ye blessed vyrgyn than of his owne propre of yt that he may haue of all the courte celestyall aboue of her of asmoche as her me rytes her graces exceden gyftes the graces of all those ben chosen In whiche dyfferrence of meryte a man may ryally ymagen as moche grete excesse as he may haue in circo~fere~ce of ye skye in comparyson of centre of the erth for she is the na+turall moder of god ye whiche pryuylege excedeth al the excellences a man may speke or thynke. also the wye that euery of ye sauyd the ryght holy huma+nyte of Jhesu cryste is of asmoche the more greate as yt that he hath of hymselfe of ye vyrgyn Mary and all the company of paradyse as ye gyftes and graces of Jhesu cryste exceden gyftes merytes of all ye sauyd the whiche excesse is infynyte for as moche yt suche a man that is to knowe Jhesu cryst is god egall vnto the fader and vnto the blessyd ho+ly goost in all maieste dyuyne and all these compa+rysons before sayd of ye multyplycacyon of euery of the sauyd they ought to be vnderstonde as vnto the nombre multytude of ye glorye and not asmo+che or more parfytly to loue.
That is to saye yt eue+ry sauyd loueth more parfytly his propre partyculer glorye than he ne doeth yt of all the sauyd so he it ought to do by good charyte ye whiche begy~+neth vnto hymselfe but for asmoche yt charyte ma+keth all thynges to be comon be it good or yll eue+ry of the hath accydentall Joye as well of ye multytude of the sauyd as of theyr merytes and of euery of them inpartyculer more or lesse after ye degrees of the glorye yt he seeth and knoweth and louech in of his neyghbours.
Who may thynke and nombre this glorye or it fayne to comprayse to esmeruayll.
The thyrde maner of knowlege is that they shall see and knowe clerely all the syn+nes greate and horryble that they haue commytted.
And also they shall see the cautelles the subty+lytees and temptacyons deceuables that they haue escaped were they of the worlde or theyr propre sensualyte or of the deuyll and of as moche that they ben escaped the more vyctoryously and from the more stronger bataylle and from more greater perylles of as moche knowen they the more ayde and the mercy of god with oute the whiche they hadde hadde full lytell power for to resyste or them to releue after the byenge of the deth for the gylte culpe of synne and as moche as they knowe to haue hadde the more greate grace ayde of god of as moche loue they hym the more of as moche that they loue hy~ the more of as moche haue they the more grete Joye for as it hath be sayd before after the loue grete or lytell is mesured the Joye ye whiche in it procedeth and so it appertayneth not aloonly the merytes of the saued ben vnto ye augmentacyon of glorye but with that ye synnes that they other tymes commytted of whome they haue glorye not to haue done them or of the condycyon of synne but accydently for as moche as they haue done penaunce that they ben releuyd.
The .iiii. maner of knowlege shall be yt they shall se know the dampned the erroure the multytude of theyr paynes tormentes wherfore vnto theym shall be declared manyfested Justyce of sapyence dy+uyne of asmoche yt they know me grete and infynyte Justyce of as moche they hym approue hym loue of asmoche they loue hym the more of asmoche they the~ enioye for as moche that dampned the multytude gretenes of theyr synnes ben innumerable of asmoche haue they more grete Joye.
In ye whiche appereth yt neuer ye da~p+ned ne co~mytte synne wherof he ne receyueth augmentacyon of the glorye of euery of the sauyd.
Also it appereth that in lyke wyle as the augmentaci+on of the glorye that they seen in sauyd and that they receyuen the one of the other is incompreuable as it is sayd before.
In lyke wyse is incompreuable the augmentacyon of the glorye the whiche cometh in the sauyd by the occasyon of the dampned and them seluen for as moche that there aren mo of ye dampned than of the sauyd.
Also many the whiche haue ben other tymes grete synners as saynt poul saynt Mathewe and mary Mawdelayn shall see the grete and horryble tormentes yt they haue Justly deseruyd.
The whiche they haue escaped by ye bonte mercy of god wherfore they ben the more embrased sharpe in the loue of god by the con+sequent it foloweth yt they haue the more grete delectacyon Joye of asmoche as the loue is ye more grete in lyke wyse as it is sayd.
By these thynges before sayd well notyd appereth clerely that all thy~+ges ben reduced fynally vnto the glorye of god for who so refuseth or hym yeldeth indygne of the gra+ce mercy of god falleth is reducyd vnder the Justyce of asmoche is the thynge dygne for to meruayll for to prayse god in his Justyce infyny+te as in his mercy who may it thynke suche infynyte suche depnes of glorye.
THe seconde Joye of the partye of the soule is parfyte to loue ye whiche procedeth of. thynges.
The fyrste is god wherfore it is to be notyd that reason experyens vnto vs shewen that of as moche that some thynge is of more grete valoure of as moche is it worthy to be the better belo+ued and of as moche that it is the better belouyd desyred it is the more greate Joye for to haue the possessyon and the fruycyon.
Now is it soo that in god is all bonte sapyence honoure and noblesse swetnes Joye and gladnes and so of other perfeccyons infynytes the whiche may be desyred and loued.
By the whiche it behoueth to saye that all those whiche of suche so grete goodes haue sure possessyon eternall they haue moche more greater Joye of hym than of ony other thynge of as mo+che that god is more greate good than is all other good create.
And syns he is all good and welth in fynyte it appereth clerely that he ought to be by loued infynytly aboue all other goodes the whiche may be spoken or thought.
Now is it shewed that of loue cometh Joye and gladnes as grete as the lo+ue may be.
By the whiche it foloweth that the Jo+ye that these blessyd haue for the loue that they ha+ue vnto god in god and of god is infynytly in infynyte aboue all other Joyes that they may haue. of ony other good create by suche maner that suche Joyous pleasurs and gladnesses that euer weren in persone or creature or myghtebe ben lesse thyn+ge vnto the regarde of theym the whiche proceden of the lyuely fountayne of the blessyd Trynyte theme is a drope of water vnto the regarde of all the sees.
The seconde thynge the whiche we sholde loue after god that is oure seluen after the or+denaunce of god and also of nature and of trewe charyte.
And therfore for as moche that the sauyd seen that they haue purchased welth infynytly and euerlastynge withoutende and that they haue done the thynge by the whiche they ben comen vnto the grace of god and vnto the glorye of paradyse they hym louen and the goodes that they haue purchased as moche as they ben and that they haue purchased greate welth.
For as moche as they haue purchased welth infynyte and euerlastynge as moche is grete theyr loue in them seluen and of theym seluen.
And by the consequent as moche is greate theyr Joye and nombre thyn+ke it who that may.
The thyrde thynge the whi+che we sholde loue that is that we sholde loue our neyghbours and the maner of the loue after god and holy scrypture is as our leluen and of this Jo+ye it hath bentouched here before in the seconde ar+tycle of the fyrste Joye.
put that it is another chynge to se and to vnderstonde the welth of hys neyghbour and another thynge hym to loue for the one procedeth of the vnderstondynge and the other of the wyll but for the comon rule it suffyseth as nowe that euery sauyd enioyeth hym of the welth and merytes of his neyghbours of as moche the more that they ben in the more grete no~bre and in the more hygh degre of merytes.
By ye whiche it for to saye that in lyke wyse as the vnderstondynge is full of the knowlege of the grete felycyte and also the beatytude of his neygh+bours.
And in lyke wyse is the wyll full of loue of the whiche procedeth a Joye and a gladnes as moche greate as may be the knowlege and the loue.
And for as moche that of god aloonly is knowen the nombre of the chosen and the degree of all theyr Joyes and merytes.
And also is glorye of cuery of them yt he hath vnto the regarde of ye loue of his neyghbour.
The fourth thynge that we sholde loue our owne bodyes the whiche shall be than clere and shynynge more than the sonne of some moche of other lytell after theyr degre of ye glorye and of the merytes of the soule as it shall be sayd here after and syns it is so these worldly people haue pleasur gladnes to see them clothed and enornyd with precyous clothes as golde sylke of dyuers of many furres of wylde bestes the whiche abyllymentes may not longe endure wt out gadrynge of wormes and that they ne chau~ge colour what may be the Joye of the blessyd the shynynge of the rube of inmortalyte whiche vnto them shall be gyuen presentyd by the blessyd The su cryste the kynge of glorye for lyueray.
The whi+che they haue deseruyd in this present worlde for that yt they haue subduyd theyr sensualyte for to do penaunce who so may it compas.
THe thyrde Joye of the partye of the soule is to be sure and certayne that the glorye the blessydnes in the whiche a man hym seeth and knoweth shall neuer defayle and in lyke wyse as the fyrste Joye precedent succedeth vnto the meryte of the fayth that a man hath holden and kepte and the seconde vnto the meryte of charyte sembla bly this thyrde Joye of certaynte is vnto the regar+de of the vertue of the true hope that a man hath hadde in the bonte of god to mowe come vnto suche glorye.
By the whiche a man hym dysposeth (by holy werkes.
This Joye of certaynte is the cause of foure partes.
The fyrste is for ye pro+messe that god hath made vnto the blessyd to haue and possede eternally the Joyes and the royalme of paradyse.
The whiche promesse is wryten in ma+ny places of the holy scrypture the whiche may ne+uer lye and by the whiche we may knowe some what the grete and mestymable dyfferrence of the poore and deceuable glorye worldly and of that the whiche is the very glorye eternall.
For fyrste the glorye the whiche is worldly is in thynges outwar+de and not alwayes in the soule for many the whi+che haue and the royalmes of the erth suffren moche of ylles and of thought of anguysshes in theyr conscyences and oftentymes they ben moche myserables and in pryson and bondes of enemye of helle by the grete and horryble mortall synnes but those the whiche haue the glorye of paradyse ben and shall be in all euer gloryous in body and in soule.
Also the glorye of the worlde is inperfyte for he that moost hath the more he defauteth but that of paradyse is ryght parfyte with+out ony indygence.
Ptholomee Naby Ader and Charlemayne those other grete lnd kynges erthely whiche haue benlde greate gloryous and puyssauntees and in rychesses theyr glorye anone be passed.
But so is it not of the glof the blessyd for there is not so lytell a saynt in paradyse but that he hath more honour of prayse of glorye and of rychesses than there shall mou~te in one man oonly all the glorye that euer was and shall be tyll vnto the ende of the worl+de in all lyuers vpon erth.
how moche ought he to haue grete desyre and grete hope the whiche infynytly is certayne for to come vnto so grete gode.
The seconde cause of this certaynte is for as moche as god and nature haue ordeyned that euery thynge the whiche is comen vnto his ende cesse his mouynge in receyuynge the perfeccyon the whiche appertayneth vnto the degre of his nature and of his condycyon.
Now is it soo that the esperyte humayne create so nobly by puyssaunce dyuyne than is in the ende and consu~macyon whan it is vnyed with god as well by grace as by glorye for in that he hath the accomplysshment of all his desyres possessyon of goodes infynyte.
By the whiche he may neuer other thynge appetyte but abyde alwayes in suche stedfastnes of the beatytude euerlastynge.
The thyrde cause of certaynte is for by cause of the estate of inmortalyte For syns that spyryte create hath taken his body vnto the whiche he hath naturall inclynacyon and that he hathe deseruyd in this brefe and mortall lyfe for to come vnto the begynnynge of euery creature the whiche is god it is Impossyble after the lawes that haue ben instytute by the sapyence dyuyne vn+to his creatures but that he abyde in the stedfastnes of the eternall vysyon of the blessyd trynyte.
The fourth cause of this sure sted fastnes yf for the valu of the good vnto the whiche these blessyd ben come that is god the whiche is the good infynyte. And more ouer the whiche is not Impossyble that a man may other thynge loue but in hym and for hym.
By the whiche as well the mynde as the vnderstondynge and wyll ben parfytly deyfyed and so there is parfyte certaynte of the beatytude eternall without ony admyxicyon to put in of varyablyte wherfore euery creature sholde take payne for to come vnto suche blessydnes eternall.
THe Ioye of the partye of the soule is a meruaylous and a grete exaltacyon gladnes inuenerable the whiche causeth four thynges in the soule yblessyd.
The fyrste is that by su+che Ioye all thynges vnto hym ben put in Ioye. /: The seconde is that she fulfylleth and maketh dronke the wyll for it is a thynge Impossyble but that the wyll of the blessyd be not all holly replenysshed with gladnes.
The thyrde is that notwith+stondynge her excesse and abondaunce she shal not be in ennoye ne in anguysshe but euer more softe swete and pleasaunte.
The fourth is that she par+fyteth all the desyre as well of the vnderstondynge as of the wyll the whiche naturally desyren gladnesse and comynge.
The whiche thynges may not be parfytly founde in this present worlde tran+sytorye in lyke wyse as it appereth ynough by experyence for all the gladnes worldly endeth and taketh his terme in anguysshe and in sorowe and a lyke thynge is it of comynge worldly and erthly the whiche better ought to be called folye than comynge.
THe fyfth Ioye of the partye of the soule is abondaunce of all goodes the whiche ben yelden them in the soule in foure partes.
The fyrste is of god the whiche is fountayne and depnesse of all goodes the whiche may neuer be spoken nor wryten nor herte humayne ne may it thynke and therfore he the whiche hath suche perfeccyon of goodes he hath all without that that it vnto hym may ony thynge defayle And he that hadde an hondreth thousande worldes and be pryue of this In the whiche is suche parfeccyon of godes he myght well saye that he hadde nothynge.
The seconde is of hymselfe for the soule yblessyd her possedeth in god in her souerayne perfeccyon of all his puyssaunces and of his vertues and merytes.
And therfore it is well sayd that who so putteth his herte aboue all in god he hath his herte so hath god and he that it putteth in another place he leseth his herte and so leseth god.
The thyrde is for the presence of the company as well of .ix. ordres of aungelles as of the patryarches appostles martyrs confessours and vyrgynes and for the consummacyon of the charyte the whiche is in paradyse the welth of the one is the welth of the other in lyke wyse as it hath ben before sayd and declared.
The fourth is for that that the godes before sayd ben all togyders not the one after the other or the one withoute the other and the soule chosen in hym and by hym the whiche is al myghty is soo vygoryous in all his puyssaunces that she may haue knowlege loue and also grete gladnes as well of god as of all the creatures as well in euery of them in partyculer as of all togyders for euery momemt and for euer without ende By this it appereth that euery true crysten man hy~ sholde enforce to mowe come vnto suche goodes to suffre an hundreth thousande tymes deth ryght Ioyously yf it were possyble and god it sholde requyre but by his mercy he doeth it an hondreth.
tymes better chepe vnto the whiche the poore worl+dely people haue ryght lytell regarde.
THe syxte Ioye of the partye of the soule is honoure incomparable for foure thynges.
The fyrste is for his deuocyon deuocyon is asmo+che to saye as dedycacyon or to be ordeyned to serue god and hym prayse.
And for as moche that ye soule yblessyd is ryght parfytly the temple of the blessyd trynyte she is bayned in the lyght of the lo+ue infynyte and embrased with souerayne ryght parfyte deuocyon.
The seconde is for as moche she her seeth the doughter of god by true adopcyon and yf lordshyppes erthely and worldly is reputed thynge hygh dygne and honourable as it sholde be to be the sone of an Erle of a duke or of a kyn+ge what may a man thynke of that spyrytuall dyuyne lygnage who may it thynke.
The thyrde foloweth by the seconde that is that by suche adop+cyon she her seeth and knoweth the quene of paradyse who may in suche honoure compas and thy~+ke he hath mater ynoughe for to delaye.
The fourth that is that not aloonly suche is the doughter and quene of paradyse but with that she is ad+uowed and reknowleged goddesse by partycypacyon.
By the whiche all the courte celestyall vnto her bereth reuerence with gretae honoure and of good ryght syns that god her solmoche honoureth and ryght excellently deyfyeth.
THe seuenth Joye of the partye of the soule is beautefull of admyracyon in foure maners.
The fyrste is in beaute of vnderstondynge the whiche is the clere knowlege of god and also of his creatures As it hath ben touched here before.
The seconde knowlege is the beaute dyuyne the whiche illumyneth and maketh the soule gloryous for to shyne an hondreth thousande tymes more than ye sonne The thyrde is beaute of noble vertues with the whiche the soule is innornyd as sholde be a ryght ryche vestyment with grete mul+tytude of golde and of precyous stones the whiche hath ben sette by a werkeman souerayne in shynynge varyacyon of dyuers colours for he the whi+che hath innornyd the heuen with dyuerse bodyes shynynge and the erth with the erbes and the trees beynge grene and the see and the ayre with fysshes and foules fleynge floures and feders so dyuersely paynted and fygured that souerayne werke man hath inestymable paynted and ennornyd his doughter his loue and his espouse his trone and his reclynatorye.
The fourth is the comparyson of ye foure vertues cardynales ye whiche than shall be in theyr souerayne operacyon.
That is to vnderstonde Justyce force prudence and attemperaunce shall holde the soule without ony resystence in her operacyons agayne god and agayne euery creature for by the vertue of force the soule is vnyed with god by Justyce she is subiecte vnto god by prudence she cheseth to see god aboue all thynges by attemperaunce she is not subiecte nor letted by ony mouynge of passyon the contrarye yt is beaute and ordenaunce spyrytuall ne may not be shewed vnto vnderstondynge humayne for this presentlyfe but ryght lytell in comparyson of the trouth.
THe eyght Joye of the partye of the soule is for the eternyte of her glorye the whiche is greate and incompreuable for foure thynges.
The fyrste is for the presence and conformyte that she hath with god.
The seconde for the company and amyable charyte that she hath with the aungelles and the aungelles with her.
The thyrde for the vnyon and Joyous consyderacyon of her wyll wt the sayntes of paradyse and all the sayntes with her.
The fourth for the tranquylyte that she hath in herselfe by that that she shall be sure and confermed in the eternyte of her glorye and blessydnes and for as moche that all these thynges the which haue ben touched here before it is not necessarye to prolonge this artycle.
THe nynth Joye of the partye of the soule is refeccyon ryght delectable for foure thynges.
The fyrste is for as moche that than the spy+ryte humayne is the souerayne consu~macyon of al perfeccyon of all delectacyon and of all his desyres and so is come vnto that that he hadde before byleued and hoped and vnto that vnto the whiche she neuer rechyd nor ouer come.
The seconde for as moche that all payne all labour all thought fynysshed in this worlde hath no or reste but in glorye there is no thought laboure nor dys+maye but all to the contrary.
The thyrde for that that the company is ryght delectable As some what it appereth in persone of grete honoure fre and lyberall vnto whome it suffyseth not to ha+ue in his hous abou~dantes and delycyous meetes yf he haue not company lyke.
In lyke wyse is it of the soule yblessyd the whiche hath the kynge Jhe+sus and the quene the moder of god and the musyque and melodye angelyque and all the prynces dukes Countes and barons esquyres ladyes ge~+tylwomen without nombre the whiche all theym delyten ryghte Joyously in the beaute and in the noble vertues and merytes of the soule yblessyd. /: The fourth for that that the palays where suche feste is songen and suche dyner is inestymable gre+te pleasaunt and ennornyd the whiche is the propre herytage of the soule gloryfyed after as holy scrypture sayth.
And yf it be so that in this lyfe mortall a man hath Joye lotes and pryse for the (proprete or possyon of a royalme or of a duchye what may her+te humayne ymagen of the glorye the whiche apperteyneth vnto the soule to haue the conquest of suche herytage.
THe. x. Joye of the partye of the soule is bles+sydnes without ony varyacyon or diminucyon or imperfeccyon the whiche ben fou~de in worl+dely glorye.
The fyrst admixcion of some thought for there was neuer soo gloryous a man erthely worldely but that hath some defaute.
Many be ryche the whiche haue no helth these other ryche in helth the whiche haue not beaute or they be not of all folke byloued these other ryche hole fayre but they haue not all that yt theyr herte desyreth but in the glorye of paradyse there ne is defaute diminucyon of beaute of rychesse of pleasure of charyte The seconde imperfeccyon of glorye worldely is a maner of anoysaunce for in wyne or in meete in carnall delyte in dysporte in rychesses or in what some euer other thynge that he may desyre comen fynally to anoysau~ce hath ben the lesse praysed but in the delytes of paradyse is neuer fou~de ony varyacyon alwayes in loue without tydynges alwayes begynneth euer more beloued euer more delectables pleasau~tes.
The thyrde inperfeccyon of glorye worldely is that it may not endure for lyf humayne temporall is compared vnto a wynde vnto the smoke or the arowe the whiche is departed shote with the bowe the whiche hath noo taryenge tyll vnto that yt she is in the marke aduysed and determyned of hym the whiche it shoteth but sensualyte for that that it is submytte vnto the spi+ryte after the ordre of reason.
And therfore all the glorye of the body cometh of god by the meane of the soule.
In lyke wyse as dampnacyon cometh vn to the soule by the meane of the body in suche wyse appyred the ordre of this treatyse the answere vnto the questyon.
And therfore of the glorye of the body of his douers is now to treate fyr+ste in generall afterwarde more in especyall.
As vnto the fyrste it is to vnderstande that the body gloryous hath foure pryncypales excellences that these theologyens callen the douers of the body that is to knowe clerenes ryght delectable impassybylyte in enarrable subtylyte inestymable and agylyte incomparable.
Also after saynt Ancelme beaute force lyberte helth all other delytes plea+sures that may be spoken ymagyned in regarde of the operacyon of the fyue wyttes of nature of the place of all other circonstau~ces in lyke wyse as it appyred here after shall be in all the bodyes of the saued in so ryght grete inestymable excellence that ony tonge mortall is not suffycyent for to speke it but for as moche as god excused the fragylyte humayne the whiche dooth that that in hym is here foloweth in partyculer the .x. pryncy+pall Joyes the whiche ben in euery body vnyed wt the soule gloryous.
Here folowen the .x. Joyes of ye partye of ye body.
THe fyrste Joye of the partye of the body is clerenes the whiche may be compared vnto foure thynges.
The fyrst is vnto the soule for as moche that the soule shall be more dygne more noble of more greter degree of meryte of as mo+che vnto hym shall be yelden his body the more shynynge in the douaire of the clerenes of glorye As for example.
Who so taketh a lyght grete or ly tell it sholde put in a lampe or in another vessell of glasse of as moche as the lyght sholde be the more grete the sayd glasse sholde be the more shynynge.
The seconde comparyson is vnto dyuerse partyes of the body for a man ought not ymagen that the eyes the face of the body gloryous aren in ony degree more clere and more shynynge than shall be the foot or the legge.
The thyrde comparyson is vnto these other bodyes gloryous for in lyke wyse as we see yt the sonne the mone all ye sterres of ye skye haue one suche dyfference in theyr clerenes yt tweyne may not be fou~de in all semblables a lyke thynge is it of the bodyes of ye blessyd.
The fourth comparyson of the good werkes done durynge the vnyon of the body and of the soule in this mortall lyf for the blessyd haue glorye pray+se of all the good werkes yt they euer dyde in this worlde for the loue of god weren they in the estate of grace or in mortall synne how be it that in that there is grete dyfference in lyke wyse as it hath ben sayd before.
By the whiche it appyred that a man may desyre to lyue longely for to amende his lyf for to excercyse hym in his good werkes of the whiche a man may haue Joye prayse without ende.
The prayse of the good dedes done in the estate of mortall synne is a Joye accydentale the whiche cometh as well vnto the body as vnto the soule for as moche that they haue in some wyse disposicyon preparacyon to retorne vnto the estate of grace.
Of that sayth Alexander of hales in his summe that the good werkes may be suche that durynge the tyme that a man is occupyed in them a man taryeth as for ony successyon of tyme the mortall synne is not aggrauate durynge the occupacyon of those good werkes.
Also saynt Bernardyne in his treatyse de contractibus in the sermon lxiiij. the whiche thus begynneth.
Ecce ego vobiscu~+sum recyteth twelue other prouffytes the whiche comen of good werkes done in mortall synne.
Fyr+ste they defenden the persone from some synnes in the whiche he sholde falle yf were not those good werkes.
Also they dysposen the soule vnto other or semblables good werkes.
Also those the whi+che done theyr penaunce in suche estate of synne ben acquyte.
Also they occupye the tyme in suche wyse that without those good werkes a man sholde falle in to ydlenes or in to more grete ylle.
Also they make the persone partener in the good dedes of his neyghbour.
Also they letten many grete losses cursyd aduentures the whiche these synners haue deserued augmenten the goodes temporels as ben helth of body rychesse of golde syluer of other possessyons for the whiche goodes they shall haue honoure glorye yf they ben one tyme sauyd.
Also they letten the puyssau~ce of theyr goostly enemye the whiche had ye more grete occasyon to make synner to falle in to temptacyon yf were not those good werkes.
Also a man is not so moche punysshed in helle or in purgatorye as yf a man had ben ydell or occupyed in euyll werkes in the tyme that a man hath done those good dedes.
Also they prouoken the bonte of the creatoure for to gyue grace vnto the synner to reknowlege his gylte for to fynde mercy.
By the whiche it behoueth to saye that the body the soule of the saued haue glorye accydentale for suche werkes how be it that they haue ben done in the estate of mortall synne.
THe seconde Joye of the partye of the body is perfecte impassybylyte for foure thynges.
The fyrst for he may not haue thynge in this worlde that vnto hym may be contraryous be it withoutforth or within.
The seconde for as moche as the body hath other tymes endured in as moche as mortall passyble of as moche shall he be in the more hygh degree of Impassybylyte as before hath ben sayd that some shall be more clere than other.
The thyrde for as moche that all the partyes of the body shall be egall in suche maner that yf he were in the fyre of helle where an hondred thousande glauyes ryght sharpe stryken agayne hym where he myght not in ony wyse suffre them.
The fourth for as moche as the contemperacyon of the foure elementes of the whiche the body humayne is composed ben in theyr souerayne ryght perfecte consu~macyon by ye whiche may neuer fall passyon corrupcyon ne alteracyon in suche wyse they abyden impassybles
THe thyrde Joye of the partye of the body is subtylyte in foure maners.
The fyrste for suche body gloryous may be wt wtin an other body not gloryous in lyke wyse as the fyre the whiche is a thynge corporell may be by the waye of nature wtout wtin in all the partyes of an yren on fyre therfore yf by waye naturell suche penytracyon is done in a body not gloryous it ought not to be ryght grete meruaylle yf it be done by puyssaunce dyuyne in the bodyes the whiche ben gloryfyed.
The seconde for the body gloryous shall not be with the body gloryous for two bodyes gloryous for to be togydres repugne of good congruyte and vnto the ordre that the sapyence inyfynyte hath put in thynges treate.
The thyrde for the body gloryous shall be egally subtyle in all partes the whiche ought to be vnderstande as to thynke on an other body not gloryous for the eye shall not fynde more of resystence than the fote or the hande in lyke wyse of other membres but neuerthelesse the one membre shall be more subtyle or lesse after as it apperteyned vnto the disposicyon of the body humayne.
The fourth is the body gloryous shall be abyde in that degree of subtylte ye he hath deserued for euer wtout fyndynge ende wtout fyndy~+ge resystence the whiche maketh lettynge vnto the wyll of ye soule but yt the body gloryous may be in a moment from ye heuen in the erthe from ye erth in heuen from the one parte of heuen in ye other in lesse space of tyme than now it may be spoken vnderstande or thought.
THe fourth Joye of the partye of the body is agylyte in foure maners.
The fyrst for body gloryous shall be aboue all obeyssau~ce vnto the wyll of ye soule shall not lette it in no but yt she be inco~tynent from one place in to an other as may be now our thought as soone ferre as nere.
The seconde for the body gloryous shall not haue more of disposico~n to descende than to ascende but all his propre inclynacyon shall be obeyed vnto the puyssau~ce wyll of the soule the whiche suche glorye vnto her hath pryncypally purchased in obeyenge vnto the creatoure.
The thyrde for as moche as the body gloryous is not borne from one place in to an other for necessyte or indygence as we see in this worlde but all oonly for the pleasure glorye of the soule and therfore in no thynge that may be ymagyned the body gloryous ought not to lette or tarye the soule.
The fourth for as moche as the body gloryous may not alonge hym from the presence of god for in what soeuer place that the body and the soule gloryous be borne alwayes they ben present haue the clere vysyon of god.
And so it appyred shortely of the foure douaires of the body that is claryte impassybylyte subtylyte agylyte the whiche ben of the hygh perfec+cyon that is in the leste of the gloryous that is or the whiche fynally shall be in glorye with ye blessyd that none entendement with holden aggreued in body mortall ne may it comprehende but euery creature in his owne ryght ought faythfully to labour to the entent that he may fynally haue the experyence of suche meruaylle.
THe fyfth Joye of the partye of the body is by cause of the habytacyon of heuen emperyall for foure thynges.
That is to vnderstande for the beaute for ye force for the resonau~ce.
The beaute of heuen is suche so grete that it may not be compared vnto no beaute erthely.
The gretnes of the erthe is also as nothynge in regarde of the gretnes of heuen force Joye gladnes there proceden habonden in all partyes in suche maner yt the fyue wyttes gloryous ben soueraynly replenysshed euery of them that that he appetyteth that is is to knowe that the syght is full of Joye and of gladnes for foure thynges.
The seconde for the presence of the gloryous quene the moder of god.
The thyr+de is in seenge the grete innumerable company of the blessyd.
The fourth is for the clerenes of the glorye the whiche is the shynynge of all sayntes assembled in one lyght.
Thynke he yt may what thynge it may be to see these thynges beforesayd for no wrytynge ne may suffyse for to declare the one of them all oonly as it is also that the clerenes of the lest body gloryous the whiche is or shall be fynally in paradyse shall be greter than shall be the clerenes of the sonne yf she were. xiiij. tymes more grete than she is now ones.
hertes humayns thynke than what may be ye clerenes of the precyous ryght gloryous body of Ihesu cryste of his ryght dygne moder also of other euery of them in his degree.
But what may yt be of all togyder but oonly one depnes of Joye of gladnes as moche grete as is yt lyght.
And this is as vnto the fyfth Joye of the body.
THe herynge shall be full of Joye gladnes for foure thynges.
The fyrst shall be for ye melody of ye voyce the whiche is shall be herde in the glorye celestyall.
The seconde for ye grete nombre of them the whiche maken gyuen suche melodye for there ben men women angelles archangelles in one accorde of dyuyne and celestyall musyke.
The thyrde for by cause that the songe be foresayd prodeth of loue of Joye infynyte.
The fourth for the reason of hym vnto whome is made suche Joyous melodye that is vnto all the blessyd trynyte the whiche gyueth so moche of goodnes so moche of honoure vnto all the company of the saued the whiche neuer may cesse to magnyfye god and hym to prayse without noysaunce or beynge wery.
And this is for the sixte Joye of the partye of the body.
THe smelle shall be ful of Joye of gladnes for foure thyng{is}.
The fyrst is for ye smelle of the precyous body of Jhesu cryste.
The seconde for the sauour of ye virgyn Mary The thyrde for smelle partyculer of euery saynt in paradyse.
The fourth for an inestymable redolente the whiche is composed of all togyders for in lykewy+se as the syght the herynge ben full of swetnes of melodye ye whiche proceden of dyuers partyes. so is the smellynge of euery of them in partyculer of all togydre.
And this is for the .vij. Joye of ye body.
THe tast shall be replenysshed wt sauour incompreuable for in as moche yt in glorye of paradyse is al welth assembled it behoued yt it re+plenysshe the tast the touchynge in lyke wyse as these other wyttes corporelles by the whiche suche thynge is named in the gospell dyner or ye souper of paradyse for foure reasons.
The fyrst for as mo+che yt in lykewyse as the meete corporell vnto vs co~+trybuteth lyf mortall of this present worlde.
In lyke wyse the glorye of paradyse contynueth ye lyf vnto all the Also for as moche as it suffyseth ryght abondau~tly.
Also for as moche as it gyueth perfeccyon vnto the operacyon of the taste for of all the sauours pleasau~tes delectables that euer were in wynes meetes in fruytes or other thyng{is} there shall be made com+posed one souerayne the whiche shal haue the per+feccyon delectacyon infynytly of all these other the whiche contynually shall refresshe the blessyd.
Also for as moche yt the shall be euer more in disposicyon well to taste to sa+ lesse after the degree the soule hath
And in lyke wyse is it of the touchynge for shall be in suche delectacyon that the pleasu+re ne may be declared by no tonge mortall by the whiche thynges it appyred in what after the fragylyte lytell power of entendement humayne how the blessyd ben of glorye of loue of Joye of helth of gladnes of beante of bonte of rychesse of all other goodes wtout ende wt out mesure that may be spoken or comprysed by entendement of persone morsall be it as vnto the glorye of the body or of the soule. the whiche thynge ought to moue pryke exhorte our hertes for to come vnto suche glorye the whiche ryght derely the blessyd Jhesu cryste vnto vs hath conquered promysed infallybly yf we hym wyll obeye in holdynge the pathe of his ryght holy co~mau~dementes.
And this is as vnto the .ix. Joye of the partye of the body.
OVer these thynges before nombred it is to vnderstande that there are certayne persones amonge the saued ye whiche haue glorye accydentall excellent synguler the whiche glorye is named aureole the whiche is as moche to saye a lytell crowne whiche is gyuen vnto suche blessyd for the synguler batayll in the whiche they victoryous as ben those and they the whiche kepte pure wt out corrupcyon volu~tarye of theyr body be it in sy or other wyse they had hope purpose to come vnto suche victorye for the loue of god to haue in wyll alonely to breke her virgynyte ne maketh to lese the aureole yf a man hym repent that the dede hath not ben accomplysshed.
Also she the whiche is defyled ayenst her wyll and afterwarde perseuered in her good purpose shall not lese the aureole yf she had conceyued lygne in the sayd vyolacyon.
Also the aurcole is promysed vnto doctours the whiche haue vertuosly resysted vnto the deuyll as well for them as for theyr neyghbours.
And by the doctour ought a man also to vnderstande the good prechours and those the whiche wryten doctrynes mo+rales vnto the glorye of god and for the saluacyon of soules for vnto suche is promysed the aureole not all oonly vnto them the whiche haue the degree professyon of doctour.
Also vnto martyrs the whiche haue had vyctorye of the worlde in suffrynge the deth or effusyon of theyr blood for the loue of god for the trought of the holy fayth catholyke.
These thre aureoles hath soueraynly the blessyd Jhesu cryste for he is a virgyn and the sone of a virgyn doctour and martyr ryght excellent.
Some of those that be chosen haue had as many aloonly some tweyne some other all thre.
THe. x. Joye of the partye of the body is for the prayse vocale the whiche is made generally vnto euery saued in partyculer of all togyders before the throne of the blessyd trynyte pryncy+pally for foure thynges.
The fyrst for as moche god hath gyuen vnto creature reasonable his his semblau~ce vnto the creacyon of thynges in lyke wyse as the gyfte of creacyon is incompre+uable for the semblau~ce whiche is bytwene god the soule deifyed saued also is inenarrable the Joye of suche comparyson of semblau~ce prayse the whiche for suche gyfte benefyce is yelden vnto the creatoure.
The seconde for the redempcyon of humayne lygnage for in that that blessyd seen clerely and manyfestly the loue infynyte that god vnto them hath shewed by his blessyd In carnacyon ryght pyteous passyon and the whiche them hath delyuered from eternall dampnacyon they gyuen graces and praysynges vocales melodyous vnto the soo moche excellently that no mortall man ne may it speke worthely.
The thyrde for the benedyccyon of the grace dyuyne of the whiche the mercy infynyte them hath worshypped ouercome in this worlde and oftentymes them hath called agayne releued and preserued from grete and detestable synnes as wel by the mysterye of the sacramentes of holy chirche as also in them the kepynge and the seruyce of all the blessyd angelles of the celestyall the whiche graces and benefyces all the saued knowen it ryght well perfectly by the whiche they gyuen prayse vnto god incessably.
The fourth for the glorye vnto the whiche they seen to be come and ben certayne that it shall neuer be lesse nor it shall neuer defayle neyther in body ne in soule ben shall dwelle in eternyte of peas and of loue in force in beaute in youth and all other goodes more grete and infynyte than ony herte ne may thynke.
There is none suffycyant for you to vnderstande for you to wryte for you to nombre for you to comprehende for all these thynges beforesayd notwithstandynge that they ben of grete meruaylle playnely they ben a lesse thynge in com+paryson of the ryall veryte than is a ryght lytell droppe of dewe in regarde of all water that god hath create.
And therfore better it is to cesse so moche to wryte hym to retorne vnto deugute oryson without the whiche none ought not ony thynge to begynne in lyke wyse to ende.
And for the true god of mercy of peas of consolacyon fontayne of loue of pyte of swetnes the lyght infynyte lyf eternall vnto you me yelde dygne of cruell deth depnes of ignorau~ce of all mysery of all welth assured indygne more than can speke in you besechynge ryght humbly that it may please you me to gyue taste felynge in this presentlyf that as of the paynes of helle of the Joyes of parady se me ye haue gyuen grace for to speke in this present treatyse to wryte vnto that that you may fere redoubte and fynally with all myne herte you to loue.
creatoure of heuen of erthe the whiche ryght Justely gyuest helle vnto the dampned your blessyd paradyse vnto the saued confesse aduowe to be that haytyf synner the whiche the goodes of the body and of the soule hath ryght folysshely dyspended vnworthy to lyfte vp my face ayenst the sonne or the mone.
But that wt standynge very god fader pyteous of euery creatu+re fontayne of mercy ryght Justely requyre the ayde of all your court celestyall ryght syngulerly of the virgyne gloryous the moder of our souerayne lorde the of grace dne aduocate of synners to the ende that by theyr intercessyons excellente merytes my synnes grete innumerables ben vnto me in this present lyf forgyuen pardonned and that this the whiche haue here done by you you and for your glorye vnto you may be agreable vnto the edyfycacyon of euery good creature not for my merytes or operacyons but by the infynyte bonte swetnes humy+lyte of our blessyd sauyour Jhesus of his holy moder vnto whome me submytte yelde vnto the deth vnto the lyf Amen.
THe yeres. vi. thousande. vi. hondreth thre score and. viij. after the begynnynge of the vnyuersall worlde.
And the yeres a thousande fyue hondreth the .xiiij. daye of Januarye after the Incarnacyon of our lorde this present booke was fyrste consumed.
In the whiche yeres dayes habonde more grete ylle than may be spoken or thought to haue be in these yeres dayes before sayd that is that the co~maundementes of god ben well nere all dyspraysed ryght dampnably trespassed the whiche thynge is the moost grete exces of the dolorous pyte that may be ymagyued for than it foloweth that almoost all the worlde the whiche reygned in these ryght peryllous dau~gerous dayes go vnto perdycyon.
The consyderacyon of the whiche exces hath be the cause motyue of the composycyon of this present booke for the consolacyon and reuocacyon of symple people.
And to the ende that those the whiche it wyll rede or here may consyder that that they haue auouwed vnto holy baptem and also to vnderstande the trought of the co~maundementes of god and of the werkes of mercy.
By the whiche knowlege they may them correcte and purefye from theyr synnes by holy entyere confessyon and to fere redoubte the horryble paynes of helle in ferme hope to mowe come vnto the ryght gloryous company of paradyse mo+uynge the ayde and benedyccyon of all the blessyd trynyte vnto the whiche fader sone and holy goost be honour and glorye in heuen and in erthe ex hoc sicut nunc et semper.
Here endeth the booke named the ordynarye of crysten men newely hystoryed and transla+ted out of Frenshe in to Englysshe.
Enprynted in the Cyte of London in the Flete strete in the sygne of the sonne by Wynken de worde the yere of our lorde.

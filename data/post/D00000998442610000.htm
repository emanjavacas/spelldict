THE VVELSPRING of wittie Conceites: CONTAINING, Methode, asvvel to speake, as to endight (aptly and eloquently of sundrie Matters: as (also) see great varietie of pithy Sentences, vertuous sayings, and right Morall Instructions: No lesse pleasaunt to be read, then profitable to be practised, either, in familiar speech, or by writing, in Epistles and Letters.
Wisedome, is like a thing fallen into the water, which no man can finde, except it be serched to the bottome.
AT LONDON, Printed by Richard Iones: dwelling at the Signe of the Rose and the Crowne, néere Holburne Bridge.
To the Right worshipfull, Maister Dauid Lewes, Doctor of the Ciuill Lawes, one of the Maisters of her Maiesties Courte of Requestes, highe Iudge of the Admiraltie, and Maister of S. Katherins: R. I. wisheth co~tinuall health both of body soule, increase of godly worship in this world, eternall felicitie in the Heauens, through Iesus CHRIST.
RIght worshipfull Sir, it may seeme a point of great presumption in me, to co~mende into your protection, this small booke, beeing another mans labour, and yet (notwithstanding) the first fruites of my poore Presse, sithens the comming in of this newe yeare: but these few thinges, being duely co~sidered, may (I trust) deliuer me from the blemish and suspect therof: One thing is, the absence of the Author, who (not only) deliuered the Copye hereof vnto mee to be printed, but (also) committed the dedication of it to bee disposed (by me) to my best liking: Another cause is, the wittie conveighances, handled in the woike: but (principally) the heartie affection and duetifull good will, that beare to your worship, with an (assured) hope, that you will accept it in as good parte as my faithfull meaning is towardes you: For (sometimes) a prettie Conceight, well contryued, may content a wise mans minde, no lesse the~
a graue and great booke: Yea, (otherwhiles) a seely Subiet, applyed to good purpose, is not (onely) acceptable, but (also) commendable: litle flower, if it haue a good scent, is worthie smelling: a litle stone, if it bee precious, and (therwithall) well set, deserueth to be worne: a poore Pamphlet, if it tende to some good effect, may (haply) at some conuenient time, be worth the reading: beseech you (therfore) giue a poore Welwiller leaue to present your worship with this small Collection out of dyuers notable workes, to the helpe and profit of many English Readers: not any thing hurtful to the learned, in other la~guages: and (although) the Phrase do not (fully) satisfie the Curious, it will (I hope) sufficiently delight and content the wise: for the further contents whereof, referre your worshippe to the Authors Epistle, and then to the worke it self: most humbly praying your worship to receiue the same into your protection and Patronage, as an infallible token of my good will towardes you, and to continue the iust defender thereof, against the scornefull crewe of MOMVS, his backbytinge Mates, to whome, all good thinges, are (continually) in contempt: And shall (dayly) praye vnto God, for your worship, longe to continue in health, to the pleasure of Almightie God, and the great desire of all your Welwillers.
THe Conceites or Deuices of our mindes expressed, either with Pen, or by Speaking, do tende to this ende, namely, that they may Perswade: And to Perswade, is as much, as that one man should make others beleeue, that our talke, or the thing whereof we reason, is either True or False, and our Reasonings or Speeches, be either publique, or priuat: Publique, are those that are vsed vniuersally to ye people, also, to those that gouerne ye people: Priuat, bée sutch as are vsed with Priuat Persons, which bée assembled together, and they be of thrée sortes: for they bée either of Thinges present, of Thinges passed, or of Thinges to come: Present, do comprehende Vertues, which are praised, or on the contrarie side Vices, which be blamed: Thinges past, as Manslaughters, Rapines, and all the offences and debates, which are brought into iudgeme~t, in which consist to Accuse and Defende: Thinges to come, are those, in which we haue néede: first, of Counsell, afterwarde, of Election, or making choice.
The first kinde, is called Demonstratiue: the second, Iudiciall: the third, Deliberatiue: all which (notwithstanding) that they do chiefly respect publicke persons, yet they be ordinarily vsed toward priuat persons, the which do many times giue counsell amongst themselues, doo Accuse, doo Prayse and Reprooue.
Other sortes of reasoning, as to Reioyce, to Bewaile, to Complaine, and all others bee reduced vnder some of the three aforenamed kindes, haue for their ende to Perswade, the which is sometimes brought to passe with reasons either Probable or Apparent, and sometimes with moouing mens affections: which things be principally giue~ by nature,
and afterward ruled and fitted out with that wonderfull order, which is shewed vs by Aristotle, and by other, both auncient and late excelle~t Wryters, who through their rule and order obserued, haue been the occasio~ that the fruites of many Authors shall liue for euer: out of whome haue taken some part of these Conceites or Deuices, which haue vnderstoode to be most learned, most méete, and proper to applye vnto all kindes and manners of Speaking, or of Writing familiarly, and those that were most briefe, déeming that in the qualitie, and not in the Quantitie of wordes, and of Sense, doth consist the Elegancie of a commendable Speech, or Writing: and that heerby we may, in what Reasoning soeuer it be, or in writing, receiue light of Inuentio~, and with such Eloque~ce adorne our matter, as shall containe fit Numbers, comely Figures, Metaphores, Similitudes, Sentences, Aucthoritie, and Examples: as those do shew foorth that haue here placed in order: and to make serue with fewe, and with many, according, as shall be most conuenient, either in Writing, or in Speaking: because one discours of Wordes, one Letter or Epistle shall not haue occasion to weaue together all these common places, it shall be expedient that they be of iudgement, and haue regard how to apply euery Sentence in his due place, according as Time and ye Matter doth require, they which shall go about to imitate any thing herein.
Those Sentences, which haue gathered out of Auncient and famous Authors, their names (for the most part) are coted in the Margent: others which haue béene partly the inuention of late Writers partly mine owne haue not coted.
Thus wishing for a frenedly acceptaunce, in recompence of my frée goodwill, cease.
The Maner to expresse by word or writing, how we reioyce, and what it is.
TO reioyce, is a conceipte of the minde, that groweth of the pleasure which we receiue of those things that delight vs: like (as contrariewise) to be sory, groweth of the displeasur that grieueth vs.
And this Co~ceipt expressed in words, or in writting, is deuided into three speciall sortes, which be, the goodes of the Minde, of the Body, of Fortune: vnder which, are comprehe~ded many kindes of reioycing with others, of their consolations, and of proper and common words, apt vnto all sortes of perswading.
THat you (most deare Frend M.N. be in good health, am as glad as trust you vnderstande that am.
needed none other consolation in this your absence (for to moderate my griefe) then the aduertisseme~t that you giue me of your good welfare.
You, who knowe howe carefull am of your he alth, would that ye would more often let me vnderstande of the same then you doe, except that ye go about by this meane to make me (more ferue~tly) wish
therefore, and so that hereafter, (as of a thing more desired) should esteeme it double worthie the acceptaunce, as in very deede at this tyme it hath happened with me.
With small paines, of body yee might ere this tyme haue relieued the troublesome estate of my minde, beeing brought to passe through your abse~ce: which (my comfort) is the newes that you haue sent me, co~cerning your good estate, in which ye are, and of the which continually do reioyce.
If you knowe, how that my cogitations were busied about nothing els, after your departure, but in desiring newes from you, ye should vnderstande, that my co~solation hath growen through the newes that haue receiued of your health.
FOrasmuch (as heare no newes of you) veryly hope yt your malady is well ceased, in which opinion do so delight mee, that feele my selfe halfe discharged of that griefe, whereinto your disease had cast mee. Consider you how greatly my co~solation hath beene in hearing the recouery of your health, for that feeling my selfe at that tyme in very ill case to receiue sutch, wished for newes, did not (onely) recouer my former estate againe, but me thought ye strength (which had loste) returned or came to mee againe, double.
You, who doe knowe, that your commodities and consolations, bee my commodities and consolations, may also bee assured, that could receiue no better (nor more desired newes) then that which receiued of your health.
That you haue recouered the health (that yee had lost) hath beene a thing (as ioyfull vnto mee) as the recouery of thinges being most precious, (when they were esteemed to be vtterly lost) was wont to be gotten againe.
Am glad (not onely) because of your present degree, but also for those things that may bee looked for (of you) hereafter.
doe incessantly ioy that your honest desire is reduced to sutch an ende, as your piety towardes yours and the loue towardes your Countrey, haue deserued: And that the reputation, the which your singular loue and famous vertues haue gotten to your consolation, hath made a ladder vnto G. Marcellus, to the same degree.
In this (my ioy) haue imbraced you with thinkyng on you, and haue kissed your Epistle, and doo as heartly reioyce as of mine owne matter.
What delight haue taken, in vnderstanding of our Brutus, his matter: you may more imagine the~ can write.
If you know how yt haue neuer ceased for any man in ye world, in being disirous to do you seruice: you may also be assured yt none shal now stay me in
feeling the gladnes of the dignitie, yt ye haue gotten.
Albeit, that there was neuer any doubte but ye you were likely to obtaine all manner, honours and dignities, that were wont to bee graunted to men of wisedome and great valour: yet, vndersta~ding that you were made a Byshop, receiued thereby sutch great consolation, as was wont to bee receiued of good newes, being not looked for, nor thought on aforetime.
ioy in all respects (for your sake) like as good Seruaunts do, in wishing for the contentation aduancement of their masters: Moreouer, for such circumstances and accidentes as haue made this your felicitie appeare vnto the worlde greater, for that it is most euident that the same was appoincted aforehande, by the most prudent Iudgement of our Lorde God, to be receiued of you to your great praise commendations, commonly desired of all men.
will not make any long discourse of wordes in giuing an account to your most reuerend lordship, of the consolatio~ that receiued thorow your promotio~ to the dignitie of an Archbishop: sithens it is so, yt with your profou~d iudgeme~t, you haue alwaies byn able to pearce into the most secret part of my minde.
Haue taken a wonderfull contentation of the infallible hope, which you giue me of your consolation, and not that ca~ yet the more easily obtaine the same (for this were the ende of an Epicure) but because yt your greatnesse is of if self deare vnto mee. Concerning the preferment that your Lord and Maister hath promised you, do also with you holde my self greatly benefited: did neuer make account that it would happe~ otherwise to your estate, assoone as saw that you were placed in ye house of so good, so gentle and louing a Lorde: to whome doo me infynite commendations: haue iust cause to reioyce with you of your good fortune: and that, so much the more, inasmuch as in these our miserable times, it is no small thing to attaine to an honorable life.
ioy with you, that as it were in your first youth with the gate of Vertue, and with the companie of fortune, you haue beene called to such a place, as many of ripe years do with long study seeke to obtaine.
If Fortune doe not staye in the course of your honours, but that it reache to the full scope, and to the prefixed height of your merits, also hope to see this my gladnes grow to such perfectio~, and your vertue to such a degree, that neither the one nor the other of vs shall neede desire any more.
YOu are glad of your good fortune, and doe saile in the quiet Sea of your delightes without being set on ground, or cast on rockes, so God conserue you without any co~trarie winde for euer. For, the prouision or furniture that you receiued of the King: do most humbly thanke his Maiestie, do account my selfe greatly bound to him therfore.
may also consider with your most wyse iudgement of the satisfying or well liking that receiue of any your gaine and consolation.
reioyce greatly (rather for the wisdome that you haue shewed in getting of goods) the~ for yt goods themselues, forasmuch as to be wise, deserueth more praise then to be rich: And for your richesse also do receiue (as great consolatio~) as is requisit to my loue towardes your vertue and goodnesse.
IN this notable pleasure and consolation, which haue receiued concerning the inheritance that you haue gotten: should also wish for some excellent meane to make my selfe merry with you, if dyd not vnderstand how that haue to deale with you, yt is with a most prudent ma~, who with the quicknes of his wit, seeth eue~ into the middest of mens hartes.
You, which know how greatly was wont to reioyce at any of your commoditie, how litle soeuer it was, may also with ye prude~ce of your rare iudgement, consider what gladnes haue receiued in my minde for those ritches whereof ye so worthely remaine Heire.
Concerning ye goods which ye inherite am very glad, but not so that haue not kept a place for such ioy (as trust) shall more gretly teele, by that more plentifull profit greater honor, in which hereafter your personage is like to succeede.
Albeit, that my reioycing with you for the inheritance graunted you freely, for the gifts of fortune
can not bee without iniurie of the opinion which haue of your minde, the which is of it selfe so great high that it dispiseth all worldly dignities: yet, notwithstanding as a man, and that most affectionate to you, can not cease reioycing.
THis must needes be esteemed a great matter, yt in vs whom fortune hath co~ioined familiarity, it doth also lyncke together with frendship.
The mildnes and maners of M. N. (are such) that like as am very glad that you be entred into freendship with him, so am sory that all men haue not knowledge of him, that they all might reuerence him as a most worthie personage.
This seemeth to me (onely) to be the true fruite of ma~s life, that is to say: the co~solatio~ which is gotte~ out of vertuous freendship, as know (assuredly) that your friendship with M.N. shall be.
hope, that through the vertue and goodues of sutch a Gentleman, you shall liue euer more more to your contentation liking, and bee comforted by his practise, and that shall euery day reioyce more plentifully, as nowe doe ioy for that haue beene the cause of your friendship with him.
THe pleasure that haue taken of your reconcyling (with such a Friende) is none otherwise to be co~pared, the~ with the displeasur griefe that
were felt in the controuersie that arose betwixt you him: but, assured my selfe that this debate could not laste long, as being grounded vpon ye malicious perswasion of others: And this renewing of amitie, doubt not, but that it shall waxe euery daye more stedfast then other, through ye vertues of each of you.
seele such pleasure of your reconciliation and agreement, made with M. N. that although was grieued whe~ as you were angry one with another: knowe not now, whether would that this saide altercation should haue happened or not: for, if it had not byn so, should not haue tasted this present consolation, the which is infinite.
iudge yt who so is not your Enemie, must needs be very glad therof, because that on him shal depend the rest and quiet estate (not only of your selfe) but also of all your howse.
Inasmuch, as you are reconciled againe with your euemies at such time as ye might haue put the~ to the foile, you haue therwith also vanquished that euill opinion, which naughtie disposed people had of you, and haue established that good opinio~, that good men haue of your valiance and excellency of minde, wherof doe ioye without ceasing.
Delighte my selfe with this (that suppose) you doe now vouchsafe to loue mee more then you did afore, that you keepe mee still in memorie, wheras can abyde nothing but that which is excellent
(except it bee I) whome you do freely permit a place there.
Abeit, that my conscience doth assure and testifie with me what account ye make of me, yet, am greatly delighted, for that euery bodye may nowe esteeme of me to bee sutch a one, as am by you, that is, by a most commendable man, reported to be.
Like, as do not greatly regard or set to heart, though vngratious and infamous people speake ill of me, so feele great pleasure and ioy when laudable persons do commende mee. Those Lordes and noble men (with whome doe very often talke) haue a most honorable opinion of your goodnes and vertue, of which thing reioyce with all my hearte.
I, hauing seene the honorable mention (which you make of mee in the letters that you did send vnto R. haue not onely beene pleased with the letters, but haue thought also the better of my self for haueing obtained such a mans commendation.
WHen as your Secretarie came to meet you, would with these my dutyfull commendations, the which deliuered vnto hym by mouth, haue borne him Companie also with these fewe lynes, the which shall serue rather to salute you, to reioyce with you of your returne, then for to set foorth in any wyse, the relation of my faithfull hearte, which thinge the sayde Secretarie shall do for me.
monly make his presence more deare: therfore, am not able sufficiently to expresse the consolation that haue receiued of your returne.
Looke, howe much more long and daungerous your voyage hath bene, so much great er is the affection wherwith do ioy (together with you) for your happy returne.
am glad for your sake (not onely of your happy ready returne out of so long a voyage, but also, for your quicke dispatch that ye had in your publicke affaires: for, in the one is comprehended your great diligence: in the other is seene your prude~ce dexteritie in dwing your busines.
WHat greater thing can (naturally) be giuen vnto men, then to euery man to haue Children of his owne? they are vnto me so acceptable, both for the tender loue beare them, and for the excellency of their wit, that they be more deare then lise it selfe: yet, neuer felt so great consolation in hauing gotten the~, as do now proue in that, they be restored to me agaime.
Nothing was euer more delectable vnto any, then my Brother was vnto me: yet, tasted not so mutch the sweetnesse thereof whilest that enioyed him, as did afterward when was bereft of him: But after that, yee had restored him againe to mee, mee vnto him: it is an incredible thing to speake of the ioy, which therof conceiued in my minde.
You be returned againe so glorious from your exile, and with so great praise in the opinions of all me~, that ye do (as it were) cause me also to wish my
selfe dryuen out of the countrey, seeing that the hope of returning thither againe, in such sorte as you are returned, would counterpaise al the displeasure and griefe that could feele.
You haue bene in exile, as it were in a fornace, (inasmuch) as your vertue is therby become bright and shining, is purged from the rust of other mens Enuy, which kept the same secrete.
Like, as haue beene one of those whome yo vniust exile did most highly displease, so nowe not stay for any body of the world to ioye in my se for your honorable returne into the Countrey.
haue receiued from you twoo Letters, of which, both the one the other were very welcome, like as a thing so curteous and, wished for in it selle, must needes be.
With my exceeding delight haue receiued the letter that you did write lastly vnto mee, by which most ioyfully vnderstood of your prosperous estate.
If seeme vnto you too importunate, for that put you in minde euery howre yt ye should writeften vnto me, impute the fault therof to the loue which beare you, the which being seasoned with the beauty of your wisedome, doo cause that feele an exceeding pleasure in reading your letters.
haue receyued a most great consolation by your letters, as being such, as are ful of much sweetnesse and pleasure, and passing the ordinarie forte, the which thing hath caused mee greatly to long for them.
Of so houest and honorable a Matrimony, will not at this tyme vse any circumstaunce of dutyfull congratulations, inasmutch, as concerning my minde good will towardes you (I hope) yee bee out of doubte: yet, will this lay, that ioye as greatly at your profit as doe of mine owne. You may be assured that God (who disposeth ordereth all these things before yt they come to passe) hath not without some great mistery co~passed per fected this mariage, wherof do (greatly) reioyce.
iudge this most holy knot of wedlocke, so necessarie for men, that without it (I dare auouch) we ca~not obtaine perfect felicitie amongst men.
Sithens that am not able to expresse the pleasure which feele of this your matrimonie, wherby yee may promise vnto your selfe a quiet estate of all the remnaunt of your life, therefore will referre it to the discretion of your iudgement, and to that true knowledge which ye haue of my loue towards you.
am like to be the last, that shall ioy together with your excelle~cie of his most fortunate mariage, as being one of his simplest Seruaunts: but shall hereby reape this commoditie more the~ others haue done, that (at the least) the long tarying of duty may cause (this my reioycing) to come in some consideration and regarde: wheras, it should aforetyme haue ben obscured through the congratulations of many.
NOtwithstanding, that euery forte of your selicitie appeareth vnto me strange, for that through your manyfold merits, haue alwaies perswaded
my self vnder your personage to obtaine by ye goodnes of the Lorde God all manner good fortune, yet, haue by this new Childbirth receiued an infinite consolation.
The happy childbirth of your good hath made vs sufficient demonstratio~, what care ye Lord God keepeth of your pleasures consolations.
ioy for this Childbirth not so much with you, as with all the residue of the world, seeing, that the young childe that is borne, beeing begotten by you, must of necessitie be also partaker of yt great brightnesse and excellencie of vertues, yt is in you: euen so, pray God that the beames thereof may spread abroade, and endure continually all that time of life, the which doth yet remaine vnto your succession.
Concerning this most fortunate Childbirth of your consorte or yokefellowe, am greatly replete with gladnesse (not onely with you) but together with the whole Cittie also, as hoping hereby to see your yeares prolonged in the person of this Childe: and so, that (both) and they shall afterward see (in long continuance) the fruite that wee shall receiue through your vertue and valour.
Pray God, that hee may make M.N. wel again: Do not you suffer him any more (to ye great da~mage of his frends and your great displeasure) to go thither againe.
Would to God that with parte of the light of mine owne eyes, myght satiffye the wante of your sight, whiche thinge, woulde as gladdely
performe (if it were possible) as do nowe speake it.
pray God that hee will vouchsafe to conserue ye health of your body, but so as it may not bee without the health of your minde, because, that like as some venemous herbe (being of it selfe deadly) whe~ it is mingled with other thinges, doth make a holesome drincke, so the health of the bodye without the health of the minde, is hurtfull, wheras beeing aco~panied therwith, it is very great helpe.
will pray incessantly vnto God, that he would maintaine still (both) the health of your body, also of your minde: forasmuch, as nothing is worse, then a sound body to dwell with a sicke minde Spirit.
pray God, that hee will conserue the health noble estate of your lordship, which thing shall bee vnto me a sufficient recompe~ce for that faithfull seruice which haue done, and desire to do therto.
would, it might so happen, that God would graunt a speedy ende to your maladies troubles, that he would vouchsafe me a beginning of beatitude and rest, the which consisteth, and is vtterly reposed in your health and welfare.
Our Lorde God, keepe and saue the person of your excellency or highnesse with a greater felicitie and prosperitie, then it wisheth.
OH that it might please God, that that singular vertue and goodnesse (which glistereth in you) may not staye long without the companie of some degree and dignitie, conuenient therto.
pray God, that like, as he gaue you the shoulders of Hercules (that is) power to beare, any great
and heauy weight: So, hee also will illuminate the heart of this our Prince, to honor you with any good dignitie, which may bee comformable to the valour of your merites.
That you be in so grent hope and credit in that Court, as vnderstande by all people there, that ye be, do not much maruell therat, inasmuch (as this) and a greater matter haue alwayes bene promised me, by your vertues: So, pray, God bring to passe that those houours and dignities, which aforetyme appeared to my sight in your perso~, may bee so worthy of you as ye bee of them.
Might it so come to passe (that the thing haue pronosticated of your Person) might bee brought to such an ende as Caesar did foretell of his owne personage: who going one morning to ye Co~menceme~ts, promised his Mother yt he would not returne home againe to his howle before he was created Bishop, (which thing) he happyly performed.
WOuld to God, the diuine prouidence might so worke yt the same selicitie might abyde with your lordship, might bee stretched foorth to yours, might be so continued in your succession through an entyre accomplishing of that hope which the world hath conceiued by the glorious fortune, by the merite of your vertues, by your goodnes, vnto whom am particulary most bound.
recommende mee most duriefully vnto your lordeship, the which (for the reuerence that beare therto) wish that may feele and know to be most fortunate.
pray God, that he would deliuer you from all trauail and grief, so as with a more quiet minde ye may liue free vnto your self, to your fre~ds, amo~gst which may account my selfe one of the dearest.
With the good grace of your lordship, recommend me infinite times, praying for the prosperous estate therof for euer to abide.
haue been exceeding glad to vndersta~d of your good prosperity, in which our lord God increase you, and exalte you dayly more more, the which your aduauncement can not bee in so great a happinesse, but shall still desire it to be greater.
must now intreate you, that ye would be content to keepe alwaies in your minde the great loue that beare you, and wil alwaies beare vnto you: Our Lord God, make you the most ioyful woman yt liueth: like, as he hath made you the most curteous.
pray God, that he will giue you such prosperitie as yee desire (that also knowing your consolation) may thereby continue most comforted, if it bee possible that a minde (beeing brought into sutch an estate as mine is) may be capable of consolation.
Sithens, that our fortune doth on euery side begin to shine againe, God be thanked, and also by all meanes pleased, because he bringeth it so to passe, rather through his goodnes and mercie, then for our desert.
Pray for time which may bring occation, wherby (through the effects of experience) ye may vndersta~d what is the greatnes of loue yt beare you.
God graunt that may within short space promise my self some other effect that may be better for your co~moditie.
pray God, that hee will one daye inspire your Maister, to giue you some condigne recompence for your long and diligent seruice.
God so bring to passe, that one day your ill fortune may cease, that my simple authoritie may increase, to the end that may by way of a reco~pence, and with some benefite, shew you the gratefulnes of my mind, how hartely your vertues be well liked of me.
Pray God, that he will grau~t vs grace to be able to wade out of this seruitude, to the ende that we may not alwayes stand to the discretio~ of such as would vs no good.
Whensoeuer any mention is made of the auncient liberties, that this Cittie had in time passed, it shameth it to think of ye seruitude wherin it is now.
Veryly, the bridle of seruitude, is a harde and greeuous thing to any man, but it is most grieuous to the~ that bee yssued out of the chaste belly of libertie, the which (I trust) God will one daye restore vs againe, although not for our desertes, yet because he will not suffer any more such tyrannie vpo~ earth.
God be the restorer again of that liberty (which wicked men of a malicious purpose) haue taken fro~ you after the manner of wilde beastes, for a tyrant is none other but a cruell wilde beaste, styll beeing thirstie after mans blood.
OVr lorde God graunt, that of this agreement may follow an vniuersall quiet, by which we be co~discended to peace, not without da~mage.
pray God, that he will grau~t you the treasure of peace, so as hereafter yee may lyue to the pleasure
of God, ioy of your selfe, your friendes and kinssolke, in perpetuall richesse, the which dooth consist in the tranquilitie of the minde, soule, and Spirit.
Forasmuch, as there is nothing more conuenie~t to a good man, nor more worthie to a good Cittizen, the~ to liue peaceably: pray God, that he will lighten your minde with these cyuill passions, and that he will pla~t in you such peace and rest, as euery one desireth, and as sewe do know how to procure.
I, as one disirous of your ease (can not cease) but still wish you peace, and do pray vnto God that he will graunt you it speedely.
Not to be in an euill Opinion, knowe very well your true vertue, and would to God that like as ye be without fault, so that yee were also without suspition.
pray God, that this report, which is come vnto mine eares, of you, doo not bring you into some sinister opinion, with others.
God graunt, that for the bounty and faithfulnes of this man, he be not contrary wise dealt withal by them that with ye venim of their malice do not cease to go about for to defile and peruerte the minde of that noble Lord, to make him beleeue that white is blacke, and blacke white.
TO aduertise, is a word that hath diuers significatio~s, for, it is take~, to marke, that is, to take heed, to harken, to waite for, to obserue, and to regarde: it is taken also for to apply, indeuour, and to haue care of some thing: like as is in this place of conceipts, it is applied: the which do serue to exhorte for a comformitie: and is vsed in the deliberatiue and iudiciall kinde.
THe maner of your doyng that matter, seemeth doubtfull vnto vs (forasmuch) as men will iugde therof, according to the ende. If that the matter might be taken in hand and proceede, according to the forme as we would haue it, euery body will call you wise and valyant: but if it bee hindred hereafter by any euill fortune, they will all then say, that ye were a vaine and ambitious person.
tell you, that men will giue their iudgement, not so much of the counsaile deliberation that you shall haue taken in the matter, as of the ende that therto shall happen.
Wee ought not alwayes to walke one and the selfe same way, but to tende our course to one the same ende. pray God, that he will be mercifull and assistyng to your councells, but much rather that hee will make you to shunne offences, and cause you to haue care of your quietnes, and of the good estate of your successours.

You ought to bee very wary in dealing herein, according to the importaunce of the matter, concerning which (I am sure) that yee shall well discerne, how, besides the vertuous commendatio~s that you may thereby obtaine, the estate of my wealth, and honour doth theron leaue and depende.
would that aboue all aduertiseme~ts (which haue giuen you to worke, and doe your businesse warily) ye should take heede (especially) that you doo not fall headlong into any such sinne, by which your lust might ouercome reason, yt you take heed of all such euil affectio~s as might peruert your vnderstanding.
Take heede that you deale so cunningly, in the matter, that (as much) as is possible the reputation of my deedes may liue, the which be yours.

Antisthenes, being demau~ded in what sort a ma~ ought to seeke profit of the common wealth: Like, as at a fire (sayd hee) which a man sitting too neere, doth scortch himself, and being to farre of, sustaineth cold.
Like as to a good gouernour of a ship it appertaineth

Consider with your selfe, that if you know ye be not fit, by your own only industrie to acco~plish this businesse, it is better for you to procure ayde therin, which may supply in your imbecillitie, then that ye should fall into any errours.
If in these your affaires ye deale so as your reason bee not intermidled with lustes or affections, doubt not of any errour to remaine on your behalfe.
Ponder with your self, how yt it is not best for you to innouate or deuise begin any new thing besids my commissio~, for to proue a new way, wheras the

All things that be delectable, are not profitable, for often times that which is hurtfull, is pleasaunt sweete, and that which is commodious, is bitter.
Take heede aboue all thinges of betrayinges, forsomutch as the hatred, is vniuersall, which is euen at your elbowes ende, causeth that yee can not promise vnto your selfe any particular safetie.

Thou oughtest three manner of wayes to consider the qualitie of hym, with whome thou art co~uersant (that is) whither hee be thy superiour, thine inferiour, or thine equall: If he be thy Superiour, thou must giue him hearing and sooth him: If hee be thine Inferiour, thou must perswade him with modestie mildnes: and if he be thine equall, thou must accorde with him.
So doing, thou shalt not fall into enemitie and hatred.
Like (as he) that is delighted in bodyly exercise, must beware of wrinches and disordered falles, so he that glorieth of his good fortune, must shun enuy.

Take this aduertisement as of a Freend, such a one as loueth you, wisheth you well, not of your enemie one that meaneth you harme: for (if yee doo otherwise) you shall giue me occasion to thinke that flattery is dearer to you, then frendship.
You (remember howe that for to haue the loue of all men vniuersally, and the fauor of some noblemen particularly) wee haue no surer waye, then to thinke how we may deserue the same.
There is nothing so hurtfull as an ill reporte, for, after that, thou shalt haue beguiled any one preuily with false perswasio~s, hatred awaketh hurteth the innocent.
Suspicions do breed moe ill reportes, then doe the deedes themselues.

Like, as where ther is no light, is no shadowe, so where no vertue is, there is no enuy. Enuy, is onely fed of euill, and is tormented by that which is good, receiuing in it self yt euil which it desireth in others: wherfore Alexander ye great, said, that enuyous men be their owne tormenters.
It is not ynough, that our owne euils, ye which be very great, doo torment vs, but also other mens blessednes, and happy estates, do vexe vs. There was neuer any famous man, in any age, which dyd not with a haynous countenance wonder at enuy. Enuy, is one of those Enemies, the which are by no meane better vanquished, then by flight.
Socrates, being demaunded of Alscibiades, how he might flye Enuy: aunsweared, with liuing an abiect and miserable, like Thersites, for, that miserie (alone) is without enuye.
The enuyous person, is an enemie to himselfe, forasmuch, as he is alwayes beaten with continual passions of the minde.
Rust, consumeth yron: ye mothes, cloath: wormes, wood: but enuy, as that (which is worse the~ al euils) consumeth man.
Enuye oftentymes casteth downe those that haue beene exalted by fortune.
Few men ther be that without enuy doth loue a fortunate Frende.
Theophrastus sayde, that wicked and enuyous men, do not so much reioyce of their own benefit, as of another mans hurte.
Those that are enuyous be the most vnhappy of all men, for they do not only sorow for their owne hurt: but also for the prosperitie of others.
Socrates was wont to say, that enuy is a wou~d in the foule.
IF we would consider howe much exellencie is in the nature of man, and how much worthines, we should also see how great shame it were to suffer it to be gouerned by leacherie, by delicate liuing, by a feminine spending of time in voluptuousnes.
It is extreme foolishnesse, to delighte in those thinges, in which is greater pleasure then profit.
The pricks of louers, the slightes that they vse, the snares that they lay, and the deceipts that they sowe for to possede the thing loued, do sufficie~tly declare vnto vs how great the dissimulatio~ and wilines of loue is.
Loue, groweth not on a sodaine, as wrath doth, neither passeth it sodainly away, although it is supposed to cary winges.
Nm. N. is necessarie to gratifie a faint louer withall, but mutch more him that hath an heart francke of loue. Loue, can not be said to be any other thing, but a madnes amongest men.
Loue, is an ydle thing, vnprofitable for any good enterprise, an Enemye to labour, that it is so, we see that, it, flying Beggers, ouertaketh rich men.
Loue, is an excesse of a certaine vnreasonable desire, which commeth quickly, but goeth slowly awaye.
Theophrastus, being demau~ded, what loue was, aunswered, it is the effect of an ydle Spirit.
IDlenes, is the father of leachery, and gluttonie is the mother.
Nothing is more vile, or doth more pricke a ma~, then gluttonnie.
Nature hath giuen vs a throate, not for an instrument to delight in surfetting, but only for a conduite and waye, whereby the meate is guided to the nourishment of the body.
Some men set all their studie and care vpon knowledge, some vppon cheualrie, and vpon other honest exercise: and this ma~ (alone) hath all his minde vpon the kitchin, and in the cookery, (as one who only hath for his ende and purpose) excessiue eating and drinking.
Like, as the roote doth nourish the plant, so the meate that the bodye receiueth, ought to nourishe it self, and not lustes, gluttonous eating drinking.
SO great is the ruine and destruction of others, that through their imbecillitie, (and not for our owne vertues) we be accompted mightie.
Men beeing in prosperitie and in ydlenesse, whe~ fortune laugheth on them, they become vniust, vntemperate, and do suffer themselues to be corrupted with voluptuousnes, It is no shame to take paines, but shame to be ydle. Vertne walketh by the waye of labour, and not by the waye of ydlenesse.
It was wont to be sayd, that exercise is the father of a good name.
There bee many moe become good through diligence, and good exercise, then be by nature.
Goods do multiply with a ma~, if he take paines.
span missing] Hesiodus, lykened the ydle persons to Drones, which be those bees that hauing no stinge to defend themselues, doe eate vp the labours of other bees, without trauailing.
sound man that is idle is more miserable, then one that hath the agewe.
Idlenes, causeth infirmitie of the body, and dulnes of the minde.
RIches be rather the Friends of vice, then of vertue, and doe oftener allure the mindes of young folke to vnhonest delightes then otherwise.
Like a horse cannot bee ruled without a bridle, so richesse cannot be ordered without prudence.
Euen, as garme~ts, which be of themselues cold, doo not increase, but conserue the naturall heate of man, so richesse and honours do not make men happy, for as mutch as felicitie consisteth in our minde, not in thinges subiect to the iudgement of others.
Our nature hath none more deadly enemie then richesse, a dire aduersarie to vertue, a minister of vice: neither did Diogenes without occasion say, that vertue dyd not willingly lodge, either within the liberties of a citie, nor yet but in a few rich Pallaces.
Plato, wisely sayde, that a ritch man could but ill willingly be vertuous.
The intemperate desires of getting richesse bee very prickes and rich thornes.
Richesse ill gotten, were wont to breede short pleasures, and long shame.
It is a harde matter for a rich man to bee temperate, and for a temperate man, to get great abondaunce of richesse.
It is necessarie to haue a rich minde, and not a body clad with a great ostentation of riches.
The very fruites of richesse, be nothing els but leachery, couetousnes, and infamie.
Richesse bee blinde, and doo make those blinde that behold them.
Garmentes, which bee too long, doo hinder the going, and superfluitie of riches bee an impediment to the soule, Our affections by nature, are harde to bridle, but after that they be acco~panied with riches, they cannot possibly be bridled.
Bion sayde, that those were made a laughing stocke which would giue themselues a praye vnto richesse: for they are graunted to a man by fortune, conserued by Auarice, gotte~ togither by falshood.
Plato, being demaunded what stoare of riches a man ought to seeke for? answered, so much as neither should breed any snares, nor haue neede of any necessarie thing.
THis course of life which hold, perhaps offe~d in, which do maruail at the brauerie outward show of this life, and do not discerne the carefulnes and great yerksomnes wherewith it is replete.
Like, as Emnus sayd, in raigning or gouerning as King, there can bee no true faithfull companion, nor credit giuen to any.
These smokes of vaine honour doo seeme in my iudgement, to serue for nothing els but to make vs slaues to the rouling estate, madnes of fortune.
If we co~sider diligently, how that these honors and worldly dignities, be for the most parte vnstedfast, we shall finde also that it commeth to passe, because that they are grounded vppon the instabilitie of fortune.
FOr to feede the People with the vanitie of sutch showes, is a thing but litle esteemed of goodmen, for it noteth riotousnes, and is nothing worth.
Like, as it is but soolish wanto~nes to be caried about with a vaine out rye of others, and to follow the shadowe of a false vertue, so it is an act of a wa~ton and vnconstant minde, to refuse the light and brightenes of that which bringeth true glorie, and is the most honest fruite of perfect vertue.
ca~not esteeme good that sort of pleasures which hath beene found out by a wicked and naughtie ma~, such a one as hee was: for, nature doth not so easily admit a naughtie plant to bring foorth good frut. Wee are so by nature enclined to pleasures and pastimes, that we delighting indifferently in all alike, and making a confusion with good and bad together, do also confound our selues.
To what ende do serue pastymes, gamings? but to steale away time, to busie our vnderstanding in vaine thinges, and without any profit.
All pleasures ought not to be followed (but those only) which haue their deriuation of honest things.
Know not how ght praise beautie, seeing, that in wome~ it is for the most part accompanied with cruelty and ingratitude.
We must haue regard to the goodnes of ye minde, and not to the beautie of the body.
Byon, confirming the opinion of some that sayd, how that tyranny consisted in beautie: saide moreouer, that fro~ tyrants a man might by many meanes be deliuered, but from beauty, by no meane.
It is a very delectable matter to behold beautyfull thinges, (but to touch them) cannot bee without danger: like, as Xenophon said, the cooke doth broile only those thinges that hee layeth on the coales: but beautifull things, do set on fire also those that stand neare about them.
Like, as Gilliflowers and other most pleasant and sweete smelling herbes and flowers, if they bee cast into a Iakes amo~gst filthie dung, do forthwith become vile, euen so beauty, if it be, not acco~panied with excellent vertues graces, waxeth eftsoones, filthie and abhominable.
AL men are in this respect equall, that they haue had all one manner of beginning, and were naturally created after one fashion.
No man can challenge to himself any worthynes, for beeing borne of noble blood and of famous parentage, but for that he hath lyued vertuously, and dyed valyantly.
The nobilitie of thy parents and blood, do serue thee to none other purpose, but that thou canst not keepe thy selfe vnknowne when thou wouldest.
He glorieth of himself but in vaine, which boasteth of his dwelling in a noble Pallaice (inasmuch) as the praise is not his, but his predecessours.
In my iudgement (he that is a good ma~) is worthie to be accounted noble, like, as (on the contrarie part) esteeme a wicked man ignoble, although hee were descended of a father more noble then Iupiter.
Nobilitie consisteth in prudence: and by vnderstanding is obtained true riches, but only at ye ha~ds of God.
He that by nature is inclyned to vertue, hee is noble, although his mother were an Ethiopian.
Antigonus ye King, going about to reproue Byon the Philosopher of ignoblenes, asked hym what hee was, of what countrey, and where was his Cittie, and his parents? to whome Bion aunsweared, it belongeth not vnto Freendes to enquire where they were borne: but what manner of men they be.
It is better to glorie of the praises of the minde then of the nobilitie of the elders, beeing already extinguished through the obscuritie of the posteritie.
Like, as the noblenes of beastes dooth consist in the dispositio~ and strength of the body, so the nobilitie of men consisteth in the goodnes of manners.
Diogenes, being demaunded who were ye most noble me~? answered, those which dispise riches, vanitie, pleasures and life.
Socrates, beeing asked of a certaine man, what thing was nobilitie, made aunsweare, that it was a good temperature of the minde, and of the body.
NO man whilest that he is in prosperitie can tell whither he be loued or not.
Euen, like as Acteon was torne in pieces with his own Dogges, that had beene nourished by him,
so are those torne in pieces by flatterers, that do noorish them.
Flatterers, bee like vnto certaine sepulchers, in which is only written the bare name of amitie.
Antisthenes sayd, that there is lesse hurt founde amongest Rauens, then among flatterers, for, these do corrupt and eate the mindes of sutch as bee aliue: the other do but deuour (only) the dead bodyes.
Antisthenes, was wont to saye, that Flatterers were like vnto curtisans, or harlots, which do looke to haue found in those that were inamored on them all excellent gifts, except Iudgement and wisdome.
Crates, seeing a yong ma~, who was very wealthy, accompanied with a multitude of Flatterers, he turned vnto him and sayd: Oh young man (I am sory) to see thee so solitarie.
Demetrius Phalerius, exhorted Ptolome ye King, that he should buy him bookes to read, sutch as treated of well gouerning a Kingdome: for, in them hee should finde written such things, as those that were his true Freendes, durst not, and his falfe Freendes would not shew him.
IT was a generall fault of all them which did not defend me, and (especiallie) of such as were bound thereby by duetie.
All the good that haue done for him, is as good as lost, for, it is euen like, as had done the same to mine Enemie.
It was wisely sayd yt there were two woundes in good turnes: the one reprouing or vpbrayding of benefites bestowed: the other, forgetfulnes of sutch,
as haue beene receiued, both of them be the mothers of vngratefulnes, and stepmothers to a good turne.
THeir maliciousnes, maketh them to credit that which they haue hath say of others: that is, that must debase my selfe.
should neuer haue beleeued that thou wouldest so litle haue esteemed our recyprocall loue, the freendship renewed amongst vs, that for one onely worde, thou wouldest seeke to destroye my Brother Metellus, neither respecting ye noblenes of our house, nor yet the great loue that haue borne vnto you and to the common wealth, the which co~siderations might haue moued you, to haue put vp a litle iniury.
The iniurie which that naughtie toungued felow hath offered to this good yong man, hath made his most shamefull and impudent life manifest for euer. ME thinketh that how much the more mightie and noble a ma~ is, so much the lesse he ought to shewe foorth his power, especially toward the ruine of poore men.
Go not you about with honest wordes of your letters to cloake the dishonestie of your minde, for those that haue already an yll opinion of you, will giue no credit therto.
OH God, what a cockesconbe is he: and how in amoured on him selfe without any modestie or reason.
euen to haue brought hym into the Worlde for despite.
There be found some sorte of men in the world such ydiotes in their talke, that looke how more they go about to beautifie inlarge their talke, so much more they are mocked rather then harkened vnto.
MEn haue vsed many times to adorne the~ selues with glorious words found out by other mens industrie.
Those men that in co~pyling or co~posing works (do nothing els but imitate others) are in my iudgement like vnto the popingaye or pye, which speake those thinges that they do not vnderstand.
Like, as he cannot runne wel, that seeketh to set his feete onely in traces of another mans feete, so those cannot write well which go on imitating, and neuer swarue from the boundes of others.
Wist not that this life was shorte, a vaine course of glorie.
Of good, and of euill, consequently of godly men and of vngodly, there is at this present no great account made: such is the life wherin we do liue. Our life (when fortune doth fauour) is like to a running brooke, which is all durtie and myrie, harde to get into, viole~t, making a great roaring noyse, and lasteth but a while.
This our mortall and miserable life is none other but the likenes of a shadow, and a birth vnprofitable to the earth.
The Sea and land is full of euills and infirmities, which daye and night doo compasse about this troublesome life.
Good things (although they be sought) doo hardly come, but on the contrarie (euils things) doo come on heapes without seeking.
Man, is none other thing but an example of infirmitie, a spoyle of time, a iest of fortune, an image of inconstancie, and a ballance of enuy calamitie: remaining (only) fleagme and choler.
This (our life walking through a circle) is alwayes subiect to bee intrapped with euill, and can neuer abyde in one estate.
This our life (trauailing alwayes toward the ende) is like vnto wine, whereof (a litle being left in the bottom of the barrell) doth become vineger.
TO lament, or to be sorowfull with another, is an affectio~ that groweth of the displeasure griefe that we receiue by our owne misfortune, or by the misfortune or hurt of that person with whome wee do lament or sorrowe.
THe death of your father (a man of most worthy memorie) hath depriued me of a testimonie of gret authoritie, vnto whom was most bou~d. Albeit, that am assured that can not bring you more hurtful newes then these, yet, because nature, or rather the prouidence of God is superiour to all men, haue thought good (not to holde my peace herein) howsoeuer the matter goeth.
In this respect the noblest and most valiant person in the worlde, is no better then equall with the simplest and him that is most vile of conditions, for, that with one bitter sorte of death, the liues of them (both) are extinguished alike.
Sithens, that it hath pleased God (who is neuer deceiued) thus to deale, it is expedient that wee be conformable to his will.
WHo doth not see, how that many times ye hurt which we receiue by the Phisitian, is worse then the malady it selfe.
Concerning sicknesse, some sorte of them were wont to come through efficient causes, as by excesse of heat, or of drought: some by materiall causes (that is) by want of nooriture or surfetting: othersome are bred in certaine, the naturall partes of man, as in the blood, in the marrowe, or in the braine: at some other times, sicknes also do proceed of exteriour causes: as by the water (being vnholesome, by the soyle of the countrey, by surfetting, by penury, and suchlike) by which meanes, suppose that your sicknes co~meth, wherof, for the loue (that beare you) am very sory.
MY griefs doo not only flowe through the companie of yours, but they doo also increase infinitly.
The Goddesse of pouertie, as beeing most hatefull, is without any Temple.
Pouertie, is no smal maladie to those ye proue it.
There is no chaunce more miserable in this our life, then pouertie: for a good vertuous ma~ (if
poore man, as one that is fearefull, is euen a semblance of feare it selfe.
Men doe communely account of ritch men that they be wise, and on the contrarie make but a scoffe at poore folke, although they be godly vertuous.
It is so cruell a wound that beare in my Spirit for this your imprisonment, that assure you, of vse no better easement nor rest in my minde, then ye hape that haue to see you recouer againe your former estate of libertie.
doo so greatly lament, for this your imprisonment, as is conuenient for our fréendship, in consideratio~ wherof, like as (at this time) am exceedingly grieued, so (I hope) that hereafter my consolatio~ shall be the greater, when as shall see you restored again to your former libertie, and honorable, estate.
OH wretch that am, that should be the occasio~ of your so manyfolde troubles, and so mutch the more wretched am I, as that your valiancie, your goodnesse, and gentlenesse, deserued better fortune then this.
Seeing, that no consolation can be greater then this that desire rather then my life: namely, that might dye in thine armes, for as mutch, as by no meanes can so hope of thy deliuerance, that thou mightest be rewarded, according to thy deserts.
Aristides, being demaunded, wherefore he tooke sorrowfully his sending into Exile? he aunswered,
because of the shame that my Countrey receiueth of the iniurie done vnto me.
Neuer desired at any tyme my fortune more fa, then to haue the accomplishment of the thing now desire in these your tribulations, to let you vnderstande howe that esteeme your libertie lost, a yoke of seruitude vppon my necke: and albeit, that the residue of your Frendes be of ye same minde, yet, haue thought good to make manyfest vnto you mine affectio~, to th ye may measure it with your own affection, and with the affection of others, and haue experience therof.
What greater misfortune can happen to noble mindes, then the losse of libertie yet (I trust) you wil play the parte of a wise and valiant man, disposing your self, according to the quality of these
should lament for your libertie lost much more the~ doe, but that perceiue how that fortune maketh sclaues of such, as by vertue were made free.
It is very lamentable that other mens wickednesse haue defiled the brightnes of your name.
If thou shalt shewe a valiant minde in these thy mishappes: can neuer praise thee vnto the full, but much sorrowing is for thine estate.
Who wil say, that he is spoiled of his orname~ts, who by death is exalted to euerlasting honours.
The chaunge of fortune is grieuous ynough to one that was sometimes happy fortunate: wheras he that hath alwaies bene in aduerse fortune, taketh
Calamities haue dominion ouer men, and not men ouer calamities.
To comforte or giue consolation: And (first) for olde age.
Knowe no cause why me~ should meruell that olde age is subiect to so many maladies, seeing, it is euen infirmitie it selfe.
That old man is more foolish (who hauing passed ouer ye daungers of this life, and is arriued at the ende of them) would wish to begin his course newe again, then a trauailour, who hauing ended a longe and yerkesome iourney, should desire to go it ouer againe immediatly (forasmuch) as nothing is more acceptable to such as bee weary, then rest and lodging.
It is not expedient for your wisedome, to wish for that, that ye haue lost, seeing, it cannot be recouered againe, that is youth, for it is the propertie of a mad man to loue that which is lost.
Men ought to reioyce whe~ they come vnto age, wherefore they were borne, seeing age, is the very rypenes of men, and is as profitable to be in men as in fruites.
DEath happeneth to al men alike, wherfore thou oughtest not to challenge vnto thy selfe a priuilege of life aboue others.
dare not take in hande to comforte thee, or to
offer thee any succour, for, knowe ye thou art wise ynough, of a most noble minde, wherfore it should seeme great presumption if would go about to administer thee consolation in this matter.
All things that be according to nature, be good: and what is more agreeyng to nature, then for an old man to dye. Thou oughtest to conforme thy selfe, according to the good pleasure of God, and to beleeue that hee knoweth better what we need then our selues, and the time when to drawe again to him self his members.
In the raging Sea of this oure tempestuous life, we haue none other hauen, saue death.
Thou mayst thus comfort thy selfe for the losse of thy Father, that sithens in his life tyme hee liued well, he hath now with death obtained rewarde of his vertues.
This world is a very Uallaye of waylinges, deepe, obscure, and full of mire: happy is he that wel getteth out of it.
Seeing, it is so ordained by nature, that he which first cometh, must first go: the sonne hath no cause to lament for the death of his Father, for, hee dooth not therby forsake him, but goeth before him.
We may (truely) call the Earth a better Mother vnto vs, the~ she that hath borne vs, for, shee nourisheth vs but for a fewe monethes: and the other for a great many yeares.
To lament for things that can not be gotten againe, groweth rather of too mutch foolishnes, then of much godlynes and loue. Uertue, may make honest any sorte of death, whatsoeuer.
Albeit, that my minde is not sufficient to comfort you, for that the sorrow that abide doth suffer me to haue no place of consolation, yet, &c. He was not borne in vaine that dyeth well, neither liued he vnprofitably that finished well his life.
Death is no death, but the end of trauailes, and a beginning of life.
There is no armour more strong against any cruell dart of fortune, then a prudent minde: and I, being of opinion that you are most wise, do beleeue also that you vnderstande, howe that no humaine thing can bee perpetuall or quiet.
If thou wouldest consider, howe that hee was borne a mortall man, thou wouldest not sorrowe of his death.
Socrates, beeying demaunded, what was the greatest beatitude of man? Hee aunsweared, to dye well.
If sicke men could be healed with teares, and that forrowe could cease their griefe, would commende this wayling.
Inasmuch as we be mortal what thing should we els looke for of this our life, but mortalitie.
Trust with the grace of God shortly to see thee not only free from this disease, but also from all ill humours, by meanes of this sicknes, wherby thei shal be consumed, veryfiyng the olde Prouerbe (that is) that one euill dryueth away another.
Nothing (new or vnwonted) is happened vnto you, neither hath fortune any iot changed custome, nor nature, beeing alwayes vnstedfast, vnconstant and blinde, but we may rather say, that in this your maladie, it hath vsed the owne proper and naturall constancie, which is, to be alwayes vnconstant, and neuer to abyde in one estate.
Sicknes is a great dehorter from vices, and affections, and an exhorter to modestie and goodnesse.
It is mutch more easie to abyde the infirmitie of the body, then the griefe of the minde, wherefore, thinke it good that in this your sicknes, yee shake of all such thoughts as might trouble you.
Although, that man by nature is accompanied with many euills, yet, the worst of them all, is the displeasure of the minde, take heede therfore, least ye set any thing rashly to heart.
Am glad that your fortune is vnlike mine: for ther is great difference betwixt beeing iniuried, beeyng vtterly vndone.
To be without doubt is toke~ of a good hart, which thing without all peraduenture, would both staye, his foolish rage, and bringe you againe to your due place of honour.
The course of your fortune, although the case be vnlike, yet it ru~neth to the same end that mine doth. To the grieuousnes of the sorrow that feele about your matters, haue yet this consolation, that trust the counsels of Frendes, and the time it selfe, which breaketh the appointments of wicked men, shall giue recompence to the wicked willes of your enemies.
Concerning this losse, if you shal make such account, as haue alwaies denied that you ought for to make, you shall doe wisely, and shall with victory triumphe ouer your Enemies.
The refuge of our studies is such, that although wee cannot haue the great losse wee had restored againe, wee may yet at the least bee somewhat eased by not thinking theron.
Doest thou not remember how that with continuall lamenting, thy troubles bee rather doubled, then raced out of memorie.
Canst not thou see things that are open and manifest, who with thy quicknesse of wit wast wont to pearce to the knowledge of thinges most secret? Canst not thou know how that continuall lamentyng doth relieue thee neuer a whit.
man, that is rightly vertuous, ought to loose nothing by the multitude of the wicked: Thy valiancie is so great and worthy of it self, that for the sustentatio~ therof, thou needest no co~fort of others, neither can well comfort another, which am depriued of all consolation, my selfe.
Like, as in the aboundaunce of good fortune we are not straight lost, so, wee ought not to dispaire in the anguish, wherinto this fearfull waue hath tra~sported vs. Albeit, the distaining that is vsed to thy honor, is not to the losse of my health, yet, there is such likenes betwixt them, that me thinketh we could not be sure Frendes, except we tasted both of like greefes.
Mans estate, was wont thus oftentymes to chau~ge, neither is there any thing stable vnder heauen,
he which yesterday was a Seruauant, to day is become as a King: and another, who of late went clad in fine Purple, and commaunded the people, is now clad in vile ragges, and become a bo~dseruant.
Pittacus sayde, that it was the duety of a wyse man to know how to skirmish with aduersitie, and the part of a valia~t ma~ to beare the same modestly.
LIke, a wyse and valiant man, thou needest not care if the vnhonestie of men shall robbe thee of those things, wherewith fortune hath indewed thee most bountifully.
confesse that thy griefe is such, as thou canst hardly receiue any consolation, so great is the losse of all thy substaunce, and so litle hope of recouering the same againe: but yet, thou oughtest to moderat thy sorrowe, and not vtterly to dispaire.
Nobodye is more vnhappy in my iudgement, the~ he, whome fortune hath not earst suffered to tast of her venim: for, like as the shadow accompanieth the sonne, so aduersitie followeth glorie renowne.
The long experience that haue knowe~ in you, concerning wordly thinges, easeth mee of taking in hand to administer you any consolation (inasmuch) as knowe yt you were wont to arme your minde against the darted of fortune, doo therefore veryly beleeue that yee will patiently abyde this burthen of pouertie, that without any fault of yours, is falle~ vppon you.
Truely, your losse of richesse is great, but esteeme that you shall make it mutch greater, if you shall also loose your selfe.
Wee must not beleeue that fortune loueth those men more, vppon whome it fawneth, and such as it neuer displeaseth, the~ those whom it exerciseth with continuall trauailes: for, like as prosperitie maketh men fortunat, so doth aduersitie make them famous and tryed.
Whilest that you torment your self for the losse of richesse, that you haue sustained, you do (without doubt) make the same greater: for, sorrowing for the losse of richesse, you debase the worthinesse of your mind, which teacheth me~ to despise worldly things.
The losse that ye haue sustained, is not so great but that your wisedome is greater: wherfore with Iudgement correct fortune.
It is better a godly poore man, than a wicked ritch man, for, the one is worthie of mercie, the other of reproofe.
IT is now time to put in practise the precepts that haue beene written by most wise men, and to apply thy selfe to the vse of such things as with long studie thou hast learned: which thing (if thou wilt) thou mayst (though not willingly, yet at least patiently) abide the want of those Frends whom thou hast lost.
He, that in ye losse of terrene goods, as of fre~ds, &c. knoweth how prude~tly and with modestie to beare fortune, he may be truely called happie.
Verely the losse of so deare a Frend, which you haue sustained, myght shake the stoutest heart that is: but (forasmuch) as me~ ought to be co~tented with any chau~ce that happeneth in this world, it is your part to be greatly comforted in consideration of the
You shew your self not to be thoroughly taught in ye law of fre~dship, sithens you sorrow at the death of sutch a freende, who liued so well, that there is no doubt, but the Angels haue caried him into the sight of GOD, to enioye the fruites of his vertuous laboures.
It is the parte of a wise man not to bee sory for things lost, nor glad for such as be present.
Wee ought not to bee sorye for the death of our deare Friendes, seeing, they must of necessitie dye: but rather for such as dye beastly.
LIke, as a man that is sound and in good health, hath no neede of a Phisitian: so a wise man hath no neede of consolation.
Doo ye not vnderstande, that he alone may bee called a worthie and valiant man, who neuer bowed his shoulders at the burthe~ of misfortunes, who neuer blamed nor panted at his chaunce: and inasmuch as it is so, you ought also in this imprisonment shewe the libertie of your minde, altogether couered with armour of your innocencie.
It is lesse hurt to be imprisoned vnworthely, the~ to haue vndeserued libertie, and to suffer wrong in defence of iustice, then through lewdnes to abound in wealth.
What thing els is the earth, but a litle Ilande, compassed rounde about with the in the which we are put, as in a prison.
in this trouble, and to giue God tha~kes that he hath so endued you with his benefites, that like, as in libertie yee dyd not want wisedome, so your courage and valiantnesse of minde hath not fainted in this imprisonment.
If it bee true that the estate of vertuous worthie men doth consist in the force of the minde, not in this corporall matter: repute any parte of consolation at my handes towardes you, to bee but superfluous, whose noble heart know, is at libertie, in this your vndeserued imprisonment.
The prison doth not minister so mutch punishment to the wicked, as it dooth glorie vnto the godly, whose vertue doth afterwarde shine more vehemently then afore, like a fire that hath beene kepte secret and after bruseth forth in great flames.
If you had by any meanes deserued thys imprisonment, there were the~ cause why should seek to comfort: but sithens that the malice of your Enemies is the only cause therof, leaue giuing of consolation to your sincere co~science of a most verteous life, trusting to see you here after much more exalted then you are nowe disgraded.
Socrates, being demaunded, howe a man might liue without troubles? hee denying that to be possible, sayde: cittie or an howse cannot bee without those that dwell therin, and frequent the same.
Those, that with waylings and lighings doo take in yll parte their misfortunes are vnwise, and do not remember how that many be, and haue ben in a like and in a worser estate.
Socrates, because he was vniustly co~demned to die, Socrates laughing sayd to him thou therfore (which art my dearest Frend) wouldest haue me iustly condempned.
THat death is not miserable that is receyued for the common weale, neither is that Exile lothsome that is caused for vertue.
If they shall take my life away, yet they shall not bereaue me of my reputation, though they shall afflict my body with Exile, for that, it is mortall: yet, they shall not remooue my minde from the common wealth.
Defend thy self stoutly from sorrow, and withstande Fortune, reuoluyng alwayes in thy minde howe that in our Cittie, and in the common weale many haue vniustly beene sent into exile: tell thee also (and would to GOD, it were not true) that thou art dryuen out of sutch a Countrey, where no good wise man can liue quiet.
do not only exhort thee, but doo also pray thée for the frendships sake that hath beens betwixt vs, that thou wouldest stablish thy minde against misfortunes, considering with thy selfe in what estate all men are borne.
Your most noble minde, hath no need of a common medecine, and that which should saye for to comfort you in this your exile should be as a shadow in respect of the light of your vnderstanding.
Hee, which is vniustly sent into exile, ought to make himselfe mery, for that he hath Iustice his co~panion of his exile, which suffereth the vngodly Citizines to persecute him.
The heart of a valiant man, dooth not faint at the first falling of fortune, and what els is this your exite, but a disfauour of one chaunce of fortune for a cou~terpaise of infinit fauours, that ye haue receiued of her.
Great folly it is to lament the dying out of ones Country, forasmuch, as it is superfluous to haue regarde to the place where a man shall staye, dying, when as he must immediatly depart fro~ all places.
Anaxagoras, dyeing out of his countrie, was demaunded by his Frendes, whether hee would haue his body caried to the place where hee was borne? He aunswered, that the waye that leadeth to Hell, is no further from one place then from another.
Like, as the Mariners haue instruments prepared (both) for prosperous and for aduerse sailings, so ought we to haue ye affections of our minds made fit (both) for good and ill fortune.
In what place foeuer a man be, hee hath one the selfe same waye continuall and plaine to walke thorough this frayle and mortall life, to an immortall and euerlasting life.
Ydle fellowes, and such as are good to nothing, are belieged with pouertie, euen in their countryes: wheras, on ye contrarie part, such as be industrious and wife, in what part of the world soeuer they bee, do posseede sufficient, and neuer feele want.
Euen, as going out of one ship into another, we may still sayle prosperously, so going out of one Cittie or countrey into another, wee may leade our life fortunately.
to the eyes of the Egle, so euery Cittie and countrie is to a valiant man.
In what part soeuer it be of the world, where the earth doth noorish vs, there is our Countrey.
Seeing, that we are by nature brought foorth all free and vnbou~d, know not by what reason we should afterward binde and restraine our selues to one corner.
Euery part of the World, is free and open to a wise man, and to a valiant minde, the whole world is his Countrey.
THou wast wont to comforte others, following the maner of ignoraunt Phisiciants, who making profession to haue skill in other folkes diseases, know not how to cure their owne. beleeue that in these corrupt and tempestuous times there is any thing that can drawe neere to the true beatitude, saue only. ioyfull pouertie.
Poore men, that do content the~selues with their estate, be deare vnto God.
Diogenes hearing, the pouertie of a wicked ma~ reprooued, fayd: neuer saw any tormented for hys pouertie, but for wickednesse.
Diogenes said, that pouertie was a learned succour to Philisophie: forsomuch, as those things that Philosophy forced to perswade with words, ye same were put in practise by pouertie.
If thou shall neuer desire much, a litle will seeme to thee ynough.
Drogenes, made this a answe be to one that attributed pouertie to him for a fault, oh vnhappy ma~,
neuer same any man become a Tyrant thorough pouertie, but many thorough richesse.
The life of poore men, is like vnto a sayling at Sea, when the ship is neare to shore, but the life of ritch men, like to those that sayle in the depth of the Sea: To the one sort, it is easie to cast auker, and to fall into harborough: To the other, it is more hard, and requireth great labour.
Like, as it is better to lye sounde and in good health vpo~ a simple matterisse, then beeyng sicke to lye vppon a large and rich bed: so also it is better to liue fortunately in meane fortune, then vnhappyly in great aboundaunce.
Pouertie, is not that which causeth vs to sorrow, but the ouermuch greedynesse of our mindes.
Many men for iniustice and euill doyng haue beene put to death, but for pduertie neuer any.
No man is more fortunat, then a poore man, for, hee neuer feareth to fall from an highe estate to a lowe. Pouertie, is a thinge that is not enuyed, neither doth any man striue to obtaine it, and without any garding it is defended and conserued: And how much the more, it is despysed, so much the more it is exalted.
Had no comfort lest me, but only this, wherof death hath depryued me.
What great sorrow and griefe haue sustained by ye death of my brother, and of what commoditie (both) publike and domesticall, haue beene thereby depriued of, you (who knowe my secretes) may consider, for, looke what consolation one man could enioy by another, al yt receiued at his ha~ds. The death of Lentulus (beare it as we can) is such, that we haue lost a very good and worthie ma~, who had the noblenes of hys minde tempered with an infinite humanitie.
know not what thing can bee acceptable vnto a man, that hath lost him, who was wont to bee more deare vnto him, then any other thing.
The death of this Noble man hath so pearced into my Spirit, that can neither finde words, nor reasons, that be able to comfort my selfe.
Am wel pleased at this that thou hast tried what credit is in men with thy small cost, as well as knowe to my great dammage.
We were caught in a snare, or at the least sore belayed and like to haue beene caught.
beare these thinges with a faire face, and a mery countenaunce, but in very deede, they doo inwardly destroy and consume me.
Thou seest howe thinges doo fall out, for there is no manner of euyll in the worlde, that doo not
at this present abyde, and doe looke for to abyde hereafter.
It is a notable sayeing amongst men, that it is but a small matter to reprooue one, but to abyde an iniurie receiued, is a burthen insupportable.
ALL the laudable customes of our councry bée now decayed and vtterly come to nothing.
Our Countrey is afflicted and oppressed thorough the miserie of the time.
The malice of these tymes is so great, that no remedie is able to discouer and make manifest the minde from those sorrowes that shadowe it.
Roome, is at this time giuen to the spoyle, Iustice hath there no place: to conclude, all good lawes and customes be there reiected.
doubt not, but that thou knowest how that at this present, the worlde is full of deceiptes, dissemblinges and lyes. Graunt vs some respit to writ of dolefull and miserable matters, conformable to these times.
Wheras in times past, wee had great fauour, great authoritie, and most great renowne, nowe all these thinges be quite gone.
spend all my time in reading, not for to finde any medicine which might heale mee, but for to deceiue the sorrowe that doth now oppresse me.
Who is so dissolute, that he can at these thinges hold his peace and keepe silence.
Wee can see in these miserable dayes nothing but trouble, and anguish to hang ouer our heads.
The le~gth of time, cause vs to see many things,
THY Letters had bred in me a great sorrowe, but that haue euen determyned with my self to make a iest at Fortune.
My heart is so hardened with continuall dispaire that can admit no newe sorrowe into it.
The pensifenes of my heart hath so tormented and spoyled me, that am euen at deathes dore. Oh enuyous fortune, howe readye art thou to chaunge the very same benefites, that thy selfe hast giuen vs? When will this winde of euyll fortune cease? neuer: The which transporteth mee from flood to flood in the Sea of worldly aduersitie, and wil neuer suffer me to see, or take ground.
Fortune, is sometimes our mother, sometimes our Stepmother in one and the same day.
Fortune doth not giue, but lendeth monie to rich men.
There is no hauen of richesse so strong, but it may be broken by occasion of yll Fortune.
haue often tymes seene nobilitie vanquished thorough Fortune, and those that haue beene nobly borne, haue vnworthely ben cast downe by fortune.
To demaund: and (first) of Ayde. IN recompence of those honours that thou hast receiued by my cou~sels, thou oughtest to bee contented, that may leane somwhat vppon the support, with thy lusty flowrishing youth to be some ayde vnto my feeble old age.
Thou knowest how greatly thou mightest help me now, neither do require ought els at thy ha~ds, but that which thou shalt iudge to bee for my preferment.
In this respect you may sta~d greatly my freend, if that like as you promised me, ye will at al assayes be the Protectour of me and mine, whensoeuer need shall require.
If you will proceede on to bee such a patrone Defendour of men as ye haue beene: Publius and Vatinius will also seeke for your frendship ayde. would yt ye would place this matter of mine, in the Register of your owne affaires, to th'ende that may with you here obtain those things that you haue put in my head to labour for.
The fre~dship that in this matter yee might vse towardes me, is so great that it ca~ not be expressed, in which my necessitie if you would (as easily yee may, stand my good Friend and Patrone) you shall both shew the excellencie of your valiant and true noble heart, to your no small honour, and also shall binde me as an humble obedient Seruaunt with all manner duetyfulnes towardes you.
ESteeme thus with your self, that if ye will in any thing shewe me courtesie, you can in no wise better fauour me then in this gouerning of the prouince.
wilbe contented with any thing that ye shall do for me, but if you will acco~plish thys my request, ye shall be the better satissied.
loue is towarde me: yet without doubt shall be the better resolued thereof if may obtaine this present fauour at your handes.
For the strict bonde of frendship and loues sake that is ioyntly betwixt vs, request thee of grace, that thou wilt vouchsafe to vse such curtesie and humanitie toward the Volteranes, as, &c. I, being an vndoubted testimonie of the reuerence thot beare vnto you, hauing already sufficiently experie~ced the loue that you beare vnto mee, haue been bould to request so much gracious fauour at your handes.
Notwithstanding, that doo not doubt, but yee wil vse the same liberialitie towards vs, which you haue for your sakes heretofore imployed (inasmuch) as ye are not vnco~sta~t: yet, we would craue at your hands that singuler grace which you first promised, and earst vsed, to bee nowe extended towardes vs aboundantly.
Seeing, that am altogether out of hope of euer deseruing your loue by merits of seruice, co~sidering, ye greatnes of your fortune the simplenes of mine, will indeuour my selfe hence foorth to meryt some grace at your handes, by crauing and by submissio~, inasmuch, as yee may of your vertuous disposition as well esteeme, the indeuour of an hu~ble well willing heart, as of such as do you diligent seruice.
THou shalt bee hee, who in all matters of mine shal be my counsellour, shalt take the charge of mine honour, lyke as thou hast done of my health, and will be at all times ready to follow thy will decrees.
doo not so mutch request your counsell for dispatch in my businesse, as to obtaine honour in conference with others, knowing, that to bee, wise and prudent, will be profitable both to him that counselled, and to the Counsellour.
esteeme more, to be cou~sayled at your hands, then do to be aided by a great multitude of others together, for, on their ayde dependeth nothing but a litle profit and honour, which (I knowe) is much regarded of you.
Do humbly therfore with all reuerence and duty that can, desire pardon.
If yt had not falne in this lewdnes or offence, for the which craue pardon of your grace, neither had my· Fortune be discouered, nor your clemencie noblenesse of heart beene made knowne famous, as by this meane it shall.
request pardon for such a thing as shalbe well worthie your grace to graunt me.
knowe not, in what matter euer offended your worthines: but sithens that ye be offended, humbly aske pardon, promising neuer to giue you any cause of offence againe.
PRaying, and such godly exercises be easie to such as seeke the way to saluation.
admonish you that yee destroye our spirituall Enemies, which be vices, sensuall lustes, and that ye giue the scepter and dominion of your spirit and inwarde partes to the feare of God.
exhort you as earnestly as can to the feare of God, whereby you may looke for an, assured and perpetual beautitude, if ye wil first cut off all vaine desires that be fruitlesse.
There be three vertues vnto which euery man ought chiefly to applie himselfe: the first is to honor and feare of God: the next dutie is, to the Parents that haue begotten vs and brought vs vp: the third duetie is to the Prince and Lawes: which who so obserueth shall acquire to himself a most beautifull crowne of glorious fame.
IT is now time that we leaue setting our affectio~s on this miserable and most short life, and seeke for that life which is happy and perpetuall.
Beleeue me, the only waye of praise dignitie honour, is to be praised and beloued of good me~, and of such as be wise.
exhort you as earnestly as ca~ that ye would begin a new habyt of liuing, and vse such manners as tende vnto vertue, which may make the minde more capable of felicitie.
Consider with your selfe how that the beautie of the minde is so much more greater, the~ the beautie of the body, as a thing that is endued with diuinitie, being famous euerlasting, is more wortthie then that thing that is obscure, terrene, frayle.
Forasmuch, as humaine prude~ce is but a dreame in respect of a well gouerned Spirit, let vs vse the counsaile and discretion, that God hath appointed.
do you too wit, that to liue well vertuously, is a thing that will better satissie euery bodye, then any thing els. When as at a certaine time one sayd to Diogenes, that mans life was sull of afflictions and euils, not the life, sayde hee: but the yll liuing.
wise man, when hee goeth on a long iourney, doth prouide (rather) for thinges necessarie, then for such things as be precious and costly.
Like, as an house or a ship must haue ye lower partes very strong, so the beginninges and fundations of our actions, ought to be true and iust. Spensippus, beyng willed by Diogenes to leaue that sitting still in a corner that hee vsed, to stretch out his legges with going, answered: that hee liued not by legges, but by vnderstanding.
YE must haue an eye to that which Plato did diuinely write, that such me~ were wont to be cittizens, as were the most excellen and worthie men in a Cittie.
Thou must wholly indeuour thy self to such vertues as may get thee eternall fame, if thou wouldest attaine to that degree that thou desirest.
Thou must of necessitie answere to that expect ation which the People haue conceiued of thee, if thou wilt looke for any preferme~t, which thing thou maist easily accomplish, if thou shalt applye thy selfe to a vertuous life.
We esteeme that the bodies of worthie and valiant men bee only immortall, and that the motions of the minde and vertue, deserue perpetuall glorie.
Let vs loue our Cou~trey, let vs obey ye Senate, let vs imitate the godly: let vs dispise the benefites of this present life, and let vs seeke for vertue, accou~ting yt to be most good, which shalbe perfectly iust. Him do deeme an able and worthie ma~, who ascendeth to an hygh degree by hys owne vertues, and not him that ascendeth by another mans fall miserie.
Couet to get thee frendship, not with al those that seeke to be srends with thee, but with such as shall be worthy men, and such with whome thou mayst well gouerne the Cittie.
It is conuenient that men doo holde in greater pryce the sowle then the body: for, the soule is ye most perfect substaunce of man, and the body is but a shadowe of the man, euer chaunging and vnperfect.
Like, as an huge image must bee set vpon some foundation, so ought a man be founded vpo~ honesty without euer shaking or being remooued.
Agesilaus, King of Lacedemonia, being demau~ded, what were the thinges that appertaineth to a Prince? hee answered: bold courage against his enemies, good will toward his Subiects, and readynes in giuing good counsell.
Zeno sayde, that the most precious ornaments of a Cittie, were the vertues of the Cittizens.
Like, as a lanterne set on the toppe of an high cliffe, nourishing with a litle oyle a great flambe, is a succour to Mariners, that passe that way thorow the deepth of the Seas, euen so is one good Cittizen a great helpe to many others.
Admonish you for your owne quiet and wealthes sake, that ye shew obedience vnto hym, whome it hath pleased GOD to appoint a Prince euer you, wherof ye shal neuer faile if that you shal but measure his great power and dignitie with your owne simple estate.
It is an ancient ordinance of lawes, ye subiectes should yeeld reuere~ce and obedience to their Prince.
Epaminundas, seeing a goodly great hoast of men without a gouernour, sayd: lo, what a multitude of beastes are here without any head.
Solon, being demaunded, howe a Cittie might be brought vnto a perfect estate, aunswered, when as the Cittizens shall obeye the magistrate, and the magistrate the lawes.
Forasmuch, as Princes are vpon earth, the deputies and lieutenants of GOD himself, who, but meere Atheistes shall dare presume to rebel against, or not to obeye their soueraine Prince.
IF you will follow the way that your Elders haue taught you, ye shalbe in good hope to come to gret preferment and dignitie.
Those haue attsined to a great parte of vertue and rightuousnesse, which do reuerence such as bee worthie of reuerence.
The hands of young men bee strong to labour, and the opinions of old men, be apt for counsell.
It is an olde saying, that the worke of younge men, and the counsell of old men, haue great force.
HE, that reuerenceth Father and Mother, is, not only in his life, but also at his death, acceptable to God.
Hee, that feareth and willingly obeyeth his pare~ts, is like (without doubt) to become a good citizen.
God hath respect vnto such as withal reuerence do giue preheminence to their Parents.
Behaue thy selfe towarde thy Father and Mother, euen like as thou wouldest haue thy Children do vnto thee.
Pittacus, reproouing a mans Sonne that would contend with his Father, vsed these wordes, if thou shalt speake any thing amisse vnto thy father, thou shalt be blamed therfore, if there shall be nothing amisse, yet, thou shalt be deemed worthie blame.
certaine young man comming from studie, whereas hee had heard Zeno many yeeres, was demaunded by his Father, what thing he had learned in so long space? he aunswered, that he would shew him: but forasmuch, as hee shewed it not forthwith, his fatherin a cholor fell vpon him, did beate him, which beating, he supporting patiently, said: haue learned with patience to beare my Fathers anger.
If thou be vngratefull toward thy Father and Mother, nobody will iudge thee to bee euer mindfull of any benefite, that they haue done vnto thee.
THere is nothing that ca~breed thee greater profit and glorie, nor of all worldly thinges that can bee more famous and worthie, then too doo good to thy Countrey.
would exhort thee to goe forwarde with that honorable enterprise that thou hast in hand: but seeyng that of thy selfe thou hast already done more for the common weale, then could demaund, ought rather to reioyce with thee therefore, then to exhort shee. That is a true Glorie, and an vndoubted praise of vertuous actes, and of excellent desertes toward
the common weale, the which is approoued not only by the testimonie of all good men, but also by the common sort and all.
It is our duetie to prouide for these things, and for this cause bee wee placed in this estate, that as out of an high windowe, we might discry counsaile a farre of, and with our wisedome to make the co~mon weale without daunger and feare.
It is the duetie of such as we are, to abide with a watchful minde, alwaies to do, to thinke, or to say, somwhat for the common weale.
He, that lustely defendeth his Countrey, not caring for death, enuy, or punishme~t in respect therof, such a one may (truely) be called a man.
Pithagoras being demau~ded, in what sort a ma~ may deale against an vngratefull Countrey? aunsweared: as against his owne mother.
THere remaineth nothing els for me to doo, but to praye exhort thee, that thou wouldest stablish thy minde against all aduersities of fortune, and that thou wilt remember (not onely those things that thou hast learned of worthie men) but also those vertues that with good nature and studie thou hast atchieued.
Wee haue seene (aforetyme) howe that ye dealt wisely in the prosperity of fortune, and that ye wan great praise therby: Let vs now see also how well you can behaue your selfe in aduersitie, without taking any great care therfore, so as your noble heart may not seeme debased.
learning may help you to passe away valiantly the iniurie that ye haue receiued.
would haue you to bee of an heart (not onely quiet) but also valiant and strong, Be of good courage, so that if the malicious wickednes of some me~ shall seeke to diminish your worthines, trueth may make knowen their malice, and your worthines: and that whereas they shall go about to quench the same, they may kindle more and more, ye flames of your vertue.
Beate down vnder the yoke of your worthiues this calamity, tread it down with the feete of your wisdome: for there is no tree that hath so firme sure rooting, as yt which hath beene beaten with many blustering blastes of winde.
He, that hath a sure and stedfast minde, doth easily obtaine a perfect stedie end of all those things that he desireth: but he whose mind is feeble and wauering, is neuer safe from the hurtes of fortune, in what place so euer he be.
There can no mishappe chaunce vnto him that groundeth hys foundation vpon wisedome, temperaunce and continencie.

young man, hee answearing, sayd: it behooueth (Oh Sophocles him that beareth rule, to haue not onely contynent handes, but also contynent eyes.
IF any thing happen co~trarie to our expectation or worthines, let vs be co~tent with patience to abide it, euer looking for better, when God shall see time.
We ought with patience to abyde those things that shall happen, which humaine wisedome cannot remeady, alwayes comforting our selues with thinking, that nothing is happened vnto vs, more then hath happened to others aforetime.
will neuer leaue exhorting you to that patie~ce which is proper to a wise man, as yee are, and that yee perswade yourselfe to bee ordered, according to the will of God, who foreseeth all thinges.

exhort you that yee vse the Armour of humilitie and patience: for, with them ye shall vanquish the force of enuy. Forasmuch, as the chaunces of thinges are not applyed to our willes, it is expedient that we apply our will to those chaunces.
Our life is like to wheras me~ must be contented with their chaunce.
OVght not we to ymitate the fertile feelds, which do yeeld much more fruit then they receiued.
If yee remember what haue done for you, yee will not forget to recompence the same againe, as duety bindeth you to doo. It is the part of a gratefull People to recompence those Cittizens that haue been friendly to the common weale.
will neuer cease to do well vnto the common weale, if it shall bee gratefull towards me, will be glad thereof, and though it shall be vngratefull, in such a weight matter, will in simplenes of conscience do it good.
VAliant Knights do raigne and beare aucthoritie more actiuely with a milde and pleasau~t Reyne or bridle, then with an harde and displeasaunt.

Aristotle, being reprooued for that he had giuen almes to a wicked man, which begged it of him, hee aunsweared, giue not this to the lewde fellowe, but to humanitie.
Scipio, willing to keepe the memoriall of Polybius, laboured not to returne home to his house euery night, except he had first gotten some Friend and familiar companion.
If thou would go about to adorne a Citie with any manner race orname~t: first of all, thou oughtest to bestoare thy self with ye singular orname~t, which bringeth with it, humanitie, iustice, and liberalitie.

exhort you, to flye ydlenes, and to spende your time in the best and most honest exercyse that ye ca~: for nothing doth more hurt time, then time it selfe.
No worthie thing ca~ be accomplished without paynes taking, and God doth willingly helpe sutch as be deligent.
Labour, is no labour while it is a dooing: afterwarde, it causeth ioy. Zeno sayd, that man had no greater neede of any thing, then of time.
Would that thou wouldest let passe all sorrowes and vaine passions, and wouldest addict thy mind to ye study of doctrine, the which in prosperity would bee an ornament vnto thee, and in aduersitie would succour thee.

Yet seing that, the worldlie foolishe men, Can not parsaiue, this sentence to be sure, thought it good, for to prepair my pen: This to discriue, with all my busy cure, Of sapience: all thoght be impure, Yet know well, that God will grace him leu: That callis on him, with most sure.
Vpon non other, therefore will cry: But onlie, on that Lord celestiall, Thoght poetis vsed, in there poetry: On many sindry; goddesses to call, How far frome wisdome, did those fall, On such a wise: their pennis to applie, Where help was none, for to be had at all.

It is an Myrour, Lord muse to make: Wherein all Christians, may beholde and sie, Their sinfull liues, they ld with and lake, In to this worlde, and of It is glasse that pates speciallie, The sharpe threatning, the did vs take, Declaring, if we sinned we shde die.
And how that Aedam: our progenitour, In Paradice did breck the Lordes command, Heir may thou (gentle reader) any hour: That cairfull pertelie vnderstand, His enemies all, that held Adam in band, And how that Christ, became his Saour And made vs whom he in bandage fand.
The second part: declares to the plaine, Of the poore er, an How he hathe spent: his life and tyme in vaine, And how he doeth his great Which he hathe vsed, a contrae his professione: And how that Christ, our Lord and Hathe saued him, his sede, and his successione.
And last of all, here thou see: Now that all they, Must truble, and As did oure And all his Prophetes, frome the beginning, persecute, and patient lie, As we muste do, if we with Christ wold ring.

And thogh it be, of cloquence dede, It is no wondir, for when this worke wroght: As do yet, then small vnderstude, Of bookes nor autours, to studie had noght, Which vnto knowledge, of Scripture should me broght, For was then to conclude: In the Bastillie, where such could not be boght.
Foure yeres in prison, they held me their expresse, Foure and foure wekes als certaine, Foure dayes, foure houres, in nombre and no lesse, did into the Bastillie remaine: For Goddes word, as it is known plaine, And for no lawes, that had done transgresse, Nether to God, nor to my soucraine.

(·.·) Inimics, had Adam principall, That maid him to theme after his fall.
The law was one, that did torigour leid, The nixt was sinne, and the thrid so was deid, The law by right did ruell, and was his guide: But sin right sone, their vndir did him hide.
To shawe him selfe, then gaue possessione, To Satan, as the law beareth witnes.
After that Adam, knew the will expresse, Of God, then Satan raging gan to spring, To tempt mannes fleshe, and theirin to ring:
Where he maid it thrall, to these fois thre, Of sinne, the law and deathes extremite.
The Law to man, did Ceriouslie command: To obey God, the fleshe did it withstand, Because it could not, all the Law fulfill: Maid place to sinne, and leit him work his will.
So sinne to passage by his might, Then death began to and was most wight,
Those thre their high power persaue: Their great impire, and paussance they did haue. an day, their loude trompettes did blaw, On high rock, sinne down to vs did shaw.
With sore threatninges, right horrible to hear, In which barraume was of frute: Of herbe or grasse, it was cleue destitute,
Men lost their tyme, to laubour or manure, All was but stony rockes, and haddry Without moistues, as do oure fathers tell: Replete with dragons, and with serpents fell.
This mounte was named, in Hebrew Sinay, And called Agar, in Arrabic say: With fearful rockes, so hie was neuer sene, With mistie clowdes, whose toppes was couerd clene: His widdered head, bald, bentic black and baire, Whose hiddious hight, was moutid in the nire.
So that few durst approche, or yet cum nere: That vglie mont, for terrour and for fere.
On that mont fand the Law a propre place: For till disclose, and shaw her rigorous face.
In middes of that mont, seat was wroght, Right riche and lucent, where their lacked noght,
All rounde a bout that face, an fyre did flow: That kest huge lyght, with fyre and birning low, Like as the hole mont, wold consume and burne: They thought suddanly, it wold in turne.
One such an wise men thoght, that fyre wold burne the heauen, the earth, and Which signified, an great puissance amoued, With yre, and wroth, where al should be reproued: Such sume, with darknes, fyre proceding bold stonist all, the folk did it behold.
Aboue this fyre, an ouglie cloude astayed, Whose heauy hew, all regions made affrayed: None other wayes, these vapours did appere: Nor when the sonne, is most serene and clere, As when before, the thundre cumnis one blot, Likewise abode, this blacke and heauie spot.
With sad and heauy wombe, withouten mirth, All readie to bring furth, and beir birth.
Which signified, to euery wight certaine: God readie to distroye, the fleshe humane.
The golden bow, was not sene readie bent: Nor yet his purpour, consequent, That God him selfe, of his beniguitie, Gaue in token, and gage, to signifie: By his deuine, and royall ordinance, That he by oudes, nor waters aboundance, No more againe, the world he wold destroye: Which leag of loue, he made to father Noye.
And sindry tymes, yet we may see our sell, Now that a cloude, beginnes to grow and swell, By Goddes might, to molifie the grounde, Numeditie makes fruites till abounde.
Great differe~ce is, betuix these Cloudes twane, The one betokneth grace, the other
With fyre slaughtis, tumbling and sterilitie, With thundering, roring and calamitie.
There sat the Lawe, both holde and rigorous: With sad and heauie, decreit,
To vex and noye, of man the flesh and spreit.
heauie sentence which we can not withstand, Who shall vs plit, forthe of thy yoke and band? hard and cruell, art thou all to
iudgement sharpe, and fearfull to considdir: Saying that mercie, ought not to be shawn, To them that is, with sinne infect and known.
All man is curst, was writtin there intill, Which did not hole the lawes charge fulfill, Who then neglectis.
they shall without remead: Condamned be, to suffre double dead, Curst be his hous, frute, corne and bestiall, That doeth not kepe, these lawes preceptes all.
Israel, considdir consequent? The lawes of God, in this his parliament, am saith he, an God right Ielous, That doeth beholde, your leuing vitious, On you shall byde, my indignatione: Vpon your sede, and generatione.
am the God, that searches thy offence, send both hunger, derth and pestilence: moue stronge warres, cruell battalles saire, kill, slaye, venge both layt and aire.
He saith not heir, he wold thy father be, To draw the forthe of: wo and miserie,
He said not heir, thy sinne wype awaye, But with great bost, and the did sraye:
His mightie tho~dring voyce, thou did heire, Then prayed thou, for terrour bread and feire, He wold not speak, but with thy trew co~ductour: Whom he prepaired, to be thy iuste instructour.
His awfull sight, did Moyses sore molest: Yet had not bene, his hindir parte celest, Where he persauit, the humble sueit visage, Of Goddes Sonne, and the perfite image, For verraye feare, he had died in that place: No man on liue, might looke him in the face.
poore Adam: who haith the wroght? Why fled thou him: that haith made the of noght? Who haith the made: so vyle and so sawaige: To slie thy makers voyce, and his langaige.
Who made the so: but sinne that rest thy force, Dishereist the, then shew thy naked corce.
Thou wold not grant, thy fault nor it declare, But thou durst by one carnall way: Excuse thy fault, and to the Lord did say, The woman that thou made, marrow vnto me, She gart me eat, the aple of the tre.
Because that sinne, was first by the committed: All thy hole raice, with ye same sinot was sinitted, Before the Law, that sinne was not exprest, But the Law made it: plane and manifest.
In syre do slepe, yet when they ar awaked: To their owne nature, incline right, their heat, they shaw ye light.
Likewise before the sinne laye as dead, And had no strength, to rise nor lift his head, But when the Law: with might and force began,
Then sinne vpstart, and he inuadid man, When he had wone: the battail and the pryse, He led man as him list, at his deuise.
And made him thrall, to all iniquitie: And made him bair, of blesse and dignitie.
For water of life, her filthie dubbis dranck: For odoriferant aire, and frutes gude: He gat but cankered mist, and scrabs rude:
For constant conscience, and tranquilitie: An trubled sprete, ful of fragillitie: This sinne, may compare to Pharo fell: That neuer wold, permit to Israel: To part nor pas, furth of that painfull place: To honour God, nor thank him of his grace.
Sinne that tyrane, to augment their wo: As sleughound tryed: their traces to and fro,
Following the footsteps, of the Law so nere: Then subtell Satan, sweftelie can appere:
Them to accuse, with visage of scorne, Was neuer sene, an monster so defornie: His vglie eine howe holked in his hede: Was like to fyrebrandes, in an furnes rede:
Ane stinking breathe, furth of his breast ran out, His the gaullis of dragons furth did spout:
His monstrous mouth, that many had opprest, Of hydra all the vennom: forthe it His silthie singers foull were fabricat: With blood of men, they were ouerspred and wat, Stryse, debait, blasphemie and occisione: With torment ire: wrothe and derisione, Inuy pride, furor: and suche an wicked meinze: war of his court, all vnder an handseinze.
That he might better, his propose fulfill, Ire frome aboue, did giue him strength at will:
And so persauing his force, great strength might, Then he began, to tempt all kinde of wight.
Satan, gart man hold as fable: The worde of God, and caused him neglect, His first command, and hold of none effect.
There was remembred, the tre of saptence, With heauy thoghtes, and grudge of conscience.
There was how Adam, interprised to be, Equall with God: his Lord in all degre: And how that he forsuke, the word deuine, And for his lust, to Satan did incline.
There was also, marked manifestlie: Fraude and dissait, proceding gre by grie: with all abuses, forfaltes and offence: That man committis, of will or negligence.
How sinne toke roote, in maunis nature humaine Is clearlie sene, and how it dois remaine, And how foolishe: and ignairs war abused,
That thoght throw ignorance, to be excused: man that is, accused of an crime,
And wold defend his cause, shulde he take syne, For aduocat, and principal His accusars companion, day and Sir Iohne is domesticall: To thy so, no officer
That haith their maister, moir seruit nor he Dar thou take suche an man of Law for the, Their neuer was man, that to him creddit gaue: But he lost their cause, did theme cleine dissaue.
Vnder whose winges, as an bie byke or hyue, Is bred all vice: in any man on liue, As Paull doeth write, if thou thyselfe abuse: Think not thy dotage, shall thy selfe excuse.
Seing ignorance, many haith deuoird, Who dotis at length, with daffing shall be sinoird.
Who will not ioine them selues, to discipline, But stil from knowledge, wisdome wil decline,
Without the Law: and be with vice inflammid, Without the Law, so shall they be condemnid.
Because the fleshe, doeth in it felfe abound: And of it selfe, from sinne can not abstene, Those ignorantes, without reasone maintene, How all that lieth not: in our fre will,
If in an harbere, among floures goode, bryeres or weides, of silth or bittirnesse: Shulee men them pluck, or lat them still incresse? By this reason, we shulde euery where, The wolfe the fox, the wod and bousteous bere,
To kill: all kinde of tender bestiall, And lat all vermine, work their naturall.
Thus when yt the fleshe, doeth in such errour raue,
The nature of the fleshe, doeth still delite: To case the selfe, and blame the holie write,
And wolde it wreist, vnto an carnal sence: Whose reasones oft are turned to offence,
Good intentes, without charitie and faith, Prouokes oftymes, Goddes yre and wraith.
Silence to all men, is conuenient, And not but why, nor wherefore to inuent Oght of our selues: that can no good considder, Seing, that it haith pleased him to confidder,
The sinnes of Adam: vpon all his raice, Is no remeid, but call on him for grace.
Then after sinne, come death right doutable, With birning brimstone: and oyles horrible, That no man might behold, for sincke and stinke, On Adam ran and said: as do thinke, Sen thou and all thy raice, haith done rebell.:
Thus death in his right hand, one coupe he bair: Full of cursing, of sorow wo and cair: With hard, and feirfull execrationes:
And with pestiferent inflammationes, For the desires of death, and his intent·
He drest him sprinkle, his poisons pestilent, On Iewe on Greke, other nation.
But where as fell, In haist they ware, so appeir, Where they with tormentes, terrours with feir:
With double dolour, and with wo tyrannicall, They harled ware, to the paines infernall.
poore Adam, take head and now beholde, How thy owne selfe, hathe the wedsett and solde:
Vnder that hard: and terrible tutoure Before the was set fyre and water pure, Thou had fre will, to chuse in to that stead,
But thou life, and chosed dead: Thou chosed thy for aye ouer the to ring, That was ouer the, bothe Lord King, To serue him as an sclaue, did the compell: And for rewarde, gat hell.
Take head, of these thy and considder, How they haue sworne, thy death all thre to gidder.
Before the coupe, of indignatione, Before the Sunne the Moone, or element,
God the Father, that is ommpotent, Disposed and wroght, thinges all and some:
As they haue bene: and as they are to come.
His elect people with grace, shall be possest, where the reprobat: neuer shall haue rest,
In hell, according to his iust With weping gnashing, and with
Thogh we our selues, can not this must we nedes beleue, it so to be,
Saying also, maker of heauen and land, Who can or may, thy riches vnderstand: How heigh, how deipe: and how inscrutable Are thy hid secrettes incomprchensable.
For thou hast thyne With all thy treasures, to be abumbrat,
Frome all dissaitfull, doctrine malignant, Ioyning them, to thy trew Churche melitant, That hathe not vainlie, taine thy talentes sweit: But haue broght forthe, thefrutes of the Spreit.
They are thy chosin: by vocatione, But not with rigour, or with violatione, Thou hast not suffred: them to be infect, Nor yet to death, nor hell to be subiect.
But hast preserued: an nombre clene ouer all That haue not bowed, their bodies vnto Baall· To them was made, the promesse infallable: Of Christ, with miracles inestimable.
To saue them all, from reprehensione, And did In his intentione: To cleith them newe, with iudgement and iustice meane with faith, their mother and nurice, with mercifull eyne, ou them did call,
With ardent loue, and petie paternall, And where they war before, with Satan solde,
For to fulfill his promesse then he wolde, Send down word, in earth vs till,
And then to make manifest, Where their shuld be, conuened from east to west, Of all nationes an Churche catholicall:
And wolde also, that the eterue purpose, Of the great and the great repose,
Shulde be confirmed, for an Testament, Abyding the ransome, and the digne payment, Of the lambes oblation, for them all:
And wolde, that the burdenes tyranicall, The decrettes: of the lawes bannishing, Shulde die in them selfe, with all manashing:
And wold that the enemies, all and some, Shulde be distroyed, vincust, and ouercome.
And wolde all thinges, shulde be pure and cleine, All Prophecies, to be fulfilled syne: Before the comming, of his word deuyne,
Bothe strong wight, permanent and glorious, By whiche the worlde, and the heauens all,
This word cled with flesh, made him readie than: To feght for loue, and libertie of man.

Follow my holie worde, and my doctrine, Nether to right hand, nor to left decline.
My worde and my command, is sufficient, Without additiones, of your owne intent,
am he, that ye shulde alwaye haue chainged, and done all thinges renew.
If ye in tymes past, were strange and nyce, And far exilid, from my Paradice,
Yet but your merite, shall of my owne grace, Restore you to the place.
Come all ye, with sinne that is vnclene, haue, with my owne pretious blood serene, An holsome bath: and stose prepaird for you, Where ye shall be, made whyte as dow:
Of all my treasures, nothing ye shall want, But as my self, thereof participant.
As aboundance of water christalline, So shall powre on you my grace deuine, Right as the oyle, was powred on Aarous head·
Which made his rayment, all in to that stead, Smell of that balme, of sauour dulce and sweit:
So shall my grace, be powred in your spreit: Which shall make, so plenteus on you rame,
That in to you, shall not be found an vaine:
Where as my holie sprite, doeth not abounde: And in my blood, your sinnes shall be Syne when it shall come to confesse in
that ye confesse in euery place, Not of your selues, but onelie of grace:
That euer was good, in warke word or thoght· Of my goodnes and grace, you it gaue, Before the tyme, ye did it aske or craue, Except by me, ye can nothing posseid,

This blessed Lord, and Sauiour most hie, Bothe heauen and earth, togidder gartagrie, In so far as the letter did conteane,
Promesse and, law, so of right shoulde perteane: The Lord shuld promesse kepe, and mercy shawe,
But man ought till obserue, and kepe the Lawe So Christ Iesus, to performe his office: For that promesse to shewe his benefice, Offred his pretious bloode, his Father till: And for oursake, hathe done the Lawfulfill.
Ended the Law, and toke an stile of newe, To be himself: our onelie Mediatour, He is that prince, that with his manlie nature, Hath vs redemed, where we were da~ned to pyne.
Giue him onelie: the gloir and to none other, He is our Lord, our Sauiour and brother.
In that diademe, may be red in faith, The lambe did meise, the Lordes ire and wraith, Where as before: could do no bloode of beist, He offred his owne bloode, as mightie preist.
But not as offred, the priestes Leuitticall, That offred for themselues, and syne for all,
Their sacrifice: nor their oblatione, Could neuer bring vs, to saluatione.
For God the Father, Lord omnipotent: Was onelie, wt his Sonnes blood content.
So Christ our Lord, was not bou~d Priest considder, But Melchisedech: high Priest King to gidder, King of all pietie, peace and equitie, And Priest that teached: the word of verritie.
And entred ones, in to the sanctuair: By his owne blood, his priesthoode to declair, Where he offred, his blessed fleshe also: Sufficient, for an thowssand worldes mo, Blood of more strength, nor the blood of
Better nor Nabothes blood, the trueth to That asked vengence, heauen to that place, To fall on Iesabell, and race.
In dyeng Christ required, with mightie voyce, Pardon to them, that did him one croyce: To death he neideth no more, him self present, That one oblatione for all: was sufficient.
For death may now, no more that lambe lambe, King, high Bischope and Preist, Betwix vs, and thy Fathers, furie stand:
The great that thou throw Christ dois haue, Then shulde thy harte, with hope and esperance:

Where their is an abou~da~ce, of ye heaue~lie bread, But allas, haue done my self misgyde, That my sinnes, theiron will not let me feid,

Perchance, he mercie will vpon me haue, trust he will me souccour, in my When with repentance, it aske and craue,
Then shall pray him that he take no heid, To my folie, nor to my wicked deid, And to my sinnes past, haue no regaird:

Syne did command, That in the booke of life And cled me with an robe, of innocence, And on my finger, put an ring of gold,
And with that hand, where the ring did repose: He gaue me bread to eat, more sweit nor rose.
Syne for my loue, the best fed calf was keild:
Which calf was Christ, our onelie stay and beild, Who said to me, my owne brother take heid, Who trustes in me, shall neuer see the deid,

Then thy right waye, shall parsaue and finde: And walk no more, stumbling as were blinde.
To vnderstand that word, shall giue me plane, If with mekenes do it humblie reid, What is the trwe meate, of an Christiane? Allanerlie since no man leues on breid,
But by the worde: which doeth of God proceid, Lord thou art high brade, lenth and latitude, Stloth serene, the pure and plesand slude.
come to the, to weshe me in that place, Thou knowes well, am the blinde man borne, Refuse me not, but grant me of thy grace,
Since for my sake thou beatten was and torne, Suffre me not, Lord, to be forlorne, Nor led with blinde, thogh blindnes desire, To go and trampe, in euerie dub and myre.

He is the bread of life, the which shall geue, Pardon of sinne, to all that will beleue.

And to saue his elect, for verye loue, He gaue him selfe, to death for their behoue.
Syne to his Apostles appeared plaine, That they might all see, his bodie visible, Syne to his Father, that is inuisible,
He ascended from them, thogh they did murne: And promest, at the last daye for to returne.
In that same bodie, that he rose from deid, Which bodie, doeth remane in heauen alwaye,
And sitteth on Godds right hand, as saith ye creid, And shall not steir, nor moue, as Paull doeth saye, Whill the last trompet sound, at domesdaye, If it so be, fleshe nor eye corruptable? May not himse, which is vncorruptable.

So by this maner, my pompes ordinair, Amendeth moir, the leuing nor the deid, For paynted tombes, torches doole nor cair, They can not clenge, the soull, nor help at neid: Their is but Christes blode, can make remeid, By liuelie faith, which purgeth man and wyfe, And yet but me. whom ye bear still at feid: Ye can not entre, intil Eternall lyfe.

Then with standards, banners harnes cleir: First all my nighbours, gart quaik and feir.
In my furie, toke the auncient towne, Of Thebes, and to the earth, kest it downe.
And subdwed, by my puyssance royall: All the cieties, of Achaye and Thessall.
The Illyriens, in the feild feghtand, Their cragges knew my sword was well sherad: With aufull terrours, all Grece to me obayed, By my great puissance, was Asia inwayed, And Lybie taken, then ouer the Phais past, Where euer was seyne, my standardes at ye last: On suche an wyse, thay doubted my puyssance, That they come trymbling, whole to my obeysance My vailzeand dedes whiche did exceirs, maid them known, to Darius king of Peirs.
Of Peirsiens, an hundreth thousand hors: And contrare me, come vnder his standardes, Thre hu~dreth thousa~d, foote me~ hardie souldartes What shall say? when we come to straikis fell, Old Charon: that great saypper is of hell.
Had muche ado ye daye, to gyde his rother, To ferrye them fro the one syde to the other: meyne ye spiretes, that doune to him send, Of them that did, aganes me contend.
In aufull battaill ouercome their fors: For all their chariottes, and bardid hors.
Aye in the hardest prese feghtand my sell, That daye of them send doune to the hell: Foure skoir a thousande soules, in an stounde, And left their bloodie bodyes, on the ground, Their great ruyne, and woundes corporall: Are recordes, of my victoures tryumphall.
will not let, to compt how in myne yre, besieged the vailzeand town of Tyre, With soir assaultes, both by sea and land, Becaus aganes me, they did withstand.
put them all to sack, and did the cietie rais, Syne passed, the myghtie mount Caucais,
Till at the last, danted all the world so, Was none theirin, that durst declair him so.
But randred whole vnto my will and mynd, In witnes Porrus, the mightie kyng of How that againes him, did preuaill: And maid him presoner, in strong battaill.
venquest him, for all his gloir and myght: And maid him thrall, to me boith day and night.
Till at the last, conquessed so longe, And cut the hard piller, that Hercules the stronge.
Maid in vaine, thinkinge it could not be out past, But breuelie to conclude, you at the last.
rayssed and conquest, all without repose, Vnto the tyme, that crewell Atropose, Ennemie to euery man, on lyfe leuand: My large power, syne toke forth of my hand, Among the mundaine people terrestriall, was holden, as an God celestiall.
My martiall dedes, that was till allowe, Caused all them, fortill beleue and trowe, That was of God Iupiter beget, My vailzeande heart, was prefixt and set, To see the whole worlde and it imbrace: If crewell death, had left me tyme and space.
But yet Mynos pray the demande, Of Hanniball, sith he doeth me vilipande.
If he thinkes on his sensuall delytes: At Capue, where his amorous appetyttes.
Was moir to Venus, and her sonne affixt: Nor euer he was with martiall dedes myxt, He thoght suche shame, to leue heir meserable That he maid his death, foull and detestable:
Willinglie he dranke, the furious poyson sell, He was homicide, and hangman of him sell, Of high honour, forsuthe he was neuer dige, Aske of Prusias, that is of Birthin king: When Hanniball, was in his glorie maist, That samyng kyng, forth of the field him cha ist, All the world knowes, how he was thrall, And subiect, to his filthie pleasures all.
By many faint, and many fals treasoune, He vsurped this name, of high renoune.
His actes in landes confes: But what are they, to speike of my proues? To all the world, it is plane euident That thoght all Ytalie, and Occident, To be of lesse valour, nor Tassallie: Or els had conquest all Ytalie, Without occicion, strife debait, or prese: Vnto the myghtie pillers of Herculese, wold not deinze me for to dissender, Allanerlie this high name Alexander.
Maid them all my subiectis, for fear and dread, Wherfore Mynos, beware and take good head: And not prefarre, his honour before myne.
Scipion My nether, think nor saye ye shing, For to be harde, nor yet till haue lowing: Throw my actes, myself for to decoire, Aboue thir vailzeand knyghtes, to haue gloire, For it is not vningloir, that desyre: But hear my life Mynos, the requyre.
When was young, lustie in my floures, detested vice, at all tyme and houres.
My heart mynde, was set without daliance, To seke the honour, that vertue doeth auance.
And compted science, to be of valor noght: Except it were with ardent mynd thoght, Inclyued till vertew, and Ciuilite, Where with conquest, all my nobilite.
But Mynos to conclude, saye the treuth, followed so vertwe, in my youthe: That was called, in my adolessance, And named, of Romains the Esperance.
When sindry Senates, had maid an band, And concluded, for fear to leaf the land, They were not willing to menteyne the weires, But with hygh curage, and yonge of yeires: Come in the Senat where they all did stand, And said these wordes, wt drawn sword in hand.
The noble name, ye hygh tryumphe gloir, That Romanis wan, of all nationes By their hygh prowes, vertwe Renoune, Shall it thus shamefullie, be castin doune: Who will on that waye, ye sentence declair· Shall be my ennemye, for euer mair.
Sayand that the Goddes, for an abuant, For their common wealth, that was to the~s: Aganest their ennemyes them to
They all maruelled, of my audacitie, In my yonge aige, my high capacitie, cause that ouer the great army Romaine, was elect and chossen chief Captaine.
Then with my belie bauners, tryumphalt, preissed fast, after this Hanniball, With litill helpe, small company or myght: gart him turne, with shame take the flyght.
At length, maid Carthage the opulent, Serue bound and thrall: to Rome the excellent: Not withstanding, all my victoryes, The Romains fand me, in their consistoryes: Als courtes and readie, at their command, As before, or that toke the sword in hand: For worldlie riches, cared nothing: The loue of the people, was my lyking.
To shew my vertue, and my ciuilitie, To yong princes, borne of nobilitie: When Carthage was wonne, vp doune soght, For all prisoners, and gart them be broght: Before me, saife and sound without dyrence, At that tyme.
toke the poete Tyrence: And captiue to Rome, him broght wt many mo, Till at the last, pleased the Romains so: That in plasne Senat, for an conquerour.
That gart Asie, and Libie haue remors, As for Egipt, and Grece, wan by fors, Aganest them, into my iust:
Or els they had, with shame taken ye And forsaken the land, for all their myght, raised the name of Romains, to auance, In Spaynge an fair cictie, named Nunance.
It were to long, O· Mynos to rehearse, My noble actes, that are put in veirse, My ennimies sand me, neuer agast, Nor yet my freindes: but humble and shamfast.
Yet aduertise the in peace nor weir, neuer miised me, to conques geir, At all tymes, my hand was so liberall, That neuer hurded treasure pecuniall.
As was geuin, the Romains to vnderstand, After my death no worldlie good they fand.
Of gold nor treasure within my boundes, Except of siluer foureskoir of poundes: For the myghtie Goddes, that are immortall, With grate me indewed, supernaturall: In my weirs, hated vice and creweltie, set vp iustice, and ciuilitie.
The furse of Bacchus, did refuse, With all the dulce pleasures, of Venuse· Who are ennimyes, at all tymes and hours, To all vailzeand, and noble Conquerours.
say not this, my self for to promote: And wold be laith, their honour for till blote, But will defend, vnto the day of dome,
Mynos ye knowe. the Romains do excell, All nations, better then my tongue can tell.
Your martiall dedes, with paines night daye, Are broght to ende, with many hard assay.
say that all conquestes vnder the sonne, Oght with reasone, and vertue to be wonne, So Scipion is worthie, that did eschewe, All kynd of vice, and followed vertue: The high tytle, of honour pretious, Before you two, that were so vitious, Wherefore we iudge, Scipion to proceid, And Alexandre: Hanniball to exceid, And yf ye thinke, our sentence importune, It is to you two, to aske of fortune, That fand her at all tymes, so fauourable, To fulfill your lustes, insaciable: That still without repose, ye thoght it good, To shed and spill, the innocentes blood: Without propose, the world to molest, Where vertue failes, reason may not rest.
FINIS BY ME, ROBERT NORVEL Epigraph: Non est mortale quod opto Psalm Epigraph: [leaf motif] werba mea auribus percipe Psalmus Vnto the wordes, that shall say, If it may pleis the, len thy care, To know the sore sighes and fear: Of my poore hart, boith nyght and day, Lord the pray.
To hear the voce, and zeill ardent, Of my distres, my God and King: My supplicatione, resing.
Befoir the day, in euerie place: To hear me, yf thy plesure be, Ilk morning, pray and ryght airlie.
Thou art the, ryghteous God bening, Thou louest not, an double man, For euill doers, neuer can: Haue residence into thy ring.
Who folehardie and wicked bene, That pleasure takes, for till offend, Ar odius, that will not amend: For such befoir the Lordis eine, Dar not be seine.
Thy fearfull yre, shall make agast, Liears, trumpours, and homicides, All suche wirkers, of wicked dedes.
The Lord that reules all, at last: Shall them out cast.
But all shy, lawes shall leir, Both heart and mynd, shall prepair, Till honour the, for euer mair: Into thy house, with heart inteir, Vnder thy feaer.
Lord my God, guyde me and conuoye, For thy goodnes, the demand, Forth of my ennimies hand: And me conduct, boith night and day, In thy right way.
No trueth is in their mouth, nor halse, Their heart, is couerd vnder cure, Their throt, an oppen sepulchure: Full of falshead, and flattrie false, Their tonge is alse.

The giftes of the Lord, are large, Vnto the iust: Sauiour, Thou couers them, with thy fauour.
For who, will them assaill or charge, Thou art their targe.

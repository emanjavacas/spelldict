Imprinted at London in Fletestrete, beneath the Conduit by Tho+mas Colwell.
NOwe forasmuche as in these latter dayes, Throughout the whole world in euery lande Vice doth encrease, and Vertue decayes Iniquitie hauynge the vpper hande.
We therfore intende, good gentle Audience, pretie short Interlude, to playe at this present Desyrynge your leaue and quiet scisence To shewe the same, as is mete and expedient.
The sume wherof, matter and argument, In two or thre verses, briefely to declare, Synce that it is for an honest intent, wyll somewhat bestowe my care.
In the Citie of London, there was a ryche man Who louynge his sonne moste tenderlye, Moued hym earnestly now and than, That he woulde gyue his mynde to studye.
Sayinge that by knowledge, scyence, and learnynge Is at the last gotten a pleasaunt lyfe: But throng he the want, and lacke of this thynge Is purchased ponertie, sorowe, and stryfe.
His Sonne notwithstandynge, this gentle monition As one that was cleane deuoyde of grace, Dyd turne to a mocke, and open derysion Moste wickedly with an bushame fast face.
In so muche that contrarye to his fathers wyll Vnto a yonge woman he dyd consente, Wherby of luste he might haue his fyll, And maryed the same in contynents.
Not longe after that, the childe began To feele his wyffes great frowardenes,
And called hymselfe vnhappye man, Oressed with paynes and heauynes.
Who before that time, dyd lyue blessedly, Whilst he was vnder his fathers wynge But nowe beynge weddyd, mournynge and myserye Dyd hym torment without endynge, But nowe it is tyme for me to be goynge, And hence to departe for a certeyne space, For do heare the Ryche man co~mynge With the wanton boye into this place.
Here the Prologue speaker goeth out, and in co~meth the Ryche man and his sonne.
LAther beseche you father, shewe me the waye What thynge were best to take in hand, Wherby this shorte lyfe so spende maye That all gryefe and trouble, myght withstande.
What is the meanynge (my chylde) the praye This question to be maunde of me? For that thynge to so, am glad alwaye Which shoulde not be greuous to the.
Marye but therfore, of you counsell take, Seynge nowe my Chyldehood, am cleane past, That vnto me ye playnely do make, What to a yongman is best for to tast.
see nothinge truely my Sonne so mete And to proue so profytable for the As vnto the Schole to moue thy feete, With studious Laddes, there for to be.
What the Scholeen aye father, naye, Go to the Schole is not the best waye,
Saye what thou lyste, for can not inuent waye more co~modyous in my Iudgement.
It is well knowne howe that ye haue loued Me heretofore at all tymes most tenderlye But now (me thynke) ye haue playnely shewed Certayne tokens of hatred For if shoulde go to my Booke after your aduyse Whiche haue spent my Chyldehood so pleasauntlye, maye then seeme dryuen out of Paradyse To take payne and woe, gryefe and myserye.
All thynges had rather sustayne and abyde The busynes of the Schole ones cast asyde, Therfore thoughe ye crye tyll ye reue asunder wyll not meddle with such a matter.
Why can not thee thus much perswade For that in my mynde is the best trade.
Whan all is saide and all is done, Concernynge all thynges both more and lesse Yet lyke to the Schole none vnder the Sonne Bryngeth to children so much heauynesse.
What though it be paynfull, what thought it be greues, For so be all thynges at the fyrste learnynge, Yet meruaylous pleasure it bryngeth vnto vs As a rewarde for suche paynes takynge.
Wherfore come of and be of good cheare And go to thy Booke without any feare For a man without knowledge (as haue read) Maye well be compared to one that is dead.
No more of the Schole, no more of the Booke That wofull worke is not for my purpose For vpon those Bookes maye not looke, If so dyd, my laboure should lose.
Why than to me thy fansye expresse That the Schole matters to the are counted werynesse
Euen as to a great man, wealthy and ryche Seruice and bondage is a harde thynge So to a Boye both dayntie and nyce Learnynge and studye is greatly displeasynge.
What my Chylde, displeasynge praye the? That maketh a man lyue so happyly.
Yea by my trouthe, suche kynde of wysdome Is to my hearte tell you, verye lothesome.
What tryall therof hast thou taken That the Scole of thee is so ill bespoken?
What tryall therof woulde ye fayne knowe? Nothynge more easye then this to showe: At other boyes handes, haue it learned, And that of those truelye most of all other Which for a certen tyme haue remayned In the house and pryson of a Scholemayster
dare well saye that there is no myserye But rather Ioye, pastyme, and pleasure Alwayes with Scholers hapynge company, No lyfe to this, the wall assure.
It is not true Father which you do saye, The contrarye therof is proued alwaye, For as the Brute goeth by many a one, Their tender bodyes both nyght and daye Are whypped and scourged, and beate lyke a stone That from toppe to toe, the sayn is awaye.
Is there not (saye they) for them in this case, Gyuen other whyle for pardone some place?
None truely none, but that alas, alas Diseases amonge them do growe apase.
For out of their backe and syde doth floe, Of verye goore bloode merueylous abundance, And yet for all that is not suffered to goe, Tyll death be almost seene in their countinaunce.
Shoulde be content then thyther to runne, Where the bloude from my breeche thus shoulde spuane, So longe as my wyttes shall be myne owne, The Scholehouse for me shall stande alone.
But am sure that this kynde of facion Is not shewed to children of honest condicion.
Of trouth with these Maisters is no dyfference For alyke towardes all, is their wrathe and violence.
Sonne in this poynt, thou art quyte deceyued And without doubte falsely perswaded For it is not to be iudged that any Scholemayster, Is of so great fiersenes and crueltye And of yonge Infantes so sore a tormenter That the breath shoulde be about to leaue the bodye.
Father this thynge coulde not haue beleued But of late dayes dyd beholde In honest mannes sonne hereby buryed Which throughe many strypes was dead and colde.
Perauenture the Childe of some disease did laboure Which was the cause of his Sepulture.
With no disease surely, was he disquieted, As vnto me it was then reported.
If that with no such thynge he were infected What was the cause that he departed.
Men saye, that of this man, his bloudy mayster Who lyke a Lyon most co~monly frowned, Beynge hanged vp by the heeles togytherÂ· Was bealy and buttocke greuouslye whipped.
And last of all (whiche to speake trembled) That his head to the wall he had often crusshed.
Thus to thynke Sonne, thou art beguyled verilye, And woulde wysshe the to suppose the contrary.
And not for suche tales my counsell to forsake Which only do couet thee learned to make.
If Demesthenes and Tully were present truely They coulde not prynt it within my head
Yet by thy fathers wyll and intercession, Thou shalt be content that thinge to pardon.
Commaunde what ye lyst, that onely excepted, And will by redy your mynde to fulfyll, But where as shulde to the Schole haue resorted My hande to the Palmer submyttynge styll.
wyll not obey ye to be playne, Thoughe with a thousande strokes be slayne.
Wo is me my Sonne, wo is me, This heauy and dolefull daye to see.
graunt in dede, am your Sonne, But you my Father shall not be, If that ye myll cast me into that pryson, Where torne in peices ye myght me see.
Where myght see the torne and rent? Lord coulde not suche a dede inuent.
Naye by the Masse, holde ye, a grote Those cruell tyrauntes cut not my throte: Better it were my selfe dyd fleye, Then they with the Rodde my flesshe shoulde fleye.
Well woulde we dyd this talke omyt, For it is lothesome to me euery whyt.
What trade then (I praye the) shall deuyse Wherof thy lyuinge at length maye aryse? Wilte thou folowe Warfare, and a Souldiour be pointed, And so amonge Troyans and Romaynes be nombred,
See ye not maysters my Fathers aduyse Haur ye the lyke at any time harde? To wyll me therto he is not wyse If my yeares and strength he dyd regarde, Ye speake worse and worse, what soeuer ye saye This maner of life is not a good waye.
For no kynde of offyce can me please, Which is subiecte to woundes and strokes alwaies.
Somwhat to do, it is mete and conueniet, Wylte thou then gyue thy dylygent endenoure To let thy youth vnhonestly be spent And do as poore knaues, which Iares do scoure? For do not see that any good Arte Or els any honest Science, or occupacion Thou wylte be content to haue a parte After thy fathers mynde and exhortacion.
Ha, ha, ha, a laboure in verye deede, God send hym that lyfe which standes in neede.
There be many fathers that chyldren haue And yet not make the worst of them a Might not you of your selfe be well a shamed Which wolde haue your sonne thyther constrayned?
woulde not haue the dryuen to that succoure, Yet for bycause the Scriptures declare, That he shoulde not eare, which wyll not laboure Some worke to do it must be thy eare.
Father, it is but a folye with you to stryue But yet notwithstandynge hope to thryue
That this thyne intente maye take good successe praye God hartely of hys goodnes.
Well, well, shall in fewe wordes reherse, What thinge doth most my Conscience perse?
Naye but praye ye without any perchaunce, Shall not my request turne to your greuannce.
If it be iust and lawfull, which thou doest requyre,
Loe this it is without further Dilacion, For so much as all yongmen for this my Beautie, As the Moone, the starres, do farre excell, Therfore out of with all spede To haue a wife (me thynke) wolde do well, For now am lyuely, and iustie, And welcome besydes to all mennes companye.
It is my chylde, what meaneth thy dotynge? Why doest thou couet thy owne vn doynge?
knowe not in the worlde howe to do the thynge That to his stomacke, maye be delyghtynge.
Why fooly she deot, thou goest about a wyfe Which is a burthen and yoke all thy lyfe.
Admyt she shall as a burthen with me remayne, Yet take one, if your good wyll attayne.
If thou were as wyse, as haue iudged the Thou woldest in this case be ruled by me.
To folowe the contrarye can not be turned My hatte theron is styflly fixed.
No, no, but about myne owne saluation: For if be helped, If were by the Masse, It is onely Maryage that brynges it to passe.
It is not the Schole, it is not the Booke, It is not Science or Occupacion, It is not to be a or Cooke Wherein is now set my consolacion.
And synce it is thus, be father content For to marye a wyfe, am full bent.
Well if thou wylt not my Sonne, be ruled But nedes wyll folowe thyne owne foolysshenes, Take hede hereafter if thou be troubled At me thou neuer seeke redresse.
For am certeyn thou canst not abyde Any payne at all, gryefe, or vexacion.
Thy Chyldhood with me so easely dyd slyde Full of all pastyme and delectacyon.
And if thou woldest folowe the Booke and learnynge, And with thy selfe also, take a wyse waye: Then thou mayst get a gentlemans lynynge And with many other beare a great swaye.
Besydes this wolde in time to come After my power, and small havylytie, Helpe the and further the, as my wysdome, Shulde me most counsell for thy Commodytie.
And such a wyfe woulde prepare for the As shoulde be vertuous, wise and honest, And gyue the wyth her after my degree, Wherby thou mightest alwayes lyue in test.
cannot, tell ye agayne, so much of my lyfe Consume at my Booke without a wyfe.
haue done to well And shewed ouer much fauoure to the, That now agaynst me thou doest rebell And for thyne owne furtheraunce wylt not agree.
Wherfore of my goodes thou gettest not a peny Nor anye succoure els at my handes For such a childe is most vnworthy To haue any parte of his fathers landes.
do not estÃ©me father your goodes or landes Or any parte of all your treasure, For iudge it ynoughe to be out of bandes And from this daye forward to take my pleasure.
Well, if it shall chaunce the thy folye to repent As thou art lyke within short space, Thynke none but thy selfe worthy to be shent, Lettynge my councell to take no place.
As touchynge that matter, wyll no man blame Now farewell father, most hartely for the same.
Rome saye rome, let me be gone My father if he lyst, shall tarye alone.
Here the Sonne goeth out and the Ryche man taryeth behinde alone.
NOwe at the last do my selfe consyder Howe great griefe it is and heuynes, To euery man, that is a Father.
To suffre his chylde to folowe wantonnes, If myght lyue a hundred yeares longer And shoulde haue sonnes and daughters many Yet for this Boyes sake, wyll not suffer, One of them all at home with me to tarye, They shoulde not be kept thus vnder my wynge And haue all that which they desyre, For why it is but theyr onely vndoynge And after the Prouerbe, we put oyle to the fyre.
Wherfore we Parentes must haue a regarde, Our Chyldren in time for to subdue Or els we shall haue them euer vntowarde, Yea, spytefull, disdaynfull, nought, and vntrue.
And let vs them chruste alwaye to the Schole Wherby at their Bookes they maye be kept vnder: And so we shall shortely their courage coole, And brynge them to honestie, vertue and Nurture.
But alas now a dayes (the more is the pytye) Science and learnynge is so lytell regarded, That none of vs all doth muse or studye To see our chyldren well taught and instructed.
We decke them, we trym them with gorgious araye We pampre and fede them, and kepe them so gaye That in the ende of all this, they be out foes.
We basse them, kysse them, we looke rounde about We merualle and wonder to see them so leaue We euer anone doe inuent and seke out, To make them goe tricksie, gallaunt, and cleane.
Which is nothyng els, but the very prouokynge To all vnthriftynes, vice, and Iniquitie, It pucteth them vp, it is an allutynge Their fathers and mothers at lengthe to defye.
Which thing myne owne Sonne doth playnely declare Whom alwayes intierly haue loued, He was so my Ioye, he was so my care That now of the same am despised.
And now he is hence from me departed, He hath no delyght with me to dwell, He is not merye vntyll he be maryed, He hath of knauetye tooke such a smell.
But yet seynge that he is my Sonne, He doth me constrayne to weepe, am not (me thynke) well, tyll be gone For this place can no keepe.
Here the Ryche man goeth out and the two Cookes co~meth in Fyrst the one and then the other.
NAke hast Blaunche Blabbe it out, come a waye For we haue ynought to do all this whole daye, Why Blaunche blabbe it out, wilt thou not come And knowest what busynes there is to be done? If thou maye be set with the pot at thy nose Thou carest not how other matters goes, Come a waye dyd the, and tarye no longer To trust to thy helpe, am much the better.
What a Murryn say, what a noyse doest thou make thynke that thou be not well in the wyrtes neuer harde man on this sorte to take With suche angry wordes, and hastie fyttes.
Why dost thou remembre, what is to be bought For the great Brydale agaynst to morowe? The market must be in euery place sought For all kynde of meates, God guye the sorow.
What ba~nyng? what cursynge? Longtong is with the made as muche spede, as coulde possyblye, wys thou mightest haue taryed for me Vntill in all pointes had ben redye, haue for thee looked full oft heretofore, And yet for all that sayde neuer the more.
Well for this ones, am with thee content So that hereafter thou make more hast, Or els tell thee, thou wylte it repent, To loyter so longe, tyll the Market be past.
For there must be bought Byefe, Veale, and Mution, And that euen such as is good and fat With Pigge, Geese, Conyes and Capon, Howe sayest thou Blaunch blabbe it out vnto that?
can not tell Lontonge, what shoulde saye Of such good cheare am so glad: That if woulde not eate all that daye My bealy to fyll, were verye made.
There must be also Fesaunte and Swae There must be and Quayle, And therfore must do, what can, That of none of all these the Gentean fayle.
saye he lookes for many thinges moe, To be prepared against to worne, Wherfore saye, hence let vs goe, My feete do stande vpon a thorne.
Naye good Long tonge, praye the ones agayne To here yet of mynde, a worde or twayne.
Come of them and speake it quicklye For what thynge it is, thou causest me ty.
Of whence is this Gentelman, yt to morowe is matried Where doth his father and his mother dwell? boue fourty myles be hath trauayled As yester nyght his Seruaunte dyd tell.
In verye dede, he commes a great waye, With my Mayster he maye not longe abyde, It hath cost hym so muche on costly araye, That Money out of his purse apase doth slyde.
They saye that his frendes be ryche and wealthy And in the Cytie of London haue their dwellynge, But yet of them all he hath no peny, To spends and bestowe here at his weddynge.
And if it be true that his Seruaunte dyd saye He hath vtterly lost his fryndes good wyll Bycause he wolde not their counsayle And in his Countrey tarye styll.
As for this woman, which hee shall marye At Sainet Albones alwayes, hath spent her lyfe thynke she be a shrew, tell thee playnely, And full of debate, malyce and stryfe.
Thoughe neuer sawe this woman before hither with him this Gentelman Yet neuertheles haue tokens in store, To iudge of a woman that is frowarde and nought.
The typ of her nose, is as sharpe as myne Her tonge and her tune is very shryll warraunt her, she commes of an And loneth to much her pleasure and wyll, What thoughe she be now so neate and so nyce, And speaketh as gentle as euer hearde: Yet yongmen which be both wyttie and wyse, Such lookes, and such wordes, shulde not regarde.
Blaunch blabbe it out, thou sayest verye true thinke thou beginnest at length to preache This thynge to me is straunge and new, To heare such a foole yongmen to teache.
foole mine owne Longtong, why calst thou me foole Thoughe nowe in the kytchyn waste the daye, Yet in tymes paste went to Schoole, And of my laten Prymer tooke assaye,
Maysters thys woman dyd take such assaye, And then in those dayes so applyed her booke, That one worde therof, she carryed not awaye, But then of a Scholer was made a Cooke.
dare saye she knoweth not, howe her Primer began, Which of her mayster she learned than.
tell the agayne, with Domine labia aperies, If nowe to heare, it be thyne ease.
How, how, with my Madaine laye in the peeas? thynke thou art mad with Domine labia aperies.
Yea mary, iudged it went such wayes, It began with laye vp the keyes.
Naye then God night, perceyue by thys geare, That none is so deafe, as who wyll not heare, spake as playnely, as coulde deuise, Yet me vnderstande, thou canst in no wyse.
Why yet ones agayne, and wyll better lysten And looke vpon the, howe thy lyppes do open.
Well marke then, and harken ones for all: Or els he are it agayne thou neuer shall, My Booke saye, began with Domine labia aperies.
Fye, fye, howe slowe am of vnderstandyngeÂ· Was it all this whyle, Domine labia aperies? Belyke haue lost my sense of hearynge,
promysse the thou semest to haue done lytell For that wote in my lyfe neuer sawe, One lyke to thy selfe, in so easye a matter.
Come on, come on, we haue almost forgotten Such plentie of victualles as we shulde bye It were almes by my trothe, thou were well beaten Bycause so longe thou hast made me tarye.
Tusshe tusshe, we shall come in very good season, If so be thou goest as fast as I, Take vp thy basket and quickely haue done We wyll be both there by and by.
for my parte wyll neuer leaue runnynge Untyll that come to the Signe of the Whitynge.
Here the two Cookes runne out and in commeth the Yongman and the Yongwoman his Louer.
WHere is my sweetynge, whom do seeke He promysed me to haue mette me here Tyll speake with him, thinke it a weeke For he is my Ioye, he is my chere.
There is no night, there is no daye But that my thoughtes be all of hym haue no delyght if he be awaye, Such toyes in my heade do euerswym.
But beholde at the last, where he doth come For whom my harte desyred longe, Now shall know all some, Orels woulde saye, had great wronge
My darlynge, my my Byrde so bryght of blee, Sweete hart saye, all haylee to thee How do our Loues, be they fast a sleepe Or the olde lynelynes, do to they styll keepe?
Do ye aske and my Loue be fast a sleepe? if a womon maye vtter her mynde, My loue had almost made me to weepe Bycause that euen now dyd not you fynde thought it surely a whole hundred yere, Tyll in this place sawe you here.
Alacke, alacke, am sorye for this, had such busines myght not come But ye maye perceyue what my wyt is, How small regarde haue and wisdome.
Wheras ye aske me concernynge my loue well assure you, it doth dayly augment: Nothynge can make me starte or moue You onely to loue is myne intent.
And as for my loue doth neuer relente, For of you do dreame, of you do thynke: To and supper, neuer went, But of Beere and Wyne to you dyd drinke.
Now of such thynhes therfore to make an ende Which pytyfull louees do cruelly To Maryage in Goddes name, let vs discende As vnto this houre we haue bene bente.
Your wyll to accomplysshe am as redye, As any woman, beleue me truelye.
This Rynge then gyne you as a token sure, Wherby our loue shall alwayes endure.
With a pure pretence your pledge take gladly For a Signe of our loue, fayth and fydelytie.
Nowe am safe, nowe am glad, Nowe do lyue, nowe do
Me thought tyll now was to sad, Wherfore sadnes flye hence agayne.
waye with those words which my father brought out waye with his saigenes and exhortacion He coulde not make me his foole or his lowte, And put me vesydes this delectacion.
Dyd he iudge that go to the Schoole, And might my tyme spende after this sorteÂ· am not his Calse, nor yet his foole, This Uirgin kysse, is my comforte.
Well than praye you let vs be maryed For me thynke from it we haue longe taryed.
Agreed my Sweetynge, it shalve then done, Synce that thy good wyll haue goten and wone.
There wolde this daye be very good theare That euery one his vealy maye fyll.
And thre or foure Minstrelles wolde be here That none in the house syt idle or styll.
Take ye no thought for abundaunce of meate That shoulde be spent at our Brydale, For there shalbe ynought for all men to eate And Minstrelles besydes therto shall not sayle.
The Cookes dare saye, a good whyle a gone With such kynde of flesshe as dyd them tell Are from the market both come home Or els my owne Conye they do not well.
knewe before that come to this place We shoulde be maryed togyther thys daye Which caused me then forth with in this case To sende for victualles or came awaye.
Wher fore then (I praye ye) shall we go to our Inne, And looke that euery thinge be made redye, Or els all is not worth a Brasse pynne, Such hast is requyred in matry monye.
thinke sixe a clocke it is, not much passed But yet to the priest we wyll make hast That accordynge to custome we maye be both coupled And with a stronge knot for euer bounde fast.
Yet ere departe, some songe wyll synge, To the intent to derlare my Ioye without feare And in the meane fyme you maye my swetynge, Rest your selfe in this lytell chayre.
Doth seeke to force my fantasye, am profest for losse or gayne, To be thyne owne assucedlye: Wherfore let my father spyte and spurne, My fantasye wyil neuer turne.
care not tho, haue no nor yet wyll flytte, As doth the water to and fro, Wherfore let my father spyte and spurur, My fantasye wyll neuer turne.
For am set and wyll not swerue, Whom spytefull speache remoueth nought And synce that thy grace deserue, count it is not derely bought, Wherfore let my father spyte and spurne, My fantasie wyll neuer turne.
Who is afraydelet you hym flye, For shall well abyde the brunte: Mangre to bys lyppes that lysteth to lye Of busye braynes as is the wonte.
Wherfore let my father and spurne, My fantasye wyll neuer turne.
Who therat to or loure am not be that doth retche There is no payue that hath the power, Out of my orest your loue to fetche, Wherfore let my father spyte and spurne, My fantasye wyll neuer turue. for wheras he moued me to the Schoole, And onely to folowe my Booke and learnenynge: He coulde neuer make me such a foole, With all his softe woordes, and fayre speakynge.
Wherfore let my father spyte and spurne, My wyll neuer turne.
This Mynion here, this myneing Trull, me wore a thousande folde: Then all the earthe that is so full.
Wherfore let my father spyre and spurne, My fantasye wyll neuer turne.
What soeuer dyd, it was for her sak It was for her soue, and onely pleasure, counte it no laboure, such laboure to take, In gettynge to me so hyghe a treasure.
Wherfore let my father spyte and spurne, My fantasie wyll neuer turne.
This daye intended for to be mery, Althoughe my harde Father be farre hence.
knowe no cause for to be beuye, For all this coste and great expence.
Wherfore let my father spyte and spurne, My fantasye wyll neuer turne.
How lyke ye this songe, my owne swete Rose, Is it well made for our purpose? The yong woman.
neuer harde in all my lyfe a better, More pleasmante, more meete for the matter, Now let vs go then, the mornynge is nye gone We can not any longer here remaine:
Farewell good Masters eueryechone, Tyll from the Churche we come agayne.
Here they go out, and in commeth the Priest along.
Syrs, by my trouthe it is a worlde to see, The excedynge negligence of euery one.
Euen from the hyest to the lowest degree, Both goodnes and conscience is cleane gone.
There is a youge gentelman in this towne, Who this same daye now must be maryed: Yet thoughe woulde bestowe a Crowne, That knaue the Clarke can not be spyed.
For he is safe if that in the Alehouse, He maye syt typlyng of Nut browne Ale: That oft be commes foorth as dronke as Mouse, With a nose of his owne not greatly pale, And this is not once, but euery daye, Almost of my faith, throughe out the whole yeare, That he these trickes doth vse to playe, Without all shame, dreable and feare.
He knoweh him selfe that yester nyghte, The sayde yonge gentelman came to me, And then desyred, that he myght This mornynge beiymes maryed be.
But now doubte it wyll be hye noone, Ere that this bufynes be quite ended: Vnlesse the knauys she foole come very soone, That this same thinge maye be dispatched, And therfore synce that this noughty pache, Hath at this present me thus serued.
He is like hence forwarde my good wyll to lacke Orels myght be iudged.
am taught hereafter, howe such a one to trust, In day matter concernynge the Churche, For if shulde, perceyue that must, Of owne honestie loose verye much.
And yet for all this, from weeke to weeke, For his stypende and wages he neuer cryeth, And for the same contynually doth seeke, As from tyme to tyme playnely appeareth, But whyther his wages he hath deserued, Vnto you all do me reporte, Since that his duetie he hath not fulfylled, Nor to the Churche wyll scant resorte.
That many a tyme and oft, am fayne To playe the Priest, Clarke, and all Thoughe thus to do, it is great payne, And myre warde but very small, Wherfore (God wyllynge) wyll such order take, Before thou be many dayes elder, That he shalbe glad this towne to forsake And learne euermore to please his better.
And in such wyse all they shall be vsed, Which in this pacysshe entende to be Clarkes, Great it were, the Churche shoulde be disordered Bycause that such Swylbowles do not their warkes.
And to saye trueth, in many a place, And other great townes besyde this same, The Priestes and Parishioners be in the lyke case, Which to the Church wardens maye be a shame.
Haw shulde the Priest his offyce fulfyll, Accordyngly as in dede he ought?
When that the Clarke wyll haue a selfe wyll And alwayes in Seruice tyme must be sought? Notwithstandynge at this present there is no remedy But to take tyme, as it doth fall, Wherfore wyll go hence and make me ready For it helpeth not to chafe or brall.
Here the Priest goeth out, and in commethe the rych man.
LOmmynae this daye foorth of my Chambre, Euen as for water to wasshe dyd call, By chaunce espyed a certayne straunger, Standynge beneath within my Hall.
Who in very deede came from the Inholder Wheras for a tyme my Sonne dyd lye, And sayde that his mayster had sent me a letter And bade hym to brynge it with all spede possyblye.
Wherin he did write that as this daye That my Sonne to a certein Mayde, Shoulde then be wedded, without further delaye, And bath borowed more than wyll be payde.
And synce that he harde, he was my Sonne, By a Gentelman or two, this other daye: He thought that it shoulde be very well done, To let me haue knowledge therof by the waye.
And wylled me if that woulde any thynge Of hym to be done of me in this matter: That then he his Seruaunt such worde shulde brynge As at his commynge he might do hereafter.
bade hym thanke his Mayster most hattelye And sent hym, by hym a peece of Venison:
For that he vouchesaued to wryte so gentely, Touchynge the marying and state of my Sonne, But notwithstandynge sent hym no Money, To paye such Dettes as my Sonne dyd owe, Because he had me forsaken vtterly, And mee for his good Father wolde not knowe, And sayde that with hym woulde not make, From that daye forwarde, burynge my life But as he had brewed, that so be shulde bake, Synce of owne choosynge, he gat him a wife.
Thus his Seruaunte from the departed Into my Chambre went agayne, And there a great whyle pitterly weeped, This to me was so great payne: And thus with these wordes began to mone, Lamentynge and mournynge my selfe all a lone.
wadnes, dotynge of those yonge folke my es without wytte, aduyse, and discretion, With whom their can beare no stroke In first Matrimoniall coniunction They knowe not what myserye griefe and vnquietnes Wyll hereafter ensue, of their extreme foolysshenes, Of all such laboures, they be cleane ignorant, Which in the nourysshynge and kepynge of Chyldren their great charges, it is conuenient Either of them hencefoorth to sustayne: Concernynge expences bestowed in a howse They as lyttell as doth the Mowse.
On the one syde, the wyfe wyll brall and scolde, On the other side the Infant wyll crye in the Cradell: Anone when the Chylde wareth somwhat olde, For meate and drynke, he begynnes to babbell.
Herevpon commeth it, that at markettes and fayres Husbande is forced to bye many wares.
Yet for all this hath my foolysshe Sonne As wyse a Wodcocke, without any wytte, Despysynge his Fathers mynde and opynion, Maryed a wyfe for hym most vnfyete, Supposynge that myrth to be eueciastynge, Which then at the fyrste was greatly pleasynge.
How they two wyll lyue, can not tell, Wherto they maye trust, they haue nothynge My mynde me, that they wyll come dwell, At length by their father for wante of lyuings, But my Sonne doubtles, for any thynge that knowÂ· Shall reape in such wyse as he dyd sowe, True he shall fynde, that dyd wryte Who sayde with a wyfe are two dayes of pleasure The first is the ioye of the Maryage daye and nyght The seconde to be at the wyfes Sepulture: And this by experience he shall proue true, That of his Brydale great euyiles do ensue.
And (as suppose,) it wyll proue in his When he shall wysshe that to him it maye chaunce, Which vnto Eupolis and also his wife, The nyght they were wedded, fell for a vengeaunce Who with the heuy thyne of the Gedde were As the Poet Ouid in these two Uerses makes playne, Si tibi coniugii nox prima, nouissima vite, Eupolis, hoc periit, noua nupta modo.
Ouidius wrytinge agaynst one Ibis his enemye That the fyrst night of his Maryage dyd wysshe The last of his lyfe myght be certenly.
For so (quod he) dyd Eupolis and hys wife perysshe.
Yet to my Soone praye God to sende Because thervnto me Nature doth bynde: Thoughe he hath offended, a better ende, Then Eupolis and his wyfe dyd fynde.
And nowe shall longe euer anone, Tyll some of those quarters come rydynge hyther, Vnto the which my Sonne is gone, To knowe how they do lyue togyther.
But am fastynge, and it is almost noone And more than tyme that had dyned: Wherfore from hence wyll go soone, thinke by this tyme, my meate is burned.
Here the Ryche man goeth out, and in co~meth the yongman his sonne with the yong woman, beynge both maryed.
Lorde wath pleasures and great commodytie, Are heaped togyther in Matrimonye?
Howe vehement, howe stronge a thynge loue is? Howe many smyrkes, and dulsome kysses?
The man with the wyfe is wholly delyghted And with many causes to laughter enforced.
Whan they two drynke, they drynke togyther They neuer eate, but one wyth another.
Somtymes to their Garden foorth they walke And into the fyeldes somtymes they go, With mery trickes, and gestures they talke As they do moue their feete to and fro.
Somtymes they ryde into the Countrey Passynge the tyme wyth mirth and sporte, And when with their fryndes, they haue ben meryeÂ· Home to their owne house they do resorte.
Somtymes abrode they go, to see playes, And other trym syghtes, for to be holde: When often they meete in the hye wayes Muche of their aquaintaunce they knewe of olde.
Sometymes to the Churche, they do repayre To here the Sermon that shalbe made: Thoughe it to remembre, they haue small care, For why? they be now, but fewe of that trade.
Somtymes at home, at cardes they playe Somtymes at this game somtymes at that They nede not with sadnes to passe the daye Nor yet to syt styll, or stande in one plat.
And as for vs wyfes, occasions do mone, Somtymes with our Gossyppes to make good cheare Or els we dyd not, as dyd vs behoue, For certayne daies and weekes in the years.
thynke that a man might spende a whole daye Declarynge the Ioyes, and endles blys: Which maryed persones receyue alwaye, If they loue faythfullye, as meete it is.
Wyues can not choose, but loue earnestlye If that their Husbandes do all thynges well Or eies my sweete harte, we shall espye, That in quietnes they can not dwell.
If they do not, it maye be a shame For loue you hartele you assure: Or els were truely greatly to blame Ye are so louynge, so kynde, and demure.
trust that with neither hande or foote, Ye shall see any occasion by mee: But that loue you euen from the harte roote And durynge my lyfe so intende to be,
Who then merye Maryage can disco~mende And wyll not with Aristotle in his Ethickes agreeÂ· But wyll saye, that myserye is the ende When otherwyse fynde it to be: man wyll marye a wyfe As the Phylosopher makes declaration, Not onely to haue chyldren by his lyfe, But also for lyuynge, helpe, sustentacion.
Who wyll not with Herocles playntly confesse, That Mankynde to Societie is wholly And in this Societie neuerthelesse: Of worthy Wedlocke tooke the begynnynge.
Without the which, no Cytie can stande Nor Housholde be perfecte in any lande.
Pythagoras, Socrates, and Crates also Whiche truely were men of very small Substaunce As harde my father tell longe ago, Dyd take them wyfes with a safe conscience: And dwelled togyther, supposynge that they Were vnto Philosophy, nother stoppe nor staye.
The Wyfe. yea what can be more accordynge to kynde Then a man to a woman hym selfe to bynde?
Awaye with those therfore that Mariage despyst And of daungers therof inuent many lyes.
But what is he that commeth yonder, Do ye not thinke it is our man? Somewhat there is that he hasteth hyther, For he makes asmuche speed as he can.
Here the Seruaunte of the Kyche mannes Sonne co~meth in, with an errande to his Mayster.
Mayster there is a Straunger at home He wolde very fayne with you talke:
For vntyll that to hym you do come Forth of the doores he wyll not walke.
Come on then my wyfe, if it be so, Let vs departe hence for a season: For am not well tyll do knowe Of that mannes commynge the very reason.
Here they both go out, and their Seruaunt doth tary behind alone.
Let them go bothe, and do what they wyll And with communicacion fyll their bealy: For by Sainct George wyll tary here styll, In all my lyfe was neuer so werye.
haue this daye fylled so many Pottes With all maner wyne, Ale, and Beere: That wysshed their bealyes full of Bottes Longe of whom was made suche cheare.
What kyndes of meate, both flesshe and fyshe Haue poore knaue to the table caryed? From tyme to tyme dysshe after dysshe, My legges from goynge neuer ceased.
What runnynge had for Apples and Nuttes? What callyng for Biskettes, Cumfettes and Caroweies? vengeaunce sayde I, lyght on their guttes That makes me to turne so many wayes.
What cryinge was there for Cardes and Dice? What coystynge, what rufflynge made they within? counted them all not greatly wyfe.
What bablyng, what ianglynge was in the house? What quaffyng, what bybbyng with many a Cuppe? That some laye alonge as dronke as a Mouse Not able so much as their heades to holde vp.
What daunsynge, what leapyng, what iumpyng about From benche to benche, and stoole to stoole? That wondered their braynes dyd not fall out When they so out ragiously playde the foole.
What iuglyng was there vpon the boordes? What thrustyng of knyues throughe many a nose What bearinge of Formes? what holdinge of Swordes? And puttynge of Botkyns throughe legge and hose? Yet for all that they called for dryncke, And sayde that they coulde not playe for drye That many at me dyd nodde and wynke Bycause shoulde brynge it by and by, How so euer they sported the pot dyd styll walke If that were awaye, then all was lost: For euer anone the Iugge was their talke, They paste not who bare such charge and coste.
Therfore let hym looke his Purse be ryght good, That it may discharge all that is spente, Or els it wyll make hys haere growe through his hood There was suche hauocke made at this present, But am afearde my maister be angrye That dyd abyde thus longe behynde: Yet for his angre passe not greatly, His wordes they be but onely wynde, Now that haue rested so longe in this place Home warde agayne.
Here the Seruaunte goeth out, and in co~meth fyrst the Wyfe, and shortely after the Husbande.
WHere is my Husbande, was he not here? meruayle much whyther he is gone Than perceyue am much the nere, But where he commeth hyther alone.
Wot ye what Husband, from daye to daye, With dayntye dysshes, our bodyes haue bene fylled: What meate to nexte shall we assaye? Wherby we may then be both refresihed.
Do ye nowe prouyde and gyue a regarve For Victualles hereafter to be preparde?
But that knowe Husbande, it lyeth vs in hande Of thynges to come to haue a consyderation would not ones wyll you to vnderstande Aboute such busynes my carefull prouision: It is nedefull therfore to worke we make hast That to get both our lyuynges we may knowe the cast.
To trouble me nowe, and make me vexed, This mischieuous meane hast thou inuented.
What trouble for thee? what kynde of vexation? Have to disquiet thee, caused at this present? My onely mynde is, thou make expedycion To seke for our profyte as is conuenient.
Wherfore to thee saye ones agayne, Bycause to take paynes thou art so lothe, By Christ it were best, with might and mayne To fall to some worke, sweare a great othe.
Yet for a tyme, if it maye thee please Let me be quit, and take myne ease.
Wilt thou haue vs then throughe hungre he starued: The Husbande.
Then saye then, this geare go about, And looke that thou laboure diligently: Or els thou shalt shortly proue without doubt, Thy sluggysshnes wyll not please me greatly.
Begynnest thou euen now to be paynefull greuous And to thy Husbande, a woman so troublous?
What wordes haue we here thou misbegotten, Is there not alredy ynoughe to the spoken?
myrth, Ioye, pastyme and pleasure, How lyttell a space, do you endure?
see my co~maundement can take no place, Thou shalt abye therfore, sweare by the Masse.
Here the Wyfe must stryke her Husbande handesomlye aboute the Shoulders with some thyng.
Alas good wyfe, good wyfe, alas, alas, Stryke not so harde, praye thee hartelye, Whatsoeuer thou wylte haue brought to passe It shalbe done with all spede possyblye.
Laye these Faggottes man vpon thy shoulder And carye thys wood from streete to strete: To sell the same, that we both togyther, Our lyuynge may get, as is most mete.
Hence Nidiot hence, without more delaye What meanest thou thus, to stagger and staye?
Lorde what howe myserable men be those Whiche to their wyfes as wretches be wedded And haue them conty nually their mort all foes Seruynge them thus, as Slaues that he hyred.
Nowe by experience true do fynde, Whiche oftentymes vnto me heretofore My father dyd saye, declarynge his mynde That in Matrymonie was payne euermore, What shall do most pityfull Creature? Iuste cause haue alas to lament: That franticke woman my death wyll procure If so he this daye without gayne be spent For vnlesse for my wood som Money be taken Lyke a dogge, with a Cudgell shalbe beaten.
Ho thou good felowe which standest so nye Of these heauy bundelles ease my sore backe: And somewhat therfore gyue me by and by Or els dye, for Syluer do lacke.
Nowe that haue some Monye receyued For this my burden home wyll go: And lest that my wyfe be discontented, What haue take, wyll her showe.
Wyfe am come, went a longe waye And here is the profyte, and gaynes of this daye.
Why thou Lowte, thou foole, thou horson folte, Is this thy wood money, thou peuisshe Dolte? Thou shalt smart for this geare, make God a vowe Thou knowest no more to sell wood, then doth the sowe
By Goddes precious wyll not vnwysely suffes To do as haue done, any longer.
Why doest thou ryse against me Villayne? Take hede scrache not out thy eyes twayne.
Scratche and thou dare, for haue a knyfe, Perchaunce wyll ryd the of thy lyfe.
Slaye me with thy knyfe, thou shytten Dastarde? Doest thou thinke to fynde me suche a Dissarde? By Coxe bones wyll make thy skyn to rattell, And the braynes in thy more depely to sattell.
Here the wyfe must laye on lode vppon her Husbande.
Good wyfe be content, forgeue my this faulte wyll neuer agayne do that which is naught.
Go to foolysshe Calfe, go to, and vpryse, And put vp thy knyfe, the aduise.
mercyfull God, in what lamentable state Is he, of whom the wyfe is the mayster? Wolde God had bene predestinate, On my Maryage daye, to haue dyed wyth a Feuer.
wretched creature, what maye do? My grieuous wyfe shall returne vnto? Lo wyfe beholde without further delaye The water ye sent for, here do brynge.
What what meaneth this weepynge? What ayleth the to make all this cryinge?
No, nor thou wilte not, if thou haste any wye, It is not thy weepynge, that can ought auayle, And therfore this matter no longer be wayle.
Come of saye, and runne to the Ryuer And wasshe these clothes in the water.
howe vnhappye and eke vnfortunate Is the moste parte of maryed mennes condytion? woulde to death had bene agate When my Mother in be arynge me made lamentation.
What shall do whyther shall turne, Most carefull man nowe vnder the Skye? In the flamynge fyre, had rather burne,
Then with extreme payne, lyue so heauylye, There is no wyfte, to my wyfe must go Whom that dyd wed, am fullo.
Where are ye wyfe, your clothes are washte cleane Is whyte as a lylly without spot or ueyne.
Thou thefe, thou caytyfe, why is not this place, Wasshed as fayre as all the rest, Thou shalt for this geare now smoke apase By gys sweare, thou brutysshe Beaste.
Alas, alas, am almost quyte dead, My wyfe so pytyfully hath broken my head.
Here her Husbande must lye alongs on the grounde as thoughe hee were fore beaten and wounded.
Well perceyue, the ryme wyll awaye And into the Countrey to go haue promysed Looke therfore thou go not from hence to days Tyll home agayne am returned.
Take hede saye, this Howse thee retayne, And styrre not for any thynge out of my doore: Vntill that come hyther agayne, As thou wylte be rewarded therfore.
Here his Wyfe goeth out, and the Husbande taryeth behinde alone.
The slyinge and fiende go with my wyfe And in her Iourney ill maye she speede: praye God almighty to shorten her lyfe The earth at no tyme doth beare suche a weede.
Althoughe that be a Gentelman borne And come by my Auncetours of a good blood, Yet am lyke to weare a Cote torne And hither and thither go catye wood.
But rather then this lyfe wyll abyde To morowe mornynge do intende, Home to my Father agayne to ryde, If some man to me his Horse wyll lende.
She is to her Gossypes gone to make mery, And there she wyll be for three or foure dayes: She cares not thoughe do nowe miscarye And suffre such payne and sorowe alwayes.
She leaueth to me neyther Breade nor drynke But such as iugde no bodye wolde eate: myght by the wailes lye dead and stynke For any great holsomnes in my meate.
She walketh a brode, and taketh her pleasure Her selfe to cherysshe is all her care: She passeth not what griefs endure, Or howe can lyue with noughty fare: And synce it is so, without further delaye To my father to morowe wyll awaye.
HO, ho, ho, what a felowe am I? Geue row me saye both more and lesse: My strength and power hence to the Skye No eacthly tonge can well expresse.
Oh what inuencious, craftes and wiles, Is there conteyned within this head? knowe that he is within fewe myles Which of the same is throughly sped.
Oh, it was all my studye daye and nyght Co~nyngly to brynge this matter to passe: In all the earth, there is no wighte But can make to crye alas.
This man and wyfe, that not longe agoe Fell in this place togyther by the eares: It was onely that this stryfe dyd sowe And haue bene aboute it certayne yeares.
For after that had taken a small: Of their good wyll and feruent loue, My thought shulde not tary in hell But vnto debate them shortely moue, Oh it was that made hym to despyse All wisdome, goodnes, vertue and learnynge That be afterwarde coulde in no wise Ones in his harte fancie teachynge.
Oh it was I, that made hym refuse The holsome menytion of his Father dere And caused hym styll of a wyfe to muse As thoughe she shoulde be his ioye and there.
Oh it was I, that made hym goe hence, And suppose that his father was verye vnkynde, It was I, that dyd oryue hym to such expence,
And nowe that haue this busynes ended And ioyned hym and his wise togyther: thynke that haue my part well played, None of you all wolde do it better.
Ho, ho, ho, this well fauoured heads of myne What thynge soeuer it hath in hande: Is neuer troubled with Ale or Wyne, Neyther by Sea, nor yet by lande.
tell you am a meruaylous bodye, As any is at this daye lyuynge: My head doth deuyse eche thynge so trymly, That all men maye wonder of the endynge, Oh haue such fetches, such toyes in this head Such crafty deuyses and subtyll trayne: That whom so euer of you do wed, ye are lyke at my handes to take small gayne.
There is no gentelman, knyght, or Lorde: There is no Duke, Earle, or kynge: But if lyst, can with one worde, Shortly sende vnto their lodgynge.
Some disquiet with Coueitousnes, Some with wrath, pryde and lecherye, And some do thruste into suche distresse That he feeleth onely payne and myserye.
Some allure to haue theire delyght Alwayes in Glotonye, Enuye and murdre: And those thynges to pracise with all theyr might Either by lande, or els by water.
Ho, ho, ho, there is none to be compared, To me tell you, in any poynte: With a great sorte my selfe haue tryed,
And when for a longe tyme we had wrestled And shewed our strength on eyther syde, Yet often tymes a fall they receyued, When throughe my Polycye their feefe dyd slyde.
Wherfore (my dere children) warne ye all, Take hede, take hede of my temptation: For co~menly at the last haue the fall And also brought to Desperacion.
Oh it is a forye for many to stryue And thynke of me to get the vpper hande: For vnlesse that God make them to thryue They can not agaynst me sticke or stande.
And thoughe that God on haue his domynion And ruleth the worlde euery where: Yet by your leaue, haue a porcion, Of this same earth that standeth here.
The kyngdome of God is aboue in Heauen And myne is tell you beneth in Hell: But yet a greater place if he had delt euen He shulde haue gyuen me and myne to dwell, For to my Palace of euery Nation Of what degree or birth so euer they be.
Come runnynge in with such festination, That other whyles they amased me, Oh all the Iewes, and all the Turkes, Yea and a great parte of Christen dome When they haue done my wyll, and my workes In the ende they flye hither all and some.
There is no miunte of the daye There is no minute of the nyghte: But that in my Palace there is alwaye
Crowdynge togither a meruaylous sighte, They come on thicker, then swarmes of Bees, And make such a noyse and cryinge out: That many a one lyeth on his knees, With thousandes kept vnder, and closed about Not so much as my parlours, halles, and euery chamber By Porches, my galeryes, and my courte: My entryes, my kytchyn, and my Larder, But with all maner people be fylled throughout.
What shall saye more, can not tell, But of this (my chyldren) am certayne, There comes more in one houre vnto Hell, Then vnto Heauen, in a moneth or twayne.
And yet for all this, my Nature is such That am not pleased with this company, But out of my kyngdome must walke muche That one or other maye take tardye, Ho, ho, ho, am neuer ones afrayde With these my Clawes you for to touche, For wyll not leaue tyll you be payde, Suche treasure, as is within my Pouche.
The worlde is my Sonne, and ame his Father And also the flesshe, is a doughter of myne It is alone, that taught them to gather, Both Golde and Syluer that is so fyne.
Wherfore suppose that they loue me well And my Co~maun dementes gladly obaye, That at the last then vnto Hell, They maye come all the redy waye.
But now (I knowe) synce came hither There is such a multitude at my gate,
That must agaynt repayre downe thyther After myne olde maner and rate.
Here the Deuyll goeth out, and in co~meth the Rychmans Sonne alone.
HOwe glad am I, that my iourney is ended, Which was about this whole dare? My Horse to stande styll neuer sufferd, Because woulde come to the ende of my waye, But yet am sorye that can not fynde, My louynge Father at home at hys place: That vnto hym maye breake my mynde, And let hym knowe my myserable case.
Here he confesseth his noughtynes vitring the same with a pitifull voi.
haue ben wylde, haue ben wanton, haue euer folowed my fancye and wyll: haue ben to my Father a frowarde Sonne And from daye to daye contynued styll.
haue alwayes proudlye dysdayned those That in my madnes gaue me good counsell counted them most my mortall foes, And stowtely agaynst them dyd rebell.
The thynge that was good, greatly hated As one which lacked both wytte and reason, The thyng that was euyll euer loued Which now see is my confusyon.
coulde not abyde of the Schole to heare Maysters and teachers my harte abborred,
We thought the Booke was not fyt geare, For my tendeer fyngers to haue handled, counted it a pleasure to be daintely fed And to be clothed to costly artaye: woulde most co~monly slugge in my bed, Vntyll it were verye farre forth daye.
And to be shorte, anone after this, Ther came such fansies in my brayne: That to haue a wyfe whom might kysse rekened to be the greatest gaine.
But yet alas was quyte deceyued The thynge it selfe doth easely appeare: woulde alas had ben buryeb, When to my Father, gaue not eare.
That which had, haue cleane spent, And kept so much ryot with the same: That now am fayne, a Cote that is rent At as to weare for verye shame.
haue not a crosse lefte in my purse, To helpe my selfe nowe in my nede: That well am worthye of Goddes curse, And of my Father to haue small mede.
THere the Ryche man must be as it were co~mynge in.
But excepte me eyes do we beguyle, That man is my Father, whom do see: And now that he comes, without crafte or wyle, To hym will hende on eyther knee.
Ah myne owne chylde, with the what there? The Sone.
At the fyrst tyme ye studied to sattell, Most true alas, do them fynde, As thoughe they were written in the Gospell.
Those wordes my Sonne, haue almost forgotten, Stande vp therfore, and kneele no longer: And what it was spake so often, At two or there wordes, recyte to thy Father.
If that ye be Father well remembred As the same beleue ye can not forget: You sayde that so soone as were maryed, Much payne and trouble therby shoulde get.
Haste thou by proofe soone, this thynge tryed? The Sonne.
Yea, alas to much haue experyenced: My wife, dyd wed, all full of frensye, My selye poore shoulders, hath now so broused, That lyke to a Creple, mone me weakly, Beynge full often with the staffe thwacked: She spareth no more my flesshe and bone, Than if my bodye were made of Stone, Her wyll, her mynde, and her Co~maundement, From that daye hyther, haue fulfylled: Which if dyd not, was bytterly shent, And with many strokes grenously punysshed: That woulde God the houre when was maryed, In the midste of the Church might haue fynked.
thynke ther is no man vnder the Sonne That here on the earth beareth lyfe: Which wolde do such drudgerye, as haue done,
At the vnkynde wordes of suche a wyfe, For howe was vsed, and in what wyse daye to declare wyll not suffyse.
Yf this be not true, as haue spoken To my good neyghbours me reporte, Who ether whyles when was smytten My wyfe to be gentle, dyd then exhorte: For glad was to abyde all laboure Wherby the lesse might be my doloure.
Wherfore good Father you humblye desyre To haue pitye of me and some compassion? Or els am lyke to lye fast in the myre, Without any succoure or consolation: For at this houre haue not a peny, My selfe to helpe in this great myserye.
For so muche as by my aduyse and counsell In no maner wyse thou woldest be ruled: Therfore to the can not do well, But let the styll suffre, as thou haste deserued For that thou hast suffred, is yet nothynge To that trybulation which is behinde co~mynge.
Alas Father, what shall do? My wyttes of them selues can not deuyse, What thynge were best to goe vnto, Wherof an honest lyuynge maye aryse: Wherfore gentle Father in this distresse, Somewhat aswage myne heuynes.
What shoulde do can not tell, For now that thou hast taken a wyfe
With me thy father thou mayst not dwell, But alwayes with her spende thy lyfe.
Thou mayst not agayne thy wyfe forsake, Which durynge lyfe to the thou dydst take.
Alas am not able thus to endure Thoughe therunto were neuer so wyllynge: For my wyfe is of such a crooked nature As no woman els, is this daye lyuynge, And if the verye trueth shall confesse She is to me an euyll that is endlesse.
If that thou thinkest thy selfe alone Onely to leade this yrkesome lyfe.
Thou maiest learne what griefe, sorowe and mone, Socrates had with Xantippa his wyfe.
Her Husbande full ofte she tawnted and checked And as the Booke saythe vnhonestly mocked.
can not tell, what was Socrates wyfe But myne do knowe alas to well, She is one that is euermore full of stryfe And of all Scolders beareth the Bell.

IOHN PENRY DOO HEARE AS SHALL ANSWERE BEFORE THE LORD MY GOD IN that great day of Iudgement set downe sumarily the Whole truth and nothing but the truth which hold and professe at this hower eyther in regard of my faith towards my God and Dread Soueraigne Queene Elizabeth unto whome only of all the potentas In the world owe all reuerente, dutie and submission in the Lord.
FIr&st because my allegeance vnto her Majesties: is cheifly called In question that am not at this day nor yet euer was in all my life eyther guilty or priuie in any purpose consultation or intent of any sedition against or disturbance of her Majesties Royall state a~d peaceable government.
And if were priuie vnto any such godlese wicked and vndutifull actions or purposes as might any ways impayre or disquiet the peaceae+ble state of my native prince and countrie would reveale disclose and withstand the same to the vtmost of my power in all persons both foraigne and domesticall of what prossession or religion soever they be.
Her supreance authorite within her realmes and dominio~s acknowledge to be such over all persons in all causes as no person eyther ciuill or ecclesiastical may exempt himselfe or his cause from the power and censure of her lawes and sword.
doe also ackno+wledge that her Majestie hath full authorite from the Lord by hir Royall power to establishe and enact all lawes both ecclesiasticall and ciuill among hir subiectes: In the making whereof the Lord requireth that hir eclesiasticall be warented by his writte~ word wich expressely conteyneth whatsoever belongeth to his worship: her ciuill to be gronded vpon the rules of common iustice and equitie the wich boundes are so farr from diminishing from the authoritie of kings and princes as they are the onely inexpugnable waies therof.
This soueraigne prerogatiue authority of her hignes am most willingly reddy to deffend and maintaine against all the estates persons and creatures vnder heaven to the losse of my life te~ne tousandes tymes if it should be neefull.
And take the lorde to record that that day to my knowlege hath not passed over my head a~ sure since the first that the lord vnder her gratious raigne broght me to the knowledge of the truth wherein have not or doe not pray for the blessings of my God both outoward inward to be powred with afull horne vpo~ hir right excelle~t Maiesties Throne Regime~t domini+ons for ever ever: And that he would eyther co~uert or spedily overthrowe In his wrath all his and hir ennaemies with their entreprises whether they be home or foraigne Herof cal the searcher of hartes as In wittnes of truth against my owne soule if eyther disse~ble or forge in the premises.
Secondly touching my faith doe beleve with my hart and co~fess· with my tongue that ther is no God but the true God only which that written word reacheth to be one in substance and three in person the father the so~ne and the holy gost three distinct persons of one and the selfe same substance.
This most high God who also is my God in Christ Iesus veleeve to be the creator preseruer maintainner soueraigne Lord and supreame commander of all creatures In heave~ and in earth men and Angels both good and bad.
doe beleeve that nothing doth or can comme to but by the fore anointed and determinate wil purpose
onely by grace the sufferings and reghteousnes of Christ Iesus apprehended by true faith.
Christ Iesus In regard of his natures beleve to be God man even God alone blessed for ever more: And in respect of his offices to be the onely king Priest And Prophet of his Church the which offices he so fully acco~pisshed In the dayes of us flesh by the ma+nifesting of the wholle will of his father thorough his preaching teaching the full redemption of his Chuch by his death and resurrction: and recaving full absolute power in heaven and in earth from his father in such sorte as he is not to reteine a successor in any of these his offices but is consecrated alone to them all for euer more.
True faith beleeve to be the persuasion of the harte where by the soule is truly assured of remission of sinnes and Imputation of righteosnes thorough Christ.
This true faith belo~geth onely to Gods elect and hath perseuerance vnto the end· with this true faith also is vnseparably ioined (as the frut thereof) a dying vnto sinne: and a living vnto righteousnes in such sorte as the me~bers of Christ have a continuall battel in them against sinne. the wich by the power of Christs death is so wounded and in some measure decayeth more and more in them vntil at lngth it shall be vtterly consumed whe~ the bodies and soules be separated and not bfore.
By the quickninge power of Christ (I do beeleeue) that his here vpo~ earth are drawne more and more to like his blessed will and to practise the same yea to give their liues rather then to dishonor their God in the will and voluntary deniall of his truth and the breach of his lawes and wil in any point revealed vnto them.
His revealed will beleeve to be perfety conteined in the written word of the ould and newe testament given by the holy ghost for Instruction and co~fort of his pore church as longe as the same is a pilgrime here vpon the earth.
This Church beleeve to be a companie of those whom the word calleth saints which do not onely professe in word that they knowe God but also are subiect vnto his lawes and ordinance in deede: with this Church do beleev that the Lord God of is meere fauour hath entred into couenant that he will be their God they shalbe his people the seales of this his convenant are only two Baptisme and the Lord supper.
The Church here vpon earth do beleeve not to be perfect although in regard of the order wich the Lord hath appointed for the same it be most absolute but to have manie blemishes and wa~tes in it yet assuredly beleeve that all th true me~ders thereof shall at the day of judgement receive their perfect consumation by Iesus Christ and be crowned in him with eternall glory of his meere grace end not for anie merit of theirs.
Thorough the mercies of my God and therefore am wilingly content to vndergoe my trouble in this life for his name sake who be glorified of my soule and body and of his saintes for ever more.
detest all heresies sectes schimes and errours wether newe or ould by whom soeuer they have be~ inue~ted as puritinisme donatism
Anabatisterie Libertinisme Brounisme all the dreames and dotages of the familie of one but especially all popery that most dredfull religion of Antichrist: the great ennemie of the Lord Iesus the most pestilent aduer+sarie of all the thrones of kings and princes.
So that abhorre fro~ my soule that whole body a~d euery part of that Romish religion called the sonne of perdition by the Spirit of God because the Lord hath determined vterly to co~sume it by his appearinge in the bri+ghtnes of his gospell before his second cominge.
detest that proud superiority of this ma~ of sinne whereby as the Apostle spake he hath exalted him selfe in his members and power to beare rule over the truth and me~bers of Christeve~ over all that is caled holy: wholy opposeth himselfe as most blodie aduersary a gainst all truths and seruants of the Lord which wil not suffer him with his sard infer+nall power toreigne over them instead of Christ in his blessed ordinances.
detest in regard of theyr offices (I speake not of the meanes persones touching the Lords election) the head of that body the Pope his cursed triple crowne his vsurped Iuridiction of eyther of both swords.
detst the limbes of that body their spirituall powre as Cardinals Archbishop a Lord bishops Sufraganes Abbots Fryors Deanes Archdeacons Commissaries Chancelers Officials Munkfryers Cannons prebend Priests.
detest theyr invented maners of calling wherby they are placed in their cursed offices theyr devised workes wherin they are jmployed by reason of theyr offices as the false doctrines and false worship of that kingdome with the livings and maintenances wherby they are maintayned in their offices.
And forasmuch as the members of Christ cannot have anie communion or fellowshipe with anie of those cursed jnuentions in so much as they can have no lawfull vse or spirituall communion of or with anie of these offices callings workes and maintenances in so much as they cannot lawfullie be subiect vnto anie parte of the ecclesiasticall power of these offices: Therfore it is that dare not participat in these assemblies over which anie of these officers bare rule or ecclesiasticallie jntermedle with the holy things of God and where anie of these devised callings and non els workes and maintenances are to be found: for am forbidden to have anie communion with these vnfructfull workes of darknes though it be vpon prte~ce of mining the truth and sacraments of Christ vpon payne of everlasting formente day and night for evermore.
Ad if may not be subiect to the ceremonies of Moses as Circoncision wich were sometymes the Lords owne sacred ordinances: how dare or any other creature be in bondage vnto those inue~tions of Antichrist the greate enemy of the Lord Iesus whereof neyther the saincts of God can neyther yet could have any sanctified vse.
The truth of doctrine touching the trinitie and touching the natures and offices of Christ Iustifying faith Sacraments externaly established by her Maiestie professed by her selfe there H. H. such as have knowledge in the asse~blies of this la~d: acknowledge fro~ my hart to be such as if mainteined not the vnitie held not the co~munio~ of the same doctrine with the~ in those points could not possibly be saved for out of that communio~ of the true profession which her Miestye hath established in these and the like rules there is no hop of saluation: but to joine not with standing with the publicke worship of these assemblies of the land dare not for the same reasons.
more over willingly confesse that both of the teachers also of the professors within these assemblyes of the land have so imbraced this truth doctrine established and professed in this land that the Lord in his infinite goodnes hath graunted the~ the fauor to shew out wherein regard of Gods election protest before men and Angels that iudge the~ members of the body whereof the sonne of God Iesus Christ is the head onely herein the Lord be merciful vnto the~ as vnto my selfe in regard of my sinnes that they are not ordered in that outward order which Christ Iesus left in his Church but instead thereof are first subiect vnto those forenamed offices seco~dly have co~munio~ with ther false maner of callings vnto their offices: Thirdlie participate with a great parte of theyr devised wor+kes wherin these officers are imployed: fourthlie with the false maintenance and livings fiftlie are mingled with the knowne profane ignorant and disordered persons which are joint members with them in their assemblies.
This is the somme of my faith and allegeance to my God and my Prince here is the so~me of the wholle difference which is betweene me and the clergy of this land and the somme of the whole cause for the which and divers other of my poore brethren are judged to be schismatikes felons heretikes: If this may come to the Royall hands of my souueraygne and to the veiwe of theyr H. H. they will be soone induced that neyther nor any other that hold the same
with me deserve the shortning of our dayes by her Maiesties sword for these things And here is all that euer wee hold.
As towching that error concerning the repeating of the Lords praye~r wherewith wee are charged far be it even far be it that wee should deny the same or anie the like scripture to be an holy forine of prayer which conteyneth not only an equisite paterne of doctrine which a Christian soule may not onlie lawfully say but also with great comfort have the vse of the same: In deed wee rather hold it for a doctrine then prayer the abuse in the often repeating of it wee condemne and this am sure was the judgement in this point of those holy servants of God who nowe rest from their labors.
The good which this land getreth outwardite by these false offices afornamed and the livings belonging vnto them is the traytors (as Iesuistes and Seminary Priests are drawen by that hope they have of possessing this Babilonish gould to become the vnnaturall betrayers of theyr naturall Prince and Contrye into the hands of strangers: wheras if these offices and livings were by publique authority once removed and converted to her Maiestyes vse the Pope would have no oc+casion to send over these locastes they would be no baytes to alluer them hether and the home Papistes would be vtterly voyde of hope to see their expected day so that the main+tayning of these offices and livings theyr devised workes and callings would fall: with them is ioyned that there is no small danger of her Maiesticall perso~ and the whole state of this land doe point but at the inconueniences which in conscience towards her Maiestye and my contrie am bond to shew they that are wiser will thinke of the cause with seriousnes and would not hope thinke me worthie to be smitten for this shewing the danger.
Whatsoeuer hold in these points controverted hold the same of meere conscience towards God of that meere destetation which in conscience am boud to have of all the inve~tions of men or Angels in religio~ and of that care which ought to have of the salvation and safegarde of her Maiestie whome the Lord preserve for ever more and of my contrie.
have for my warrant not onlie the written word which is sufficient but also in the points of greatest moment the doctrine of the Church of Engla~d established by her Maiestie and theyr Honors togeather with the writtings testimonies and blood of the famous servants and Martyrs of Christ viz. M. whickleff.
M. Charch and many other holy witnesses of the Lord in former tymes M. Tindall M. Lambert.
M. Bale the famous servantes of God in this later age togeather with the witnesses of the reformed Churches at this day in the points say of speciall waight my soule is so evinced by the word of God in all them as am ready to give my lyfe by the ayde of my God for the truth of this testimony and the testimonies of the fornamed servants of God and holy Churches of Christ: yet if any ma~ can see by the written word of God that erre in any thing will most willingly reforme my iudgement crave pardon ernesthe for any oversight: yea and be most willing to suffer due punishement for my temeritie: But if on the other side testify nothing but verity in these points am vndoubtedlie persuaded of: most humblie crave that the percing edge of that sword may not in heat be turned against me and my brethren which was never professedlie violent against the open and sworne enemies of their native Prince and contrie.
Death thanke God feare not in this cause especiallie for know that the sting of death is taken away and that they are blessed which die in the Lord for witnessing against the former corruptions Reu.
Life desyre not if be guiltie of sedition of defaming and disturbing the quiet state of her Maiestie peceable governement.
Lastlie most humblie and earnestlie beseech theyr Honors and worships in whose handes this writting of myne shall come to consider that it is to no purpose that her
Maiestyes subjects shovld bestow their tyme in learning in studie and meditation of th word, in reading the writtings and doings of learned men and of the holy martirs whic have ben in former ages, especially the writings published by her Majesties auctoritie, they may not without danger proffesse and hold those truths as which they learne out of th and that in such sorte as they are able to conuince all the world that will stand against th by noe other weapons then by the word of God.
beseech them also to consider what a lamentable cause it is that wee may hold fellowship with the Romish Church in the inue~+tions thereof without al danger canot without extreme peril be permited in Iudgme~t practise to dissent from the same where it swerueth from the true waye, as they find the things to be of especiall moment in religion, beseech them in the bowels of Iesu
Christ to be a meanes vnto her Majestie their H. Hs. that my cause may be waighed in even balance, imprisonments, Indightments arainme~ts yea death it selfe are no meete wea+pons to conuince the conscience grounded vpon the word of God accompanyed with so manie wittnesses of his famous seruants Churches.
The Lord blesse hir right excellent Majestie my most gracious soveraigne blesse their H. Hs this whole land all his saincts even for his great names sake.

Couetous ryche men beholde learne what perel daunger they be brought into, yf they haue theyr consolacion in theyr daungerous and myserable Mammon, made by Ihon Mardeley Clerke of the Kynges maiesties mynte in southwarke.
To the right worshypfull Mayster willia~ webbe, mar cha~t of Salisbury Iho~ M. wissheth continual encrease of vertue and prosperous securytie of helth, knowlege of gods veryte, euerlastyng phelycytie.
THe cause occasyon, that haue take~ vpo~ me to communycate this simple worke vn to you, which nomi+nate, the daungerous, or mysera+ble Mammon, was only to thys ende, and purpose (for as muche) as experience openeth vnto me, that not wythstanding, (as now) euerye man hathe truste· or at the least to enbrace the worde of God, whyche is apparent before theyr eyes, and to take suche frute by the same, the olde fleshlye Adam, may be mortifyed to be renewed in a new conuersacio~ lyfe, and to walke in ye lyght, not to be carnally mynded, whych S. Paule calleth deth, but to be spiritually affected, according vnto ye worde wherunto ye be now called: But truely it is a lamentable thyng, to se the corruptio~ of ma~s mynd whyche beareth as it were a certayn zele, or affectio~s, to ye worde of God can bothe speake of it, and also is desyrious to here of it, yet theyr lyues be not wythstandyng nothing agreable· ther unto, but styll dwell in the olde man, as moche coueting, ryches and worldly substaunce, as they dyd before they had knowledge rather more, who seeth not how gready al kinde of me~ be in these as wel the clargye as the
The mightie, as the mar+chaunte, whych heapeth chracheth in tresure, landes, and possessyons so gredely, as though ye worlde shuld continew for euer, hauing no regard, nether to the poore membres, nether it is to be feared, to theyr own solles helth, it may not be: sayeth the apostle Paul, that they which were once lyghted, haue tasted of the heuenly gyfte, were become partakers of the holy ghoste, tasted of ye good word of god, shuld fall away (for soche sayth he) doo crucifie ye son of god makinge a mock of him, alas who ca~ expres without a riuer of tearers.
The insaciable desyre yt me~ haue to obtaine riches, ho~geri~g so much for the~, yt he forceth not yf he may haue gold treasure, this tra~ssyto+rie substa~ce, by what meanes he cometh to it, besides greet a care, trauell, he taketh nyght day, to bryng in goodes, ryches, into hys possessio~, whe~ he hathe gotten it, he hordeth kepeth it fro~ ye vse, relyue, help, of the poore brethren, which shal ra ther peryshe, than he wyll other lende, geue, or socoure, the~ with any of thys hys myserable mam mon. Whych he so warely reserueth to him selfe, as thoughe, he shuld inhabit the erth euer, contrary to the word of god, whych these ryche me~ haue in theyr hou ses many tymes redyng the sa me, And also vnto the law of nature, what els be these kynde of couetous men, but euen soche as the Apostle speaketh of, in his epistle to the Hebreus ye. x. chap. Yf we synne wylfully, af ter that we haue receyued know+ledge of the truthe, ther remayneth no more sacrifice for synnes But a fearful lokyng for iudgement, a viole~t fyre, whych shal deuoure the aduersaries.
Tyrable most fearful this vnto al sinners, i~ especial to all soche as loueth gold better then god.
The couetous ma~ will here peradue~ture saye no man dothe loue his ryches better then god.
Unto soche answere yf thou se or know thy brother destitute of lyuing to mayntayn hys family and occupie~g thou hauinge in thy kepyng more treasure the~ yu doest put in vse but reseruest it in thy coferes, thou then louest thy gold better the~ god For S. Iho~ sayth he yt loueth not his bro ther knoweth not god as muche to sygnifye louethe not God for they are of the worlde and not of God for he that knoweth god heareth his word and loueth his brother for loue is a co~maundement hereby know we ye spryte of veritie the spryt of erroure But now and euery man lykethe the bred that is gotten with disceate at the last hys mouth shall be full of grauell what shall the ryche man take away wyth hym more then shal the poore sauyng paraduenture ther maye be moo clothes founde in hys graue the~ in the poore mans it is a rufull thynge to remember the whealynesse that the couetous ryche be in, for the neade and myserie of the poore they neather fele not yet consyder.
For the wyse man saythe he that is ful, abhor reth a honye combe.
But to hym that is hongrye euerye sowre thing is swete.
Alas how lytle be the poore brethre~ re me~bred of the ryche, in thys age it wold petie a mans harte to co~syder it, for yf he geue a parte of ye scrapes of his table, or an. ob. or a peny he conteth wt hym self, he hath done asmoch, as to him is co~ma~ded, no certaynly.
Thou arte not so discharged of thy dutie reconi~g, which yu must re~der of thy bayliwike, as in this lytle treatis shalbe declared.
For ye wy+se ma~ discribeth what yu oughtest to do vnto thy brethren.
Thus sayth he, who yt geueth vnto the poore, shal not lack, But he that turneth hys face fro~ soche as be in necessitie, shal suffre great pouertie him self, Now seyng yt the poore, the le~der shal both mete together, the lord shal lyghten both theyr eyes, wold consel al me~ who~ god hath endewed wyth ryches.
To ponder this litle wor+ke, to haue an earnest purpose and ready wil to order theyr sub+stance according to these scriptu+res, not wrytte~ by the holy ghost in vayn, but to admonish vs of ye will plesure of god, to frame our lyfe co~uersacio~, after ye pre+ceptes of ye same, Albeyt, theyr be a great no~ber which haue ye goo+des of this world, and esteymeth lytle or nought ether ye word whi+che they haue receyued other els theyr bonde~ dutie vnto theyr poo+re brethre~, they be so bli~ded with auaryce, loue of the~ selues.
To anymate soche sorte of men, thought it my part to take vpon me to put forth this smale worke as a thing very neadful, for the forsayd consideracio~s to moue, styre ye ryche, to bestowe theyr laboures, in ye lordes vyneyarde, yt they may for theyr wel doing, receyue theyr peny of euerlastinge lyfe, And for ye loue beare vnto you amongest all other my dere fre~des, dedicate this ye frute of my spare houres, vnto you, trustyng ye wyl take it in good part which shal incorrage me here after to gratifye you wyth some other worke as occasio~ shal serue me, Thus god preserue your Maystership in helth and prosperious successe· in all your godly affayres yours at co~maundement.
Ihon Mardeley Redderatio+ne~ villicationis tue. Iu. The dau~gerous and myserable Mammon.
AMongest the hole multitude of euyls throwen vpo~ ma~kyn de, in this mortal lyfe is to be feared most greuouslye.
The prickyng thornes of ryches which these welthy worldlinges be endewed wtal in soch superflus habo~dau~ce, yt alas it is to be lame~ted.
Co~sydering ye great dau~+ger, perel those men be in, why+che possesse ye same, thinke it no part theyr bo~de~ office, dutie, to mynistre vnto the poore me~bres of Christe, accordynge vnto the Gospell, But continuallye laboure, and studye, to enryche the~ theyr posteritie eue~, as ye vse therof, apparteyned vn to the~ only, none other inue~tinge, by al ye meanes they may possyble, to get obtayne riches, la~des possessio~s, wt great trauell and care of mynde as though ye thing ones gotte~ shuld euer remayne styl continue with the~ or else at ye leaste theyr chyldren and frendes to enioye the same after the getters decease: These kynde of men, lytle pondereth, or weigheth in theyr mindes, This fearful sayeng of our Sauiour christ, spoke~ in the. xvi. of S. lukes gospel, wher it is said, Come and geue nowe accompte, of thy Bayly wyke stand forth, Let me see, what accompt thou canst ren+der, of soche goodes as thou hast had lent to the, how yu wilt dyscharge thy selfe, of the dystrubu+cion of the~ vnto whose vse yu wast appoynted to haue ye kepynge of thy riches, not vnto thy nowne goo to make a reconing quickly, Oh merciful lord, shal this street acco~pt, by thys of ye ryche world+lynges demau~ded, yea truly, for when the euening cometh, which is the end of this world, the~ shal euery man gyue a iuste reconing of his Baylie+wyke, and take his reward good or bad, accordinge as he hath enployed his Talant here.
Now if thou ca~st discharge thys thyne accompte, iustly and truly.
The~ was theyr neuer any earthly lorde, yt so rewarded hys seruauntes, as thy lorde the~ thy audytoure wil reward the, for he wyl gyue the lyfe ioye, euerlastynge, But yf yu ryche ma~, be neglige~t regard not thine own velthe, take no hede vnto thys thy reconing, no tong can expres the soro we payne, yt thou shalt suffre.
Therfore, the desyre of so great ioye, dred of so horryble payne, yea al thoughe thou haddest no loue of god in thy harte, yet at the leaste way it shuld make the continually to remember, that theyr must be accompte made of thy Baylywyke, Therfore be circu~spect, learne thys lesso~ of the wycked stewarde make you frendes, of the wycked Ma~mon, which is your ryches, that whe~ ye haue ru~ne your course in this transitorious lyfe, depart hence, they may receaue you into euerlasting habitacio~s, Co~sider thou ryche man, which wyth al thy study ouse diligence, laboureth continually, trauelleth, wt all thy wytte endustrye to obtayne riches, to be of great sub stau~ce, to purchase ample great possessions, as though thou shul inheret the yearth euer.
Mar+ke what is sayd to the in the gospell, Wo be to you that ar ryche.
That haue therin your consolation, Wo be to you that ar full, for ye shall ho~ger, Wo be to you that now laughe for ye shal wepe. &c. Oh how farre passeth the wysdome of the chyldren of thys worlde, from the chyldre~ of lyghte.
For what soeuer he be whych loueth money and fyxeth hys harte vpon the vayne riches and substaunce of thys worlde, neuer contented nor satisfied for all hys delyght, and pleasure in ryches and yet, for all that saythe the wyse precher, he shall haue no profyt therof.
Is it not to be greuously lamented and so to se what insaciable desy+re many men haue to get ryches and be so careful studiouse for the optayninge of the same, that in maner al theyr whole care stu+dy is ye way.
And vnto what end purpose, do they thus torment them selues nothinge else, but to heape vp, gather in, to enryche theyr chyldre~, wyfe, frendes, to be lordes ouer the poore, and to lyue here in great welthines, hauing no co~sideracio~ of this streat accompt, to be re~dred, both for ye inordynat gathering therof, and also for the not helpyng of theyr weake brothers, whych peryshe for exterme neade, lake of thyn+ges necessary to mayntayn them and theyr familie, And many be yet so myserable in gettyng goo des, and ryches, that they pynche theyr bodyes, aswell by the trauel labour, payne which continually they take, but also be soch nigardes that truly it is to the~ a helly payne to bestow some part of ther money, vpon theyr owne belys.
And many tymes for feablenes beinge exersysed in theyr couetuouse chrachynge vp this worldly glase, whyche is all but vanitie, that they dye myserably To these men speaketh the wyse man, whyche sayth nothynge is more wycked, and vngracious, than is a couetous ma~, for theyr syluer nor theyr gold shal not be able, to delyuer them in the daye of the Lordes wrathe.
Therfore beware yu ryche couetous man that thou gette not thy goodes, wrongfully as by extorcio~ stelth vsury, or deceyte, yf yt thou haue than wo shalbe vnto the, at thys dredfull daye, of thyne accompt makynge, for thus sayth S. austen, yf he be cast into ye fyre that hath not geue~ of his own goodes iustely gotten.
Wher shall he be caste yt hath stole~ other me~s goodes, thynkest yu? Or yf he shall brene with the fende? yt hath not clothed ye naked.
Where iudgest thou he shall berne, yt hath made naked those yt ware clothed.
Oh howe fewe dothe thes ryche men cloth now a dayes.
Almost none, but careth al to cloth him selfe (& his) Reme~ber what the scripture sayth vnto hym.
And that his eyes ca~not be satisfyed wyth riches, nor wil excogitate wt him self, (& saye) for whom do take this paynfull trauell.
And yet after all hys labours, he shalbe fayne to leaue hys goodes to another.
That ne uer traueled nor swet for theym, therfore is it not a vayne thynge and a great myserie, for a ma~ all ye dayes of hys lyfe to trauel laboure studye to enryche other whych shal (eue~ hys own sonne) Caste· hys armes abrode, in all wantonnesse co~+sume this riches which thou hast so greuously al the dayes of thy lyfe cared for, yea in a smale tyme he shal wast spend it awaye ryotously, And vnthryftely, art not the cause of this euyl thy self whych by thy lyfe woldest not be+stowe thy substa~ce, according, as thou art bounden.
Bothe by the commaundemente of God, and the lawe of nature.
Do+este thou not vnderstande that the bread of the hongrye is the lyfe of the poore.
And he that defraudethe him of his bread defraudeth him of his lyfe.
He that trusteth in riches, shal come to nought, And it is muche better to haue a lytle wyth the feare of the lorde, than great insaciable treasures.
Be holde sayth the holy prophet Da+uid in the thyrd eyght psalme.
He heapeth vp treasure, and yet knoweth not he for who~ he gathe reth it, is it not more tha~ madnes (yea) very madnes it selfe.
To be so desyrious of great ryches whi+che is so dau~gerous, excludeth many out of ye kyngdo~ of heaue~, it is sayd in the gospel.
My lytle babes, how hard is it for the~ that trust in theyr riches, to enter into the kingdo~ of heue~, wherby it is more easyer, for a cable, to go tho+row ye eye of a nedle, than a ryche man to enter into kingdo~ of he ue~, Ponder wel these wordes yu man, which art choked wyth the thornes of ryches, worldly sub stau~ce, weigh say fro~ the botto~ of thy hart, what perel, Ieoper+dy, yu art in, whych ioyne house to house, felde to felde, shal ye alo+ne inhabit the erth? The precher in the second of his boke sayth made gorgious fayre workes.
And se al is vanitie vnder ye sonne, shalt yu not leaue al these thinges To other, what madnes is thys sayth S. Auste~, to lese lyfe, gra ce, to procure, the soules da~pna+cion to wynne gold lose heaue~, And therfore sayth ye {pro}phet psal. liiii. vnhappynes, shal compasse the, rou~d about, trauel vnrighteousnes, in ye middes amo~g the~ doth not ye prophet Abacuc saye.
And heapeth vp thicke clay agaynst him self: Therfore saith a holy Doctour.
The clay of Egypt is toughe stincking, med+led with bloode, the slattes were harde to be vndone.
For they were bake~ with the fyre of couetous, with the layre or earth of lustes: Alas in this do trauel ryche me~ in this thei watche lye~g await for poore me~.
And in a mome~te they be gone done into hel, this is a fearful sente~ce, to be feared of these ryche worldli~ges But alas feare yt twoo thinges specially, make me~ thus to lyue by coueting rape of other me~s goodes.
But take hede beware sayth S. Lu. in ye vi. of his gospel of couetousnes.
For no ma~s lyfe sta~deth in ye abo~ dau~ce of thinges which he posses+seth.
And S. Austen sayth, we se sayth he, yt rauenous fyshes, haue some measure.
But ye couetous ryche ma~, he is neuer satisfyed nor fulfylled, but euer he taketh.
And neuer hath ynough, wtout dred of god or shame of ma~ He occupieth dead me~s goodes, as thoughe he shulde neuer dye To soche it shalbe sayde: yu foole This night wyl they fetch away thy soule from the.
Than whose shall yu thynges be, that yu hast so gredely gathered together.
Rede in the Prophet zacharia the syxte chapter and thou shalt se.
Wha~ zachary was co~manded of the an+gel to lyfe vp his eyes to se what it was yt goeth out, the prophete askynge what it was, it was answered, This is ye pot goyng out And that is the eye of the earth, thys potts couetyse, whych euer more gapeth after worldely goo+des ryches and honoure And as lycoure in ye pot profyteth not to ye pot self.
But vnto them that drawe, drinke therof, so worldly goodes, ofte profyteth not the keper.
He that hath mo+ney, shall haue no fruit of it, ful sore be ye couetous persones blin+ded.
That they se not howe they shuld come to heaue~.
But to win ne tra~sitorie thynges, they haue as manye eyes as Argus had mo, for they ar like to owles and nightroues that seethe better by nyght than by daye.
And thorow this vyle auarice a ma~ doth lose ye pytie, he shuld haue of his own soule.
For by that dedly synne is lost the lyfe of the soule.
In gettyng ryches therby is lost also the pytie they shulde haue vnto theyr bodyes, putting the~ selues in much great ieoperdie, both by sea, land, also leseth the ruthe and co~passio~, they shuld haue of other poore mens indigence and nead, for it is sayd whe~ he is fylled he shalbe stopped, oh what ty rable sayinges of the scriptures be these, wyl they not take away that inpietie whych is thus closed by obstynacio~ that this coue tousnes may go out of the ryche mans hart by repe~tance to fol low the sayenge of christ whyche sayth in ye gospel of S. lu.
That he whych is faythful in yt which is leste, the same is faythefull in moche.
And he yt is vnfaithful in ye least, is vnfaythful also i~ moch So the~ yf ye haue not bene faith+ful in ye wycked ma~mo~, Who wil beleue you in yt which is trew, yf ye haue not bene faythful in ano+ther ma~s busines, who shal geue you your own, As who shuld say ye ryche couetous ma~, is but ye ke+per for the poore, ought to be a iuste true mynyster, a faythful distrubutter as wel in ye least as in ye moche, that is to geue of hys lytle as of his moche, quantitie for qua~titie, beyng his own for no ma~ lyueth to him selfe but to benefyte other.
And therfore yf the ryche men, be not faythful in the poore mans busynes, who shal geue hym his owne, for god shal for not doynge hys bonden dutie vnto his weake brethre~, ta+ke it fro~ hi~ (for it is wrytte~) Thei beare no burde~s, but be in al ease and riches.
They be not oppressed wyth mortal myserye of men neather pinched wyth nead, lyke other me~ wherfore they ar pufte vp wyth pryde.
They be droned in myschefe, iniury, so that for theyr welthy ryches.
They be ge uen to al lustes follow the desyres of theyr owne hartes.
And wt sondrie myschefes co~sumed. &c. Wo to ye proud welthy in eue~ soche as thinke the~ selues sure vpon ye mou~te Samaria, lo these vngod+lye ryche men, thynke to possesse theyr ryches perpetually, They drinke theyr wine out of goblets playe~g vpo~ istrume~ts, anoynti~g theyr heads wt ye best oyle, but no ma~ is sory for Iosephs hurt.
And prouideth for his own, he is a wyse man which can by his wit and pollicie get heap ryches to gether moch in estimacio~ with the wycked.
say they, se how ye worlde goeth wyth thys man he hath by hys endustrie in fewe ye+res gotte~ great substance possessions surely he is a wyse man.
Wo be vnto the~ yt ar wyse in theyr own syght.
And thynke the~ selues, to haue vnder+standing for that which is hygh+ly estemed among me~ is nable in ye lyght of god.
Ryches is a perelous trape, many be ta+ke~ in the snare, for by the inordynate coueting therof, many heapeth vp theyr own destructio~, for the pleasure therof in ye end it is verye greuous bytter.
The ryche glotto~ yt had so great pleasure in his ryches, was caste down into hel.
The great riche Epulo whiche fared so deliciouslye hadde soch an insaciable couetous hart to haue treasure had poured i~to hys mouth hoote molte~ gold as the hystorie maketh mencio~.
Couetyse, is cause yt ryche men, eate poore men, euen as beastes eate grasse.
And wyl not let the~ grow vp, but kepeth the~ loo not helpin+ge the~ in theyr necessities but set+teth theyr pasture fro~ the~.
Am+brose wel pai~teth fourth these ry+che couetous me~, saying how far+re wyll ye ryche men stretch oute your couetousnes, wyl ye dwel a lone vpo~ the erth, haue no poo+re me~ with you, why put you out your felowe in kynd couite ryches and possessio~s, which kynde na+ture hath made co~me~ to all both poore riche, wil ye the~ ryche me~ chalenge propertie therin.
Natu+re kynde, knoweth no ryches, for she bryngeth fourthe all men poore.
Naked we come naked the earth taketh vs agayn, natu+re maketh no differe~ce betwen ry+che poore, loke amo~g the dead bones, and se yf thou canst know the ryche fro~ the poore.
What auaylethe thy ryches then thou couetous man, whych arte neuer fully satisfied so lo~g as thou art in this corrupt stincking fleshe Behold how god hath plaged co+uetous persones, for Innocentius speaking of ye harme.
That co meth of couetousnes saythe, Oh how many me~ hath couetousnes deceyued spylled, for couetous+nes sake.
Wold not Balaam for gyftes that kyng Balac promysed to haue cursed Israel dyd not his own asse reproue his conscie~ce, hurt his fote at a wall not wythstanding yet he was ouerco+me.
And lead awaye wyth couetousnes: Achane was stoned for couetousnes.
Gyhesye was stryke~ wt leprosy for sellyng of Amanes helth that came by ye grace of god, many moo as Iudas ki~g Achab other innumerable whi+che couetousnes, hath broughte to distruction (for it is wrytten).
The couetouse ma~ shall receyue punyshme~t whe~ he dieth, also it is wrytte~ in Hierime the. ix. cha.
It was not wt out cause yt the wyse man sayde.
Blessed is ye ma~, yt is fou~d wtout spot, hath not gone after gold nor hath had truste in the treasure of money.
Whyche is he, we wyll prayse hym, for he hath done my+racles in hys lyfe (as though he wolde say) ther is none, or at the leaste very fewe but al knowe perceaue in the~ selues, what gre+dy desyre loue, they haue to mo+ney.
And yet to blear the eyes of the poore, this couer of shame, vyce.
Hath couetyce, whych they cal bodely sustena~ce, neadful to natur vnder shadow of which couetyse to obtayne ryches, doth labour i~ordinately, vnsaciably out of rule al godli measure, by meanes possible he ca~ ymage~ thus wt al his dilyge~ce, he goeth after gold, trusteth in the treasure of his money, wil not suffre hys money to followe hym that money may remaine for his sake.
And not he for the money sake, lyke as a bondman to hys Mammon, to loue the money, to set hys harte vpon it for wher your tresure is, ther shalbe your harte, also.
For ye cannot serue God and Mammon together, for thys cause the apostell he calleth no other synne Idolatrie.
But onely couetousnes, for a couetous man declareth hys carnal wil, and how that he hath more trust in hys ryches, then in God.
For he thynketh to haue more gayne by hys money than by god.
It is to be lamented to se these wealthy worldlinges what maner of glorie and confydence, they haue in theyr riches, calling and substau~ce, for yf they be not yet of the notable soorte, of the myghty ryche couetous me~, Yet yf they be extolled to anye offyce but as feed men, It loke they a lofte wyth a lordly cou~tenaunce vpon theyr inferyours, whyche hathe theyr lyuinges of the same fountayne, out of the which they same lycoure for theyr owne lyuynges, as though ye same ware thrall or bonde~ serua~ts vnto the~ whych is contrarye vnto the say+inge of S. Luke, in the. vi. chap+ter of his gospel, whych sayth an euyl man, yet vseth lyberalytye vnto hys frendes.
And the brutall beestes, of theyr own kynde be good, and lyberall, vnto theyr owne nature, how moch therfore oughte a christen man, thynke it a hygher thynge, that hys goodnes and lyberalytie, shuld helpe them, that be indigent.
Yea, hys enemyes, and euen the~ that haue hurte hym.
For except thou help thy enemy whych hath neade of thy help, and soccour hym in his necessytie, it is euen as thou had+deste stolen from hym.
So sayth S. Ambrose, (fede the hon+grye saythe he) for yf thou fede hym not, yu kyllest hym, as moche as in the is, For yf thou be a couetous man, and dwellethe in thy riches.
Thou hast nether cha+rytie here in earth vnto thy brethren nor to God in heauen, for thou beareste thys pote as is before spoken of, Into the lande of
That is to saye: into the land of stenche, (that is hell) for theyr is stenche in steade of swet smellynge.
That thou go not with thys pote into the lake of darkenes.
Consydre that thou muste render a streate accompt of thy bayly wike.
And make the frendes of this wycked Mammon, whyles thou arte the vser of it (for else) Thou shalte be an inhabyter of euerlastinge death, shalt there paye the vttermost farthing.
Oh Lorde that euery ryche man wol+de consyder what his dutie, and office ware toward his poore bre+thren.
Then wolde he not be so gredy to heape and gather riches To that end to vse them as many doth, vnto theyr owne destruc+tion, as it is moche to be feared.
For amongest all kynde of men, ryche couetous men, be so blynded in the duste of theyr substau~ce.
That they wil not se, the neces+sytie of the poore, but with al diligence, loketh vnto them selues theyr chyldren and familie, Lyuing in all lustes and pleasures as in sumptious farre, Gorgyous apparell gallant and fayre houses.
They satte done to eate, and rose agayne to playe.
Oh wold vn+to the lyuing god, that the ryche men wolde remember who are theyr chyldren.
Then shuld they fynde that the hongrye, thyrsty, naked, sycke and straungers, by theyr chyldre~.
For who~ god hath made theyr houses an inne, or an hospital, for the~ to be releued in.
Take example of Lote whyche shewed mercy vnto the poore.
And hyde them in hys house buryeng them by nyght, whych were slayne by the fylthy Sodomy+tes, and beware thou be not like vnto the ryche glotton whyche despysed the nead of poore Lazarus.
For the ryche man was buryed in hel, and Lazarus was re+ceaued into the bossome of Abra+ham.
By whych storye it is euydently declared, that the substa~ce, of the ryche, appartayneth vn+to the poore, and those whych ha+ue not to defend the cares of this lyfe, thou art bounden to help in al that in thy lyeth, For a sacrifi+ce well pleasinge vnto god, is to attende to his co~maundeme~tes, and to depart from al iniquitie, and vnryghteousnes, she+wynge mercy vnto thy dettours, as the Lorde dyd vnto hys seruaunte.
And gather not your treasure vpon the earthe, where ruste and mothes corrupte, and where theues breke thorowe steale.
But gather youre treasure, together in heauen where neyther ruste nor mothes &c.
That thou mayste be blessed as Salomon sayth in the iii. of his Pro.
Bles+sed is the man, that fyndeth wys+dom and obtayneth vnderstandinge, for the gettyng of it, is bet+ter then any marchandyse of syluer, the proffyte of it is better then gold.
Therfore, there is no precyous stones to be compared wyth vnderstandyng applye thy mynd oh ryche ma~ to vnderstande the dutye vnto thy poore brethren, whome thou art bounden to succoure helpe and loue.
For saynete Jhon in hys secounde epystle saythe, he that loueth his brother, abydethe in the lyghte and he that hateth hys brother, walketh in darkenes, and cannot tell whether he goethe for darke+nes hath blynded hys eyes.
Se therfore that ye loue not the worlde neyther the thynges, that in the world.
For yf any man loue the world, the loue of the father is not in hym.
For al that is in the worlde, is lust of the fleshe, Luste of the eyes, and pryde of goodes whyche vanyssheth awaye and the lust therof· But the couetous ryche men, be of the world, and therfore speake they of worldly thynges and the worlde heareth them, they be also louers of them selues, and make al the prouisyons possyble for the maynteynaunce of theyr owne belys, to be estemed, had in reputacion, and great reuere~ce, for theyr ryches sake, seakyng and procuryng myghty frendes vnto whom they make great and banckytynge hauynge plentye and haboundaunce of al thynges thus the worlde loueth the world, and the ryche cheryssheth the ryche.
But the nead ye poore brethre~ haue skase the cro~s or scrapes whyche falleth frome theyr tables.
And yet many tymes, yf they gyue a halpenie or a peny to a poore ma~, it is thought to be a great benefyte vnto him.
Or yf they call a poore house hol der, hauinge wyfe and chyldren, hauing no help to get his liuing to soccour them wythal, yet yf he and hys wyfe haue theyr bely ful of meat at the ryche mans table Theyr childre~ cryeng for honger at home, yet thynke they to haue done a charitable almes.
Alas thys is farre fro~ the almes and loue whyche thou oughtest to do vnto thy nedye brother, For thou ryche man whych hast plen+tye of gold syluer and other sub+staunce, lyeng by the, beyng more then yt shalbe sufficient or requy+syt for thine own vse, but only to horde kepte it in thy store box, the same to lye, vnocupied, hauynge ouer (and aboue that,) to mayntayne thy state and occupienge, accordyng thy tn vocation thou ar bonde~ to distribute lend and gyue it vnto soche as wante and as wolde therby lyue wythe moderacion and honestye (for it is writte~) he that doth aske gyue, and from hym that wolde borow turne not thy face, for we knowe S, Iohn.
That we ar translated from death vnto lyfe, because we loue the brethren.
But he that lo ueth not hys brother, abydeth in deathe, who so euer hateth hys brother is a manssear: Do we not herby (saythe he) perceaue.
That for loue he gaue hys lyfe for vs, and therfore ought we al so to gyue oure lyues for the bre+thren, for whosoeuer, hathe thys worldes goods that is habunda~+ce of ryches, and seeth hys brother haue nede, and shutteth vp hys compassyon from hym.
Therfore let vs not loue in wordes to~ge, but wyth the dede and veri tie.
And so doyng we be fully ser+tyfied, that we are of the veritye that is of god, can before hym quyte our hartes, that we haue loued our brethren here is a con+fortable lesson, for the couetous ryche man, to learne and also to follow.
But yf your hartes condemp you, God is greater than your hartes, shal condemp you for he knowethe all thynges, he knoweth youre vnkyndnes, ingratitude, yt you shew to your brother i~ kynd.
For though thou sayest loue God, and hate thy brother, Thou art a lyer, for how can be that louethe not hys brother who~ he seeth, loue god who~ he hath not seen? Oh most vayne man, whych blyndisheth thy self to know god.
And eather in gettynge of thy ryches, other else in the abusyng of the same, thou ne+ther knowethe God, nor thy brethren, for hauinge any superiori+tie ouer hym.
Thou shewest a sta+tely and a proud cou~tena~ce, vpo~ hym, and as ready to consume eate him vp wyth lordly wordes, as to ouerwhelme and deuoure hym, in pluckyng fro~ hym, grou~ de lyuing.
Therfore (it is wrytten) be circumspecte and take the more hede vnto those thynges, whych ye haue harde, for doubte leste ye peryshe.
It is a maruellous thynge that these couetous ryche men, doth not, or else be so blinded with auarice.
That they wyl not remember what is spoke~ in the scripture agaynst theyr insaciable desyre of riches, that the abundaunce of theyr ryches wyl not suffre the couetous man, to slepe.
He is so bussyed in hys mynd, nyght and day to bring it into hys kepyng.
Is to the great detereme~t, and hurt of hym that hath them in possession for often tymes they peryshe wyth greate mysery and trouble.
Yea and yf it happen he haue a chylde, yet getteth he nothynge.
But as he came naked into the world, euen so shal he goo agayn, is not this a myserable plage.
That the couetous ryche man shall not enioye hys ryches, and maye, theyr chyldren neyther.
For it is wrytten god geueth a ma~ ryches and good and yet geueth he hym not leaue to enioye the same.
Therfore whyles thou art vser of thy goodes reme~ber that thou must gyue a streat acco~pt of thy Bayly wyke, according as the scrip+ture doth teache the do, That is, lay thy bread vpon wete faces, so shalt thou fynde after manye dayes, that is, hap thy nedy brother that wepeth for want of suc+cour and thou shall haue manye dayes in perpetuall blesse for euer, for whan the cloudes be full they poure out rayne vpon the earth, Cease not therfore.
Wyth thy hande to sowe thy seed, whether it be in the morninge or in the euening, for yu knowest not what frut shal grow therof vnto then crease of thy saluacio~ for god loued a glad gifte, quomodo potest esse misericors.
And o, howe moche is it for to be mercyful to thi brother i~ kind for yf god hath endewed thy wyth ryches.
That god hath geue~ the~ vnto the for thyne owne vse and profyte onely.
But that thou arte made but a steward ouer them to distri+bute, and bestowe them vnto the profyte of the come~tie, for doubt+les the ryche ma~ is not the very owner of theym.
But onely God he it is whyche is the owner, for he sayth by the Prophete Agget.
Golde is myne, syluer is myne and he hath but co~mitted substa~ ce vnto vnto thy hand.
But for a ceason to se how thou wilt distribute the~ to thy brother, for al is but vniuersa vanitas omnes homo viuens.
Now yf thou be a faithful dispo+ser of this wycked mammon, accordyng thy dutie and godes co~maundementes and for by cause that thou shalt well knowe, it is thy office to mynister to thy brother, note the Parable of the ryche glotton as is aforesayd why+che was clothed in sylke faryng dylycately, was buryed in hell Upon thys place sayth S. Gregorie that he was not dampned because of hys despoylynge and gettynge of others.
But because he did not distribute his goodes to other as the processe of ye texte dothe declare.
And seynge thou must neades geue accomptes of all that is geuen the, The~ canste thou not glorie in thi riches, but rather to feare tremble in weiinge wythe thy selfe howe moche thou hast to accompte for, before the hygh iudge, myghty audytor Christ, for he wyl not be delu ded all though the world may be blinded haue a {per}petuall study, by al the wayes meanes that may be in ye to benyfyt do good to the neady poore, for yf thou shut vp thy charitie fro~ thy brother thou sleyth hym as moch as in the lyeth, for the prophet saith Wo be vnto the crowne of pryde whose great po~pe is a flour that fadeth away, from such as be in welth ouerlade~ wt ryches.
And therfore sayth he, trust not in thy riches, for it shal not help in ye ty+me of ve~geau~ce, ther is nothi~g worsse tha~ a couetous ma~, no nor a more wickeder thing, the~ to loue money for it is but fylthy dou~ge Heare these wordes thou couetous riche ma~, which seaketh rest in thy substa~ce, taketh co~solaci on plesure in thy ryches, wilt not vse it, as thou art appointed to ye easment of thy poore brethre~ And according vnto the co~maun+deme~t of loue, whyche is to loue thy neighbour, eue~ as wel as thy self.
But alas who so doeth now a daies, in al thiges, do vnto his neyghbour as he wolde be done vnto, who geueth hym, who lendeth him, assysteth eadeth him, in al his necessyties, as he wolde his neyghbor shuld do vnto him yf he ware in lyke neade, fewe or none in the world, for ye wild asse is the lyons praye, eue~ so are the poore the meate of the ryche, for ye couetous ryche ma~, he hath no co~passio~ of the poore, but all hys eye is vnto hym self, careth not for ye misery yt his brother endureth He doth not vnderstand what is writte~.
As who shuld say, god may geue ryches, make ye riche poore, at his pleasure, for it is an easy thi~g in his syght to enriche a poore ma~ quickly, also to put downe the proud fro~ theyr seate, to exalte ye humble.
perellous time shal come vpo~ the ryche as sayth the prophet Abacuc, which heapethe vp other mens goodes, And wo vnto him yt couetousli gathereth goodes into his house, yt he may let his on hye to escape fro~ ye power of mysfortune.
The very stones of the wal shal crye out of it saith this holi {pro}phet though it be far of for a tyme, yet at the laste shall it come to passe not fayle.
Oh the~ in that daye what acco~pt wilt yu make of thy Baylywyke, what answere wilt thou make of the wytholding a way ye goodes of the poore shalte yu not re~der a streat accompt therof yea truly, to thi vtter da~natio~.
Ther+fore beware how yu getteth riches whe~ thou hast gotte~ the~, that yu dispose the~ godly vpo~ thy poore brethren by kynde for whose vse they ar geue~ vnto ye not onely vnto thyne own as haue before declared vnto the in this simple tretyse, learne of ye wise precher Ecclesiastes what holsome frutful instructio~s he geueth to soche eouetous ryche me~, whych be so insaciable in gatheringe heapynge vp of goodes neuer co~tented, thus saythe he.
was weary of my labour which had take~ vnder the Su~ne, because should be fayne, to leaue the~ vn+to another ma~, yt cometh after me who knoweth whether he shall be a wyse ma~, or a foule, and yet shal he be lord of al my laboures Is not this a vayne thing a ve+ry vanitie.
That a ma~ shal leaue his laboures, vnto another that neuer swet for the~.
Therfore {per}ceaue ther is nothinge better for a man, tha~ to be ioyful in his laboure, to bestowe distrubute his goodes whiles he lyueth, for that is his porcion, for who wyl bryng hym to se the thyng, yt shal come after hym, for as they be al dust, so shall they all turne vnto duste agayn, now here hast thou hard by the word of god in what perel Ieoperdie, The ryche couetous ma~ sta~deth in whe~ he shal gyue vp his reconi~g at ye last day how he ought to distribute be+stowe the~, of the nedy poore, so that in the so doying he may aduoyde the dau~ger of eternal da~p+natio~.
And to obtayne ye celestial ioyes of heaue~ vnto yt which god bring vs all.
FINIS All ye whych be endewed wt ryches and tresure Reme~ber your streate acco~pt, that ye must render Be mercyfull to the neadye, gyue Mammon wyth measure To succour theyr wante, who~ ye ar bonden to tender Be lyberall to gyue, and also a free lender Then be ye good Baylyffes, and mynysters profytable Else shal ye perishe, yf ye god des worde do pounder For hiding your talent, with the seruaunte reprouable Here endeth a smale treatyse named, the Daungerous, and Myserable Mammo~.

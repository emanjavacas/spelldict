true reporte of the death martyrdome of M. Campion Iesuite and preiste, M. Sherwin, M. Bryan preistes, at Tiborne the first of December Observid and written by a Catholike preist, which was present therat Wherunto is annexid certayne verses made by sundrie persons [Figure: Apoca.
These are they that came out of gret tribulation, and haue washed their stoles and made them white in the bloud of the Lambe.
AMongst the diuers reportes of the behavior of Campion, M. Sherwin, Brya~ at their death (passing among freindes from hand to hand) hapned vpon one ge+ven out as it seemeth by a Catholike priest, who as it apereth pressed to ob+serue marke those dealings: which report have here published, co~sidering the divers many slaunders raised since by some maliciously blinded to satisfie content all such as do desire to vnderstand the manner of the same: hope that consideration which hath movid me hereto, wil also perswade that priest to the wel liking of this my doing? dout not but that the relation it self will content the reader throughly touching their words, and behaviour at the tyme of execution, Notwithstanding those slaunders which were since spred to diminish the honour of their refolute departure Martirdome, as that Campion was timerous and fearfull, that Sherwin died a protestant, with other such false reportes, as thov shalt see in pervsing this short relation here exhibitid for thy satisfaction: wherin is a lively Image of resolute martirs, constantly professing their faith belief, resolutly disclaming from all treasons and treacheryes falslie intendid againste them: and loyaly behaving them selues towards our queene country.
Who as they were in their lives lanterns of piety vertue, so in their deathes made themselves paternes and examples for all good christian subiectes to follow.
And here by the way might point out M. Elmers folly, as not one of the least, who notwithstanding the knowen lerning of M. Campion (he him selfe a man of knowen wisedome, iudgement,) was not ashamed, at a Sessions at Newgate, vpon the apparance of the Cutler of Holborne, to say openly, that Campion was and that a Note booke or two of his felowes being taken from him, he had nothing in him, as it was manifest in his disputations in the Tower.
Further that al the Papistes in the worlde coulde not answere Whitakers booke against the saide Campion.
Which his censure, referre vnto the iudgement of the lerned discret and wise, who know do condemne the babbling of that barren declaymer, as voyde of witte, discretion, lerning, modestie, truth.
But howe friuolous and vayne these slaunders are, although the whole world (filled nowe with the fame of his lerning) doth know, yet it shal be made more manifest and apparant euen vnto him selfe by those Disputations had in the Tower, to the honor of Campion and furthering of his cause, at suche time as by the grace of God they shal be published.
This rehearsal (good Reader) confesse is impertinent to the purposse of that Preist who gaue out the report folowing, and yet thought it not altogether amisse to touch those slaunders so false and malicious, as many good Gentlemen can not but confesse.
Muche more Elmer spake that day, as he thought, to the discredite of M. Campion, but pray God giue him better consideration both of this and of further iustice, and so shall the poore Poulter at his nexte complaynt be heard, euen of himself, beeing as he himself said, a Bishop, a Lorde, and of some credite Farewell.
true report of the death of M. Campion Iesuite and Preist, M. Sherwin, and M. Bryan preistes.
THE diuers and contrary reportes falsely and maliciously bruted and published of M. Euerard Haunse directly executed for cause of Religion, after his late martyrdome, gaue iust feare of the like practise towards those thrée glorious Martirs, learned, meeke, stoute, and constant Priests, M. Edmund Campion Iesuite, M. Rodulph Sherwin and M. Alexander Bryan preistes, who vpon the first day of December last past were vnder pretence of highe treason moste iniuriously to the great lamentation generally of all good men, martired for the Catholike faith and religion.
Upon which occasion many good catholike gentlemen desirous to be eye witnesses of that which might hapen in the speach, demeinor, passage of those thrée rare paternes of piety, vertue, and innocencie, presented them selues at the place of execution, and my selfe a Catholike preist pressed to that bloodie spectacle, no dout a liuely sacrifice vnto God, and a sweete sauour vnto his Angels, with minde vpon occasion to referre uncerely and truly to my power this tragedie, with suche accidents as did hapen in the maner, and ende thereof.
Since which time, vpon request of some of my fellows and wrote those dealings, to answere and satisfie our aduersaries generally, to content comfort our persecuted brethren specially, and in part to diminishe those sinister rumors which are raysed against these good men by a notable and most infamous libel, entituled, An Aduertisement and defence for truth against her backbyters, and specially against the whispering fauorers and colorers of Campions, and the rest of his confederates treasons published there, and openly read, printed abrode without authoritie of seen aud alowed, a pamphlet, false, impudent, and farssed with lyes and vntruthes, only to colour and shadowe with some face of equitie those strange procedinges, my meaning is not to refute in spetial falsities, that shamfull aduertisment alredy generaly confutid in all mens consciences, and with priuate mutteringes even of the aduers parte them selues flatly condemned, for knowe, and all men are that those inocentes suffered only for religion for our fathers faith, and spirituall inheritance, for seruing god in priestly function and duties.
And not for treson, not for conspiring her highnesse death and ruin as it shal more clerly apere by their owne defence at the tyme of their arraignment, which will shortly be published as a testimonie, and expreste signification of their innocencie, together with their dispntations priuately had in the tower, argumentes of their learning and seale towardes this our natiue countrie, so devided dayly with nombers of newe faithes and religions, to the ruin and damnation of many our parentes, children, kinssolkes fréendes, for whose instruction saluation only these good men with infinite more haue offered, and as were, consecrated them selues to these daungers, and of our times.
But if vpon that defeuce of their doings stand long to the contrary, yet could not, when all were done, saye more then other men haue already by whom is declared howe our doings and labours in these spiritual affayres, are misconstred, how truth is made treason, religion rebellion.
To whose bookes do referre my deare countrie men inwardly affected, or outwardly afflicted by the swete departure of these so so so vertuous Priests, of whose innocencie, dutiful purposes, demeinors, and attemptes towards our natiue coun+trie, our parentes and friendes, notwithsta~ding that generall testimony of many lerned are further and most sure witnesse their disputation publikely chalenged, and by the aduerse part priuately performed, their answeres wise, and euen to the admiration of al men discrete at their arraignement, their resolute denial and plaine disclaming from all such practises surmised, and violently intended at their laste speach, and that assured vpon the peril of their souls, and lastly the disloyal and traterous practise of the aduers part, againste her highnes, her crowne, and state, againste her frendes, against some of her graue and wise, true and faithful Counselers, practised secretly, as by priuate speach of her maiesties subiectes generally is and manifeste, by some hollow harted freendes and flaterers vtered nowe, and no doubt if all were knowne, for some purpose broched by M. Norton nowe prisoner, who for the better face of his owne disloyalty and treason, procured these her maiesties true and moste loyal subiectes to be accused, condemned and executed for treason.
say no more, but half those wordes he vsed, wonld haue byn made playne expresse treason in pore Catholikes, howsoeuer some will seme to excuse them as rashe wordes.
Well here as wil answere for myne owne sonle before God mynde to write sincerly and simply a truth concerning the behauiour of these men at their departure, wherin of myne owne faith and fidilitie in reporting call witnes of those gentilmen who before the begining of this tragedie at Tiborne disputed of the motion of the Sunne from east to west which was violent which was natural, at whose backes the end of this pageant: mynded this end, and they know atended the same.
this do implie to remember those gentilmen of the manner, of the behauiour, meke, humble, constant and resolute of those honorable martirs, nowe no doubt daily intercessors for our miserable countrie, not douting but that, as they were then charitably moued and affected with compassion, so now they wil truely giue testimony of their innocencie and my fayth in relation.
Let therefore malice report treason, and sownde conspiracie, a practise euen from the infancie of religion and faith, to brede hatred to religious faithfull men, yet in al these inuentions of quarelling Lawyers in our doing in suche wise made treasonable, we for them and our selues by S. Paules example (who beeing charged before the ciuil magistrate, of conspiracy, and il demeinour towardes his countrey, protested that he was iudged concerning the resurrection, a question in religion, and not for sedition or concourse in tumults) doe crie to God and al Christian people which beheld their sufferance, and doe still sée our afflictions, that ye cause of their death and our extreme misery, is meerely and only religion, no treason, no vnduetifulnes to our Prince, no disobedience to her temporal laws, howsoeuer they who maligne our fayth and Priesthood, haue by these Macheuilian practises drawen al our doinges, ententes, and endeuours to disloyalty and treason: by which meanes were lately condemned thirtene preistes, and one lay man, agaynste lawe, equitie, conscience, without special euidence, vpon general presumption, by testimony of three or foure lewde Apostates, vnlawful persons, and notoriously infamed.
This is vox populi and was at the time of their arraignement expresly proued, howsoeuer this namelesse Aduertiser doth without shame most falsly affirme the contrary.
But to my purpose, which is to intimat and the behauiour, speches, and protestation of these so lerned rare men.
It is not vnknowen that M. Edmund Campion Iesuite Preist, a man reputed and taken, and by diuers his coequals plainlye confessed the flewer of Oxforde for that time he studied there, and since abrode in foreine countries one in whom our countrey hath had great honor, the frute of his vertue, and giftes, whiche as they were in his childhood here among vs wonderful, so they were abrode, as in Italy, Germany and Bohemia an honor to our country, a glasse and mirror, a light and lanterne, a paterne and example to youth, to age, to lerned, to vnlerned, to religious, and to the laytie of al sort, state, condition, of modestie, grauitie, eloquence, knowledge, vertue, and pietie, of which iust and due commendation, some of our aduersaries can giue true and testimonie, who after diligent sifting and enquiring of his life, maners, and demeinor, found nothing faulty, nothing worthy of blame.
This man M. Campion say) first mekely yelded himself and his carkasse to this butcherie, with such humility corage, as moued most beholders to compassion and pity.
Those speches he vsed in the way to diuers calling and crying vnto him, leaue (my selfe not able to make relation therof) to common report, or to that mans testimonie, who eyther for pity or affection wiped his face defiled with durt, as he was drawen most miserably through thick and thin, as the saying is, to the place of execution: for whiche charity, and happily some sodein moued affection, God rewarde him, and blesse him.
What he spake openly, that my meaning is to set down truly, my selfe béeing present and very nere, as hard by Syr Frances Knoles the Lorde Howard, Syr Henry Lee and other Gentlemen then gathered there to see and heare him.
And here wil omit, althogh it be very much material, his vsage in time of imprisonment, his constant patience in his rackinges, and after his conde~nation by report of some very nere to him, his fiue days fast fro~ te~poral bodily sustenance, his abstinence from slepe and ordinary rest, which was before his death by credible report of some, continued two nightes, bestowed in meditation prayer.
Who after many conflictes and agonies, ioyfully comming to receiue his reward and crowne, the kingdome of heauen, an enheritance certayne to such, who in this life refuse the worlde, thinges worldly, themselues for Christes sake, after some small pawse in the carte, with graue countenance and swéete voyce stoutly spake as followeth.
Spectaculum facti sumus Deo, Angeli, hominibus saying, These are the wordes of S. Paule, Englished thus: We are made a spectacle, or a sight vnto God, vnto his Angels, and vnto men: verified this day in me, who am here a spectacle vnto my lorde god, a spectacle vnto his angels, vnto you men.
And here going forwarde in this text, was interuptid cut of by Syr Frauncis Knowles and the earnestly vrging him to confesse his treason against her maiestie, and to acknowledge himself gilty.
To whom he answered You haue now what you do desire, besech you to haue patience suffer me to speake a woorde or too for discharge of my conscience.
But beiug not suffered to go forward, gaue answere to that point they alwayes vrged, that he was giltlesse innocent of all treason and conspiracie, crauing credit to be geuen to this answere, as to his last answere made vpon his death soule: adding that touching this poynt both the Iurie might be deceauid, and more also put in the evidence then was true: notwithstanding he forgaue, as he would be forgeuen, desiring all them to forgeue him whome he had confessed vpon the racke.
Further he declared the meaning of a sent by him self in time of his imprisonment out of the Tower, in which he wrote, he would not the secretes of some houses where he had bin interteined, affirming on his soule, that the secretes he in that letter, were as some them, treason, or conspiracy, or any matter els any way intended against her Maiestie or the state, but saying of Masse, hearing of confession, preaching, and such like duties and functions of Priests: this he protested to be true, as he would answere before God.
Then he desired Syr Francis Knowles and some other of nobility, to heare him touching one Richardson co~demned about a booke of his, and ernestly besought them to haue consideration of that man, saying, he was not that Ri+chard son which brought his booke, this he affirmed with vehement protestation vpon his death.
Then one Hearne a seolemaster, as lerned after, red the new Aduertisement openly with lowde voyce vnto the people, published only to colour so manifest and iniury: M. Campion al the time of his reading deuoutlye praying Notwithstanding which ad+uertisement or defence of theirs, aswel bicause they their own pocie in publication therof, as that they did also better colour or faster for their procedings, pressed him to declare his opinion of Pius quintus Bull concerning thexcommunication of our Soueraigne and queene.
But being asked whether he renounced the Pope, said he was a Catholike: whereupon one inferred, saying: In your Catholisisme (I noted the worde) al is conteined.
In fine, preparing himself to drinke his last draght of Christ his cup, was interrupted in his prayer by a minister, willing him to saye, Christ haue mercy vpon me, or suche like prayer with him: vnto whom he looking backe with milde countenance, humbly saide.
You and are not one in religion, wherfore pray you content your selfe, barre none of prayer, only desire them of the houshold of faith to pray with in mine agony to say one Crede
Some also called vpon him to praye in to whom he answered, that he would pray in a language that he wel vnderstood.
At the vpshot of this conflict he was willed to aske the queene forgeuenes, and to praye for her.
He meekely answered: wherein haue offended her? In this am innocent, this is my laste speache, in this geue me credite, haue and do pray for her.
Then did the Lorde Charles Howard aske of him: For which quéene he prayed, whether for Elizabeth quéene.
To whom he answered, Yea for Elizabeth your queene, and my queene, vnto whom wish a long quiet raigne, with all prosperity.
And so he meekely and sweetly yelded his soule vnto his Sa+uiour, protesting that he dyed a perfect Catholike.
M. Campion hauing thus triumfed on the world, the flesh, the diuell, and receiued his long desired crown, M. Rodulph Sherwine a stoute, wise discret, and lerned Preist, was brought vnto the cart, a man so so febled with fasting, watching, and suche like spirituall exercise, as was wonderful vnto suche, who had conuersed with him before his imprisonment.
He standing vpon the carte, with closed eyes, with lifted vp to heauen in contemplation and prayer, al men marking his demeinor, with milde voyce first made this demaund: Doth the people expect that should speake? Being answered of many, and some of nobilitie, yea, yea, with stoute courage and strong voyce saide: Then first thanke the omnipotent and most mercifull God the father for my creation, my swéete and louing sauiour Christ Iesus for my redemption, and the holy Ghoste for my sanctification, three persons and one God.
After this thanks geuing vnto the holy and blessed trinity, entring in discourse of his faith, his condemnation and death, was interrupted and stayed by Sir Frauncis Knowles and the sherifs, saying You haue declared your faith, we know it, come to the poynt, and confesse your treason disloyalty towardes your Prince.
And being stil vrged, answred, wil not belye my selfe, for so should condemne mine owne soule.
And although haue confusion in this world yet doubt not of my saluation in Christ Iesus, in whom only looke to be saued, and in whose death, passion, and bloud only trust: and so made a sweete prayer to Iesus, acknowledging the imperfection, misery and sinfull wretchednes of his owne nature, still protesting his innocency from al treason and traiterous practises, and that his going out of this Realme beyonde the seas, was onely for his soules health, to lerne to saue his soule And being againe interrupted by Sir Frauncis Knowles said in this wise: Tush, tush, you and shal answere this before an other Iudge, where my innoce~cy shal be knowen, you see that am guiltles of this.
Wherevpon Sir Frauncis saide, We knowe you are no contriuer or doer of this treason, for you are no man of armes, but you are a traytor by consequence.
miserable consequence, that hath depriued vs of so worthye members, and is like to imbrue our country nation with much innocent bloud, do not our Soueraigne and quéene deny the same so strangely inferred vpon no premisses, and turne her Highnesse hande of indignation from many our afflicted brethren, her hart to wonted mercy and clemencie towards her true, loyal, and naturall Catholike subiectes.
But to Sherwine who boldly answered, If to be a Catholike onely, if to be a perfecte Catholike, be to be a traytor, then (said he) am a traytor.
After which wordes being by authoritie debarred of further speach, he sayd, forgeue al, who either by general presumption, or particuler error haue procured my death, and so deuoutly prayed vnto Iesus: after which prayer Be was vrged to speake his opinion touching the said bull of Pope Pius to which poynt he gaue no answere.
Then beeing willed to pray for the queenes Maiesty, answered, haue and do.
At which wordes the Lords Howard againe asked, which quéene he ment, whether Elizabeth queene? to whom somewhat smiling he sayd, yea for Elizabeth queene, nowe at this instant pray my Lorde God to make her his seruant in this life, and after this life coheir with Christ Iesus.
When he had prayed to God to make her his seruant, there were, which said openly, that he ment, to make her a Papist, to whom he boldly replied, Els God forbid.
And so collecting himself to prayer, dyed paciently, stoutly, and mildly, crying, Iesus, Iesus, Iesus, esto mihi Iesus
Here can not omit a practise of some of our yong masters, slaunderously geuen ont against M. Sherwin dreamed by them of his wordes here, as that he dyed a protestant, because he disclaiming from the wretchednes of his owne mortalitie, and nature, reposed himselfe wholy vpon Christ and his passion.
These minions would, no doubt, make Catholiks monsters in poyntes of religion and faith, and do labour to perswade the people, that the Catholike religion doth euacuate the comfort of our fraylties and price of our souls, the sheding of Christes moste pretious bloud, in which we do acknowledge all our suffitiency, and in which only as the sole foundation spring and cause of all merit, the merite of all our wel doing, so iniuriouslie to Christe his passion abolished by protestants, is, hath, and shal be by vs maintayned, not againste these naked solifidians onely, but euen againste the gates of hell.
What web soeuer some sottish weauer or sutch like shall weaue in the meane tyme of a suposid suttelty touching iustification in M. Sherwins woordes here vttered, his fyne suppose is coming out with great labour and much ado and all not woorthe a rush.
Truly it is a world to sée the raggid rable of these petti pratres who since M. Campions imprisonment and death, haue caste vp their chargid gorge againste priesthoode, priests and the societie of Iesus, who yf it would please her Highnes and her honorable Counsel to lay open ether or print, would shortly plums these in suche short, that their nakednes aparantly discouerd, wold shew them in their kind then should nether Haer, Whitakers, Fyld, Keltrigh, Eliot, kogging Munday riming Elderton and Iohn Nichols the disciple of Bawdy Bale all worshipful writers at this time Preistes and Iesuites, so daunse in their nettes, as now by sway of time they do, to the great hurte of insute innocent soules then should not William Wiborns Magg Howlet (a false and malicious practise of fewe melancholike heretikes first broched, and now renued by him selfe to diminish the credite and autoritie of Councels) flye free in the day from pursuite and wonder of other birds: at whom nowe with the rest think the lerned and wise Catholike will looke and laugh, as not worthy of refutation answere, howsoeuer some yonger scoler may sho+rtly exercise him selfe in reply vpon him whom all Englishe Catholikes (as they say) can not answere.
After these two glorious Martirs, was brought vnto his martirdome M. Alexander Brian a man although in lerning knowledge inferior to them, yet equal in patience, constancie and humilitie, whose pressures in prison and tortures, strange dare say, among heathens, more monstrous among Christians, may be thought vncredible, and are signified vnto his brethren abrode by him selfe.
To omit his rackings, what practise was it of vncharitable Protestants to put pinnes vnder his nayles? What hart could sée his famine so extreme, that for his corporal sustenanse he was driuen to lick the moysture of walls? His vsage is abrode in mens hands, written by him selfe, a of their cruell and harde hartes, who in sutche wise abused a sacred prieste of God.
Being in the cart prepared to death, began first to declare his bringing vp in the Catholike faith religion, his being in Oxford vpon whiche worde he was stayed by one, saiing: What haue we to do with Oxford come to the purpose, and confesse thy treason.
Wherupon he answered, am not guyltye of any suche death, was neuer at Rome nor then at Rhemes when D. Sanders came into Ireland To this ende he spake and protested, as he woulde answere before God.
He spake not much, but where as he was vrged more then the other to speke what he thought of the said Bull of Pius quintus he sayd he did beleue of it as al Catholiks and the Catholike faith doth, and therupon protesting him selfe to dye a true catholike, saying Miserere mei Deus was deliuered of the carts with more payn by negligence of the hangman the~ either of the other, who after his beheading, himself dismembred, his hart bowels and intrels burned, to the gret admiration of some, being layd vpon the blocke his bellye downward, lifted vp his wholy body then remayning from the grounde: and this adde vpon report of others, not mine owne sight.
Here you haue the speach and demeinor of these three martirs at their last hower, and in their last breth, of the true report whereof doe referre my selfe vnto diuers of nobility and worship, vnto those gallant and braue courtiers who beheld and hard the same, who their innocency so punished, who commen+ded their death so patie~tly sustained, who through mere pittye procured them fauor, and preuented the bloudy purposes of some cruel tormenters: for which fauour God rewarde that Gentleman, who after M. Sherwin was put from the cart, turned back and said, This man was a wise man.
God, say, rewarde him, God encrease his honour, God make him a sheepe of his foulde, a childe of his Church, God boord him in that arke which hath, doth, and shal preserue al Christs folowers from the floud and deluge, in which only is grace, security, and saluation, out of whiche is nought but desperate miserie, perdition.
To conclude, vpon this occasion hane not thoght impertinent to remember al Catholikes, and specially vs Preistes, of some woordes of a lerned and famous Doctor, whiche to this ende haue, as it foloweth, gathered out of his exhortation to martirdome, largely and sweetely deliuered vs in an Apologye of the English Seminaries: That as the cause, not the paine, or persecution, (whereof our Heretikes only vaunt them selues) iustifieth all men: so Christ, and these good mens, consciences formed in al pietie, mekenesse, and modesty, so their last protestation, washed, sealed, confirmed with their blood, so their resolute death for religion, for our faith, for the church, no doubt by Gods grace shal animat and strengthen vs, who remayne eyther in the furnace of Gods probation, or in the burden or broyle of this hote haruest of our Lorde, or by suer treading, threshing, and winewing, are laide vp for well tried wheate in the barne floore of Christes Church.
And further may moue her Maiesties hart to haue compassion, maye open her graue Counselors eyes to see our innocency, may alter our enemies and ill informers mindes to loue and charitie, may stirre vp the minds of al men inwardly in conscience to co~sider the cause of our sufferance, affliction, imprisonments, and giue them such sense, reason, and religion, that they may acknowledge our vndeserued calamities: saye, this may the deathes of so good and holy martirs worke, as they did sufficiently testifie, that they were not acquainted with any conspiracie against our Prince and country, but did suffer for the honor, peace, and vnitie of the Churche, for sauing of their soules, and the soules of our beloued parentes, children, friendes, for the defence of Christes priesthood and souerainty in earth, for his eternall sacrifice and sacramentes, who moue the hart of our noble Prince to tender her true and trustiest subiects afflicted Catholikes.
caueat to the reader touching A, his discouery Anthony Munday, or as it is [not without some consideration] thought, that some macheuillian in mnndayes name hath shufled out of late a Discouery of Campions his confederates treasons, the same in effect substance with the aduertisment before rehearesed.
My self considering this neiwe hatched discouery to peepe out by sene alowed: haue thought good in the conclusion of this reporte for the more credit of this his discours to aduertise the reader, of the qualities and conditions of this davus, so rayling aud rauing at uertuous and good men deseassed, that there by he may the better Iudge and value the truthe of that neiwe pamphlet which hathe byn perused by no wurs man then by M, Norton a supposed traytor in the towre, and nowe deliuered ont by munday, who first was a stage player [no donbt a calling of some creditt] after an aprentise which tyme he wel semed with deceauing of his master then wandring towardes Italy, by his owne report became a coosener in his iourney.
Comming to Rome, in his short abode there; vvas charitably relieued, but neuer admitted in the seminary as he pleseth to lye in the title of his booke, and being wery of well doing, returned home to his first vomite againe.
omite to declare howe this scholler new come out of Italy did play extempore, those gentlemen and others whiche were present, can best giue witnes of his dexterity, who being wery of his folly, hissed him from his stage.
Then being therby discouraged, he set forth a balet against playes, but yet (O constant youth) he now beginnes againe to ruffle vpon the stage.
omit among other places his behauior in Barbican with his good mistres, and mother, from whe~ce our superintendent might fetch him to his conrt, were it not for loue (I woulde saye slannder) to their gospel.
Yet thinke it not amiss to remember thee of this boyes infelicitie two seueral wayes of late notorious.
First he writing vpon the death of Euerard Haunse, was immediatly controled and disproued by one of his owne hatche. and shortely after seting forth the aprehension of M. Campion, was disproued by George (I was about to saye) Iudas Eliot, who writing against him, proued that those thinges he did were for very lucers sake only, and not for the truthe, althogh he himself be a person of the same predicament, of whom muste say, that if felony be honesti, then he may for his behauiore be taken for a laweful witnes againste so good men.
al which considred, wishe the to think that the credit of this discourser (at the time of their arraignment an ac+cuser) shuld be such as in euery indiffer+ent mans iugement we know and see by experience the accusers report against the accused doth deserue.
Therfore good reader examine this mans honesti so reported, snspend thy iugement against these good preists, vntill by gods grace the whol maner course, and order, araignment, accnsation, condemnation, and answeres, shal come forth, which is shortly inte~ded for thy benefite and satisfaction.
Vpon the death of M. Edmund Campion, one of the societie of the holy name of Iesus.
WHy do vse my paper inke, and penne, and call my wits to connsel what to say, such memories were made for mortall men, speak of Saints whose names can not decay: an Angels trumpe were fitter for to found their glorious death, if such on earth wer found.
Pardon my want, offer nought but will, their register remaineth safe aboue, Campion exceedes the compasse of my skill, yet let me vse the measure of my loue, and giue me leaue in lowe and homeli his hye attempts in England to rehearse.
He came by vow, the cause to conquer sinne, his armour prayer, the word his targe shield, his co~fort heauen, his spoyle our soules to win, the diuel his foe, the wicked world the field, his triumph ioy, his wage eternall blis, his captaine Christ, which euer blessed is.
From ease to paine, from honour to disgrace, from loue to hate, to daunger being wel, from safe abode to feares in euery place, contemning death to saue our soules from hel, our new Apostle comming to restore the faith which Austine planted here before.
His natures flowres were mirt with herbes of grace, his mild behauior tempered wel with skil, a lowly minde possest a learned place, a sugred speach a rare and vertuous wil, asaintlike man was set on earth below, the seede of truth in hartes to sow.
With tung pen the truth he taught wrote, byforce wherof they came to Christ apace, but when it pleased God, it was his lote he should be thrald, he lent him so much grace, his patience then did worke as much or more, as had his heauenly speeches done before.
His fare was hard, yet mild sweet his chéere, his prison close, yet frée and lose his minde, his torture great, yet small or none his feare, his offers but nothing could him blinde.
constant man, mind, vertue strange, whom want, nor wo, nor feare, nor hope coulde change.

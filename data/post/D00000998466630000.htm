In Hodge lether bryches her needle shee lost· When Diccon the bedlem had hard by report That good Ga~mer Gurton was in thys sorte, He quyetly perswaded with her in that stound Dame Chat her deare gossyp this needle had found, Yet knew shee no more of this matter (alas) Then knoeth Tom our clarke what the Priest saith at masse Here of there ensued so fearfull a fraye, Mas Doctor was sent for these gossyps to staye, Because he was Curate, and estemed full wyse Who found that he sought not, by Diccous deuice, When all thinges were tombled and cleane out of fassion Whether it were by fortune, or some other constellacion Sodenlye the neele Hodge found by the prickynge And drew it out of his bottocke where he felt it stickynge Theyr hartes then at rest with perfect securytie, With a pot of good nale they stroake vp theyr plauditie.
Diccon MAny a myle haue walked, diuers and sundry wai

That euer saw a sorte, in such a plyght As here within this house to my There is howlynge and adamye, With whewling and pewling, as though they had lost a trump Syghing and sobbing, they weepe and they wayle maruell in my mynd, what the deuill they ayle The olde Trot syts groning, with alas and alas, And Tib wringes her hands, and takes on in worse case With poore Cocke theyr boye, they be dryuen in such fyts feare mee the folkes be not well in theyr wyts, Aske them what they ayle, or who brought them in this staye? They aunswer not at all, but alacke and welaway Whan saw it booted not, out at doores hyed mee And caught a slyp of Bacon, when saw that none spyed mee, Which intend not far hence, vnles my purpose fayle Shall serue for a shoinghorne to draw on two pots of ale.
Hodge SEe so cham arayed with dablynge in the durt She that set me to ditchinge, ich wold she had the squrt Was neuer poore soule that such a life had? Gogs bones thys vylthy glaye hase drest mee to bad Gods soule, see how this stuffe teares Iche were better to bee a Bearward and set to keepe Beares By the Masse here is a gasshe, a shamefull hole in deade And one stytch teare furder, a man may thruste in his heade.
Diccon By my fathers soule Hodge, if shulde now besworne can not chuse but say thy breech is foule be torne, But the next remedye in such a case and hap Is to plaunche on a piece, as brode as thy cap.

Hodge Nay, but ich saw such a wonder as ich saw nat this· vii. yere Tome Tannkards Cow (be gogs bones) she set me vp her saile And flynging about his halfe aker fysking with her taile, As though there had ben in her ars a swarme of Bees, And chad not cryed tphrowh hoore, shead lept out of his Lees.
Diccon Why Hodg lies the connyng in Tom tankards cowes taile? Hodge Well ich chaue hard some say such tokens do not fayle, But cast yu not till in faith Diccon, why she frownes or wher at Hath no man stolne her Ducks or Henes, or gelded gyb her Cat Diccon What deuyll can tell man, cold not haue one word They gaue no more hede to my talk then thou woldst to a lorde Hodge Iche can not styll but muse, what meruaylous thinge it is Chyll in and know my selfe what matters are amys.

Hodge Lae cham not very glad, to see her in this dumpe Cholde a noble stole hath fallen, shee hath broke her rumpe Tyb.
Nay and were the worst, we wold not greatly care For of her huckle bone, or breakyng of her Chaire, But greatter, greater, is her grief, as hodge we shall all feele.

Sir answer me to this, is thy head whole or broken? Chat· Yea master Bayly, blest be good token.
Hodge Is my head whole? ich warra~t you, tis neither scuruy nor seald What you foule beast, does think tis either or bald.
Nay ich thanke god: chil not for al that thou maist That chad one scab on my narse, as brode as thy fingers end.
By our Lady here is no harme, Hodges head is hole ynough, for al dame Chats charme.
By gogs blest, how euer the thing he clockes or smolders, know the blowes he away, either wt head or shoulders, Camest yu not knaue within this houre, creping into my pens And there was caught within my hous, gropi~g among my hens.
Hodge ¶A plage both on thy hens the, a carte a carte, Chould were ha~ged as hie as a tree, chware as false as yu art Geue my ga~mer again her yu stole away in thy lap.
Ga~mer Yea maister baily there is a thing, you know not on may hay This drab she kepes away my good, ye deuil he might her snare Ich pray you that ich might haue, a right action on her.
Haue thy good old filth, or any such old am as true, wold thou knew, as skin betwene thy browes Ga~mer Many a truer hath be~ hanged, though you escape the daunger Chat, Thou shalt answer by gods pity, for this thy foule slaunder.
Why, what ca~ ye charge hir to say so, ye do not well.
Ga~mer Mary a ve~geance to hir hart, whore hase stoln my neele.
Thy nedle old witch, how so? it were thy scul to knock So didst thou say, the other day, that had stolne thy Cock And rosted him to my breakfast, which shal not be forgotten, The deuil pul out thy lying tong, and teeth that be so rotten.
Ga~mer ¶Geue me my neele, as for my cocke, chould be very loth That chuld here tel he shuld hg, on thy false faith and Baily.
Your talke is such, can arse who shuld be most in Ga~mer shal ye nd no other wight, saue e, by bred salt Baily.
Kepe ye content a while· se that your songes ye holde, Me thinkes you shuld remembre, this is no place to scolde· How knowest thou ga~mer gurton, dame Chat thy nedle Ga~mer To name you sir the party, chould not be very glad.
¶Yea but we must nedes heare it, therfore say it boldly.
Ga~mer Such one as told the tale, full soberly and coldly, Euen he that loked on, wil sweare on a booke: What time this drunken goip, my faire ng neele vp tooke Diccon (master) the Bedlam, cham very sure ye know him.
false knaue by Gods pitie, ye were but a foole to trow him, durst auenture wel the price of my cap, That when the end is knowen, all wil turne to a iape, Tolde he not you that besides, she stole your Cocke that tyde· Ga~mer No master no indede, for then he shuld haue lyed, My cocke is thanke Christ, safe and wel a fine.
Yea but that ragged colt, that whore that tyb of thine Said plainly thy cocke was stolne, in my house was eaten, That lying cut is lost, that she is not swinged and beaten, And yet for al my good name, it were a small amendes picke not this geare (hearst thou) out of my But he that hard it told me, who thou of late didst name Diccon whom al men knowes, it was the very same.
This is the case, you lost your nedle about the dores And she answeres againe, she hase no cocke of yours, Thus in you talke and Action, from that you do intend, She is whole fiue mile wide, from that she doth defend: Will you saie she hath your Cocke? Ga~mer No sir that chil not, Bayly.
Ga~mer Soft by the way, Ye know she could do and she not say nay.
Yea he that made one lie about your Cock stealing, Wil not sticke to make another, what time lies be in dealing weene the ende wil proue, this brawle did first arise, Upon no other ground, but only Diccons lyes.
Though some be lyes as you belike haue espyed them.
Yet other some be true, by proof haue wel tryed them.
Mary syr euen this, The tale tolde before, the selfe same tale it was his, He gaue me like a frende, warning against my loe, Els had my hens be stolne, eche one, by Gods crosse: He tolde me Hodge wold come, and in he came indeede, But as the matter with greater hast then speede, This truth was said, and true was found, as truly report.
¶If Doctor Rat be not deceiued, it was of another sort.
By Gods mother thou and he, be a cople of suttle foxes, Betweene you and Hodge.
beare away the bores, Did not dicco~ apoynt the place, wher yu shuldst sta~d to mete him.
¶Yes by the masse, if he came, bad me not sticke to speet hym. D. Rat.
Gods sacrament the villain knaue hath drest vs round about, He is the cause of all this brawle, that dyrty shitten loute: When gammer gurton here complained, made a ruful mone heard him sweare yt you had gotten, hir that was gone, And this to try he furder said, he was ful how be it He was content with small adoe, to bring me where to see it.
And where ye sat, he said ful certain, if wold folow his read Into your house a priuy way, he wold me guide and leade, And where ye had it in your hands, sewing about a clowte, And set me in the backe hole, therby to finde you out: And whiles sought a quietnes, creping vpon my knees, found the weight of your dore bar, for my reward and fees, Such is the lucke that some men gets, while they begin to mel In setting at one such as were out· minding to make al wel. Hodge Was not wel blest ga~mer, to scape ye chad ben there The~ chad ben drest be like, as ill by the masse, as gaar vicar.
Mary sir, here is a sport alone, loked for such an end If diccon had not playd the knaue, this had ben sone amend My gammer here he made a foole, and drest hir as she was And good wife Chat he set to scole, till both partes cried alas, And D. Rat was not behind, whiles Chat his crown did pare, wold the knaue had be~ starke blind, hodg had not his share.
Hodge Cham meetly wel sped alredy amongs, cham drest like a coult And chad not had the better wit, chad bene made a
Sir knaue make hast diccon were here, fetch him where euer he bee Chat.
Fie on the villaine, fie, fie, yt makes vs thus agree, Ga~mer Fie on him knaue, with al my hart, now fie, and fie againe.
Now fie on him may best say, whom he hath almost slaine.
¶Lo where he commeth at hand, belike he was not fare Diccon heare be two or three, thy company can not spare.
Diccon God blesse you, and you may be blest so many al at once Chat.
Come knaue, it were a good deed to geld the by cockes bones Seest not thy handiwarke· sir Rat can ye forbeare him? Diccon ve~geance on those hands lite, for my ha~de cam not nere hym The horsen priest hath lift the pot, in some of these alewyues chayres That his head wolde not serue him, belyke to come downe the stayres.
Nay soft, thou maist not play ye knaue, haue this language to If thou thy tong bridle a while, the better maist thou do, Confesse the truth as shall aske, and cease a while to fable.
And for thy fault promise the, thy handling shalbe reasonable Hast thou not made a lie or two, to set these by the eares? Diccon What if haue· fiue hundred such haue seene within these seuen yeares: am sory for nothing else but that see not the sport Which was betwene them whe~ they met, as they the~selues report Bayly.
The greatest thing master rat, ye se how he is drest.
What deuil nede he be groping so depe, in good wife Chats he~s nest Bayly.
Yea but it was thy drift to bring him into briars.
Gods bread, hath not such an old foole, wit to saue his eares? He showeth himselfe herein ye see, so very a coxe, The Cat was not so madly alured by the Foxe, To run into the snares, was set for him doubtlesse, For he leapt in for myce, and this sir Iohn for madnes.
Well and ye shift no better, ye losel, lyther, and la, will go neare for this, to make ye leape at a Dasye.
In the kings name master Bayly, charge you set him fast.
What fast at cardes, or fast on slepe? it is the thing did last.
Nay fast in fetters false varlet, according to thy deedes.
Master doctor ther is no remedy, must intreat you needes Some other kinde of punishment, D. Rat.
His punishme~t if may iudg, shalbe naught els but the gallous.
That were to sore, a spiritual man to be so extreame.
Is he worthy any better, sir how do ye iudge and deame? Bayly.
graunt him wortie punishment, but in no wise so great.
Ga~mer It is a shame ich tel you plaine, for such false knaues intreat He has almost vndone vs al, that is as as steele· And yet for al this great a do'cham neuer the nere my neele.
Canst yu not say any thing to that diccon, wish least or most· Diccon Yea mary sir, thus much can say wel, the nedle is lost.
Nay canst not thou tel which way, that nedle may be found Diccon No by my fay sir. though might haue an hundred pound.
Hodge Thou lier didst not say the neele wold be gitten? Diccon No hodge, by the same token, you where that time be For feare of Hobgobling, you wot wel what meane, As long as it is sence, feare me yet ye be scarce cleane.
Wel master rat, you must both learne, teach vs to forgeue Since Diccon hath confession made, is so cleane shreue, If ye to me conscent, to amend this heauie chaunce.
wil inioyne him here, some open kind of penaunce: Of this condition, where ye know my fee is twenty pence For the bloodshed, am agreed with you here to dispence, Ye shal go quite, so that ye graunt, the matter now to run, To end with mirth emong vs al, euen as it was begun.
Say yea master vicar, he shal sure confes to be your dotter And al we that be heare present, wil loue you much the better D. Rat.
My part is the worst, but since you al here on agree.
Go euen to master Bayly· let it be so for mee, Bayly.
How saiest thou diccon, art content this shal on me depend Diccon Go to M. Bayly say on your mind, know ye are my frend· Bayly.
¶Then marke ye wel, to recompence this thy former action Because thou hast offended al, to make them satisfaction, Before their faces, here kneele downe, as shal the teach.
For thou shalt take on othe, of hodges leather breache First for master Doctor, vpon paine of his Where he wil pay for al· thou neuer draw thy pure.
And when ye at one pot, he shall haue the first pull, And thou shalt neuer offer him the cup, but it be full.
To good wife thou shalt be sworne, euen on the same wyse If refuse thy money once, neuer to offer it twise.
Thou shalt be bound by the same here, as thou dost take it When thou maist drinke of free cost, thou neuer forsake it: For gammer gurtons sake, againe sworne shalt thou bee To helpe hir to hir againe if it do lie in thee And likewise be bound: by the vertue of that To be of good abering to Gib hir great Cat: Last of al for Hodge, the othe to scanne, Thou shalt neuer take him, for fine gentleman.
Hodge Come on fellow Diccon chalbe euen with thee now.
Bayly Thou wilt not sticke to do this Diccon trow.
Diccon No by my fathers skin, my hand downe lay it? as haue promised, wil not denay it, But Hodge take good heede now, thou do not beshite me.
Hodge ¶Gogs hart thou false villaine dost thou bite Bayly What Hodge doth he hurt the or euer he begin.
Hodge He thrust me into the buttocke, with a bodkin or a pin, saie Gammer, Gammer? Ga~mer How now Hodge, how now: Hodge Gods Gammer gurton.
Ga~mer The deuil sonne, god blesse vs. Hodge Chould iche were hanged Gammer.
Ga~mer Mary se ye might dresse vs. Hodge haue it by the masse Gammer Ga~mer What not my neele Hodge? Hodge ¶Your Neele Gammer, your neele.
Hodge Cha neele Gammer, here in my hand be it.
Ga~mer For al the loues on earth Hodge, let me see it.
Ga~mer Nay Hodge say truth, and do not me begile.
Hodge Cham sure on it ich warrant you: it goes no more a stray Ga~mer Hodge when speake so faire: wilt stil say me Hodge Go neare the gammer this wel in faith good lucke: Chwas almost vndone: twas so far in my buttocke Ga~mer Tis min owne deare neele Hodge, sykerly wot Hodge Cham not a good sonne gammer, cham not, Ga~mer Christs blessing light on thee, hast made me for euer Hodge Ich knew that ich must finde it, els choud a had it neuer Chat.
By my troth Gopy gurton, am euen as glad As though mine owne selfe as good a turne had: Bayly.
¶And by my concience, to see it so come forth, Reioyce so much at it, three nedles be worth.
Diccon Nor much the gladder for al this noyce: Yet say gramercy Diccon, for springing of the game.
Ga~mer Gramercy Diccon twenty times, how glad cham, If that chould do so much, your masterdome to come hether, Master Rat, good wife Chat, and Diccon together: Cha but one half peny, as far as iche know it, And chil not rest this night, till ich bestow it.
If euer ye loue me, let vs go in and drinke.
am content if the rest thinke as thinke· Rat it shalbe best for you if we so doo, Then shall you warme you and drse your self too.
Diccon Soft syrs, take vs with you, the company shalbe the more, As proude coms behinde they say, as any goes before, But now my good masters since we must be gone And leaue you behinde vs, here all alone: Since at our last ending, thus mery we bee, For Gammer Gurtons nedle sake, let vs haue a

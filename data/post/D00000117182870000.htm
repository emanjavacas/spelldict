ch
which has been since continued by several subsequent acts it was enacted that there should be paid to his said majesty his heirs and successors by every hawker pedlar and every other trading person going from town to town or to other mens houses and travelling either on foot or with horse horses except as therein is excepted carrying to sell or exposing to sale any goods wares or merchandises the yearly sum of
and upon payment or giving security for the duty in such manner as is thereby directed a license was to be granted to him or her so to travel or trade
and if any such hawker pedlar should be found trading as aforesaid without such license such person should for every offence forfeit one moiety to th informer the other to the poor of the parish which penalty was by warrant from a justice of the peace to be levied by distress and sale of the offender's goods
provided that the said act should not extend to hinder the real workers or makers of goods from carrying abroad or exposing to sale any goods of his or her making in any mart fair market or elsewhere
the makers and wholesale traders in english most of them living in the counties of bucks bedford and other adjacent counties usually come to london once a week to the where they have fixed certain shops and standings
and sometimes it so happens that they carry some goods to the houses or shops of milliners and other retailers who are their customers for which some of the said makers and wholesale traders have been informed against and forced to pay the penalty of altho it is apprehended that they are not hawkers pedlars or within the meaning of the said act for the reasons following
that by the said act such only were intended who had no fixed shops or standings where they carried on their trades but carried them on chiefly if not altogether by travelling from place to place
but the same was not intended to extend to those that chiefly or constantly kept and traded in certain shops or standings and only casually carried out some goods to the houses or shops of their customers
ii
that those who sell by wholesale to the retailers were never intended by the said act to be obliged to take licenses but only such as go from place to place to sell their goods by retail and only such can be intended or described by the names of pedlars or
iii
that they being makers as well as wholesale sellers of their manufacture are exempted by the clause in the said bill
n.b
that soon after the making the said act viz
march

upon the petition of edward hooton preferred to the house of commons complaining of the hardships put upon them as aforesaid
the consideration of the said petition was referred to a committee which committee made their report
and thereupon it was resolved that the workers of his her or their children apprentices servants or agents and all wholesale dealers in the said manufacture tho they go about from shop to shop to any of their customers who sell the same by retail again shall not be deem'd hawkers and pedlars by the said act of the ninth and tenth of his majesty's reign
the said makers and wholesale traders having lately been disturbed and prosecuted upon the pretences aforesaid a bill is now depending for their relief

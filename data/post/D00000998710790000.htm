a glimpse of joy for the happy restoring of the kings most excellent majesty or the devoir's of a nameless poet
to the generall's excellence and to all the noble sparks of great brittain's heroarchy that have hopes to survive their countreys sufferings

figure figure portrait of charles ii

what glimpse is that see a rising sun let us with joy like hyperboreans run to tops of highest mounts that thence we may ken the first dawning of our welcome day let every eccho cry a king a king to welcome in the flower of our spring our hopes are high let's not be dampt with fears when in it he that's king of kings appears this change is so like his that all can tell who will not own it must turn infidel
this work of wonder makes our land to ring he that was born is now created king
let's not complain of winter and cold weather if now two grateful summers come together on sions mount let sacred glory dwell and plume its rayes in spight of rome and hell
let from the fathers aromatick urne like a resurging phenix charles return

peers stand for ciphers now alas but when that figure stands before they'l stand for men and statue it no longer skelitons will stand for hundreds thousands millions

churches awake rouze up what had you rather a stepdame have then your own nursing father

countreys awake and do not give a voice to such as will not make a king their choice

lawyers awake for have heard a cry that since you lost the spring your streams are dry

souldiers awake and hazard not a limb except you militate for christ and him all's out of joynt and each profession dead for what's a man or state without a head

poets awake for when he's crown'd his rayes will turn to gold your coronets of bayes

awake dull souls brittains maecena's come shall any of parnassus sons be dumb

but stay our god is jealous and most high and hates the sin of anthropolatry then let's not idolize him lest he prove a gift bestow'd in anger not in love he is not so much ours yet but we may if still unthankful sin him quite away

let us adore that heavenly hand that gave isaack our nations blessing from the grave he was the harmless dove sent from our ark and ever since hath hover'd in the dark
let us pray since flouds begin to cease that he may bring our of peace

let wisdom mercy and each princely grace shine in his heart with splendour in his face let him descend like moses from the mount as sent from heav'n upon our prayers account oh may he in his government inherit like his leaders double spirit
give such physicians lord as may abate the paroxismes of our church and state

let's run as far to meet him as there's land and when the swelling ocean bids us stand let's wait upon the shore in trained bands which may in numbers equalize the sands let's wish all hearts of stone that would undo us were turn'd to to attract him to us

the sovereign of the sea's let now be man'd to fetch us home the sovereign of our land and since he hath been exil'd for our sin our pray'rs shall be the winde to bring him in and if the ocean be at ebbe and low our tears of joy shall swell it to a flow

let heart be joyn'd in heart and hand in hand till charles le boon be crowned charles le grand
act but with art and heart this loyal game you shall not want a trump to sound your fame

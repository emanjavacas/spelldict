a short view of the life and vertves of the avthovr

christian reader

thou hast here a taste of the doctrine of that reuerend prelate whom if thou knewest not in his life time suppose it concernes thee to bee acquainted with now as with a man rare and eminent for all kind of vertue naturall morall theologicall personall pastorall and indeed one of the examples of his time
if the lawes of a preface did permit so much suppose it would be a labour worth thy acceptance to giue thee a iust storie of his life whereof there is no part but would yeild thee good matter of imitation but leauing that to the pen of some able historian whom god may stirre vp to write a speciall uolume of the worthies of our age hold it my dutie to impart to thee some few of those obseruable passages concerning him which returned to my minde vpon the publishing of this worke not

doubting but that by the attentiue reading thereof thou mayest bee as well edified as by the worke it selfe

first then be thou pleased to take notice that this holy man hauing beene noursed vp from his tender age in the exercises of true pietie and in the studies of various and exquisite learning first in the famous schoole of winchester where he was placed a child and after in new colledge in oxford whether he was elected to bee a fellow was in his riper yeares aduanced to diuers eminent places of dignitie in the church not by any ambitious suit or seeking of his own but by the speciall and had almost said immediate prouidence of almightie god who beyond his expectation or desire raised him by insensible degrees to the heighth of episcopall dignitie thereby giuing vs one proofe among many that notwithstanding our great and manifold sinnes he hath not altogether abandoned the care of his church
for while this man by the naturall inclination and bent of his owne minde affected rather the

fruitfulnesse of the vine and the fatnesse of the oliue in a more priuate and retired life then to be a gouernour ouer the trees as appeared by his willing acceptance of a fellowship in the colledge neare winchester where for a time he liued and could haue beene contented to haue ended his dayes there in sweet contemplation if he had beene let alone
yet god that rules all things so disposed of him that one while by the conspiring votes of a numerous society hee was euen before he thought of it recalled to the wardenship of that

colledge whereof he had beene

formerly fellow another while by the speciall grace and fauour of his maiestie without any suite of his owne likewise preferred first to the prefecture of the hospitall of saint crosses neare winchester then to the deanerie of the cathedrall church of worcester and lastly to the bishopricke of bath and wels where he died

jn all which places of honour and employment first he forgate not the practice of those vertues whereof he had made shew in his more priuate life but continued the same in his rotchet which he had beene in his schollers gowne thereby shewing that his vertues were vertues indeed and that hee vsed them not as doe their vizards only to act a part in which being done they pull them off and cast them into a corner

jnstances of this kind may be first his humilitie the basis as it is well called of all vertue which being a fruit of true christian mortification and consisting in a of a mans selfe and his gifts he had studied so well in his younger yeares that in the whole course of his life afterwards there was no tumor of pride appeared but as well in his actions as in his speeches he euer

made himselfe equall with those of the lowest sort
and that notwithstanding the many temptations which hee had both from the eminencie of his place and excellencie of his parts to doe and speake otherwise

secondly from this and not from the goodnesse of his nature only though that were very good did

proceed that singular affabilitie and easinesse of accesse which he euer retained to all sorts of men and to those of his owne coate especially
there was no place nor time almost except it were his times of deuotion wherein hee might not bee spoken with by the meanest person and in his speech so farre as lawfully he might hee euer studied to giue the partie content so that although it were not in his power to grant euery mans suite for who can doe that yet thinke no man can say hee was euer sleighted or superciliously vsed by him


adde hereunto his rare tranquillitie and contentednesse of minde which though a man would thinke should agree best with an honourable and plentifull estate yet experience teacheth that it is farre otherwise
accesse of fortunes in most men rather enlargeth then satisfieth desire and new honours breed new ambitions besides the verie employment of great men occasioneth many troublesome disquieting thoughts which a priuate life is naturally free from
but this man hauing first framed his mind to haue true contentment in his more priuate fortunes retained the same temper in all the alterations of his estate so that whatsoeuer outwardly befell him either to the better or the worser part he seemed very little to be affected surely nothing disquieted therewithall
a strange serenitie of minde in him whereof take it also to haue beene a good argument that as haue often heard him say so long as he was in perfect health of his bodie he did neuer

dreame


but a speciall cause of that also may haue beene his great temperancie or rather austeritie in diet which was another vertue that hee retained from the time he first tasted uniuersitie commons vnto his dying day
for as at the greatest and best furnished meales whereat the condition of his place required his presence his feeding was commonly vpon one dish and that none of the daintiest so it is well knowne that when he was not hindered by the extraordinarie resort of strangers vnto him he fasted commonly foure times in the weeke from his supper and spent that time vntill eight or nine of the clocke at night in framing some meditation or other vpon a piece of holy scripture the copies of diuers whereof remained in his studie at his departure some few of which thou shalt find annexed to this worke for thy vse and benefit


as hee was in his diet so in his apparrell recreations and all other outward things belonging to this life a most sparing and temperate vser of gods blessings and that as well in his richer as in his meaner fortunes so that vnlesse it were in the companie of schollers and in such ingenious and pleasant discourses as are incident thereto wherein he would sometimes expresse much freedome of innocent mirth a man could not obserue that he tooke much delight in any wordly thing whatsoeuer an euident argument that his intellectuall part had the predominancy ouer his sensuall or rather indeed that grace ruled them both and that the man in him was subordinate to the christian

with these vertues did this good man come furnisht

to the episcopall chaire and being there hee kept them like as he did also his firme purpose of single life which though it be not of it selfe a vertue

but a state yet he that could liue in that state free not only from the act but from all suspition of vncleannesse as thinke no man in this age liued more free had certainly attained that excellent gift which our sauiour commends and wisheth them that haue it to make vse of as of a great aduantage and helpe to godlines matth


now as the varietie of his preferments in the world did no way hinder him in the practice of these his priuate and personall vertues as hath beene said so did they yeild him a greater furtherance or opportunitie at least of acting some others which may call publike or pastorall

for first as he had beene alwayes liberall from the time he had any thing to giue so vpon the increase of his fortunes hee improued that vertue euen to a kind of magnificence
am verily perswaded if hee had attained to that wealth which some of our english prelates heretofore haue done hee would haue built churches and colledges
but his forwardnesse in this kind could neuer stay till his purse were full therefore hee neuer attained to the doing of any pompous worke
but if it were possible to lay together his ordinarie largesse to the poore at his gates and in the streets his contributions to pious workes of all sorts vpon his owne and others motions his exhibitions to poore schollers both abroad and in the uniuersitie of

all which he kept no kalender
assure my selfe they would arise to as great a summe as the workes of one of the greatest benefactours of our time
besides his increasing of the allowance of the poore brethren of saint crosse both in diet and otherwise which was worthily continued by his

successour his maintayning of two lectures in new colledge in oxford one for the hebrew tongue another for the mathematickes his leading the way to the setting vp of the great organ in the church of worcester and to the founding of a librarie there as also of another in welles might well be reckoned as particular instances of his farre extended bountie in this kinde


next his magnanimitie and courage appeared well in the gouernment of the uniuersitie that one yeare wherein he bare the office of vicechancellour for as they well know that haue had experience of that place the animosity of some spirits there being like

alexanders horse generous indeed and fit for great seruices but yet fierce and vntractable for the time requires no lesse then an alexander to curbe them and to bring them to their due temper and pace
and such an alexander was he
for notwithstanding all opposition that is vsually made in that kind hee reuiued much of the ancient discipline there and indeed wrought such a sensible reformation vpon the more distempered parts of the uniuersity that as haue credibly heard it was deliberated by those that had the highest care of that place

to haue continued him longer therein though a consecrated bishop had not he of his owne minde desirous to attend his greatest charge shewed himselfe auerse from receiuing any such dispensation


next to his magnanimitie if not a part of it may reckon his contempt of wealth and especially of that manner of getting wealth which is too commonly in vse among them which seeke

quocunque modo rem

had he made that his rule he might haue beene a rich man
but dare say that in all elections of schollers collations of orders and benefices dispositions of offices and grants of colledge and that passed through his hands as there passed in his time very many he neuer fouled them with the least touch of a gehazi's reward which integrity of his together with his and were the onely causes that he left no greater estate behind him

but to come yet more nearely to the discharge of his episcopall function
his abilitie to teach which saint paul makes one of the principall vertues of a

bishop as it was very great so did it neuer appeare more then after he came to speake ex cathedrâ for although the acts of gouernment alone may seeme sufficient to take vp a man in that place yet he knowing that there is a double honour which saint paul allowes to such as doe not only rule well but also labour in the word and doctrine
tim

did after the example of saint chrisostome

saint augustine saint gregorie the great and other ancient bishops whose homilies wee enioy and read at this day and neuer ceast after he was a bishop to adorne the pulpit with his no lesse frequent and assiduous then learned and pious labours
witnesse his ordinary preaching in the cathedrall church of welles his frequent excursions into the parishes adioyning and indeed his leauing of no place where he came if it were a sit time of preaching vnsupplied
besides all which his ordinarie discourses were in one kind or other as good as lectures to those that heard them for indeed he was a man of rare sufficiencie in all parts of learning and for any doubts that were proposed to him whether historicall textuall practicall or controuersall as his readinesse was singular to take notice of them so was his dexteritie no lesse happy in resoluing them so that to conclude for this point may say he was a

salomon to his houshold seruants to the city where he liued an

oracle to any scholler that resorted to him a

liuing librarie to the whole church such a priest as god himselfe describes by his prophet malachie one whose

lips did preserue knowledge and men did seek the law at his mouth

but it is required of a bishop that hee should pascere cibo too as well as verbo and therefore saint paul among other things sayes hee should bee

giuen to hospitalitie
so was this man in a very extraordinarie and remarkable degree
for to omit his housekeeping first at saint crosse where hee made it his studie and profession to refresh the bowels of the poore

not with drie pensions as his predecessors for the most part had done either for the sauing of trouble or charges or both but as became the honour of that place with constant solide and substantiall meales and then afterward at his deanerie of worcester where he entertained the better sort with that splen dour and the meaner with that bountie and munificence that the whole countrie rings of it to this day to omit these say the list of his ordinarie family which he kept in diet after hee came to the bishopricke of bath and welles did commonly consist of at least fiftie persons a great part whereof hee kept not so much for any state or attendance vpon his person as out of pure charitie in regard of their owne priuate needs
besides all which his gates were the daily refectorie of his poore neighbours and for superuenient strangers be was another

abraham a

lot neuer suffering any man of fashion schollers especially that came to him vpon businesse or otherwise to depart emptie away

now in this rankenesse of housekeeping know it is a disease that commonly fals vpon great families that they grow disorderly and riotous abusing oftentimes the bountie of a good lord or master to their owne hurt and the scandall of others
which fault lest any man should suspect to haue beene in his house cannot but remember another vertue of his which saint paul commends also in a bishop and that is the

ruling of his house well and hauing those that are vnder him in subiection with all grauitie
surely this

man had so
for notwithstanding his large allowances of all things fit for the entertainment of strangers you should see no footsteps of riot or excesse in his house no tipling or carowsing of healths no casting of the childrens bread vnto dogs not so much as any hawkes or hounds kept vnlesse it were

those wherewith hee hunted after the kingdome of heauen
and the reason of all this take to haue beene first his owne example who was indeed a patterne of sobrietie and of all good conuersation as saint paul wisheth

timothie to be then the choice of his seruants wherein he imitated dauid psal
and lastly his training them vp whom he entertained in true pietie and deuotion
for besides his ordinary chappell houres which he saw duely and by all frequented hee caused many of his household to assist euery morning at the sixe a clocke prayers in the cathedrall church adioyning hee neuer sate downe to his meales but he had according to the ancient fashion of bishops a chapter of the holy bible read by one whom he kept for that purpose and lastly at the close of the night he called his whole family into his ordinary dining roome and there in his owne person most deuoutly commended them by his prayers vnto almightie god
which thing though it be no more then euery christian housekeeper in his particular charge doth or should doe yet account it the more memorable in a man of his place because the multitude and different qualitie of their attendants seemes ordinarily vnto such a sufficient pretence to remit that dutie to their chaplaines if not to lay it quite aside

now as the philosopher sayes that each priuate family is the modell of a so may say that each christian family is the modell of a church and therefore no wonder if he that was so good at the ordering of the one proued no lesse excellent in the administration of the other
the care of his diocesse as it was of all other his greatest and that which most tooke him vp so did it bring forth in him fruits of exemplary diligence and such as deserue not to be concealed from the world

for first whereas the foundation of all good order in a church is the planting of an able and learned ministery which thing appertaines to the care of the bishop and hath euer beene accounted a chiefe

branch of his supereminent power in the discharge hereof he was so carefull and precise that he neuer conferred holy orders vpon any person whom he did not first examine strictly according to the canons of the church neither did hee trust herein any chaplaine or other deputie but himselfe personally performed the office for the satisfaction of his owne conscience as one that meant to giue an account to god for what hee did
a worthy example doubtlesse which if it were imitated by all the rest of that uenerable ranke neither on the one side would they bee troubled with so many clamours of the laitie against the vnsufficiencie of their clergie nor on the other would they haue such cause as oftentimes they haue to

beshrew their owne fingers for ordaining them who are no sooner put into the ministerie but they become the of faction and

schisme against that very authoritie which ordained them

as he was thus prouident to plant a good ministerie in his diocesse so was hee no lesse carefull to cherish those who were alreadie planted
his care of them all in generall was most tender and fatherlike
the most eminent among them for pietie and learning he did not only vse most familiarly but studied to draw them nearest to himselfe by prouiding them of prebends in his church wherein it was his want of opportunitie rather then of desire and forwardnesse that he did no more
and lastly to the weaker sort of them he spared not to giue his aduice and direction vpon all occasions how they might enable themselues for the better discharge of their calling to which purpose he had both intended and begun a plaine and familiar explanation of the doctrine of the church of england contained in the catechisme and thirtie nine articles which he meant to haue communicated to them for their proper vse and instruction but the interruption of parliaments and other great affaires toward his later time and at last his vntimely and much lamented death as it seemes put an end to that worthy and religious designe

in the exercise of the discipline of the church hee carried himselfe so that by his own practice he wrought a great reuerence thereof euen in those who were otherwise not well affected thereunto
for when any ennormous offender was censured in his consistorie whose punishment and penance was fit should be performed in

the cathedrall church as incestuous persons notorious adulterers notorious schismatickes or the like himselfe was vsually the preacher at such times and this he did often and vpon diuers occasions and in such his sermons sundry of which thou shalt find in this worke did so open the grieuousnesse of those offences and the authoritie of the censures and discipline of the church as for the most part wrought great contrition in the parties punished and after sermon before the the whole congregation himselfe gaue them absolution
all which he performed with that grauitie learning and power as gaue great comfort to all and bred no doubt a generall reuerence and awe of the censures and authoritie of the church

and here by the way cannot but acknowledge as himselfe often did what a helpe he found toward the ordering of his iurisdiction in the assistance of a wise honest learned and discreet

chancellour whom as it was his happinesse to find there so it was his vertue euer to make much of his person and to vse his counsell as occasion serued
by meanes whereof hee not only was neuer crost nor contested with in any cause wherein he thought fit to but also for the legall and orderly carriage of such things as came before him no man could euer take iust exception to the formalitie of his proceedings

his trienniall uisitations he alwayes kept in his owne person and kept them so that to say no more he was euer welcome where he came for indeed his comming was like saint pauls to the corinthians

not

burthensome but beneficiall to those he came too for he sought not theirs but them yea as occasion serued he did gladly spend and was spent for them though cannot adde as it is in the same place that

the more he loued the lesse he was loued againe for surely it was a great argument of their loue that they resorted flockt to him in euery place

tanquam ad salutare beneficum sidus as seneca speakes of good princes going their progresses yea they brought their children and whole families to receiue his blessing and to be confirmed by him which act being one of those that

antiquitie hath euer reserued to the episcopall power he performed not in a tumultuarie manner or as we vse to say hand ouer head but with aduised deliberation and choice admitting only those whom either by the certificate of their minister or the examination of his owne chaplaines hee found to be sufficiently instructed in the principles of religion and so by the intention of our church

capable of the benefit of that sacred action

of his care of the cleargie in generall haue alreadie spoken yet it is not to be omitted heere how in those uisitations of his he particularly exprest it
wherein his fashion was to examine strictly all those of whose sufficiencie hee any way doubted as well touching their course of studie as of their preaching and as he would restraine those from preaching for a time whom hee found weake and ignorant so would hee with all direct them both for the bookes they should reade and the method they should vse for the better enabling of themselues

to that exercise and thereof would he take account as occasion serued by which meanes he alwayes quickned their industrie and drew many of them to such a commendable improuement of their talent that the countrie was much edified thereby

will adde but one thing more of the cariage of this man in his episcopall function which though it were a thing small in it selfe yet know not how it serued to increase much as well the peoples deuotion to god as their reuerence to his person
in the cathedrall church of welles whether it were so that himselfe preacht or no as indeed very often he did but though he did not after the sermon done and the psalme sung as the manner is himselfe standing vp in his episcopall seat gaue the benediction to the people after the example of the high priest in the old testament numb
which thing as hee performed like himselfe that is to say in a most graue and fatherlike manner so any man that had but seene with what attentiue and deuout gestures all the people receiued it what apparant comfort they tooke in it and how carefull euery particular man was not to depart the church without it could not but conclude that there is a secret

vertue in the prayers and blessings as of naturall so of spirituall parents which as they are neuer the worse for giuing so those that haue the relation of sonnes vnto them are much the better for the receiuing and it is not for nothing that the apostle saith

the lesser vseth to be blessed of the greater

by these few things which haue set downe christian reader thou mayest easily perceiue what an eminent patterne of all vertue as well personall as pastorall god hath bestowed on our church in the person of this one man whom as oft as reflect on considering the rare integritie and synceritie of his life together with his singular pietie and deuotion whereof no man that knew him but was a witnesse me thinkes may well ballance him with any of those whom the church of rome boasteth of and whom she daily canonizeth among the saints
neither doe doubt but those of that church that either knew him or shall read of these things are by this time ready to say talis quum fuerit vtinam noster fuisset
yea who knowes whether they may not by some forged plea goe about to claime him after his death who liued in a church opposite to theirs all his life time for such trickes haue they practised of late vpon some of our most eminent prelates and it is no new art but that which they may haue learned from that old

italian thiefe who was wont to draw all the faire oxen he could lay hands on though it were obtorto collo auersis vestigijs vnto his owne den
but to preuent all such practises in this particular hold it not amisse to acquaint thee somewhat more particularly with his resolutions touching matter of religion and how hee stood affected to the controuersies of our times
it is true that of his owne disposition whether framed so by nature or by grace or both he was undefined span alphabet of a most peaceable and milde temper apter to reconcile differences then to make

them and to interprete the sayings euen of the aduersaries where they were ambiguous in the better part in regard whereof if there be yet any hope left of sowing vp those innumerable rents which faction hath wrought in the seamelesse coat of christ and of drawing the distracted parts of his church to some tolerable vnitie thinke he had beene such a man as is hardly found amongst many to bee imployed in that seruice
howbeit as saint iames sayes of the wisdome which is from aboue that it is

first pure and then peaceable so may be bold to say that this mans desire of peace came euer in the second place and that his first care was to maintaine the puritie of religion as it is now taught in the church of england
for proofe whereof though might thinke it enough to referre thee to these and other of his sermons wherein he hath as his matter led him confuted and cut the throat of most of the errours currant at this day in the church of rome yet because it may be excepted that a mans opinions are in some sort as the lawyers say of ones will ambulatorie while he liues and that no man is bound to stand to any religion but what he dies in will rather impart to thee a late profession of his made in his last will and testament which is the most authentike record of a mans minde and such as when hee is once dead

no man disanulleth or addeth thereunto as the apostle speakes
jn this last testament of his amongst other pious recommendations of his soule to god he hath these words

desire to end my life in that faith which is now established in the church of england whereof am a member and haue beene by gods blessing well nigh thirtie yeares a preacher and my soules vnfained desire is that it may euer flourish and fructifie in this kingdome and in all his maiesties dominions and from thence be propagated to other countries which sit in darknesse and in the shadow of death whether jnfidels or heretickes
amen

behold here not only a sound but a zealous professor of the religion established and would to god euery man of learning and conscience whether of the one or other side would but make the like declaration of himselfe in his last will perhaps it would be as good a legacie as any hee could bequeath to gods church
for by it would it appeare what euery man thinkes of the summe of religion truly and indeed when all worldly hopes feares preiudices dependances and engagements being set aside he hath none but god and his owne conscience to satisfie and then doubt not but as an eminent prelate of the church of rome said of the doctrine of iustification by faith only that it was a good though not so good to breake fast on so it would bee acknowledged of our reformed religion in generall that although it be not so plausible and pleasant a religion to liue in as some other may be yet it is the only comfortable religion to die in as being that which settles a man vpon the true rocke and giues a sure footing to his faith when all the

superstitious deuises of mans braine doe like sand faile and moulder away

but to returne to this reuerend prelate of whom we are speaking being fallen vpon the mention of his last will and testament it may haply bee expected that should here relate what legacies he gaue therein to the church what summes of money he bequeathed ad pios vsus for that is the pompe of willes in these dayes
but for that haue said enough alreadie
he that gaue all whilst he liued euen his very bookes a great part of which thinke to the value of foure hundred pounds worth bee disposed to the librarie of new colledge in oxford by a deed of gift diuers yeares before his death reseruing the vse of them only for his life time could not haue much left to bestow at his death
only a name hee hath left behind him and that more precious then any ointment a name that filleth the church for the present with the sweet sauour thereof and trust that euen posteritie also shall be refreshed by it
for

the memoriall of vertue as he saith is immortall because it is approued both with god and men
when it is present men take example at it and when it is gone they desire it it weareth a crowne and triumpheth for euer hauing gotten the victorie and striuing for euerlasting rewards

as touching the manner of his death though any man might guesse at it that hath beene acquainted thus farre with the passages of his life for seldome doe a mans life and his end varie yet it will not bee amisse

to acquaint thee with thus much that hauing some few houres before his departure made a zealous and deuout confession both of his faith and sinnes to the bishop of elie there present from whom also he receiued absolution according to the order of our church and being assisted to the last gaspe with the comfortable and heauenly prayers of that diuine prelate after he had taken particular leaue of all about him and giuen them respectiuely both his counsell and benediction he speedily yeilded vp his soule to god

there passed not many moneths before that reuerend bishop whom last mentioned followed him to his graue with whom as he had liued many yeares in a most entire league of friendship not vnlike that which saint chrysostome describes to haue beene betwixt himselfe and saint basil lib
de sacerdotio so doubt not but they are now vnited and incorporated together in a farre more firme and vndiuided societie euen that of the which are written in heauen heb
and as they were heere geminum sidus a paire of lights of our church comparable euen to those primitiue ones whose lustre and influence remaines with this day so they haue by this time receiued the reward of such as turne many to righteousnesse euen to be stars in the firmament for euer and euer dan


now although an

epitaph be a good mans due after his departure should haue thought it needlesse to set any vpon him who as yet liues so freshly in the mouthes and hearts of all that knew him did not

find himselfe had meditated somewhat that way in his life time not for the perpetuating of his name for he doth not so much as name himselfe in it but only for the expressing of his firme hope in the resurrection and his charitable desire of their good that should suruiue him for whose sake he wrote this and desired it should be grauen only vpon a stone where he should lie without any further cost or ambition

viator consiste paucis te volo me vide
exuviae hîc reponuntur hominis sed christiani quibus nihil vilius propter peceatum hominis nihil pretiosius propter spem christiani
non eas deseruit anima sed hîc deposuit
custos bonae fidei spiritus sanctus qui cauet ne quis in vacuum veniat dum legatione pro ijs apud redemptorem defungitur anima cui reduci cum christo eas reddet gloriosas gloriosè induendas et cum beatâ beandas in aeternum
libentèr mortalis sum qui sim futurus immortalis
ne tantuli in me contemplando te poeniteat laboris non dimittêris sine praemio voueo haec historia mei prophetia sit tui perge

jf all this be not enough to continue the memorie of so worthy a prelate behold another monument of his owne making too
a monument of his wit shall say and of his learning or rather of his pietie and deuotion surely if thou take the paines to reade

attentiuely the sermons here published to thy view thou shalt find in them a more then ordinarie expression of both
for howsoeuer they are not set forth according to the ordinary fashion of these times wherein ornaments of speech varietie of illustrations allegations allusions and the like are affected and vsed euen to an excesse you must not expect too much of them from a man that neuer tooke more time for the preuiding of any sermon then some part of the weeke preceding that day whereon he was to preach and then also betooke not himselfe to the helpe of his pen but out of his strength of memorie and naturall readinesse of speech in both which he excelled deliuered those things which he had first exactly digested in his mind afterward dictated to his amanuensis in such sort as they are here published yet dare be bold to say that to an attentiue and iudicious reader they will appeare to containe not only matter of excellent obseruation for the increase of knowledge and pietie in our christian profession but also an exact idea of the true forme of a sermon so farre as concernes the essentiall parts of of it composed according to those rules of art which all men acknowledge to be of most vse in ecclesiastical oratorie
for whereas speech is fitly compared by the ancients to a picture

in the framing whereof the chiefe thing that requires the artisans skill is to draw his lines in their iust number and proportion so as may expresse all the parts of the thing described and the postures of them which when it is done it is no hard matter to adde the colours thereunto it followes

that the principall point of art likewise in making of a speech or sermon is the delineation of the parts of it and the apt connecting of them together or opposing them one to the other whereupon the seuerall exornation of them with words and sentences does either

of it selfe follow or is without any great difficultie put too
now in that was our author alwayes so elaborate and exact that thinke there was no point or circumstance in any text that euer he handled so closely concealed which he did not both fetch out and propose and handle in such order and method as might best giue illustration to the whole
wherein what singular vse he made both of his logicke and skill in the tongues which are the two spectacles that may not say eyes that enable a man to looke exactly and distinctly into a text thinke there is no man of iudgement that doth not easily discouer
in this respect then as said before he hath left vnto yonger men a patterne of preaching and for the rest though his fashion were not to lay on much colour yet that which he did lay on will appeare to him that markes it to be very proper
his illustrations so naturall his allegations so pregnant his words where the emphasis and weight of the sentence lies so choice and significant that if hee had vttered plura farre more in lines hee could hardly haue said plus more in substance and effect to any point that he hath handled

an exposition of the first psalme
epigraph

vers

blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsell of the vngodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seate of the scornfull

this psalme stands first in order and for the matter it well deserues to stand first
venerable bede giues the reason hic psalmus fine titulo quia ipse est titulus this psalme hath no inscription because it selfe is an inscription it containes the argument of all the other psalmes and if of all the psalmes then of all the bible know them and know all yea know all in the best manner non theoreticè sed practicè we may behold therein man as a liuing bible the man christ exactly of whom not a few of the psalmes entreate and other men proportionably whose affections are here limmed and described be they good or bad
the diuision then of this psalme is the same with that of the whole bible in both wee must obserue a couenant and parties thereunto the parties are god and man man is remembred in the entrance blessed is the man god in the close of the psalme the lord knoweth the way of the righteous
the couenant stands in their mutuall stipulation man vowes a duetie god promiseth a reward

touching the first partie to the couenant and his vow wee must more distinctly obserue who this partie is and what he vowes
the

partie is vir ille that man each word will yeeld his note
first that the partie to the couenant is man and secondly that he is more than an ordinarie man

as for his vow it consists of two parts an abrenunciation of that corrupt state wherein he liues by nature and a dedication of himselfe to a better state whereunto he is called by grace
but these parts must bee considered first ioyntly in regard of their number and order we must see why they are in number two and then how those two are digested hauing thus considered them ioyntly wee must looke into them seuerally we must looke into the nature of each of them apart and then in the abrenunciation we shall finde from what and how farre we must be seuered will you know from what the text will tell you that wheras there are sinners and sinnes we must be seuered not from the sinners but the sinnes not from the vngodly sinners and scorners but from their counsell way and chaire
secondly of sinne you shall finde here the seed and the fruit from which you must be seuered the seed is the counsell of the vngodly that is it which is sowen in our inward man and comprehends the solicitation vnto sinne from which spring two euill fruits which shoot forth in our outward man the way of sinners is the first which is our falling to an ill course of life the second which is worst is the chaire of the scorner our becomming vnto others both to doe ill and also to vilifie what is good
this is that from which we must be seuered
but how farre our first care must be to withstand the first offer of sin we must not meddle with the seed thereof not walke in the counsell of the wicked
we should estrange our selues so farre but if haply we haue not beene so watchfull as to auoyd the seed yet we must be carefull not to bring forth the fruit thereof not the first fruit wee may not apply our selues to a wicked course stand in the way of sinners at least take heed of the second fruit of professing the art of sinning to the reproach of vertue which is a sitting in the seat of the scorners this is the serpents method to draw vs to the height of sinne from whence wee must take the measure of our care in preseruing our selues therefrom
and this is the first branch of that vow which we made in baptisme and called it abrenunciation according to the ancient phrase of the church
the second part of our vow is our dedication when we haue really shaken off this corrupt course we must betake our selues vnto a better
we are taught here what it is and how long it must continue it stands in two points the first of which is the entertainment that we must giue vnto gods law that must be acceptable to our inward man our delight must be in the law of the lord the second is our employment answerable thereunto the benefit thereof must redound to the whole man the whole must meditate vpon that law

but how long surely god will not be serued by fits we must perseuere in this deuotion day and night that must be the terme of our meditation neither onely of our meditation but of our delight also yea this continuance of time though annext vnto the last must be vnderstood

in all the former clauses for the latter doth alwayes presuppose the former we cannot meditate except we delight neither can wee delight as we ought in the law except we seuer our selues so farre as is required from communion with sinners therefore wee must be constant in all

to begin then wee are first to see the first partie to the couenant which is set downe in two words vir ille that man it is a man and yet such an one as is more than ordinarie

man is a terme which though it properly note one sex yet vsually it includes both and why man is the head of the woman therfore vsually where he is mentioned shee is included the cinilians obserue it in the law and so doe the diuines on the scripture
certainely the fathers thought it worth their noting vpon this place and it is well they did note it for some schoole diuines haue beene so ill catechized

as that they haue questioned the womans interest in this couenant forgetting the text of saint paul that in iesus christ there is neither male nor female

what therefore is spoken to man the woman also must take vnto her selfe

secondly as there is no sex excluded no more is there any kindred for in christ there is neither iew nor greeke therefore is the partie set downe in a name that signifies all mankinde to signifie that all mankinde are included in this couenant
and indeed it was entred into with adam in paradise therefore it concernes all his posteritie as the sun in the firmament so the sonne of righteousnesse is common vnto all say hath made a whole chapter of it cap

let not the sonne of the stranger that hath ioyned himselfe vnto the lord speake saying the lord hath vtterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold am a dry tree the prophet goeth on and reports the interest which god giues to each of them in his couenant
saint peter acts

hauing first receiued it in a vision deliuers it afterwards in a maxime of a truth perceiue that there is no respect of persons with god wherefore then if any man be excluded it is because he excludes himselfe

and indeed there are too many which exclude themselues and though all may yet few doe partake of this couenant and therefore the psalmist doth not onely name a man but that man is ish which vsually notes some great man especially with this emphasis if the person be so noted sure it is some extraordinarie man
and verily whereas all the world lyeth drowned as it were in wickednesse

so that the lord lookes downe from heauen and cannot see any one that doth good no not one

and all flesh hath corrupted his way so that the psalmist cryes out helpe lord for there is not one godly man left there must needs bee somewhat more than ordinarie in him which is not led away with the errour of the wicked seeing they are so many but striues to enter in at the straight gate and to goe a way that is so narrow to be as noah in the old world as lot in sodom as eliah in israel is a rare thing and therefore deserues a marke of raritie the person deserues not onely to bee called a man but that man by an excellencie and wee must hold this rule

that though it may bee yet it is not a common thing to bee a partie to this couenant therefore we must thinke it worth our paines to affect it seeing wee receiue so honourable a title for our right in it

the fathers go one step farther and apprehend in this title hominem dominicum as saint austin speakes our sauiour iesus christ
and no maruell for though the first couenant were entred into immediately with a meere man yet because hee forfeited and failed to performe his part of the contract god in the renuing of it prouided better for vs and entred into the second couenant immediately with him that is both god and man and so that by him as the head it should be communicated to the church which is his bodie and who dare assume to bee a partie to this couenant but christ and those whom he will enable thereunto we may not presume of this honour except we deriue it from him for though it be a point of great dignitie yet is it a point of great difficultie also as you will perceiue when we haue vnfolded the vow
let vs come then vnto it

told you it consists of two parts which we must consider first ioyntly and then seuerally in the ioynt consideration of them we must consider first their number they are two they must needs be so many since the fall before one was enough
while we had the image of god we had nothing to doe but to dedicate our selues to him but now that image is lost wee haue more to doe wee must not onely put on the new but also put off the old man

those words of god will set enmitie betweene the serpent and the woman her seed and his imply that there must be a separation betweene his and those that are not his and this hee discouered immediately after adam had children in the separation of abel from cain in whom saint austin layeth the foundation of the two cities the citie of god and the citie of the deuill which is true concerning so much of it as hath a foundation in man although it began before in regard of the angels which before the fall of adam were ranged into good and bad after abel and cain god continued the separation in the posteritie of seth and cain in the posteritie of noah of abraham

of isaac of iacob saint paul giues the rule no communion betweene light and darknesse righteousnesse and vnrighteousnesse

as this number of parts is required so must we take them in their order and the naturall order is here set downe in my text we must begin at the abrenuntiation
the law for the most part is deliuered in negatiue commandements which speake to vs as we are in the state of corruption from which wee must be cleansed before we can make any vse of the affirmatiue and haue our part in sanctification
learne of our bodies how wee must deale with our soules corrupt humours must be purged before good nourishment be administred otherwise the peccant humours will corrupt good nourishment

hosea teacheth it by another similie bidding vs to plow vp the fallow grounds of our hearts and not sow amongst thornes good husbands know that except the plow doe first weed the ground the weeds will choake the good seed that is sowne therein and surely the reason why men profit so little at the church is

because they are not by abrenuntiation prepared for their dedication

but enough of the parts of our vow as they are considered ioyntly let vs now come to take them asunder and looke into the nature of each of them apart and first of our abrenunciation wherein wee shall learne from what and how farre we must be seuered
there are sinnes and sinners both exprest in my text the sinners in three seuerall names whereof the learned giue diuers significations wherein they doe rather follow the translations than the originall words but the best exposition of these names is that which we sinde in the description of their sinnes the first is rashang which is a tumultuous or an vnquiet person whose sin is ambulare in consilio who is more vnquiet than hee that is vnresolued the second is chataim from chata which signifieth one that shoots but cleane besides the marke and his sinne is stare in viâ looke where his arrow pitcheth there to take vp his stand and to resolue vpon that course
the third is letz a craftie scorner and the definition of his sinne is to sit downe in a chaire to be a publike professor of sinne with the disgrace of godlinesse
as we must marke this distinction of the sinners so must we also the specious titles that are giuen to their sinnes counsell way chaire good names but ill applyed counsell is necessarie to guide vs in our course but not the counsell of the vngodly wee are all commanded to goe a way but it must not be the way of sinners and a chaire is a seat of honour but not if it be the seat of the scorner that wee be not abused by the outside we must looke into the inside of a temptation adde vngodly vnto counsell sinner vnto way scorner to the chaire and then we shall see that there is reason why wee should bee separated from these and we shall not be by wolues in sheepes clothing

but mark whereas you haue heard of sinners sin the persons their ill qualities we are not willed to be separated from their persons but from their ill qualities not from the vngodly but from his counsel not from the sinner but from his way not from the scorner but from his chaire we must goe out of the world if we will be separated from their persons but from their qualities wee may bee separated and yet conuerse with them onely when publike authoritie commands whether ecclesiasticall or ciuill we must separate our selues from the persons also not only from the sinnes of men
the children of god are compared to light and during the time of their spirituall warfare they must shew themselues like vnto light light shines in the aire and on the earth and yet contracts no contagious qualitie from the one or the other so should the children of god doe and as christ tels them they must be though in the world yet not of the world yea as the light doth discouer

and correct the malignant qualities of the aire and the earth remaining it selfe vnalterable so must not we be the worse for the world rather the world should be the better for vs

but let vs looke a little farther into these things from which wee must be separated and then we shall finde here the seed and the fruit of sin the seed that is the counsell of the wicked by that they seeke to worke

vpon our inward man and frame that and worke it vnto sinne by questioning the truth wherein it is setled

god saith the preacher made man right that is set him in the right way and set him vpright in his way but man sought out many inuentions what those inuentions were salomon in that booke expresseth in his owne person where he sheweth that he was ambulans in consilio he tooke a taste of all courses but could rest vpon none of them

the prophet esay compares wicked men to the restlesse seas

saint iames saith that they are undefined span alphabet men that can no where take sure footing and how should they that haue left a rocke to walke vpon the sands

saint iude calleth them wandring starres and indeed nothing can better resemble them then a planet who is sometime in coniunction with one star and somtime with another and varieth according to his coniunction and the world is at this day ful of these walkers in counsell

persons hauing itching eares who are euer learning and neuer come to the knowledge of the truth and this breeds so many sects in the world wherewith our church as others hath beene and is not a little disquieted

and yet mistake not fauour not the blinde obedience or implicite faith where vnto the church of rome enthrals the consciences of her followers and makes them seale their vow of obstinacie with the most sacred obligations of oathes and sacraments whereupon our recusants are become like deafe adders

that stop their eares and wil not heare the charmer charme hee neuer so wisely did wee teach any other doctrine then that which god first deliuered in paradise and hath since vnfolded by his prophets and apostles from whence the world degenerated and whereunto we recall it they did well to stop their eares as our people shall doe well to stop their eares against them because they draw not vnto god but from him but it is one thing to forbid irresolutenesse when a man is assured of gods will warranted by his word such as was in eue

when she conferred with the serpent and the sonnes of god when they would needs be acquainted with the daughters of men and in the israelites when they would learne the manners of other nations another thing to forbid that irresolutenesse which was in nicodemus nathaniel in gamaliel when they began to stagger and could not presently resolue whither that they were with others to oppose christ or else leaue their former course and become the disciples of christ neither of those courses being at the first assured to their consciences
the papists forbid this latter irresolutenesse when neither way is knowne to be right which irresolutenesse causeth a man to enquire and finde out that which is right we forbid the former irresolutenesse where one way is knowne to be right the other to be wrong which will bring a man from a sound resolution to an irresolution certainely if we doe so walke in counsell we haue receiued the seed of sinne

our lesson then must be this when god hath set vs in a right way neuer to aduise whether it bee good to take another way if wee doe then this ill seed of bad counsell sowen in the inward man will fructifie and shoot forth in the outward man corrumpunt bonos mores colloquia

praua ill counsell will corrupt good manners he that takes this kinde of counsell when he comes to resolue resolues commonly vpon the worse he will not stand in the right way though hee will stand in a way so it befell rehoboam he heard the ancients and hee heard the youths

hee that had so little wit as to heare both had so bad a will as to follow the worse the like befell ahab

who was contented to heare as well the true prophet as the false concerning his iourney to ramoth gilead but when he came to resolue he gaue more credit to the false than to the true the verie same befell the iewes deliberating what way to take

whether to goe into aegypt or abide in iudea they asked ieremie hee aduised them to abide in iudea and that it was gods will they should doe so they aske others they aduise them to goe into aegypt

and with contempt of gods pleasure they obstinately did so

but why doe seeke for proofe to these stories looke to the first deliberation that is of record that of eue with the serpent and iudge therby how dangerous it is at all to deliberate in such a case that first deliberation hath giuen vs a wofull proofe that he that doth ambulare in consilio improborum will stare in viâ peccatorum saint paul hath a rule

rom
that it is too naturall for men to bee vaine in these dialogismes our foolish heart will be darkned and when we striue to be most wise we shall prooue most sottish well may we stand in a way to make some triall of the counsell that is giuen vs but it is more then likely that our way will be the way of sinners

and it were well if we bore only this fruit there is yet a much worse which is the sitting downe in the seate of the scorners when the heart becommeth so corrupt that it depraueth the principles of conscience and our iudgement is so peruerted that we speake good of euill and euill of good call darknesse light and light darknesse then wee are come so farre as to beare this second ill fruit

but the phrase imports two things by sitting in the chaire it is meant that men proceede so sarre in sinne that they become doctors of it and the chaire of scorners shewes that they scoffe all that are opposite to it touching the first we must note that a sinner desireth not to bee single but as good things haue semen in speciem suam a seede for the multiplication of their kind so haue euill also the serpent drew into his companie eue eue adam the daughters of men corrupted the sonnes of god yea whatsoeuer sinne a man is giuen vnto hee desireth companie a theise prou
an adultresse prou
idolaters num
the same may be obserued in others sinners are ambitious to be teachers of their sinne neither onely teachers of sinne but also mockers of godlinesse so ismael dealt with isaac the israelites with the prophets

the scribes and pharisees with christ saint iude by a generall name calleth wicked men mockers and hardly will he forbeare to scoffe at godlinesse

that vndertakes to be an aduocate of sinne for whereas they are not able to resist the strength of the apparent grounds of pietie and truth they find that the best way to entertaine the fauourable opinion of ignorant people towards them that are bad is to vilifie those that vndertake the

defence of that which is good this hath beene alwayes the practice of the enemies of the church whether infidels or hereticks as appeares by the ecclesiasticall storie and at this day the romanists vse the very same method who spend more bookes in reproaching their aduersaries persons then in refuting of their arguments and thriue better by this indirect course then they could by any that is direct

you haue heard from what we must be separated it remaines that now in few words you heare how farre
this it set downe in three verbes walking standing sitting wherein there is a gradation for standing is more then walking and sitting more then standing but this gradation is somewhat strange for though in exhortations wee doe rise from the lowest degree to the highest yet in dehortations wee vse to fall from the highest degree to the lowest as for example when we exhort to liberalitie we tell men that it is not enough for them to haue a charitable heart they must also haue a good eye neither will a good eye suffice except they haue a liberall hand so do we by degrees draw them to the height of vertue but when wee dehort as for example from murder we tell men that they must be so farre from shedding bloud that they must not vtter so much as an vnkinde word yea they must bee so farre from letting loose their tongue that they must set a bridle vpon their hearts so doe wee endeuour to hold in the verie first motions of sinne
strange then may it seeme that these words being a dehortation should follow the course of an exhortation and in marshalling of sinnes should begin at the least but the reason is the psalmist sets downe the method by which sin first entred vpon man and euer since doth worke it selfe into man to the end that we may obserue how we must preserue our selues from it and take heed that it preuaile not so farre as to bring vs to a desperate case
there are three degrees here specified which ascend one aboue the other
first the serpent tries whether hee can worke in vs an vnresoluednesse of heart and tries whether we be stedfast in our faith and here must we begin to withstand him and not be brought to any parley such deliberation must be auoyded for it is no better then the receiuing the serpents poyson into our vnderstanding which must be the guide of our life but if wee haue beene so foolish as to walke in his counsell wee must take heed that we bring not forth the fruit of that wee haue conceiued and let not our life witnesse that wee haue beene inueighled by his counsell we must not stand in his way

but it is too vsuall with men to be ouertaken with this second degree of sinne wherein the serpent will not suffer them to rest he will carrie them forward to the consummation of gracelesnesse he will make them his seedsmen like vnto himselfe he is not contented to haue poison except he also poison others and whom he cannot worke to be a serpent on him hee will roare like a lyon euen so doe wicked men when they are come to the height of sinne they neuer cease till they haue corrupted or oppressed those that are good answerable to this contagious disposition

of theirs the septuagint and the vulgar call their chaire the chaire of pestilence for it is obserued as a malignancie that doth attend the pestilence that they who are infected take great delight to infect others also

but when men come so farre they are euen past hope nothing remaines but that iudgement ouertake such miscreants the floud must drowne these gyants fire and brimstone from heauen consume such sodomites and such israelites must bee corrected with the babylonian captiuitie
but conclude you see how farre a man may goe in sinne if we will be as thorowly separated from it as we ought we must haue these three degrees alwayes before our eyes for we can neuer know certainely how to keepe our selues in the way that doe not know how farre wee may goe out of the way wherefore let vs take heed vnto these degrees that we slip not if it may be into any of them or if we slip in yet that we goe not so farre as to be past recouerie this is required in the first part of our vow that vow which we made vnto god in baptisme

epigraph

psal
vers
but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth hee meditate day and night

the article that is required on our part in the couenant whereinto we are entred with god or the vow which we haue made in baptisme doth as haue told you consist of two parts an abrenunciation of the state wherein we stand by nature and a dedication of our selues vnto a better state whereunto we are called by grace
you haue heard of the first of these two parts of the abrenunciation but you haue not heard of the best that is the dedication
the abrenunciation is required non per se sed propter aliud not that wee should rest in it but that wee should tend vnto a farther end by it
the reason is plaine it is but remouens impedimentum non efficiens communionem

it is but the laying aside of the waight and sin which doth easily beset vs and clog vs in our race we haue not by it a communion with god
men plow their ground but it is that it may bee the fitter to receiue good seed and they purge their bodies but it is that they may be the better able to digest good meat euen so the first part of our vow serues to make way vnto the second true pietie is like iacobs ladder which hath one foot vpon the earth and the other in heauen it is not enough to ascend from the earth we must also climbe vp into heauen when we haue really shaken off our corrupt course we must then betake our selues vnto a better
and that is expressed in the second part of our vow

wherein we must obserue two points first whereunto then in what

sort we must dedicate our selues that whereunto is the law of the lord and the text tels vs how and how long we must dedicate our selues thereunto how we must first receiue it into our inward man our delight or will with a delight must be in the law from thence it must spred it selfe ouer the whole man we must meditate thereon
you see how

the text also tels vs how long euen day and night this dedication must neuer be giuen ouer these be the particulars whereof now briefly and in their order
first we must see whereto wee must bee dedicated and wee finde that it is the law of the lord
when wee finde that wee haue freed our selues from our serpentine guides then must wee bee aduised in our choyce that we pitch vpon a good guide wherein the scripture bids vs take heed of two rockes the one is undefined span alphabet the other is undefined span alphabet we must neither our selues forge a religion neither receiue any that is forged by others for guiding of our conscience as we must not be without law so must we take heed what law we vse

and indeed we may vse none safely but the law of god in such cases

that of the apostle is true there is but one lawgiuer no law but his bindes vnto that for performance whereof we may securely expect that he will performe what in the couenant for his part hee hath promised vnto vs many commendations wee read in prophane writers of the the lawes of solon lycurgus zaleuchus and others but these must all be as imperfect as the whether we respect the precepts or the sanctions none comprehending exactly the dutie of man and therefore not being able to set man in the way to the attaining of his soueraigne good
this is peculiar to the law of god

but what is meant by the law of god surely the law deliuered by moses whereof the prophets were but interpreters and their interpretation shewes the largenesse of the text namely that the gospell is included in the law for the decalogue cloathed with the ceremonies what is it but implicitum euangelium the substance of the gospell which is saluation by repentance and faith in christ
and so must we vnderstand not onely moses his commendations of the law deut
but king dauids also psal
and the truth whereof cannot be acknowledged if the law and the gospell be taken oppositè and not compositè if we oppose the one to the other and doe not by the one put comfort into the other certainely in this place we must so vnderstand the law because it is made the way to blisse
and marke that here one law of god is opposed vnto the three degrees of sinne the counsell of the wicked the way of sinners and the seat of the scorners one to three to giue vs to vnderstand that what those three promise is performed in this one no true counsell but in this law no good course but that whereinto wee are set by this law and if we will be doctors and despise the folly of others we must sit in moses chaire we must professe no other but the law of god
and thus much of that whereunto we must be dedicated

let vs uow see how
wee must first receiue it in the inward man the

word vsed by the psalmist is chephetz which signifies voluntatem and voluptatem and notes where and what entertainment wee must first giue vnto the law
where in our will so we finde in the tenour of the couenant this shall be my couenant

which will make with the house of israel saith the lord will write my lawes in their hearts god will not haue a seruile dedication hee will not bee serued by compulsion and therefore those that serue him are called psal
a willing people neither can the seruice be reasonable wherein the will is wanting for the actions are not counted ours wherein the will hath no part seeing it is by vertue of the will that a man is dominus actionum suarum a free agent neither is any action free but that which is done willingly though we cannot partake of the law but by our vnderstanding yet is the principall obiect of the law our will for theologia is scientia not theoretica but practica wee learne not the law for to know it but to doe it
adde hereunto that inclinatio voluntatis is inclinatio totius suppositi it is not without cause that god requires the will seeing the will hath power to sway the whole man especially if the will be chephetz ioyned with delight for so god doth require the heart hee will haue it seasoned with loue

thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy heart and loue is the fulfilling of the law king dauid opens this delight

when he tels vs that the law was sweeter than honey and the the meaning of it is we must not be mercenarie but the pleasure we take in it the cause why we entertaine it

and marke the phrase his delight is in the law multi habent legem in corde sed non cor in lege saith hugo de victore
many treasure vp the law in their hearts that doe not solace their hearts in the law they only know it these also delight in it
saint austin obserues a distinction betweene in lege and sub lege qui est in lege secundum legem agit he whose heart is in the law followes the direction of the law qui est sub lege lege agitur he whose heart is vnder the law

entertaines it rather of constraint then with a willing minde but wee must delight in the law of god in the inward man as the apostle speaketh
for as ground is fruitfull not by receiuing but by liking of the seed euen so man becomes not religious by knowing but by affecting of the law amor est virtus vniens by loue doth a man become one with the law yea himselfe is turned into a liuing law for men are alwayes busie about that wherein they take delight and the law being receiued into the man will the whole man which is implyed in the next branch he meditates on that law

to meditate on the law is first to ruminate on the scripture and sound the depth of it for the law is deliuered in few words wherein there are contained great riches of sense which by meditation we must worke out christ hath giuen vs a patterne mat
where he vnwraps the sense of seuerall commandements of murder of adulterie of diuorce
in the sixth of saint iohn how much matter doth he draw out of the storie of manna and what mysteries doth saint paul in the epistle to the hebrewes find in the ceremonies of moses this is the first

branch of meditating the vnfolding of the riches of that sense which god hath treasured vp in his law
this is the worke of our vnderstanding

but the vnderstanding doth but prepare matter for the affections there is a second branch therefore of meditating which is the seasoning of our affections with that which we know and as the vnderstanding prepares matter for the affections so what vse of our affections but to quicken our actions therfore as a man which takes into his mouth a morsell of good meate chewes it and by chewing doth discouer the sweetnesse and kindly nourishment that is in it and hauing rellisht it swallowes it downe and by meane conueiances disperseth it into euerie part of his body that euery part may be made more vigorous and actiue thereby so a man which takes into his thoughts the law of god must by his meditation chew vpon it and when hee hath found out the sweete matter that is in it his affections must swallow it greedily and he must not cease to worke vpon it till hee hath made the power thereof appeare in his liberall hands in his godly lips and in a word euen in his whole outward man for the law is giuen to the whole man mat
the commandement thou shalt not kill by the glosse of the pharisees was restrained to the hand as if thou were nothing but thy hand and to kill were nothing but to shed bloud
it is true that what a man doth by a part the whole becomes guiltie of it but then he must know that there no part but may contract his guilt a man may commit murder with his tongue and he may commit it with his affections this the pharisee knew not and because he knew not he taught not and his disciples practised not and so both of them for want of meditation scanted the entertainement which they were to giue vnto the law
and so shall we if we tread in their steps and learne not how to dedicate our selues to god whose law we must delight in meditate vpon and affect that so wee may occasionally set on worke the tongue and the hand and may vtter and act with the outward man those things which wee conceiue and loue in the inward man
thus you see how we must be dedicated
but how long day and night saith the psalme
for first we must meditate day and night which words some take properly some improperly improperly the day notes prosperitie and the night aduersitie these significations are frequent in the scripture and then the meaning is that be we as happie as solomon or brought as low as iob neither condition must make vs forget our meditation this is a worke for all times for hereunto shall we bee beholding for our temperate vsing of prosperitie and resolute bearing of aduersitie

but take the words properly and then because the proposition is affirmatiue some thinke that it holds semper but not ad semper that though habituall meditation must neuer bee wanting in vs yet the actuall neede not be exercised but as occasion is offered vnto vs but if we take meditation together with the fore mentioned actions which must goe with it we neede not doubt but the proposition will hold semper and adsemper for when are we not doing speaking or thinking and which of these

can be perfect without meditation and how then should not our life be a perpetuall meditation and why may it not be said that we should meditate on gods law day and night sure am

that moses speakes thus vnto israel these words which command thee this day shall bee in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently vnto thy children and shalt talke of them when thou sittest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest downe and when thou risest vp and thou shalt binde them for a signe vpon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets betweene thine eyes and thou shalt write them vpon the posts of thine house and on thy gates
and the apostle
cor
whether yee eate or drinke or whatsoeuer yee doe doe all to the glorie of god
the enuious man will alwayes bee sowing tares therefore we must neuer sleepe the enemie will bee alwayes giuing an assault therefore we must alwayes stand vpon our gard no man putting his hand to the plow and looking backe is fit for the kingdome of god

secondly as we must meditate vpon the law so we must delight in it day and night this circumstance of time must not be restrained onely vnto meditation but enlarged also vnto delight neither must it onely belong to our dedication but to our abrenuntiation also
for meditation when it goeth so far as to season the affections with that which is knowne as expounded it presupposeth delight in the will and the dedication presupposeth the abrenunciation it is impossible the later should subsist without the former therefore as long as wee are bound to obserue this last wee must continue all the rest which must needes goe before it
whereupon it followes that except this text be vnderstood of our sauiour iesus christ who onely hath performed this vow which is vndertaken by vs it rather shewes vs what we should then what wee can doe and sets vs vp a marke whereat all our endeauours must bee ayming in this world in hope that we shall hit it in the world to come

conclulde
the summe of the christian mans vow is

we must decline from euill and doe good from all euill must we decline whereunto we are prone by nature and we must doe all good which is recommended vnto vs in gods law that must rellish pleasantly vnto vs and therein must we continually exercise our selues our inward our outward man fully constantly fare we well or fare we ill

psal
vers
blessed is the man

this psalme containes the couenant betweene god and man so that we are therein to obserue the parties to the couenant and articles whereon they are agreed the parties are god and man the articles man vowes his duetie god promiseth a reward of the first partie and his article

haue alreadie spoken it followes that now come on to the second partie and his article

the second partie is god god is a partie to a couenant with man
a mercie to be wondred at for god is a creator man his creature therefore god may require whatsoeuer man can doe a man is bound to doe it were there no other inducement but this that hee is gods creature for he cannot owe his being but hee must with all owe his seruice and to whom he oweth the one to him hee oweth the other also
and yet see how gracious god is vnto man hee will not haue man serue him for nought
this is signified in that he vouchsafeth to enter into a couenant
if a man haue a and make him his farmer the law saith of bond he makes him free and inables him as well to implead his master as to be impleaded by him
and doth not god in a maner doe vs the like fauour when hee doth contract to giue a reward vnto our seruice whereby he becomes bound to performe and we may bee bold to challenge it it were honour enough done vnto our nature if onely it were vouchsafed some neere attendance vnto god and it caries with it a great reward to haue our person so imployed how much more honour then is done vnto vs when god not onely yeelds that but a much higher aduancement also for that it is a question whether a man may serue god for a reward the nature of a couenant doth cleare this doubt for seeing god puts on the person of a contracter it is plaine that wee may not neglect the regard which wee must haue vnto the articles of his contract especially seeing the contract is founded in christ whose merit ouer and aboue gods word doth embolden vs to relie thereon
but yet this rule we must hold we must obey quia bona lex prius quam quod nobis commoda our first respect must be vnto the precept of the law and then to the sanction and we must obserue the precept absolutely and for it selfe but the sanction onely conditionally and because god is pleased to adde it and being conscious to our selues of our owne defect we must presume not vpon our own performances but vpon christs and claime not for our owne merits but for his in whom we are vouchsafed an interest
but to leaue the partie and come to his article
the article is in effect this if a man be dutifull in performing his vow god will be gracious in giuing a reward
touching this reward we are here taught what it is and what is the euidence of it it is set downe in one word blessed and indeed blessednesse containes the whole substance of our reward
but how shall it be knowne who is blessed surely here are euidences by which it may bee proued and the euidences are as many as there are degrees of blessednesse thereof there are two degrees for men are blessed either in this life or that which is to come

how it may bee knowne whether a man is blessed in this life wee are taught in the third and fourth verses where we are taught the difference betweene good and bad men in this world
good men are compared to a tree whereof wee haue here set downe the kind and the vertue the

kind it is not a natiue but a satiue tree planted by the riuers of waters
and the vertue therof is double it is profitable it is acceptable profitable for it brings forth its fruit in due season and his leafe neuer failes acceptable looke whatsoeuer he doth it prospers
as for the wicked non sic wee must remoue all this from them the kind and the vertue of the plant
and what are they then nothing else but winnowed chaffe chaffe which the wind driues too and fro
this is the first euidence the euidence of blessednesse in this world

the second is the euidence of blessednesse in the world to come
in the world to come two speciall times are obseruable the beginning and the continuance thereof
the godly differ from the wicked in both in the beginning that is the time of the generall iudgement for then the righteous shall stand the wicked flie in the continuance the righteous shall be of a congregation whereunto the wicked shall not come
now this double difference proceedes from a double act of gods prouidence an act of his wisdome which doth distinguish these persons hee knoweth the wayes of the righteous and an act of his power the way of the wicked shall perish but wee must marke that the first of these verbes that expresseth wisdome includes power and the second that expresseth power includes wisdome
these be the particulars which are to be obserued concerning the reward the nature the euidence of it whereof shall now onely vnfold that word which expresseth the nature and that word is blessed ashre

this word in the originall respects our steps and touching them obserues two things their praise and their comfort their praise is to be straight and that the word signifieth primarily their comfort is to be happie and that the word signifieth secondarily

wee haue here no abiding place but are wayfaring men we may not we cannot stand still wee shall be euer in our way onely our care must be what steps we tread and this word implies the two characters whereby wee may discerne such steps as we should chuse they must be straight and happie first straight then happie

what a straight step is we may learne of the harbinger of christ who doth not onely call vpon the people to prepare the way of the lord

and make his path straight but also shewes what is opposite to straight if there be any hils they must be taken downe if there be any vallies they must be filled vp if there bee any crookednesse declining to the one side or the other it must be set euen
these are shadowes of better things
that which maketh a man goe out of the wayes of god is either presumption which maketh him to swell like a hill or desperation that maketh him to sinke like a vallie or else he is too much besotted with prosperitie which is leaning to the right hand or else murmureth in aduersitie which is leaning to the left hand
so many wayes to say nothing of the particulars contained vnder these seuerall wayes may wee decline from straight steps
there is both a variation and declination of the compasse of our life

a second thing that we must marke is that whereas the wayes of

god lie straight and recta linea est breuissima inter eosdem terminos that god doth not toyle vs out but setteth vs in the next way to heauen if we fetch a compasse and trauell by the crooked line the fault is our owne that will goe aside when wee might keepe forth right as the prodigall childe

that might haue stayed at home with his father who would needs try the world and come after a long time home to that father from whom he went

the third thing that we must marke is that rectum is index sui obliqui we must ghesse how farre we are out of the way by comparing our course to the straight way looke how farre we are distant from that so farre we are out
here praeter and contra which the church of rome distinguisheth concurre in one that which is praeter viam is contra viam because we should keepe in the right way and what more vsuall in the scripture then to charge vs not to decline either to the right hand or to the left as if so to decline were a sinne and a violation of the law and a doing contrarie to that which the law commands for the law commands vs not to decline
the patronage of veniall sinne then which it borroweth from the preposition praeter is but weake for to goe praeter viam is to doe contra legem

as our steps must be straight so if they be straight they will be happie for holinesse and happinesse concurre in god and by his ordinance they concurre in man

when god made his creatures hee beheld them and saw they were all good and because good therefore hee blessed them and euer since hath blessing been an inseparable companion from good
in the law god by moses telleth the iewes deut
that if they hearken to his voice and keepe his lawes they shall be blessed the like doth god pronounce by esay

say vnto the righteous man it shall goe well with him so true is this that this word ashre doth therefore signifie happinesse because happinesse is annext to holinesse

moreouer wee must note that this word is plurall so is it euer read in the originall the holy ghost intimating thereby that as a man is compounded of soule and bodie a bodie of many parts a soule of many faculties that which must make happie must containe a manifold blessing which must giue content to euerie part and power and withall checking the vaine either definitions of philosophers or elections of men which haue recommended vnto vs or haue addicted themselues vnto a maimed blessednesse
but more of that anon when shall open the nature of blessednesse

by the way may not omit to obserue how in this reward the holy ghost doth refute the vulgar opinion
for vulgarly men are of their opinion

whom malachi speakes of who account it a vaine thing to serue god and say what profit is there in walking humbly before him we account the proud blessed and they that set light by god are lifted vp and in the booke of wisdome the vngodly say

they accounted the righteous mans life madnesse and his end without honour the apostle telleth vs that christians seeme in this life

to be of all men most miserable the vnthriftie seruant did not sticke to challenge his lord to his face that hee was a hard man

and gathered where hee hath not scattered reaped where hee had not sowen

so farre are worldly men from thinking that the children of god are encouraged by any reward to be constant in performing of their vow that they hold them most miserable because they keepe the same
read esay
vers

but in the places you shall finde an answer to their exceptions and they are sufficiently answered where they are brought in so blaspheming

but you will not wonder at their errour if open vnto you the ground thereof
wee must obserue then that they frame vnto themselues false notions of blessednesse and according vnto them doe they iudge of euerie mans state for example hee that placeth happinesse in riches what wonder if he hold all poore men to be wretches and if any make his belly his god will hee not thinke basely of daniel

and the three children that liue with water and pulse marke the forecited places and you shall finde that euerie one of these made his owne choyce the measure of his iudgement and contemned all others that were not like vnto himselfe

wherefore that we be not lead away with their errour and that wee may be as wee ought affected towards our reward it is behoofefull that we better vnderstand the nature of blessednesse
all men naturally desire to bee blessed and hee were a monster and not a man that were contented to bee a wretch but that which in common wee all desire when we come to determine most doe mistake
not to tire you with the enumeration of mistakes in this kinde

whereof varro as saint austin reports made a long catalogue in few words blessednesse is the enioying of the soueraigne good

what the soueraigne good is wee must iudge by these two characters it must be optimum and maximum it must bee the best that can be and the most complete if it be not the best it will not sistere appetitum we shall not leaue shifting of it it will neuer giue vs content wee will euer be longing vntill wee light vpon that beyond which there is nothing that wee may long for and if it bee not maximum the most complete it will not implere appetitum wee shall not be satisfied therewith we shall be hungring and thirsting still though we desire no other thing yet of that thing wherein wee take content wee shall still desire more and more vntill our vessell is filled vntill we haue as much as wee are capable of

now these two characters of the soueraigne good belong onely vnto god he by the verie heathen is stiled optimus maximus and the scripture that tels vs there is none good but god only and that he only is almightie doth confirme vnto him these attributes as also doth that title of his shaddai and therefore as the apostle speakes

only blessed
whereupon wee may conclude that hee only is our soueraigne good for if by enioying of himselfe hee make himselfe blessed hee must needs bee the fountaine of blessednesse to all others
and indeed saint austin expresseth this religiously vnto god

fecistinos domine ad te inquietum est cor nostrum donec requiescat inte whom haue

in heauen lord but thee and there is nothing on earth which desire with thee my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for euer psal
blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praysing thee psal

but god is essentia simplex of an vncompounded nature the nature of man is many wayes compounded how then can this single nature satisfie our compound especially seeing before you heard that it is a manifold good that must make a happie man we must helpe our selues with a schoole distinction
a good may be manifold either formaliter or eminenter in kind or in vertue as for example there is a vegetable soule in a plant there is a sensitiue soule in a beast the soule of man hath not these in their kind yet hath hee them in vertue for the reasonable soule is endued with faculties which in his body performe both vegetation and sense a man hath an eye and an eare a hand and a foote to see to heare to worke to goe an angell hath none of these formaliter according to their kind yet hath he them all eminenter his nature is such as hath the vertue of seeing hearing mouing and doing and that in a more excellent sort then man is capable of euen so the single nature of god may giue full content to the manifold capacities of man seeing no created good proceedes from god which is not eminently in him for there is no effect that is not an image of the efficient though created effects are images of the vncreated efficient no otherwise then if wee consider them defecated or purged from those imperfections whereunto the condition of a creature a mortall creature doth subiect them seuer them and then whatsoeuer good they haue is an image of that which is in god
whereupon it followeth that if any sense of our body or power of our soule find any good in the creature it shall enioy the same though in a more eminent sort if it enioy the creator
hauing found the soueraigne good it followes that we now see how we become blessed

we become blessed then not by hauing but by enioying for if hauing were enough euerie creature should be blessed for all creatures haue him because they cannot be without him yea they liue moue and haue their being in him

but onely reasonable creatures are capable of happinesse for they onely can see god and take their delight in god
the vnderstanding and the will are those immediate faculties whereby we partake the soueraigne good each by a double act first the eye of the vnderstanding being illightned doth discouer it then doth the will sanctified fall in loue and make to wards it when they are both met then fals the vnderstanding a worke againe and doth vncessantly contemplate it wherewith the will is stirred to a second worke it takes inexplicable pleasure in it
and this is the true enioying of the soueraigne good which makes a happie man

where hence we may also gather the cause of the angels and adams fall both of them were made after the image of god and thereby made partakers of the diuine nature they fixt their eyes and setled their affection

vpon themselues that modell of diuine being which they had in themselues and so fell in loue with themselues and their own worth deemed themselues meet to be their own soueraigne good and so lost the true while they sought an imaginarie happinesse
but we must know that the abilities that we haue be they neuer so diuinely qualified are but vessels whereinto we must receiue they are not the happinesse it selfe which we must enioy the glorie of being the soueraigne good is the incommunicable prerogatiue of god

but god is in heauen and man on earth and of man on earth the rule is true he cannot see god and liue how then should he enioy him

and so become blessed we must vnderstand that there is a presence of god in his word which is apprehended by faith of which saint paul

wee with open face behold the glorie of our god and are changed into the same image this sight is aenigmaticall as the apostle speakes
cor
and like the beholding of our face in a glasse but yet is it a true sight and the pledge of a cleere
it is true for whether we respect the obiect god as he is described in his word or our faith whereby we apprehend god so described neither can deceiue vs if they bee sincere if there bee no mixture of humane inuention with gods reuealed will and our faith be not allayed with our corrupt affections

as this darke enioying of god is true so is it the pledge of a cleere men come not to heauen per saltum men leape not out of the dregs of nature into the glorie of saints neither can they be blessed in the church triumphant that are not blessed in the militant but if we be blessed on earth by beleeuing god in his word we shall be blessed in heauen and there our faith shall be turned into sight and god will shew himselfe vnto vs as he is we shall see him face to face

now because the state in grace is blessed as well as the state in glory and these two blessednesses are inseparable as we may gather by the two titles that the scripture giues vnto the spirit which are

first fruits and a seale or pledge the psalmist pronounceth them blessed that performe their vow two wayes blessed re and spe blessed in that they are in the kingdome of grace and blessed in that they shall be of the kingdome of glory both these blessednesses are included in this word and more blessed a man cannot desire to be as hereafter you will be more fully perswaded if this perswade not enough when you shall heare of the euidences that are annext to either of these blessednesses

but for this time conclude
the summe of all that you haue heard and whereof pray god we may all make vse is we must not hold our labour vaine which we take in seruing god and that wee contemne not the true let vs not fancie a false reward of our paines god vouchsafeth to be our reward and we shall want nothing if we enioy him and enioy him we must by knowing and louing truly and sincerely though darkly and imperfectly in the state of grace that we may cleerely and fully know and enioy him in the state of glory
that his word may dwell richly in vs in keeping whereof there is so great a reward

psal
vers
and he shall be like a tree planted by the riuers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leafe also shall not wither and whatsoeuer hee doth shall prosper

this psalme breaketh it selfe into as many parts as are contained in the couenant of god therefore haue you more then once beene told that wee may consider therein the parties to the couenant and their mutuall stipulation the parties are man and god man is to vow his dutie god doth promise a reward
of the first partie man and his vow you haue heard at large and haue begun to speake of the second haue shewed you what is obseruable in the second partie in god
and whereas touching the reward the psalme teacheth what it is and what euidence there is for it haue shewed you what it is vnfolding the riches that are contained in the first word blessed
it followeth that now goe on and with the psalme let you see what euidence there is of this blessednesse
and here wee finde a double euidence as there are two degrees of happinesse men are happie in this life and happie in the life to come of each the psalme expresseth a distinct euidence the euidence of happinesse in this world stands in the apparent difference that in this life appeares betweene the good and bad
good men are compared vnto a tree and touching this tree wee are taught what good is done for it and what good commeth of it
the good done for it stands in the husbandmans care and choyce care in setting the tree for the tree is not wilde but planted choyce in setting it in a fruitfull ground for the tree is planted by the riuers of waters this double good is done for the tree
but what good comes of it surely as manifold a good for it proues well and is well approued it proues well whether you looke to the principall or the accessorie good expected from a tree the principall good is fruit and this tree bringeth forth fruit fruit that is good it hath the two markes of good fruit stamped vpon it for it is kindly and timely fruit kindly the tree brings forth fructum suum such fruit as well beseemes such a tree and so well husbanded neither is it onely kindly but timely also for the tree bringeth it forth tempore suo in his season when it is fittest to serue the planters vse
a tree that beares such fruit answereth the desire of the husbandman in regard of the principall good but what doth it in regard of the accessorie it failes not there neither for it beares leaues which are ornamenta arboris and munimenta fructus that grace the tree and defend the fruit and this accessorie good is lasting for the leaues doe neuer faile

it is plaine that the tree proues well neither is it lesse plaine that it is well approued for what it doth prospers the fruit prospers the leaues prosper yea it is as farre approued as it proues good whatsoeuer it doth prospers it doth and receiues as much as you can require of a tree
a happie coniunction when doing well and faring well meet so louingly together

but all this while haue beene talking onely of a tree the holy ghost meanes more then a tree in this place what saint paul said gal


of abraham his wiues and children the same may say of this tree undefined span alphabet these things are spoken by an allegorie and so much is intimated by the first words of this text he shall be like a tree so that what you haue heard is but the outside we must also looke into the inside of this allegorie
and there wee shall find that by the tree is meant a christian whom god the father as a carefull husbandman hath planted in our sauiour christ as a soyle well watered with the grace of god and that this tree proues accordingly abounding in good workes cloathed with their due circumstances so that they are acceptable vnto god and profitable vnto man
this is the inside of the allegorie

hauing laid it open before you in grosse and giuen you a taste of the contents therein it followeth that now resume the particulars and lead you by the outside more fully and profitably to vnderstand the inside of this allegorie
first then the holy ghost resembleth a christian man to a tree
it may bee that you would expect that hee should propose abraham isaac iacob or some of the patriarchs they may seeme fitter patternes and better but the holy ghost passing by them pitcheth on this
and why to make the deeper impression in vs if we will profit and if we will not to worke in vs the greater confusion
those worthies are dead well may we heare of them we cannot now see them et segnius irritant animos demissa per aures quam quae sunt oculis subiecta fidelibus things heard doe lesse affect then those that are seene therefore doth the holy ghost bring euery man home and presents him with a visible sermon in his owne orchard whereof hee should neuer behold the trees but he should behold an image of himselfe in euery good tree an image say of that which hee should striue to be

but a little more distinctly to shew how reasonable this choise is we must obserue that as the philosopher sayth homo est arbor inuersa a man is a tree turned for a tree hath his roote in the ground and his branches spread aboue ground but a mans root is his head therein is the fountaine of sense and motion and there doth hee take in nourishment but the armes and legs as branches of this tree they spread downeward
and there is a mysterie shadowed in this for the roote of a christian man it is in heauen our life is hid in christ

and we spread downeward fructifying in good workes in the sight of the world whereas before we were in christ our roote was downeward

it was in old adam and it bare fruit answerable to that roote this saint paul sets downe excellently

cor
the first man was of the earth earthly the second was the lord from heauen as is the earthly so are they that are earthly and as is the heauenly so are they that are heauenly
this is the first reason of the holy ghosts choise

a second reason is

because a tree is the best patterne of synceritie make the tree good saith our sauiour and the fruit will bee good

make the tree euill and the fruit will be euill for a good tree cannot beare euill fruit nor an euill tree good fruit
there is no dissimulation in a tree neither should there be in men but it fals out too often that mens outside and there inside are not like they are plaine and very hypocrites

a third reason why the holy ghost delighteth in this similie is because a tree is a patterne of true gloriation it makes shew of nothing but its owne fruit its owne leaues by them doth it commend it selfe vnto the husbandman and men should not stand vpon their pedigrees but vpon their owne vertues and thinke themselues best graced by that which testifieth their owne worth
but enough of the reasonablenesse of the holy ghosts choice especially seeing the analogie that is betweene the particular parts of this resemblance will more and more confirme the same
some inquire what tree is here meant whether the oliue psal
or the palme tree psal
because these are perpetually flourishing and greene but suppose that the whole contexture of this verse alludes to the garden of eden or rather the vision ezech

where we find flourishing trees planted by the waters of the sanctuarie that place and this haue the same mysticall sense
but let vs come to the branches of the similie
and first wee are to see what good is done for the tree and that appeares in the care and the choice of the husbandman we haue here first his care he plants the tree
the tree is not natiue but satiue not a wilde tree but a tree of the orchard and there is great ods betweene such trees and the ods is worth the marking for this obserued in the outside of the parable giues light vnto that which we must principally obserue in the inside
in the first of genesis god bids the earth bring forth trees but genesis the second it is said that god planted a garden and there doth god first shew himselfe to bee an husbandman as christ cals him iohn
the holy ghost doth often frequent that similie to giue vs to vnderstand that gods care of man is more then ordinary wee see in the creation with what circumstances the framing of man is described let vs make man after our owne image and when man forfeited the newmaking cost more care the second planting then the first

saint hierome out of aquila reades transplanted and indeed so it is
we grew vpon a wilde oliue and wee are grafted into a true wee were branches of a degenerated vine and are now set into a generous to speake it plainly we were children of wrath and are made children of god besides our birth in our mothers wombe wee haue a new birth

in the wombe of the church this saint paul rom
speaking of baptisme expresseth by planting and he calls a man newly baptised undefined span alphabet newly planted which word is frequent in the councels

our note is
we must acknowledge the prerogatiue of a christian aboue other men which must carrie with it an acknowledgement of gods speciall care vouchsafed the faithfull whereof infidels haue no proofe they continue wild whereas wee are planted trees they lie in the dregs of nature whereas we are brought to the state of grace
the second good that is done to the tree appeares in the choice that is made of the soyle
it is no small benefit for a tree to be planted but that is not enough it must also be fitted with conuenient ground otherwise much care might be ill spent here we haue choice ground it is locus irriguus well watered ground and such is commended for the growth of trees especially if the waters bee artificially diuided and carried round about the trees that they may yeeld nourishment to the root which way soeuer they spread and such is the site of our tree it is not onely planted by the waters but also by the diuisions of waters it hath iuyce enough and that well disposed

this is the outside of the resemblance but the inside teacheth vs that as we christians are beholding to god the father by whose care we are planted so are we to god the sonne by whose spirit wee are watered
for indeed by baptisme we are incorporated into christ he is the soyle that beares the spirituall trees

hee is the fountaine opened to the house of israel for cleansing mentioned in zacharie

he is a well of liuing waters springing vnto eternall life whereof we read in saint iohn hee is the waters that streaming from the sanctuarie ran into the dead sea

and were both sanantes and viuificantes healed the trees that grew on the bankes thereof and made them beare fruit abundantly both which properties are necessarily required for a transplanted tree that it may cease to bee what it was and become what it should be and wee doe finde a mortifying and a quickening grace in christ abolishing our old man and reuiuing the new

finally there are in christ riui aquarum

he that beleeueth in me saith christ out of his belly shall flow riuers of waters of life yea as wee haue manifold diseases and wants so may wee finde manifold remedies and supplies in christ his grace doth compasse vs on euerie side and is at hand euerie where to steed vs so good choyce hath god made of the soyle wherein to plant the trees and so well are christians prouided for that are made members of christ
and so haue opened vnto you the good that is done for this tree let vs now goe on and see what good comes of it
and wee shall finde that as it receiued so it yeelds a double good for it proues welll and is well approued it proues well whether you looke to the principall or to the accessorie good which is expected of a tree

the principall good is to beare good fruit and so doth this it bringeth forth fruit
fructus comes from fruor it must bee such a thing as is vsefull not briers or thornes that scratch and spoile of which kinde

there is more then enough appearing as well in mens liues as growing vpon trees
whereupon it comes to passe that the prouerbe is changed and in stead of homo homini deus wee may now say homo homini daemon men liue not for their mutuall good but ruine

as that which a tree beares must be fruit so must hee bring it forth
those that are planted in the church must not conceale the grace they haue receiued no more then a tree doth his sap
wee glorie in the discouerie of rich metals and precious stones that nature hath buried in the earth and the sea wee suffer nothing of this great world to lye hid we loue to bring it forth to behold to shew it so should we deale with the gifts and graces which god hath treasured vp in this our little world
no tree should striue more to send forth fruits then wee to bring forth workes
but we must looke that the works be good as the fruit of this tree is
it hath the two markes of good fruit set vpon it it is kindly it is timely
lignum rationale saith hilarie dat fructum non confusè non importunè as the naturall so the spirituall tree bringeth forth fruit neither confusedly nor vnseasonably
let vs behold these two properties first in the naturall then in the spirituall tree
first let vs see how kinde it is
profert fructum suum
suum is a relatiue and lookes backe vnto the good that is done for the tree the first appeares in the care of him that of a wilde tree it a planted tree and it must not degenerate againe and beare fruit answerable to his former stocke being a generous vine it must not beare wilde grapes nor sower oliues being made partaker of the sweetnesse of the true oliue tree
the children of god must not liue like the sonnes of men neither must the members of the second adam liue as if they were members of the first
we are offended when we see such degenerating in the trees of our orchard it were to be wished we not approue it in our selues that are of the garden of god
the ouerflowing of atheismes heresies and impurities doe testifie to the world that we beare vnkindly fruit
but suum his fruit refers not onely to the husbandmans care but also to the fruitfulnesse of the soyle and so requires not onely a good nature but a good measure also
for a tree to beare scant fruit where there is good store of iuyce must needs be vnkindly and it is not kindly for men to be sparing in doing well who are rooted so neere vnto the fountaine of grace
for him that hath fiue talents to yeeld but two or him that hath ten to yeeld but fiue will make but a bad accompt seeing god expects that men shall render according to that which they doe receiue

moreouer suum doth import a respect to the doer and also vnto others as it is ioyned with profert
looke vpon it and you shall finde that grace abilitie to doe well but the faculties of our soule seasoned with grace are they that are exercised in well doing therefore is the worke reputed ours as the fruit is reputed to be borne by the branch of the wilde oliue though it be beholding to the new stocke of whose

fatnesse and sweetnesse it doth partake for that it is able to beare such fruit it is no small honour that god doth vs in that he makes his gifts so become ours

but as suum giues vs undefined span alphabet a possession and proprietie of the worke so prefert cals for a undefined span alphabet or a communicating of the worke vnto others we must bee good dispencers of the grace of god and edifie others with our gifts
and here we see a difference betweene rationall and irrationall trees of irrationall trees as of other creatures the rule is true vos non vobis they yeeld much good for which themselues are neuer a whit the better but rationall trees reape good of that where with they doe good they doe good because they bring forth fruit and from this themselues also reape good because the fruit continues their owne and shall be reckoned vnto them in the day of the lord

finally by his fruit wee may vnderstand such workes as belong to euery mans vocation
for as in an orchard there is varietie of fruit plum trees and euery tree endeauours to sucke iuice answerable to his kind that it may beare such fruit and an doth not turne a plum tree nor a a but euery tree contents it selfe to bee of its owne kind so in the church are there varieties of callings pastors people magistrates subiects euery one is to walke as he is called of god

learne what belongs thereto and not incroach vpon or entermedle with that which belongs to others
except men heed this whatsoeuer good they seeme to doe it is not accepted the saying of the romane generall to the souldier that kept the tents when he should haue beene fighting in the field non amo nimiùm diligentes will be vsed of god if he call vs to one profession and we busie our selues about another god will not like such busie bodies

as the fruit is kindly so is it also timely the tree bringeth forth fruit in his season
as there are diuers seasons in the yeere so are there fruites for euery season the health of our body doth require it should be so for whose sustenance these fruites were prouided that is vnkind to bee taken in winter which was fit in summer neither will that serue at autumne which was made for the spring euen so the qualities of men haue their seasons and as the preacher saith there is a time for euery thing

a time for weeping and a time for laughing a time for peace and a time for warre
nehemiah doth blame the people that wept

and biddeth them goe and feast god reproueth the people that did feast because it was then a time to fast rehoboam was stared by the prophet

when he would haue warred vpon israel iehosaphat is rebuked by a prophet for that hee would haue societie with the king of israel
the ground of this varietie is we may not rebuke when we should comfort nor comfort when we should rebuke the habits of vertues must be alwayes in vs but the acts must be exercised vpon their iust occasions

you see by this time that the tree proues well in regard of the principall good that is expected from a tree neither is it lesse true in regard of the accessorie good the accessorie good are leaues and indeede the accessorie are a great good of the tree for they are ornamentum arboris

and fructuum they make the tree more pleasant to behold and serue for to defend the fruit from the iniurie of the weather therefore are they compared to the haire of a mans head which if it should be missing euery man sees how much deformitie and discommoditie would come vnto our head

but this is but the out side of the parable
good workes haue their circumstances which in doing them must bee obserued and are as behoofefull to the worke as leaues to the tree both to recommend it and also to defend it for example he that giues must giue with cheerefulnesse hee that obeyes must doe it with willingnesse hee that reproues must doe it with charitablenesse take away these circumstances and a churlish gift is not worth thankes stubborne seruice cannot content neither will a man be reclaimed by a malicious reproofe put these circumstances to it and if euer a man will be thankfull it will be to him that giues vnto him cheerefully if any seruant will please it is hee that doth his dutie willingly and if euer an vntoward nature will be altered charitie must season the reproofe due circumstances giue a sweete influence vnto a good worke and they are the best apologie to stop the mouthes of slanderers
such leaues a good tree beares and a good man obserues such circumstances

and he obserues them constantly for his leafe neuer fadeth
the reason why the leaues fade and fall is the disproportion betweene the heate and the moysture when the heate is too weake and so the moysture fals backe to the roote or else is too strong and consumes it faster then it can be supplied by the roote so that if the leafe neuer fade there must needes euer be a good proportion betweene them
the grace of god is compared sometimes to fire sometimes to water because it hath a warming and cooling propertie a drying and a moystning it warmeth vs when we are ouer cold as we are too often in doing good and when through indiscreete zeale wee are ouer hot then doth grace coole vs and keepe vs in a good temper sometimes wee are ouer drie and spating in doing well grace then serues to moysten vs and make vs more friuitfull and when we grow luxuriant it drieth vp our superfluities and brings vs to a meane from the due proportion of these qualities ruling our actions it comes to passe that as a tree casteth not his leaues so wee faile not in the circumstances which must order our good workes
fruit without leaues or leaues without fruit make but an imperfect good tree so good workes without due circumstances and circumstances without good workes make but an imperfect man
as then the trees of paradise were all good for foode and pleasant to behold

good for foode in regard of their fruit and beautifull to behold in regard of their leaues euen so should the spirituall trees bee meane christian men their workes should be both vsefull and gracefull otherwise they are not answerable to this tree neither doe they attaine the perfection of christian men
and let this suffice to shew that the tree proues well

as it proues well so it is well approued for what it doth prospers yea it is as well approued as it proues well for whatsoeuer it doth prospers

the prospering of the tree may well bee expounded out of the parable of trees iudg
where the oliues fatnesse is said to bee that wherewith they honour god and man and the vines wine that wherewith they cheere both that is the good vse that is made of them is their prosperitie
and what is the prosperitie of a rationall tree but that our workes set forth gods honour and edifie men onely the rationall tree hath one aduantage aboue the irrationall that it yeelds the doer a good testimonie of his good conscience it is a great blessing when a man doth labour to be assured of this that he labours not in vaine

neither doth the tree onely prosper well but the prosperitie of it is vniuersall whatsoeuer he doth prospers
as he brings foorth good leaues and good fruit so there comes a blessing vpon them both
it is the vnhappinesse of the wicked that nothing goeth well with them their very table as it is in the psalme is made their snare and that which should bee for their comfort is made vnto them an occasion of falling

but all things worke for the best to them that loue god as the apostle telleth vs rom
their very afflictions are matter of exceeding ioy iam
and this is
mysterium crucis wherewith none are acquainted but those that are truly initiated into christ

bede goeth a step farther and shewes that their very sinnes doe prosper he instanceth in saint peters fall by which he profited in humilitie and compassion we may instance also in dauid and others and this is miraculum miraculorum that god turnes both sorts of euils as well culpae as paene as well of sinne as woe into the profit of a good man god turneth it say for his hand it is that workes so strange effects and his hand is implyed in iaztliack which though it be vulgarly translated shall prosper yet according to the coniugation it may signifie shall make to prosper and then must there bee some efficient which most fitly must bee accounted god
and god will blesse in making all things to prosper that a good man takes in hand as in the creation when he saw all things that himselfe had made that it was good then he blessed it
or if you will referre it to the tree or the christian noted by the tree then the meaning is that the worke prospers for the persons sake
and indeede if we bee in ill termes with god that which wee doe will succeede but ill as all will succeede well if we bee in good termes but the prosperitie here meant must be vnderstood not corporally but spiritually for corporally they often are distressed though that distresse in the end turnes to their greater good
finally saint chrysostom vnderstands christ by this tree and indeed what you haue heard can fully agree to none but vnto him hee is the tree of life and the best of vs is but a branch in that tree yea a diseased branch therefore we must acknowledge the perfection of this resemblance in him and begge that according to our proportion it may bee communicated vnto vs

god our father which is the spirituall husbandman so continue and cheerish our plantation in christ that wee may by the holy

ghost become more and more fruitfull and gracefull spirituall trees abounding in good workes and doing them as wee ought that the world may bee the better for them and wee finding grace in gods eyes may euer enioy the comfort of them
amen

epigraph

psal
vers
the vngodly are not so but are like the chaffe which the wind drineth away

the reward which god bestowes vpon them which performe their vow made vnto him in baptisme is as you haue heard in the first word of this psalme blessednesse blessednesse in this life and blessednesse in the life to come
as this blessednesse consists of two degrees so doth this psalme yeeld vnto vs of either degree a speciall euidence a speciall euidence of the blessednesse which is in this world and that stands in the difference which euen during this life may bee obserued betweene the good and bad we haue that difference exprest here in the third and fourth verses
of the good haue already spoken on the third verse haue shewed you how fitly they are compared vnto a tree a tree for which much good is done whether you respect the husbandmans care in planting it or choyce of the soyle wherein it is set
and as there is good done to it so comes there good of it for it proues well and is as well approued proues well in fruit and leaues good fruit for it is kindly and timely neuer fading leaues which are a perpetuall ornament of a tree and muniment of the fruits
and as it proues well so is it well approued whatsoeuer it doth is acceptable to god profitable to men and comfortable to the tree
these things you heard enlarged and applyed to a good man it followes that now come on and you heare what this scripture saith of a bad man
wherein you must consider these two points first whom the holy ghost meanes by the vngodly secondly what miserie euen in this life is heaped vpon them
first they are not what they seeme to be non sic improbi it is not so with the wicked they haue no part in the resemblance of the blessed tree secondly what they seeme not to bee that they are a worse resemblance fits them for they are no better then winnowed chaffe
begin with the first they are here called vngodly

venerable bede obsernes well that by the vngodly you must vnderstand not onely incredulos but also falsos christianos not only the godlesse infidell which is without the church but also the counterfeit beleeuer that liues within the church
and indeed paul rom
out of the psalmes and other passages of scripture making an anatomie of a wicked man giues a good rule those things which the law speaketh it

speaketh to them that are vnder the law so that all they must take this title to themselues that professe they know god but denie him in their workes that haue a forme of godlinesse but deny the power thereof are called christians but yeeld no odour of that sweet oyntment which being powred vpon christ the head runnes downe to the verie skirts of his garments
and therefore whosoeuer they are that are any parts of his coat they should all of them smell of mirrhe aloes and cassia

and shew forth the vertues of him that hath called them out of darknesse into his marueilous light
all should but more then a good many doe not and therefore they come vnder this name of vngodly

but enough of the persons of whom haue spoken at large vpon the first verse let vs come on to their state remembring this that all come vnder the state that come vnder the name if they bee vngodly they partake of the miserie
and what is their miserie surely they are not what they seeme to be and what they seeme not to be that they are
they are not what they seeme to be for in this world of all men the vngodly seeme to be in best state but my text denieth it non sic improbi it is not so well with them they are not that blessed tree
what then surely what they seeme not to bee that they are they are in a much worse state and therefore are set forth in a baser resemblance they are but like chaffe that is driuen by the wind
strange doctrine the whole text is a verie paradox

a paradox is a truth which crosseth the common opinion of the truth of this saying there can be no question seeing it is gods word but sure am that the state of the vngodly is commonly taken to bee much better if any surely they in this life seeme to be that blessed tree haue seene saith dauid the vngodly in great prosperitie

and flourishing like a greene bay tree in the second of esay they are compared to the cedars of lebanon and the okes of basan and what a goodly tree was nebuchadnezzar so he is compared dan

where wee read that his top reached vp to heauen his branches spread to the ends of the earth he was full loaden with fruit and all the birds of the aire did harbour in his boughes and yet the holy ghost saith non sic impij the vngodly are no trees no blessed trees

how then shall we proue this truth we must helpe our selues out of another psalme the sonnes of men of low degree are but vanitie

and men of high degree are but a lye all is not gold that glisters neither may wee mistake a painted face for natiue beautie he that goeth to a play shall see on the stage kings and queenes and other personages of worth in outward shew whereas indeed the persons that acted them are base and mercenarie fellowes
and this world is but a great stage and the wicked are but personated actors or players not one appeares as hee is or to follow the similie of trees which god himselfe is pleased to vse deut
the wicked are compared vnto the vines of sodome and gomorrah that beare grapes in shew but the iuyce of them is nothing but gall and bitternesse yea it is deadly poyson
they that write the historie of that countrey obserue that the fruit thereof makes great shew but

when men come neere it and touch it it resolues altogether into cinders which hapily the wise man meaneth when he saith that there grow plants bearing fruit which neuer come to ripenesse

euen such is the prosperitie of the wicked faire in shew nothing in substance
the reason is plaine

for seeing god onely is good and nothing good farther then it partakes of him vngodlinesse that separates from god must needs depriue of good and he is but a verie wretch that hath whatsoeuer else is called good if he haue it without god yea he is more wretched by so hauing what he desires then by wanting it
it is saint austins note and there is good reason for it euen that aphorisme in physicke corpora corrupta quo magis nutris eo magis laedis hee that giueth a sicke man whatsoeuer he cals for may hapily please his taste but hee will surely encrease his disease honour pleasure wealth make vngodly men vnhappily happy so that if you looke vpon them with the eyes of faith and not with the eyes of flesh and bloud you will acknowledge this to bee true though strange the vngodly are not what they seeme to be they seeme to be happie but indeed they are vnhappie
two wayes vnhappie
for first you must strip them of true blisse non sic they are not like the blessed tree then must you cloath them with their contempt they are like the chaffe
need but touch at the former
you will easily conceiue that branch of their miserie by measuring the priuation by the habit and you must iudge of the want by the desireablenesse of that which they doe want

god takes care of the blessed tree of a tree of the field a wild tree he maketh it a tree of the orchard a planted tree
non sic impij no such care taken for the vngodly they are as left to themselues to grow on in the corruption of their natures


the blessed tree is planted by the riuers of waters it is set where it cannot want

on euery side it is supplied with abundance of iuice
if god as the husbandman take care of any christ will be vnto him a fountaine of liuing waters his grace will bee sufficient for him non sic impij they drinke little of christs spirit as they are little husbanded by gods care


the blessed tree as it receiues good so it yeelds good againe
for first it proues well it yeelds kindly fruit
non sic impij their fruit is not theirs but it is the fruit of him that sets them on worke that is of the diuell
for marke the naturall fruit that our vnderstanding should beare is truth and that our will should beare is good the very philosophers haue taught vs that truth is the naturall obiect of the vnderstanding and good of the will but our vnderstanding bringeth forth lyes to deceiue vs and our will sinnes to giue mortall wounds vnto vs

if we bee vngodly
and what are these but the fruites of the diuell who is a lyar and a murderer from the beginning


the blessed tree brings forth not only kindly but timely fruit also his good deedes are as seasonable as they are vertuous non sic impij
the scripture especially the prouerbs teacheth vs that the wicked are peruerse they are peruerse in that they doe not onely what they should not

but also when they should not they will feast and be frolicke

when they should humble themselues before god and when they should be ioyfull and cheerefully serue god then will they bee discontent and fall to their teares as the iewes when after their returne from babylon they laide the foundation of the temple in the booke of numbers you shall find

that when god would haue had the israelites enter into canaan then they would backe againe into aegypt and when god would not haue them goe then they would needs hasten into canaan


the blessed tree beares not onely fruit but leaues
a good man cloatheth his good deeds with good circumstances non sic impij
if happily an vngodly man vndertake a good matter he wil marre it in the manner of doing of it if he giue he will doe it churlishly if he reproue hee will doe it vncharitably if he pray hee will doe it hypocritically finally whatsoeuer hee doth he will doe it vntowardly and so his good doth no good and so proues no good at all

finally the blessed tree is as well approued as it proues well
when a good man doth good it pleaseth god and it profits men and they haue comfort of it themselues
non sic impij god abhorreth them as being vnlike vnto him and to men they are as odious as they are mischieuous finally they can take litle true content in themselues because in themselues they can find little true good

and so haue you seene the vngodly stript of all that is desireable in the blessed tree so that although with the church of laodicea they say that they are rich and increast with goods and haue neede of nothing

yet by by this time you see that they are wretched miserable poore blinde and naked

and a man would thinke this were miserie enough so to be stript
the holy ghost doth not leaue them so but as it tels vs that they are not what they seeme to be so doth it also tell vs that what they would not seeme to be that indeed they are and this it teacheth in another similie
he resembles them to dust or to chaffe driuen with the wind he doth not resemble them to nothing for manet in ijs materia poenalis
sinne as the schoole teach is nothing but not simply nothing it were happie for the wicked if as they were made at first of nothing so sinne would bring them to nothing againe but sinne is such a nothing as euer cleaues vnto that which continueth something it destroyes the but not the being of a creature
for example by sinne our vnderstanding doth not cease to be but to bee furnished with the true light whereby we may see the way of life and our will loseth not her being but her holy power of choice as likewise our affections are depriued of their true taste
this which so remaynes being depraued with sinne doth saint hilarie fitly call materiam paenalem it remaynes vnto our greater woe

but to come to the similie
the vngodly doe not thinke so well of themselues but the holy ghost thinketh as meanly it appeares by the resemblance dust or chaffe things that are next to nothing
and indeed to set forth their vilenesse the holy ghost doth varie such kind

of resemblances sometimes by representing them by scumme sometimes by froth sometimes by drosse sometimes calling them vanitie yea psal
casting them below vanitie in the scales if they bee both put they will ascend lighter then vanitie
the reason is because all imperfection that is in vnreasonable creatures is but malum poenae and therefore must needs come short of malum culpae seeing the least sinne is worse then the greatest woe therefore the greatest woe doth not sufficiently set forth the euill of the least sinne
we need not therefore wonder that the holy ghost doth vse so meane resemblances to set forth the vngodly in whom there is so little worth

but to come closer to it
they are like dust or chaffe
puluis licet terra sit tamen terra esse desijt quia nihil habet solidi destitutus humore that which is dust was earth but by loosing his moysture it is no longer a part of the earth and chaffe was a part of the eare of corne though being thresht it continues no longer a part of the eare take which resemblance you will though the latter is thought best to expresse the originall this you may gather that all the vngodly haue their originall in the church though they doe not shew themselues to be of the church
the husbandman carrieth out cleane seed but when it growes into an eare that eare that beares the good graine beares also chaffe

our sauiour christ vseth this similie comparing the world to gods field his word vnto seed and himselfe vnto the sower and surely god neuer sowed any of his heauenly seed but the eares did spring accompanied with chaffe god sowed it in adam of whom sprang cain and abel cain plaine chaffe abel good corne he sowed it in noah of whom sprange sem cham and iapheth sem and iapheth good corne but cham very chaffe hee sowed it in abraham of whom sprang ishmael and isaac in isaac of whom sprang iacob and esau from both came chaffe as well as good corne
and this resemblance of chaffe doth adde much to the vngodlinesse of the vngodly that being vouchsafed to be in the church they haue so little grace as not to be of the church which agrees well vnto those persons which told you before were meant here by vngodly namely counterfeit christians

but chaffe hath two remarkable things in it ariditatem and sterilitatem which you may very fitly oppose to the double good of the blessed tree the drinesse is opposite to the good that is done for the tree and the barrennesse to the good that comes of it
touching the drinesse it is plaine to any one that beholds chaffe for though while it was growing it had some sap yet being cut downe from the root which did feed it and thresht from the graine which might yeeld some moisture to it it must needs be drie
and such is the condition of the vngodly if they let goe their which they haue on christ by a true faith and lose themselues from that blessed communion which they haue with saints what sap of grace can there be in them seeing these two are the only meanes of grace and without these we may not expect any sap of life
therefore ieremie compareth

the wicked vnto the heath in the desart

and parched places in the wildernesse in a salt land

and if they bee subiect to drinesse they must needs bee subiect to barrennesse for who can expect fruit where there is no sap seeing sap is the cause of fruit and who can expect good workes where there is no grace seeing it comes of grace that man doth any thing that is good but the vngodly are not only compared vnto chaffe but vnto winnowed chaffe
the state of the vngodly is but meane if they bee no better then chaffe but their state is meaner if that chaffe be winnowed
it is some honour to the chaffe that it cleaues to the eare of corne growing in the field and in the threshing floore lieth mingled with the graines but it loseth much though not of its substance which it neuer had yet of the countenance which it seemed to haue if once it come to be winnowed
those that are not of the church acquire some estimation by being in the church which they vtterly lose when they leaue that communion

but what is this winnowing the fathers obserue a double winde that turmoyles the vngodly there is ventus vanitatis and ventus iudicij they are exposed to an inward and to an outward wind the inward wind is the wind of vanitie that taketh them sometimes in the head and as saint paul speaketh ephes

they are carried about with euery wind of doctrine by the slight of man and as saint iames

they waue about and are vnstable in all their wayes
let a theudas or a iudas of galilie come amongst the iewes let a montanus or a mahomet come amongst the christians what a company will they draw after them vnlearned and vnstable soules how are they besotted with nouelties how are they with their owne heads winnowed like chaffe

neither with their heads only but also with their hearts
there is not a passion which like a strong gale of winde doth not transport them anger raiseth stormes within them vaine glorie as wings carrieth them beyond themselues couetousnesse makes them base enuie makes them vnsociable pride maketh them tyrants luxurie makes them beasts the vngodly are as plyable as a weathercocke neither need they any other winde to shift their situation but only their owne passions

but as if this inward wind did not turmoile them enough they are subiect to an outward the wind of gods iudgement which the chaldee paraphrase calls ventum furentem and the prophets very commonly call it a whirlewind
saint iohn baptist tels vs

that christ shall come with his fanne in his hand and therewith shall throughly purge his floore
where marke that gods iudgement is compared to wind of which our sauiour christ tels nicodemus the wind bloweth where it listeth

thou knowest not whence it commeth nor whether it goeth so doe gods iudgements surprize men when the vngodly crie peace peace

then comes suddaine destruction vpon them
you shall find this fully and excellently described iob

but marke the opposition of chaffe vnto the wind the weaknesse of to the irrisistiblensse of the wind especially if it be a whirlewind whither you respect the impotencie of their owne affections vnder which they sinke or gods vengeance which must needes them
who would set the briars and thornes against me in battle saith god esay will goe through them will burne them together it must needs make much to the miserie of the vngodly that being so little able they must abide so violent an encounter violent it is but yet such as is meet for them for the vngodly are called reshagnim turbulent and tumultuous people and what iudgement is so fit for them as to bee harrowed and hurled with the wind they that giue rest to none it is pittie they should haue any rest
the vulgar addes to the text exegeticè from the earth the wind driues the chaffe from the earth
saint hierome makes a good note vpon it tàm infoelix erit impius vt ne terrenus sit puluis most miserable is the case of the vngodly when the earth that bare them

will not endure them
god in deuteronomie threatens such a iudgement to the iewes and we see that at this day they endure it their case may be any mans case and if wee bee vngodly the whirlewind may driue vs out of the good land which god bestowes vpon vs russinus goeth a step higher si facies terrae species patriae accipitur recrè puluis facie terrae proijci dicitur quia visione calestis gloriae impius remouetur
adam in paradise below forfeited paradise aboue and the iewes had little hope of heauen the truth that were cast out of canaan the type thereof neither may wee presume of the kingdome of glorie if we be vnworthy of the kingdome of grace
and no wonder for chaffe that is winnowed from the threshing hoore is reserued for the fire

as saint iohn baptist telleth vs neither are the wicked separated from the good but for their greater woe

but must conclude
three things we learne in this text first that the vngodly are subiect to a double punishment poena damni and poena sensus they are depriued of great good and the euill is great whereunto they are exposed
secondly the non sic and the sicut aduise vs to compare the happinesse of the blessed tree with the miserie of this winnowed chaffe that the contraries being set one against the other we may the better discerne them and resolue which of them to choose
last of all we may see that there is no reason why we should enuie the pompes and vanities of this wicked world seeing they haue neither substance nor continuance
iob teacheth it more then once and so doth dauid psal
and
when we goe to a play we doe with the eyes of our reason correct the eyes of our bodie and our reason iudgeth them but varlots whom our sense beholds as kings it were to be wished that when we come to the stage of this world we would bring thither aswell the eyes of faith as of reason our iudgement would not bee so often perplext nor our resolution staggered as they are with the seeming prosperitie and glorie of the world we would with moses

esteeme the rebuke of christ better then the treasures of egypt and endeauor to be happy rather in deed then shew

to shut vp all
blessed we would all be in this world but few take notice of the euidence of true blessednesse that euidence is in the first resemblance the resemblance to the tree let vs obserue it and desire to partake it otherwise we may be deluded with a seeming euidence which you haue heard of in the latter resemblance the resemblance of winnowed chaffe the double miserie that is in it should make vs abhorre it as the double good of the former should make vs affect it

god giue vs a true iudgement to distinguish them and grace to make that discreet choice that we may partake the former of them
amen

psal
vers
therefore the vngodly shall not stand in the iudgement nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous

the words contain the second of those euidences whereby it may be known who are blessed
men are blessed in this life and that which is to come and god hath set marks vpon either degree of blessednesse
the markes of the first degree you heard vnfolded when last spake vnto you vpon this psalme it followes then that now open vnto you the markes of the second degree so farre as find them exprest in this verse
for the better vnderstanding whereof we must obserue first what matter is contained in these words and then whereupon these words are inferred
in the world to come there are two remarkable things the entrance into and the state of it in either of these there is some thing common and something proper both to the good and the bad
in the entrance that which is common is iudgement both must come to the barre that which is proper is that in the iudgement the righteous can the vngodly cannot stand
in the state it is common to good and bad to bee societies or congregations but it is proper to the righteous to be of such a congregation whereinto the vngodly shall not come neither shall the righteous come into the congregation whereof the vngodly shall be
so much must bee supplyed pari the ground is the same for both the reason of the latter difference is contained in the former for they that differ in the iudgement must differ in the societie also seeing god is pleased that that shall be the ordinarie passage vnto this
these are the contents of the words

but you must take notice of the inference also remembred by the first word therefore
that will informe vs that the euidence of blessednesse in the life to come depends vpon the euidence of blessednesse in this present life
he that is blessed here shall bee blessed hereafter and hee

shall neuer bee blessed hereafter that is not blessed here
and so haue shewed you whereof you shall heare come wee then to the text and first to the contents thereof wherein wee must first see what is common to the good and the bad at their entrance into the world to come and that is iudgement

by iudgement the chaldee paraphrast vnderstands the generall assizes that shall be kept at the end of this world and he is in his interpretation followed by most diuines ancient and moderne
this being the meaning of this word the persons here mentioned righteous and vngodly must be vnderstood to appeare as well in their bodies as their soules
there is a iudgement that passeth before vpon them wherein their bodies are seuered from their soules but that iudgement is priuate and particular whereas this is publike and generall and though they agree for the most part in the substance yet in the solemnitie they differ much and the latter doth much improue the former whether you respect the glorie of the iudge or the doome of the iudged
this being resolued that the iudgement is that which shall be at the last day we must here obserue how the holy ghost speaketh very accurately in these words
he saith not the vngodly and sinners shall not be iudged but the vngodly shall not stand in the iudgement nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
and so the words haue in them aliquid commune which they imply and aliquid proprium which they expresse it is common to all the persons here mentioned good and bad to be iudged but proper to the bad not to stand in iudgement

it is common to good and bad to come vnto iudgement as commom as to rise from the dead
saint paul who acts
saith there shall be a resurrection of the iust and vniust saith distinctly

cor
that we shall all appeare before the iudgement seate of christ to receiue according to that which euery man hath done in his bodie be it good or ill
daniel in the twelfth of his prophesie teacheth the verie same

many of those that sleepe in the dust shall rise some to euerlasting life and some to euerlasting shame
the verie same also wee learne of the preacher in his twelfth chapter

god shall bring euery worke into iudgement and euerie secret thing whether it be good or whether it be euill
the point is so cleare that it is made an article of our faith so that shall not need to adde any more proofe

here note that wheras god is an absolute lord most wise most holy most mightie so that he knoweth all and detests all sinne and may deale with sinners at his pleasure yet hee will haue all the world see that he receiues none into heauen nor sends any vnto hell but the ground of his doing is iust for he sentenceth both in iudgement so that there can bee no exception taken not by malice it selfe vnto his proceeding
both good and bad passe by iudgement to their state
and let this suffice concerning that which is common vnto good and bad in the entrance into the world to come

come now to that which is proper
and here must begin with venerable bedes rule intellectus est per opposita
we must conceiue

that what is denied to the vngodly is granted to the righteous so that these concise words must be resolued into more and so some not vnfitly supply in the first branch of this sentence a word that is found in the last to make it cleere wherefore they read thus the vngodly shall not stand in the iudgement of the righteous that is the vngodly shall not stand in that iudgement wherein the righteous shall stand
let vs then consider these propositions asunder first that which is exprest then that which is implyed
the exprest proposition is the vngodly shall not stand in iudgement
standing in is opposed to both shrinking from and sinking vnder iudgement so that if the vngodly shall not stand it followeth they will shrinke from and sinke vnder it
and indeed the holy ghost obserues both when god ariseth vnto iudgement the wicked will first trie their heeles but when they will not serue then they grow heartlesse and despaire of helpe

but to open these branches a little more fully
flight is the first attempt of the vngodly at the day of iudgement they are forced vnto it from within and from without from the horrour of their owne conscience and from the terrour of the iudge
touching conscience it is an vndeniable truth that where there is sense of guilt there is distresse of feare see it in our adam no sooner had hee eaten of the forbidden fruit and his eyes were opened thereby but hee tooke couert and when hee was questioned hee gaue god this reason for his flying
saw that was naked
neither was it his case only

it is hereditarie to all his ofspring salomon hath put it in a prouerbe

the wicked flie when no man pursueth them god hath put it into his law where the israelites are threatned that if they breake gods couenant one part of their punishment shall be amazednesse of heart

and such a fearefulnesse as that they shall flie at the shaking of a leafe
an example we haue in foelix

who trembled when saint paul did but preach of righteousnesse and iudgement to come

as the guilt of conscience so likewise the terrour of the iudge will make the wicked to flie
when god gaue his law he gaue it with that terrour that the people gaue backe and stood afarre off yea moses himselfe confesseth as saint paul reports that he was greatly afraid

and how much more thinke you shall the wicked be afraid when christ shall come in the glorie of his father with all his angels with the dreadfull sound of the trumpet and all the world burning round about him certainly it cannot but strike such a terrour as shall make the wicked betake themselues to their heeles
christ in the gospell describing the last day saith

that men shall be at their wits ends for feare and expectation of the euils to come they shall call to the rockes to hide them to the mountaines to fall vpon them
saint iohn repeates the very same reckoning kings great men rich men mightie men bond free the voice of euery one of them shall be this the great day of the lambs wrath is come and who shall be able for to stand reuel


put these causes of flight together and then learne from saint iohn

if our conscience doe accuse vs god is greater then our conscience and

knoweth all things
and yet saint basil maketh such a liuely description of the worke of conscience in iudgement that a man would thinke nothing could be added to the terrour thereof

undefined span alphabet
the conscience will so limme out our liues and be such a looking glasse of all our deeds that by an vnspeakable power in a moment of time as we would thinke nothing can better represent our selues to our selues

but for all that the heart of a man is an intricate labyrinth none knoweth it but god only as god himselfe teacheth in ieremie

as all things are naked before his eyes so will he then bring many things to light which are hid in darknesse
when then both these terrours concurre whereof the one so much increaseth the other you will not wonder that the wicked vpon the apprehension thereof betake themselues to flight

flying is their shift but it is a vaine one for whether should they flie when euery creature which at the creation was made a souldier in gods hoast shall at the last day become a iaylour to arrest prisoners and present them at his assizes what remayneth then but that they that cannot shrinke from the iudgement

sinke vnder it for wickednesse condemned by her owne witnesse is very timerous and being prest with conscience alwayes forecasteth terrible things the man that was but questioned for wanting his wedding garment at the marriage

grew presently speechlesse our sauiour luke
saith that their iudgement shall come like a snare and indeed in the psalme we reade that god shall raine vpon the wicked

snares fire and brimstone storme and tempest this is their partion to drinke
now we know that a snare doth not only take but the wild beast that is taken therein

but if the terrour of the iudge doe not

vnder whom the mightiest helpes doe stoope as it is in iob nor the inextricable suddaines of his iudgement yet the weight of sinne will crush and beare a sinner to the ground

dauid in his owne person and conflicts with a guiltie conscience out of which notwithstanding by gods mercie he did finally rise yet confesseth that the sense of guilt is like a drowning floud like a crushing burden a burden too heauie for man to beare and if the righteous that man after gods owne heart when he sell as a man were scarcely saued where shall the vngodly

and the vnrighteous appeare you see then how true it is that the vngodly shall not stand in iudgement causâ cadent cadent persond themselues with their cause shall fall to the ground they shall both sinke as low as the chambers of death

but concessum quod impijs negatum as bede noteth though they shall not yet shall the righteous stand
and no maruell for they shall bee free both from the guilt of conscience and the terrour of the iudge
and why their hearts are purified by faith yea purified from dead workes whatsoeuer is mortall is taken from them for christ iesus of god is made vnto them wisdome righteousnesse sanctification and redemption

the law of life which is in iesus christ freeth them from sinne

and death so that

there is no condemnation vnto them which are so in christ and if there bee no condemnation then may they lift vp their heads with ioy when christ commeth

knowing that their redemption draweth neere if their conscience doe not accuse them they may haue boldnesse in the day of iudgement they shall stand before the sonne of man and his throne shall be vnto them a throne of grace

but more distinctly
the standing of the righteous is opposed to the flying from and sinking vnder iudgement if adam did flie only because hee was naked that which remedieth the nakednesse stayeth the flight now nakednesse stood in sinne and mortalitie both these are remedied in the resurrection of the iust
the sinne is all taken away by the imputation of christs righteousnesse and sanctification of his spirit
the mortalitie because as they are quickened by grace in their soules so their bodies of naturall become spirituall

and their corruptible puts on incorruption their mortall immortalitie so then there being no part of nakednesse left there can remayne no cause of flying

and if not of flying from then not of sinking vnder iudgement for that which is the cause of flying is the cause of sinking also but the state of their person doth deny al possibility of sinking the spiritin their soule is the pledge of their inheritance in heauen and their bodies which they shall then receiue are not only houses from heauen

but such as are fitted for heauen both carrie vpward and not downward

but marke more particularly

what the scripture saith of the resurrection of the iust
the dead in christ shall rise first yea they onely shall rise from death for the resurrection of the wicked is not from but vnto death from one death vnto another
and therefore in saint luke onely the righteous are called filij resurrectionis

because their resurrection is vnto life which is properly a standing the wicked doe but rise to take a greater fall they fall from a temporall to an eternall death

secondly as the righteous shall rife first so being raysed

rapientur in occursum they shall be taken vp into the ayre to meete christ and so shall euer be with him so that except he fall they shall neuer fall they shall be remoued from the earth which is the place of falling

thirdly they shall be placed at the right hand of christ to be taken vp vnto him is to be admitted to a beatificall vision

for what is our happinesse but to see him as he is for in his presence there is fulnesse of ioy and if we be placed at his right hand there is pleasure for euer more secure honour and endlesse life if that support vs no feare of falling we shall certainely stand

but to put it out of all doubt
when we come to the right hand

we shall be set vpon thrones and shall with christ iudge the twelue tribes of israel

yea the angels also so farre shall we be from being wofully passiue that wee shall bee gloriously actiue in that iudgement
how we shall iudge is a curious question will not now vndertake to resolue it it sufficeth to my purpose that howsoeuer we shall iudge as many as are honoured with that function may well be held standers they shall neither shrinke nor sinke

but we may not forget that the sinewes by which wee are supported in this standing are deriued from christ if out of him we looke vpon our selues

we may well say enter not into iudgement with thy seruants lord for in thy sight shall no flesh liuing be iustified or to keepe to the word of my text

if thou lord marke iniquities who shall be able for to stand wee cannot stand without corruption except his grace doe clense vs neither can we stand against condemnation except his merits doe secure vs

some here worke vpon the difference which they suppose to be betwixt vngodly and sinners vnderstanding by vngodly those wicked men who are open and professed enemies to god malefactors deprehensi in flagranti crimine taken in the manner of doing by sinners vnderstanding other wicked men which seeme to be in the church and are as it were but probabiliter suspecti challenged vpon suspition
and they tell vs the first sort of wicked men shall not stand in iudgement that is shall not be graced with any formall arraignment before their condemnation the second sort howsoeuer they may stand in iudgement so farre as to be legally tried yet they shall neuer come to stand in the congregation of the righteous

neuer partake with them in happinesse
princes saith gregorie deale otherwise with their subiects then they doe with their enemies in point of iudgement for if they take an enemie they vse martiall law and command execution without any iudiciall processe but if a subiect be called in question hee hath the benefit of the law he is suffered to plead for himselfe neither is hee doomed before hee is tried
the meaning is that of the wicked which shall bee arraigned at the day of iudgement such as are without the church shall without all plea as profest enemies of christ bee proceeded against for their infidelitie shall be vndeniable but those that are within the church god condescends farther vnto them they shall haue a trial they shall be heard what they can say though it will steed them little because it shal be shewed them how vaine it is and indeede such a forme of proceeding is exprest matth

and luke

where by the way it is good for vs to take notice that though it be a priuiledge to be of the church militant in this world yea and it giues vs also a priuiledge aboue infidels at the entrance into the world to come yet except we so shew our faith in our workes on earth that we may haue the benefit of it at the day of iudgement there is little comfort in such a priuiledge
for in regard of death a citizen is no freer then an enemie if both come to it though one come to it by martiall law the other by processe in a ciuill court so if both meete in hell it skils not whether one come as an infidell and the other as a wicked christian except haply the christians case be the worse because he neglected the good meanes which the infidell had not

haue shewed you wherein the vngodly and the righteous agree and differ at the entrance into the world to come we must now following the text see the very same points in the state of both which followeth vpon that entrance
and here first we doe find something common for

both are socteties or congregations
they haue beene so from the very beginning of the world there hath beene the serpent and his seede the woman and her seed the sonnes of god and the daughters of men michaell and his angels the dragon and his babel and hierusalem
saint austen in his learned bookes de ciuitate dei hath enlarged this point it is so cleere neede not dwell longer vpon it

but we must marke that these societies may bee distinguished onely habitu or also actu onely in qualitie or also in place in this world they are in place confounded though they are distinguished in qualitie the righteous though they are not of the world

yet they are in it and many false christians are in the church which are not of it the world is as gods feild wherein grow both wheate and tares in his earthly barne there is both graine and chaffe his house hath seruants thriftie and vnthriftie and in his flocke are as well goates as sheepe
but this confusion shall not hold on alwayes they that differ in qualitie shall also be sundred in place the goates from the sheepe the tares from the wheate the foolish virgines from the wise the vnthriftie seruant from the thriftie
this is the first point of difference

but it is not the onely point but as they are separated

so this separation shal continue for euer so doth abraham assure diues betweene you and vs there is a great gulfe no passage from one to the other
the same god that separated the egyptians from the israelites by the pillar of fire when they came out of egypt will neuer suffer them to come together will so part the saints of heauen from the feinds of hell that they shall neuer grow into one societie againe
not that absolutely it cannot be otherwise but god will haue it to be so

he will haue it cleerely to appeare that there is no communion betweene light and darknesse christ and belial the temple of god and the synagogue of satan

it is true that the godly shall goe out and see the wicked tormented

and diues in hell shall see abraham in heauen and lazarus in his bosome to the greater comfort of the one and terrour of the other
but they shall neuer come together neither shall they change their place or state

this latter difference is grounded vpon the former for they that differ at the entrance into the world to come must needes differ in the state thereof for iudgement is the gate that doth as it were lead vnto that state therefore if the vnchangeablenesse of the state doe moue vs wee must not bee carelesse of the iudgement
let this suffice touching the contents of these words a word of the inference and so an end

therefore the first word of this verse lookes backe vpon that which goeth before and out of that truth collects this
you haue heard that the vngodly shall not stand in iudgement wonder not at it
the vngodly are but winnowed chaffe and how should that stand that is so light as chaffe or rest which is so restlesse as chaffe which is winnowed the righteous shall stand and wonder not at it they are trees well planted trees trees laden with fruit with leaues trees well liked euery point addes weight vnto them maketh them firme and standing
if a man bee disenabled to stand it is because hee is chaffe and if hee bee

a tree hee shall bee well able to stand
you see what you should feare what you should desire feare to be like this winnowed chaffe desire to be like the happie tree that you may haue a blessed entrance into the world to come

neither a blessed entrance only but a blessed state also must you affect to haue therein and how shall you haue it learne of therefore
it looketh backe to the beginning of the psalme you see there the disposition of good men in this world they will haue nothing to doe with wickednesse they will not walke in the counsell of the vngodly nor stand in the way of sinners nor set in the seat of scorners they will haue no communion with wickednesse on earth and the wicked shall haue no communion with them in heauen
it is a poeticall fiction that what euery man affected here in earth with that hee shall bee solaced in the elysian fields
certaine it is that looke in what men delighted while they liued on earth with their companions in that shall they be ranged in the life to come they shall not there bee the seruants of god who here were the slaues of satan spirituall eunuches that bring forth no good workes bastards that are not the seed of god the incestuous brood of ammonites and moabites that are borne of worldly lust and concupiscence shall more certainly bee excluded the congregation of heauen then were the corporall from the congregation of israel on earth

seeing then

god is a god that hath no pleasure in wickednesse neither shall euill dwell with him the foolish shall not stand in his sight he hateth all workers of iniquitie

let vs prouide physicke before we are sicke and get righteousnesse before we come to iudgement so shall the tribunall of christ bee vnto vs as mount sion when to others it is mount sinai when they flie and fall we shall approach and stand vpright and if wee liue the life of christ tread the steps of the faith of our father abraham

haue our conuersation in heauen wee shall not only bee as angels but with angels wee shall bee refreshed in abrahams bosome wee shall sit downe with him with all the patriarches and prophets with all the saints and angels at christs table eternally blessed in the kingdom of heauen

god grant vs such grace in this life as may bring vs to such blisse in the life to come
amen

psal
vers
the lord knoweth the way of the righteous and the way of the wicked shall perish

vpon former words of this psalme haue obserued a double difference betweene the righteous and the vngodly a difference in this life and a difference in the life to come in this life the righteous are like vnto a blessed tree to which there is much good done and of which there commeth

much good but the wicked are like winnowed chaffe that hath small worth and takes as little rest in the life to come they differ also whether you looke on the entrance thereinto or the state therein at the entrance the wicked shall not endure the iudgement wherein the righteous shall stand vpright and the righteous shall be of a societie whereinto the wicked shall not come

haue opened both these differences so farre as was occasioned by words of this psalme it remaynes that now wee see the cause thereof which is the argument of this verse
it will teach vs that of so notable a difference there is some remarkable cause the cause then is gods iudiciall prouidence gods prouidence is very large but there is a speciall branch thereof that calls men to an account for their liues
in this branch which call iudiciall prouidence there are two things which wee must obserue sapientia and potentia it is a true discerner and a powerfull rewarder of all men bee they good or bad so much shall we find in these words the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked shall perish
for the words are synecdochicall there is more implyed then is exprest in them the word that notes sapientiam gods discerning of the wayes implies potentiam his answerable dealing with them and the word that notes potentiam his reuengfull hand on the wayes implyes sapientiam his discerning thereof also
and why this iudiciall prouidence is operosa cognitio therein the power of god attends his wisedome and his wisedome guides his power
this being obserued in generall vpon the words of my text we must more distinctly therein see first whereupon then how this iudiciall prouidence workes that whereon it workes hath something common and something proper that which is common is via bee men what they will bee they haue a course of life but all take not the same course there is something proper which stands in their seuerall courses therefore the text doth distinguish of wayes saying that there is via iustorum the iust mans way which is all one with a iust way and there is via peccatorum the wicked mans way which is all one with a wicked way this is that whereon gods iudiciall prouidence doth worke
now his work thereon hath also aliquid commune and aliquid proprium both the wayes are wrought vpon by gods wise power or powerfull wisdome for god is a discerner and rewarder of both as told you when opened the synecdochie of the verse
but there is something proper in either word the wisdome and power iudiciall workes one way vpon the way of the righteous and an other way vpon the way of the wicked nouit viam iustorum he takes a speciall notice of and bestowes a gracious reward vpon the way of the righteous but via peccatorum peribit the way of the wicked shall feele another kind of reward because it is excluded from this speciall kind of notice
and these bee the contents of this scripture which will now vnfold briefly and in their order

first then of that whereon the iudiciall prouidence worketh therein

as told you there is something common and that is a way
praesens vita saith saint basil nihil aliud est quàm perpetua via this our mortall life is nothing else but a passage and this world a through faire therefore the schooles distinguishing betweene those that are departed and those that liue call the liuing viatores way faring men and those that are dead comprehensores such as are at their iournies end the patriarches acknowledge as much when they call themselues pilgrimes strangers soiourners and their life a pilgrimage

and indeed

neither good nor bad haue here any abiding place they doe in purpose or in practice seeke one to come
it is true that worldly men thinke of no other world

but the
psalme confutes their folly so doth the gospell in the parable of the rich man and how should that be stable

that rests vpon a thing most vnstable praeterit figura huius secult the fashion of this world passeth away and all these things must be dissolued and how should the little world euer come to a stand when the great world makes away so that wee must prouide for another place

wee must nay euery man doth will he nill he he doth for his life is but a way he is euery day euery houre euery moment onward somewhat toward heauen or hell
but the way notes not only a course but a setled course
there are many startings aside both of good and bad the best many times slep aside into but that is not via eorum the iust mans way for he commeth to himselfe againe and with greater alacritie returnes to his religious course and the wicked out of fashion or fancie doe oftentimes trie the right way but that is not via eorum it is not the wicked mans way for he quickly distastes it and takes againe his former roade therefore the scripture doth not by the way vnderstand that which we doe by sits but that which wee doe constantly and wherein wee perseuere
so then it is common to all men to go a way and hold a setled course but yet the course which all take is not the same the text will tell you that though a way bee common yet not the same way
here are two mentioned the righteous mans way which told you is a righteous way and the way of the wicked which told you is a wicked way
the scripture doth mention a straight and a crooked a narrow and a broad way the way of the eagle and the way of the serpent a way vpward and a way downeward a way to life and a way to death the way of god and the way of the diuell the straight narrow eagles way the way vpward to life which is gods way that is the way of the righteous or the righteous way the crooked broad serpentine way the way downeward to death which is the way of the diuell that is the way of the wicked or the wicked way
neede say no more of these wayes that heretofore haue said so much of the difference betweene good and bad men it shal suffice to haue added thus much vpon occasion of this word way and the thereof specified in this verse

let vs come on then to the iudiciall prouidence that worketh vpon

these wayes
and here told you there is also some thing common and some thing proper both these wayes are wrought vpon by the prouident wisdome and power of god he discernes them hee rewards them both were there no other proofe the triuiall verse confirmes it

entèr praesentèr deus est vbi{que potentèr
his eyes behold all the wayes of men and his eye lids trie them all that which is applyed to baltazzar mene mene tekel vpharsin

concernes euery one more or lesse
dauid hath made the
psalme in describing this generall eye and hand of god and the sonne of syrach hath excellently exprest it
chap
and we shall really denie god and be plaine manichees if we did exempt any thing from him and not subiect all things to his iudiciall power
tis true that some things he permits vnto the creatures but it is neither an ignorant nor an negligent permission he knowes whereabout they goe and holds the bridle in his owne hand most maiestically doth god in esay let zenacharib vnderstand as much

in an answer that he giues vnto that insolent message
know thine abode and thy going out and thy comming in and thy rage against me because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come vp into mine eares therefore will put my hooke in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and turne thee backe the way by which thou camest

but need not enlarge this point of gods generall iudiciall prouidence for it will be farther confirmed by the particular branches thereof if these particulars be true the generall cannot bee denied because the generall is included in the particular
though then it bee common to both wayes that they come vnder gods iudiciall prouidence yet come they not vnder it both alike it workes vpon either after a speciall manner first vpon the way of the iust nouit deus the lord knoweth that way the knowledge of god here meant being not generall but speciall we must enquire what manner of knowledge this is
cannot better informe you then by paralleling gods speciall knowledge of man with mans speciall knowledge of god for hee which knowes god is also knowne of him
cor
et qui ignorat ignorabitur
cor
now the speciall knowledge that man must haue of god stands in two points in distinguendo colendo he must first learne to distinguish god from all others and that contra and and supra he must oppose him to all that seemes but is not god hee must not thinke him like vnto idols that haue eyes and see not eares and heare not hands and handle not
for hee must beleeue that god is priuie to the wayes of men and disposeth all things at his pleasure
as we must thus oppose god to those which seeme but are not gods so must we preferre him also before all to whom that name is communicable bee they angels or men for though there bee some thing like in both yet doth god infinitely exceed in that wherein he is like
this is the first branch of our knowledge which stands in deo distinguendo in distinguishing god from all others

the second branch stands in deo colendo in our carriage towards god and that also consists of two branches contemplation

and dilection our eye must euer bee on him our heart must euer be towards him

one thing haue desired of the lord saith king dauid and that will still require that may dwell in the house of the lord all the dayes of my life to behold the faire beautie of the lord and to visit his holy temple and how busie is the eye of the spouse in the canticles in viewing her beloued from top to toe

as the beautie of god drawes the eye of man continually to behold it so being beheld undefined span alphabet a man cannot behold it but he must fall in loue with it
it was wittily replyed by an ancient father saint basil as it is thought vnto iulian the apostata when hee wrote vpon an apologie of christian religion presented vnto him

undefined span alphabet
certainly it is impossible for him that knowes god as a christian ought not to thinke hee is bound to loue him in the highest degree with all his mind with all his soule with all his heart with all his strength as the law speakes

this being the speciall knowledge that we must haue of god we must obserue that gods speciall knowledge of vs is answerable hereunto
he knowes his first distinguendo as in the departure out of aegypt the bloud of the paschall lambe was sprinkled vpon the doore posts to direct the punishing angell not to mistake an israelite for an aegyptian and before the babilonian captiuitie god sent a man with a pen and inkehorne to marke in the forehead those that should escape the destruction wrought by the caldeans and in the reuelation the seale of god is set vpon his chosen that they be not wrapt in the generall desolation
so must we assure our selues

that god knowes all his by name and there is a booke of remembrance of them before him as malachie speaketh he will neuer misdeeme wheate for chaffe nor mistake a sheepe for a goate

but the scripture doth branch this distinction and god doth distinguish his contra and supra alios

contra hee doth oppose them vnto others
wee learne it of the apostle others are without god without christ without hope strangers from gods couenant aliens from his but they that are his haue god for their father christ for their sauiour the holy ghost for their comforter eternall life for their hope

they haue pretious promises made vnto them and they are of the houshold of god and fellow citizens with the saints

neither doth god only thus oppose them to others but preferre them before others
we learne this of moses exod
though all the world be his yet they are his peculiar his treasure elswhere they are called his inheritance his first borne his image kings priests all tearmes of preheminence and note their prerogatiue aboue all others
so doth god distinguish his

and as he doth distinguish them so doth he also regard them and that in two points contemplatione and dilectione
first contemplatione
his eye is vpon his canaan from the beginning of the yeare to the end thereof

the walls of ierusalem are euer in his sight his eyes are vpon the righteous his eares are open to their prayers they find grace in his eyes and his

delight is to be with them they are a seale vpon his right hand and a signet vpon his arme finally they are the very apple of his eye

if you reade the song of salomon you shall see this gracious contemplation of god set forth at large where the beloued doth confesse that he receiues a from this contemplation

and indeed the righteous lord loueth righteousnesse

as his eyes doe behold the thing that is right and god doth therefore take delight to behold his church that hee may vse that as a meanes for to draw from him the arguments of his loue loue being the end of his contemplation
king dauid doth excellently set this forth psal
where bringing in god testifying that he hath chosen sion for his resting place for euer and that there he delights to dwell he goes on reckoning vp the blessings that he will powre vpon the king and his subiects the priests and the people the poore and the rich and deut
where god professeth that his eye is alwayes vpon the land the end is expressed to giue them seasonable raine and make their land fruit full for his loue is beneuolentia non latens he delighteth in the prosperitie of his seruants
the very same is meant by those titles which god giues himselfe of father sauiour husband the fathers eye is vpon his child to prouide that is fit for it the husbands eye vpon his wife to communicate both his honour and his wealth vnto her the sauiour lookes vpon his charge that hee may looke to it and not suffer any thing to annoy it and that he may procure the welfare of it
this reall loue makes good that which before obserued that gods power concurres with his wisdome and this speciall knowledge is not speculatiue but practicke gods children feele most gracious effects thereof and neuer more liuely effects then at the day of iudgement whereof this text especially is meant

well then the wicked in this world haue no wisdome to discerne the godly at least their wayes though they obserue their persons and the power that they haue they bend against them in regard of their wayes you may see this excellently set forth in the booke of wisdome cap

but what need the righteous care they may say with the apostle that they are though vnknowne yet knowne they are knowne to god

and god power is their support and this makes a full amends for their worldly ignoblenesse that they are so heauenly noble and shall appeare such at the generall iudgement

and so haue opened the first speciall act of gods iudiciall prouidence which workes vpon the wayes of the godly
let vs now see the second how the same speciall prouidence workes vpon the wayes of the wicked the way of the wicked shall perish here you must supply the word lord for he is the person that doth destroy them
and marke what he doth destroy
not the person but the way
quàm clementer saith saint hierome he seemes to gather gods mercie out of it in that non perit impius sed impietas and indeed were it meant of this life it were a great mercy because that sinne is not abolisht here but grace succeeds and that is a blessed destruction

but the connexion of this verse to the former shewes that this is

meant of the life to come and then you shall find that the destruction is wofull and it stands in two points as their wayes doe import two things the act of sinne and the fruit of that act
the act of sinne shall cease wherein they take pleasure for in hell though there bee sinners yet is there no sinning the corruption remaynes in their persons the guilt in their consciences the one to make them fewell for the flames of hell that they may neuer goe out the other to feed the worme that shall neuer die but the terrour of the iudge shall bee so great whose hand they shall feele in the fire and the euidence of the euill of sinne shall be so apparent in the worme of their conscience that they shall not dare any more to fall to the act of sinne and so they shall be vtterly depriued of the pleasure they tooke therein that shall perish

a second thing that shall perish is the worldly fruit of their sinning which is honour wealth friends and such like
saint iames calls it undefined span alphabet

esay chap
speakes it plainly hell hath enlarged her selfe and opened her mouth without measure and their glorie and their multitude and their pompe and he that reioyceth shall descend into it that for which they take all their wicked paines and wherein they took their wicked delight that shall faile
faile totally and finally totally the glution shall not haue so much as a drop of water left to comfort him
in this life there is a kind of mixture in the heauiest iudgement of god and some thing left to mitigate the extremitie of their paine not so in the life to come of that time we may vse those words of the
psalme
let god arise and his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flie before him like as smoke vanisheth so shall he driue them away as waxe melteth before the fire so shall the wicked perish at the presence of god
in the booke of wisdome chap
this is amplified what hath pride profited vs what good hath riches with our vaunting brought vs all these things are passed away like a shaddow and as a post that hasteth by he goes on resembling it to the way of a ship of a bird of an arrow and concludes the hope of the vngodly is like dust that is blowne away with the wind like a thinne froth that is driuen away with the storme like smoake that is disperst with a tempest the same we may reade iob

as these wicked wayes perish totally so doe they finally also for destruction

as nahum speaketh shall not arise the second time their perishing is eternall like that of the deuill and his angels who go into euer lasting fire
and indeed these wayes are in this point opposed vnto the righteous wayes

for righteousnesse as the wiseman speaketh is full of immortalitie and the psalmist calls it a way euerlasting each bodie shall continue his state answerable to his head as christ so christians as the deuill so the wicked both shall bee lasting the one in blisse the other in paine

but the word here vsed shall perish is worth the noting for abad signifies perdere and perire and what is fitter for a destroying way then to be a way that shall be destroyed during this life the wayes of the wicked are viae perdentes for they doe nothing but destroy either gods good creatures as the epicure and voluptuous or other men as the couetous

and the oppressors yea their owne selues for they waste gods image in them and fight with their lusts against their owne soule they shew themselues to be the children of their father which in the reuelation is called abaddon or undefined span alphabet

and what is fitter for him that is a destroyer then to bee destroyed and so to bee destroyed as they doe destroy not quoad esse but quoad bene esse their persons still continuing all their comforts faile as they endeauoured to make all good persons and things to be vncomfortable

but as this destruction is opus potentiae proceeds immediatly from gods power so is it guided per sapientiam his wisdome hath a hand in it for as he doth blesse those whom he doth specially know so if hee destroy any it is because they are not within the compasse of his speciall knowledge
and indeed so shall christ say at the last day

depart from me yee workers of iniquitie know you not how can god bee ignorant and yet iudge it is not meant simply of knowledge but of that speciall knowledge whereof you heard before and if you will haue it more plainly conceiue it in these foure degrees

first god knowes not the wayes of the wicked in se he finds no such thing in himselfe and yet is his nature the exemplar of all good things
secondly he knowes them not no such effects euer proceeded from his spirit and yet euery good and perfect gift commeth from aboue

from the father of lights
thirdly he doth not know them secundum se as an image of himselfe as all his creatures are not only the little world was made after his image

but also the heauens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handy worke and the visible creatures make knowne the inuisible creator
rom
and lastly hee doth not know them secum hee hath no such in his retinue

holinesse beseemes his house for euer and they must bee sanctified that come neere him and be holy as he is holy and the wicked shall not stand in his sight

well then when we behold the wicked on earth prospering in their wicked wayes we see that euery one takes notice of them and euery bodie is readie to doe seruice to them and haply this may bleere our eyes and we may thinke better of their state then it deserues
but as christ when his disciples shewed him the goodly fabricke of the temple said vnto them are these the things that you wonder at tell you

not a stone of these shall be left vpon a stone which shall not be destroyed so tell you gaze not vpon such wayes dote not vpon them for god knoweth them but afarre off psal
they are strangers vnto him and therefore tollentur impij ne videant gloriam dei they shall haue as little part in gods blessing as they haue in his speciall knowledge

lay both these works of prouidence together and then see the truth of in saint paul the lord commeth

as saint iude translates it yea and christ himselfe in saint iohn reuel

behold come quickly and my reward is with me to giue to euery man according to his workes

what shall then say to you but euen remember you of those words in the prophet ieremie chap
stand yee in the wayes and see and aske pages missing

an exposition of the one and fiftieth psalme
epigraph

the title
to the chiefe musician
a psalme of david when nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone in to bathsheba

haue ended the first psalme wherein opened vnto you the couenant of god the parts of it the parties to it the parts are a vow and a reward the parties god and man man voweth his seruice god promiseth a reward an euerlasting reward for a momentainie seruice
behold a gracious an vndoubted truth and yet doth it prognosticate little good to vs neither may we presume of any interest therein if wee trie our case by our liues
for who is there amongst vs that tollerably performes his vow and therefore which of vs can hopefully expect the reward surely all assurednesse of the latter is cleane taken away except we bee prouided of some remedie for our failing in the former

now god bee thanked there is one and you shall find it in this psalme
the remedie is repentance and this is undefined span alphabet so saint irenie calleth it a penitentiall psalme

there are seuen which we vulgarly call deadly sins we may call them also if not more fitly yet as truely cardinall or mother sinnes for they are the nurseries of others
for the recouerie out of these sinnes

the old liturgies haue prescribed the vse of seuen speciall psalmes they call them penitentials amongst them this is the chiefest and to be vsed contra luxuriam which is not the least of those seuen deaths heads

when we looke vpon the deluge of sinne wee find that all the fountaines

of the deepe the bottomlesse pit are broken open and the streames thereof drowne many soules in perdition yet amongst them there is none more vniuersall none more preualent then is this sinne of luxurie
desire you a proofe you shall haue a short but yet a pregnant one men are turned into women and women into men
anatomize that carrion well may you find more certainely you can find nothing worse therein
there is nothing worse then this preposterous vnreasonablenesse and vnreasonable preposterousnesse

well what then is the remedie surely know none better then that old one practised by the church and therefore haue chosen to recommend vnto the world this penitentiall and shall be glad if any that is bewitch with that pleasing poyson may bee cured hereby
this psalme was occasioned by a wanton man and woman and therefore the better fitting to our wantons of both sexes and doubt not but the most monstrous changeling if hee meditate sadly hereon may bee brought to change againe but for and to the better meane hee may resolue to turne from his sinne and turne vnto god to worke this shal be my endeauour and to this end will bend the exposition of this psalme
let vs come then to it
there are two meanes of instruction rules and examples a rule is more apt to make a man wise but to make a man good there is much more power in an example an example is not onely a quicker but also a more quickning course
of examples some are onely reported some are represented also the force of a report is very great yet comes it far short of that which proceedes from a representation for wee are much more affected with that which wee see then that which we heare this was the ground of instituting tragedies and commedies or to speake more to our purpose of those seuere penitentiall formes practised in the primitiue church

now the doctrine of repentance is in this penitentiall deliuered not in a rule but in an example in an example not reported but represented

therefore a latine father cals it monumentum a liuing portraiture of a penitent

a greeke father cals it undefined span alphabet a speaking image it doth so eye vs that it cannot but affect vs affect vs not sensually as dead pictures doe but morally as a reflecting example that transformes into it selfe all those that doe discreetly behold it
certainly if any this kind of instruction will worke vs and worke repentance into vs touching then this vertue of repentance wee may learne heare whence it springs and what it is the fountaine of it is opened in the title but the nature of it is vnfolded in the whole body of the psalme

the title doth set before vs a person and his state the person is dauid for this is a psalme of dauid
but the words must bee resolued into more then appeare for dauidis is as much as a dauide and de dauide dauid was the author and dauid is the argument of it with his owne pensil doth he draw this picture of himselfe
he represents himselfe two wayes cadentem resurgentem in the state of a sinner and the state of a penitent in the state of a sinner he confesseth that he went went into

bath sheba in the state of a penitent in the other words
where you haue the meanes by which he was brought to repentance and the successe of those meanes

the meanes are nathan the prophet nathan king dauids subiect but as a prophet he was the embassador of god the king of heauen had his leidger with that king on earth
neither doth the holy ghost only mention the meanes but giues vs also to vnderstand the needefulnesse and the powerfulnesse thereof the needefulnesse in the word venit nathan came to dauid dauid neuer sought to nathan we are as carelesse to returne as wee are gracelesse to goe from god it is needefull therefore that god seeke vs that wee may seeke to him otherwise we will not nay we cannot
the meanes is no lesse powerfull then needfull that is intimated by after that that is after he had committed his sinne
sinne doth not only wound to death but disenable also to rise there from for the holy spirit of discipline will flie deceipt

will not abide when vnrighteousnesse commeth
that which we cannot doe lying in the dregs of sinne god doth supplie by the ministrie of his word the ministerie of his word is the meanes to worke repentance reade this truth in the successe of those meanes

the successe was king dauids speedie and sollemne conuersion speedie no sooner did nathan reproue him but he gaue glorie vnto god he acknowledged his sinne and penned this psalme
neither was his conuersion only speedie but solemne also hee deliuered this psalme to the chiefe musician he would haue it published in the church the church to be a witnesse vnto his conuersion
haue broken vp the title and poynted out the particulars to the fuller vnfolding whereof let vs now so listen that we may by gods grace be led onward some steps in our owne repentance
the first thing that offers it selfe is the person
one person is both authour and argument of this psalme and when we consider the argument we may wounder at the author wounder that there should bee found a man so humble as to record his owne so notable defects
but yet such ingenuitie though neuer so distastfull to flesh and blood hath beene found in manie worthie children of god especially in those that haue beene chosen to be penmen of the scripture they report as sincerely their owne faults as their vertues no lesse gods reproofe of them then his fauours towards them such ingenuity wee finde here in king dauid but it was not only in king dauid moses went herein before him so did samuel also saint mathew followeth them so did saint paule none of these spared themselues neither were they ashamed to record the errors of their life to record them say which is much more then only to acknowledge them though the acknowledgement be publike

they obserue not amisse who herehence gather that the scriptures are diuine because the penmen thereof are so vnpartiall such dealing is vnlikelie to come from flesh and blood whereupon it followeth well that they wrote as they were moued by the holy ghost

our lesson is the humilitie of a publican sauoureth much more of

gods spirit then the pride of a pharisee and if wee desire either to resemble these worthies in our persons or that our words should bee conformable to the holy canon wee must indite no lesse penetentials then panegyricks and make remembrances of our sinnes aswell as of our vertues
certainelie king dauid did so witnesse this title wherein he sets forth himselfe cadentem resurgentem first taking a grieuous fall and then recouering himselfe by grace

first let vs see his fall that is noted in these words hee went in to bathsheba
few words but they summe vp a large storie you may reade it
sam

that chapter is a full commentarie vpon this short text and if we scanne it we shall finde that king dauids fall was complicatissimum peccatum a sinne of many roots

there are three heads wherunto all sinne is reduced

impuritie

iniquitie
impietie and they met all in this fall of dauid first impuritie for the first degree of his sinne was incontinencie hee defiled his soule with vnchast lust and his body with an vnlawfull copulation a foule sinne so to abuse a member of christ

and to polute a temple of the holy ghost

to couer this sinne hee fell into another he fell into iniquitie
it is iniquitie for a man to take his neighbours wife but for a man that hath many to take his neighbours wife that is contented with one for a king to take his subiects wife a master the wife of his seruant a master and a king liuing at home lying at case to take a wife of that subiect and seruant who is aduenturing his life spending his bloud in the defence and for the honour of his maister and soueraigne certainely this is haynous iniquitie
but what an accession is there made vnto it if it bee couered with a treacherous murder of that person to whom such wrong is done and dauid so couered his iniquitie first he assayed the murder of vriahs soule by making him drunke when that would not doe what he intended then doth he plot the murder of his bodie he maketh him carrie belerophons letters treacheorous letters against his owne life yea letters that added treason vpon treason for they made ioab the generall to betray the life of vriah his resolute souldier and for his sake the liues of many others fearefull iniquitie

but we haue not yet sounded the bottome of this fall these two roots of bitternesse haue a third wrapt about them
impuritie and iniquitie are accompanied with impietie so we learne from the mouth of the prophet god was despised in his commandement and the enemies of god were occasioned thereby to blaspheme for the reproach of an ill life redounds vpon the god whom we serue who is by infidels supposed to be an abetter of such courses

but there is a speciall reason of impietie in this fall
you must obserue that the arke of the lord was often carried forth in the warres of israel and god so present as he was now gaue them victorie in battell if the israelite was foyled the enemies grew insolent not onely against those whom they foyled but also against the lord whom they thought to bee foyled by their gods in them thereupon they did magnifie their idols and villisie the lord of

hosts
this may you obserue in the philistines
sam

and in the storie of balthasar dan

so that the treacherous aduantage that was giuen to the enemie must needs open their mouthes to blasphemie and so make king dauid guiltie of impietie impietie against god that so often so many waies had deserued better of king dauid

put all these together and you will confesse that saint chrysostome sayth truly that this was flendum naufragium a woefull wracke of so goodly a vessell
the more shamefull are the talmudists that would free the king in this fact from sin flatly against king dauids owne confession and the prophet nathans challenge yea so farre was this from being no sinne that all his other sinnes are as none in comparison of this you may gather it from the testimonie of the holy ghost

dauid turned not aside from any thing that god commanded him all the dayes of his life sauing onely in the matter of vriah the hittite

you haue heard of a foule fall wherein many enormous sinnes goe chained together there is one thing more in the storie which may not omit and that is how dauid fell into this sinne
surely by ease and prosperitie whi he was persecuted by saul while he fought the battells of the lord hee walked vprightly towards god and men no sooner had god giuen him rest but you see what comes of it
the naturalists obserue well that the northwind is more healthfull though the south bee more pleasant the south with his warmth raiseth vapors which breed putrefaction and cause diseases the north with his cold drieth those vapours vp purging the bloud and quickning the spirits aduersitie is vnpleasant but it keepeth vs watchfull against sinne and carefull to doe our duties whereas prosperitie doth flatteringly lull vs a sleepe that the enuious man may haue opportunitie to sow tares and choake the good seede of gods grace in pace amaritudo amarissima

it neuer goeth worse with men spiritually then when they finde themselues corporally best at ease iesurun waxed fat and kicked

he for sooke god which made him and light lie esteemed the rocke of his saluation
how wicked the sodomites were we reade gen
but eze chap
tells vs the cause therof was fulnesse of bread and idlenesse
tunc cum maesta fuit defensa est ilion armis militibus grauidum laeta recepit equum
most surprizes of citties haue fallen out vpon the secure riot of the beseiged our soules are neuer freed from the seige of the compassing lyon but he neuer gets so great an aduantage against vs as when hee maketh the least shew of an assault solomon in greatest glory was in his greatest danger the woefull euent proued it too true
it was a wise pollicie of epaminondas then to bee sentinel when the cittizens were at their bacchanalls and when wee haue the world at will it is good prouidence then to looke most to our waies

and why king dauids fall is a good reason it may seeme strange that a man such as dauid was so indowed so blessed that he was a man after gods owne heart and the penman of the holy ghost that such a man so good a man should take so great so dangerous a fall
but the best men are men and their falls doe testifie of what tree they are branches

by nature they spring from old adam he is their roote all though by grace they are grafted into christ yet during this life all the sowre iuice deriued from the former stocke is not cleane dried vp in them it yeilds forth many shootes those loaden with many clusters of bitter fruite
and what doth this preach vnto vs but that admonition of saint paule let him that stands take heede least he fall

for if the greatest worthies haue beene spectacles of humaine frailtie who may presume of his owne strength happy shall we be if other mens harmes make vs beware

and indeed to beware is the true vse that wee must make of their harmes they grossly abuse such histories which by them countenance and excuse their sinne dauid fecit cur non ego the drunkard the adulterer the murtherer atheistically pretendes though he hath not a good rule yet he hath a good example for his doing some patriarch did that which he doth non est hoc tollere sed geminare peccatum this doth not mend but marre the matter such apologies are worse then the sinne
saint austin and others haue at large replyed vnto them will onely giue two animaduersions and so dismisse them
the first is as in good deedes he that followeth another deserues lesse prayse because he doth but exemplifie an other mans fact so of ill doers the latter deserues more blame then the former because hee is so desperate as to venture where he seeth a likelier man then himselfe hath taken a fall
this first animaduersion we learne from reason
and from religion wee must learne a second animaduersion it is grosse blasphemie so to peruert the meaning of the scripture and make the holy ghost an aduocate for sinne what neede such fuell for lust which hath the whole world continually to feede it and will not want an apologie though the holy ghost doe not penne one certainely this fall was neuer penned for so wicked a purpose that will appeare in the next branch of the text or in the second state wherein king dauid doth set forth himselfe
there you shall finde that the former state was not set forth propter se but propter aliud he tooke no pleasure to blaze his state as a sinner but that we may thereby perceiue his other state as he was a penitent
let vs looke now into that and we shall finde that these few words doe summe vp a good part of a whole chapter the
of the
of sam wherin we are to obserue the meanes that brought him to repentance and the successe of those meanes
the meanes are nathan the prophet one man but sustayning two persons the person of a subiect vnto king dauid as hee was nathan the person of an embassador from god as he was a prophet
and indeed though a soueraigne haue a command ouer all his subiects yet is hee himselfe a subiect vnto god and therefore hath god his lidgers resident about him to let him from time to time know his sacred pleasure whose office it is to hold their master in or call him backe when he forgets or neglects the king of kinges that is in heauen

but this present

occasion calls vpon me to enlarge this poynt and

may doe it fitly to the occasion and not stray a whit from my text not from the storie of nathan the prophet intimated in this place

you then that are to take sacred orders must obserue that in the function of a prophet there was some thing common and something proper it was proper to them to foretell things to come the diuine determination of euents which in humane iudgement were contingent
but morrall instructions and corrections were common to them with the preists and indeede god did but supply the negligence of the preist by this ministrie of the prophets
the ministrie of nathan here touched though it hath something of that which is proper vnto a prophet yet the most part of it is common and so concernes you
you then must learne of the prophet nathan what furniture a minister must haue and how he must vse his furniture
his furniture must be lex et euangelium both these appeare in nathans message the law by that hee layd open king dauids sinne the gospell by that hee absolued him from the guilt thereof there is no censure of sinne but from the law and onely from the gospell is the propitiation thereof therefore must you be well studied in both of them and hold your selues to be but imperfect ministers if you be ignorant of either
as you must learne of nathan the prophet to haue this furniture so from him also must you learne how to vse it as you haue a tallent so must you employ it the steward of the lord must bring forth to his familie things both old and new we are called builders and the scripture is called a canon or a rule all the spirituall stones which bee laid in the temple of god must be squared by this spirituall rule neither without this rule must we worke any
neither is it enough to know that wee must vse our furniture wee must know also when it must bee vsed and how and you shall learne both of the prophet nathan
when praeuenienter and subuenienter if we can we must preuent the sinnes of our flocke
magister historiae ecclesiasticae obserues out of epiphanius that nathan would so haue preuented dauids fall for hearing that the kings affection was bending towards bathsheba he made hast towards him but was hindred by belial
whatsoeuer is to be thought of that narration of this we may bee sure that the prophet would not haue been wanting to the king with a ghostly preseruatiue if he had seene his pronenes to that fall and a minister if he see the signes of an imminent spirituall danger must arme his people against temptation and asmuch as in him lieth preuent their falls
but if he cannot be so timely he must not leaue them when they are downe qui non potuit praeuenire debet subuenire wee must lend him a hand to rise whom we could not keepe from falling so did nathan the prophet raise king dauid

but as you must learne of him when so must you also learne of him how he did it undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet vnpartially but discreetly
vnpartially he was the embassadour of god and therefore hee spake with the libertie of an embassadour and we must not derogate fro the authoritie of our master to whose tribunall all persons are subiect euen

the greatest monarches of the world as a great monarch nebuchadnezzar confest in a proclamation registred dan


but there is an vnpartialnesse diuine which is enioyned of god and there is an humane one which is but a fiction of mans braine
the humane dreames of faults which are not and taketh vp rumors vpon trust and rashly vents them to the disgrace of the innocent headie and fierie spirits offend too often this way and in stead of preachers turne libellers vnder pretence of freedome of spirit and vnpartiall reprehension
but we must not reproue that which is not a fault nor those which are not faultie

secondly humane vnpartialnesse doth season reproofe with vnmannerly language whereas saint paul hath taught ministers in reprouing to giue euery man his due respect rebuke the elder men as fathers the younger as brethren

the elder woemen as mothers the younger as sisters the higher persons are in degree with the more respect must wee temper our reproofe
this is the generall rule that we must follow particular instances of some prophets who brought speciall messages from god must not be drawne by vs into example god will not haue theologie to confound policie

add hereunto that nathan told his message to dauid in priuate because dauid committed the sinne priuately personall and priuate sinnes must not haue a publike reproofe except they haue vndergone first a iudiciall censure where publike authoritie hath not gone before the reproofe of personall faults must be priuate

these rockes being heeded our vnpartialnes will be diuine we may freely deliuer what difference there is betweene mens liues and gods lawes and set the peoples danger before their eies yea touching sin we may tell them that omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se crimen habet quanto maior qui peccat habetur answerable to the dignitie which god vouchsafeth vs are the sinnes improued by which we offend him
secondly

touching danger wee may let them know that potentes potenter punientur mercie will soone pardon the meanest but mighty men shall be mightily tormented
this wee may tell them and tell them that they must expect this from god
from god say and not from vs for we haue only undefined span alphabet we are only referendaries of gods will wee acknowledge undefined span alphabet to be the peculiar of god if any corporall chastisement bee to bee laid vpon a soueraigne a subiect must not draw the sword god onely hath power to vse it and they into whose hands he is pleased to put it which certainely is not the pope nor his assigne whether hee claime it directly or indirectly hee doth it contra ius sine exemplo he hath no good either rule or example for it either in gods word or in the writings of the primitiue church neither is it the people who must take law from not giue law to their soueraigne both in precept and in sanction

as nathan did vse his ministrie vnpartially so did hee vse it discreetly also

undefined span alphabet hee handled the king so artificially that he made him giue sentence against himselfe before he

was aware
that seemes a beame in our brothers eye

which in our owne seemes scarse a moate as christ teacheth in the gospell therefore our iudgement is best tried in another mans case for therein wee will see with the most if it be a fault and if it be a good deede we will see with the least therefore hee that will handle a mans conscience with spirituall wisedome must first worke vpon undefined span alphabet see what good rules he hath to guide conscience withall and exercise them with some abstracted case and if he find that it passeth an vpright iudgement then come on to undefined span alphabet his conscience and if euer you shall then make him sensible of his owne case certainely he must either condemne himselfe which is a signe of grace or else contradict himselfe which will argue him to be voide of reason

neither is this the onely poynt of spirituall wisedome which a pastour must haue he must also vse a good method in dispensing the parts of his ministrie nathan will teach him asmuch who comming to dauid furnished with the law and the gospell first humbled him with the law then raised him with the gospell first told him thou art the man and then when dauid acknowledged it nathan added the lord hath remoued thy sinne thou shalt not die
and you may not peruert this order you may not applie a salue before you haue vented the corruption of a wound you may not power oyle into it before you haue scoured it with wine finally you may not absolue a sinner before you haue made him penitent

hauing sufficiently vnfolded the meanes must now let you see that these meanes are needfull and powerfull needfull that is intimated in this word venit nathan came to dauid of himselfe dauid sinned but when hee was left vnto himselfe there appeared in him no disposition to repent to manifest this god did let him alone by the space of a whole yeare and during that time hee seemeth to haue beene senselesse of his state mortifera securitas

he seemed to bee as it were dead in that sinne it was a strange thing that such a man should take such a fall but more stange that in so many moneths hee should not recouer out of it
what was the cause was it because hee did not know the difference betweene good and euill it were absurd so to thinke but it was because hee did not make vse of his knowledge in weighing his owne actions whether they were good or euill wherefore had not nathan come to dauid it is to be doubted dauid would neuer haue returned vnto god
it is to be doubted the rather because if you looke to the first sinne of man you shall finde that after he had eaten of the forbidden fruit he hid himselfe from god no mention of his returne vntill god sought and found him out
and who may hope to bee better then our father adam surely the continuall storie of the church shewes that we are herein all too like vnto him looke vpon all the restitutions that are recorded and you shall finde in them all the preuenting grace of god and that saying of god is of a perpetuall truth am found of them that sought me not and made manifest to them that inquired not after me

but what shall neede examples of that truth which euery man that hath grace may reade in himselfe the conclusion is repentance springs not naturally from vs it is an effect of gods word reclayming vs of our selues we are as vnapt to rise as we are apt to fall
wherefore we cannot too much magnifie the goodnesse of god that vouchsafeth vnto vs the ministrie of his word it is a great grace that god is not wanting vnto vs when we are wanting vnto our selues wanting not only to instruct our selues but also to make vse of our knowledge for the scripture is vsefull not only to informe but also to remember vs

needfull then the ministrie is it is not onely so but powerfull also the word of god is sharper then any sword

it is liuely it is mighty in operation it enters through euen to the diuiding asunder of the soule spirit ioynts and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the weapons of the ministers warfare are mighty through god to cast downe holds

to cast downe imaginations and euery high thing which is exalted against the knowledge of god and to bring into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of christ
and it had neede be so it hath to doe with so senselesse a subiect

gregorie the great parallels dauid in his sinne with lazarus in his graue christ cried with a loude voyce lazarus come forth and it was not a weake voyce that could rouse dauid out of his so dead a sleepe and it is the common disease of all sinners nothing lesse then gods spirit can worke a spirituall remorse in them but the power of the ministrie will appeare better in the successe wherefore come vnto that

the successe was a speedie and a sollemne conuersion a speedie he did not outface the prophet he did neither denie nor extenuate his fault but presently acknowledged it and desired to bee vnburdened of it

gustauit tantùm peccatum saith saint ambrose vt ostenderet quomodo posset aboleri he tasted of the poyson but did not digest it he did not so take in sinne

but he could vomit it vp againe
saint austin wittily obserues the word hospes in nathans parable and shewes that sinne in the children of god is but a stranger well may it be entertayned it cannot haue in them any perpetuall abode because it is not of the houshould yea seeing they accompt this stranger to be an enemie they make hast to be rid of him we see this in dauid and we must learne by him when we are roused to see that we are out of the way to make hast and not deferre the time to turne our feete into the way of gods commandements

as dauids conuersion is speedie so it is solemne it appeares in two points in that hee penned this psalme and that hee committed it vnto the chiefe musician

first he penned the psalme
saint iames his rule if any man bee merry let him sing holds not backward therefore euery man that singes is merrie there are mournefull aswell as there are ioyfull songs
gracelesse persons when they haue sinned are so shamelesse as to make ioyfull songes thereof witnes the impure sonets whereof euery age hath vented some none more then this our sinfull age and they are accompted the fittest musicke for their most riotous feasts

but dauids song made of his sinne is undefined span alphabet adolefull elegie a verie lamentation

but what needed this after nathan had absolued him yes there was great neede of it first his confession to nathan was very succinct and though praematura venia arguebat profundam poenitentiam god knew he repented heartily whom hee forgaue so speeedily yet so short a text needed a larger commentarie least men should conceaue too shallowly of repentance and performe it perfunctorily
secondly the conscience is not so soone quieted as it is pardoned though our faith doe rest vpon gods truth yet desire we to haue it confirmed by a liuely sense therefore a godly man newly recouered though he be safe is not secure which maketh him plie god with his prayers vntill he haue recouered againe his former peace
finally god released all the punishment of sinne vnto dauid but not all the chastisement as it appeares by nathans absolution dauid might desire to bee eased of that also and to that end hee might importune god with his passionate prayer and it beseemes vs well when wee are free from the flames of hell to deprecate the calamities wherewith god may iustly visit vs in this life
come to the last note
this psalme when dauid had penned it was deliuered to the chiefe musician or master of the quire not onely to bee kept but also to be sung hee would haue the church to witnesse to his conuersion and take a good patterne from him yea so it was made a part of the cation and is to goe for a rule amongst vs the septuagint intimate as much when they translate undefined span alphabet they intimate thereby that not onely dauids case must bee remembred therein but others also must be conformed thereto

but must end

as nathan was sent to dauid saith saint austin so is dauid sent vnto vs we may nay we doe goe in to our commit spirituall corporall fornication and god knowes we haue litle sense of our sinne
as we tread dauids steps in sinninge so in dauids senselesnes let vs reade our owne
god doth not forsake vs when wee will not we cannot helpe our selues we haue many nathans that are neither vnlearned nor idle they deale as discreetly as vnpartially it were to bee wished that as they are needefull and powerfull so they might speede with vs as nathan did with dauid and worke in vs a speedie and a solemne repentance

if king dauid were not ashamed so to humble so to afflict his soule which of vs should be ashamed wee should not but as saint ambrose in his dayes

wee so may wee complaine in ours there are fewe men bee they but of meane substance that doe not thinke themselues too good to be so abased yet he that will not submit himselfe to this painfull impression of the law shall neuer feele that more comfortable that springs from the gospell

god grant that seeing the best of vs shall euer carrie about vs a bodie of sinne we may neuer want nathans if it may be to prevent at least to make vs see our slips and that wee may bee as tractable as king dauid submitting our selues to the voyce of the law

that wee may haue the benefite of the gospell so may pastors and people haue mutuall comfort in the church militant and in the triumphant be ioyntly blest for euermore
amen

epigraph

psal
vers

haue mercy vpon me god according to thy louing kindnesse according vnto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions

wash mee thoroughly from mine iniquitie and cleanse mee from my sinne

this penetentiall doth teach vs touching repentance whence it springs and what it is whence in the title and what in the psalme
of the title haue alreadie spoken it followeth that now come on to the psalme which when haue ript vp and laid open before you you will haue iust cause to say that it is the goodliest picture of true repentance that euer was drawne by the pen of the holy ghost
the whole is a prayer but of that kind which we call a vow and as king dauid did sustayne a double person so is his vow double hee was a child of god a deare one hee was a member of the kingdome the cheifest one he was a man after gods owne heart and hee was the king of israel therefore he vowes not onely for himselfe but his kingdome also
but in setting downe his vowes he obserues a good order the first is for himselfe the second for the kingdome
and why the kingdome was wounded by his fall and the cure thereof depended vpon his recouerie therefore doth he first take care of the head from whom the same health was to streame afterwards into all the body
for though the vowes be two yet are they both resolued into the same parts there are in effect the same contents in either votiue prayer
let vs take them asunder and see it
in that either is a vow you must find in either the parts of a vow they are a desire and a promise you may see them euidently in either vow
first in the vow that king dauid maketh for himselfe hee doth expresse a desire to be restored vnto and preserued in the state of grace and if he speede hee doth promise a religious seruice vnto god
these two poynts are enlarged in the seauenteene first verses in the personall case of king dauid and being contracted are repeated againe with a speciall application to his kingdome in the two last
you see the breife of the whole psalme but it is too scant it will not yeeld you a full view let vs then goe backe againe and vnwrap these particulars that we may take more feeling notice of the spirituall riches that are contayned therein

the first vow is made for king dauid the first branch of that vow is his desire and the first petition in that desire is that he may be restored vnto grace
in this petition there are two remarkable things the matter which hee presents vnto god and the manner wherewith hee doth ingeminate the same matter and presse god with it
the matter is contained in these two first verses which in effect sound onely this miserable king dauid desires reliefe from the effectuall mercie of god in iesus christ

where there is sinne there is miserie behold here varietie of sinne transgressions iniquities distortions all cleauing to dauid for mee and mine confirme asmuch and make him a wretch though hee were a king
now what is the remedie of such miserie but effectuall mercie and this we finde here mercy by name in the entrance of the prayer haue mercie
but whereas there is mercy in affectu or in effectu mercy in god or mercy from god king dauid doth desire not onely that god would bee gratiously affected towards him but also that hee would worke powerfully vpon him
vpon the guilt of his sinne dele quit me thereof

vpon the corruption of his sinne laua wash me therefrom
yea because guilt is sooner remoued then corruption clensed keeping correspondencie with gods course in working therein he adds multùm laua munda neuer giue ouer washing vntill thou hast made mee throughly cleane thus doth miserie seeke vnto mercy
but where is mercy to be found surely in god to him he directs his prayer haue mercy vpon me god
there is no remedie for a sinfull man but in god whom he hath offended with his sinne and therefore hee saith secundum tuam misericordiam according to thy mercy it is gods propertie to haue mercy but it is gods in christ so much is meant by the next words according to thy louing kindnesse according to thy tender mercies god shines graciously to none but in the face of iesus christ and in him is god become a tender harted father to all penitent sinners

to all say for hee hath not onely tender mercies but there is also in them to bee considered the measure
rob is the hebrew word

wee translate it multitude but it signifies also magnitude and giueth vs to vnderstand that bee our sinfull miserie neuer so great neuer so diuerse wee shall not want releife in mercy which is more great and manifold

finally the text doth tell vs that as our miserie must seeke for mercie in god onely in whom it may be found so we must not dreame that any thing without god can obtaine this at gods hands therefore wee must pray secundum according to thy louing kindnesse lord let that be not onely the measure of the mercy which seeke but the inducement thereto also
and so haue you the contents of that portion of king dauids desire which haue read vnto you will now resume them and to your and my farther edification enlarge the exposition of them

first then though mercy stand formost in the text yet will begin with the miserie for miserie is first in nature and were it not for that

there were no neede of mercie add hereunto that the sense of miserie sets the best edge vpon the desire of mercie and he wil more eagerly long after it that perceiueth throughly in what need hee stands of it
told you that dauid was miserable though he were a king were there no other proofe there is enough implyed in the first word hee that cryeth miserere haue mercy doth plainly confesse that he is in miserie for one correlatiue ca~not subsist without the other
but to put it out of al doubt here is enough exprest to proue him a wretch

peccatum facit populos miseros wheresoeuer there is sinne there is miserie yea and there only for sinne only is simply euill malum paenae calamitie and woe though we call them euills yet indeed they are not so simply but onely undefined span alphabet as the person is and as god intends for that otherwise they are good it is plaine by two vndoubted grounds the efficient and the finall cause
that which is properly euill hath onely causam deficientem it springs from the fayling of a reasonable creature but woe hath causam efficientem it springs from the almighty hand of god hee is the creator of this darkenesse aswell as the opposite light
as it hath an efficient
so hath it a final cause that is the recouerie of a sinner god iudgeth vs temporally that he may not iudge vs eternally therfore dauid saith

bonum est domine quod humiliasti me it is good for me lord that haue bin in trouble but that which is truly euill is destitute of a finall cause aswel as it was of an efficient as it comes from weak enes so it ends in vanitie
it is true that god doth often times draw light out of darkenesse good out of that which is simply euill but that is don by his transcendent prouidence it will neuer proue that that which is truly good truly euill can haue any naturall habitude the one to the other or that they haue any cognation betweene themselues wherefore onely sinne being simply euill is that which properly maketh a wretch

and verily wee that beholding beggers lazars men any waies afflicted confesse them miserable si adspici possint lanitatus if we had eies to see the spirituall wounds and sores the wantes and the woes of adulterers murderers blasphemers any other wicked liuers wee would confesse them to be much more miserable
my text doth occasion me to giue you a tast thereof by opening the three words wherewith dauid doth expresse his sinne

the first is peshang

which is well rendred a transgression that is a passing of our bounds
our lusts are apt to range and exceed god sets bounds vnto them by his law hee would hold them in but it will not be we are sonnes of belial we will beare no yoake we breake gods bands and cast his cordes from vs

the first euill of sinne is it maketh a lawles man and who doth not know that liueth in a society what an vnhappie libertie the lawles haue

but why will man be lawles forsooth he thinkes that the more hee hath his will the more hee shall compasse his owne ends he thinks so but it proues not so that appeares in the next name of sinne that is chata

and noteth a shooting cleane besides the marke
when wee become masterles the vpshot of our endeauour is to mistake euill for good

and reape woe where wee looked for rest the wicked wisd
confesse this truth and all histories are but chronicles of it they testifie that lawlesse men haue finally missed of that whereat they aymed yea that they haue therein bin deceiued most wherein they seemed vnto themselues to haue succeeded best
and doth not this name of sinne then argue a sinner to be a wretch

but that which is the height of euill in sinne is noted in the third word gnaon peruersenesse

and indeed sin is nothing but the peruerting of a creature god made the great and the little world to set forth his owne glorie but sinne turneth both to his dishonour god made the little world to be lord ouer the great and sinne turneth the lord into the seruant and the seruant into the lord god made man a consort for angels sin doth range man with the feinds of hell finally god made man after his owne image sin doth change him into the image of the diuell most wretched peruersnesse
now seeing this threefold euill is found in sinne as the names thereof giue vs to vnderstand we cannot doubt but sinne doth make a miserable man hee that is infected with it will confesse it though he be a king

certainely king dauid doth he was at this time a king a victorious a glorious king obeyed by many nations abounding in al kind of worldly prosperity add thereunto that same gracious entaile of his crowne sent vnto him from god
sam

the verie crowne of blessings
but see being stung with the conscience of sinne hee is sensible of none of these neither doth hee finde comfort in any of them notwithstanding all these he confesseth himselfe a wretch
wherein wee may obserue by the way the difference betweene the iudgement of flesh and blood and of a child of god concerning that which maketh happie the one placeth it in the things of this life the other in the peace of god
and indeede so long as it is not well betweene god and vs all the world can giue vs no content the consciousnes of sinne if we haue as feeling hearts as king dauid had feeling the mischieuous nature of sinne wee will account our selues but wretches and wee will with him fall to our miserere mei haue mercie vpon me which is the second part of my text
the correlatiue of miserie is mercy as there were no neede of mercy were there no misery so because there is miserie there is a remedie prouided for it and that is mercy
the verbe doth properly signifie be gracious to mee
grace is free loue so teacheth saint austin non est gratia vllo modo si non sit omni modo gratuita that fauour deserueth not the name of grace that can be either merited or requited

but yet there are two sorts of this grace one quae datur non merenti another quae datur immerenti the first was the grace of creation it proceeded from the free goodnes of god for there was no possibilitie of mans deseruing before hee had his being therefore was his being a guift of grace
the second is the grace of redemption this proceeds also from gods free goodnesse this was vouchsafed to man when he deserued the contrary he deserued eternall death but god vouchsafed

him eternall life this speciall kind of grace is called mercy therefore considering the argument the translator did not amisse in restrayning the amplitude of the words and rendring it haue mercy for euangelicall grace is mercy and it is such grace that is meant in this place

but this mercy is considered either in affectu or effectu as it is in god or as it manifests it selfe vpon man
the remedy of misery is mercie but that mercy must containe not only a gracious disposition towards man but a powerfull operation vpon him god must be well affected so as that mans state also may be altered
in miseries plea for mercie these two cannot be seuered without impietie or blasphemie
blasphemie for sin compassion are inco~patible if the one be not conceiued as the remouer of the other but he doth not so conceiue them that looks only to the affection looketh not also for the action of mercy therefore he blasphemes the author thereof
secondly there is impietie in it for it argueth that a man would be free from gods displeasure but he would not part with that which offends his pure eyes hee loueth to be a sinner
and this is plaine impietie

but what are the effects of mercy euen as many as are the euills of sin
in sin then there are two euills the guilt and the corruption thereof the guilt is resembled to a debt

indeed it is a plaine debt a double debt for in euery sinne that wee commit we grow in arrerages vnto god in regard of the duty which wee owe him and god growes in arrerages vnto vs in regard of the punishment that is due vnto vs
now of these debts god keepeth a booke all our misdeeds are recorded before him

and of these bookes there is mention made in the reuel where the soone of man is represented vpon his tribunall iudging all the world according to those things that are found in the bookes that are open before him

as in regard of the guilt sinnes are compared to debt so in regard of the corruption they are compared vnto staines staines of all sorts to froth to foame to scumme to drosse to mire to all sorts of diseases and impurities of the flesh and indeed how can they bee other seeing they are the insection that wee receiue from the vncleane spirit

this being briefly obserued let vs now consider of dauids prayer his prayer for the affection and operation of mercy
first for the affection in these words miserere haue mercy
the affection is the roote from whence springs the operation wee learne it in another psalme

cause thy face to shine and we shall be saued therefore he doth well to make sure of that first because no hope of the other if hee speede not of that
no hope that the beames will euer warme our land if the sunne haue no aspect vnto our horizon neither is there any hope that wee shall euer seele gods comforts if gods countenance bee not propitious yea the influe~ce is too scant to support our drooping soules did not they first lay hold vpon the abundance that they beleeue to bee in the fountaine of grace

but what our faith is assured of in god wee must desire to feele in our soules our desire that first craues gods good affection must goe on and desire gods good action also certainely dauid did so it appeares in dele and laua blot out wash cleane
two petitions made for two blessings innocencie and sanctitie

innocencie for he desires to be acquitted of his debt he would haue his name blotted out of the obligation that god had against him
and no wonder we know the perplexities of debters if the debt be only pecuniary and may be redeemed by a freind how much more if it be capitall and can bee answered by none but our owne person in such a case how doth feare haunt vs and anguish distresse vs neither night nor day at boord or in bed alone or with friends can we be quiet vntill wee are free from such an obligation
and can a man priuie vnto himselfe in what danger he stands to finde any rest vntill he haue made his peace can hee chuse but bee ouerwhelmed with sorrow except he can put off the storme that hangeth ouer him can hee forbeare to importune god for a pardon knowing how obnoxious he is to the stroke of his vengance doubtlesse hee cannot bee hee as great as good as king dauid he will fall to dele lord doe away mine offences for there is no securitie but only in innocencie

innocencie is not enough it is enough to free vs from feare but it is not enough to cure our miserie without sanctitie it is not fully cured for though when we looke without vs being innocent we haue nothing to dismay vs yet when we looke into our selues if wee be without sanctitie how ougly shall we appeare

quid prodest malorum quae feci impunitas nisi etiam bene agendi sequatur facultas as good haue no innocencie as not to haue it ioyned with sanctitie
we naturally delight in neatnesse in our persons our cloathes our diet and what not and how much cost doe we bestow in cookerie taylerie cosmetrie to remoue any vncomlinesse or vndecencie that may offend though it bee but the eye of vanitie we that so care to haue a faire outside what a foule inside doe we endure if we endure the corruption of sinne no sluttishnes in diet comparable hereunto

the scripture resembleth it to a dogges feeding vpon his vomit

no slouenrie in apparrell to bee matched herewith the scripture calleth it nakednesse such nakednesse as discouers our filthinesse
finally no sores come neare the spirituall ones in ouglinesse the scripture doth parallell the deformitie thereof with the disease of leaprosie
can a man being such endure himselfe can he chuse but fall vnto laua be earnest with god to wash him from his filthinesse certainely he cannot a sensible sinner cannot and such a one was king dauid he prayeth laua wash me lord

neither laua only but multùm laua the originall hath multiplie to wash when he prayed for innocencie it was only dele put a way my sinnes but when he commeth to pray for sanctitie hee is not contented with laua wash me he will haue his washing renued againe and againe
what is the reason surely there are many reasons for it
the first is the difference that god puts betweene iustification and sanctification

page duplicate

it is his pleasure that the one should be actio indiuisibilis the other diuisibilis as the diuines speake the first he consummates at once in the other he proceeds by degrees hee is pleased that our whole life should be an exercise of mortifying the old man and quickening the new
as when a garment hath taken a deepe staine it must haue more scouring and spungings then one before we can get it out euen so the corruption of sin sinks so deepe that it asketh a great deale of paynes to worke it out therefore multùm laua is very necessarie in regard of mortification and it is as necessarie also in regard of viuisication
saint ambrose represents it in a fine similie hee that will die a purple in graine doth giue his cloath inferiour colours first and after many dippings in many preparatiue liquours he doth at length perfect the colour and giue it its full luster euen so the splendour of sanctitie is not attained in the first moment of our conuersion many a line must bee drawne in our soules by the spirit of god before wee can fully recouer his image
not that there is any inability in god so that hee cannot in a moment make vs both innocent and holy as he did in the creation but he is pleased in the difficulty of the recouerie on our part to make vs mindfull of our former vnthristinesse and carefull to husband grace better when god doth vouchsafe it

besides these reasons there is a speciall one which concernes king dauids case
you haue heard that he committed more sinnes then one whereof euerie one was verie hainous now a single cleansing doth not suffice for many enormous sinnes though for our secret sinnes it is enough to say

munda me domine clense me lord from my secret faults and for ordinarie slips

dimitte nobis debita our dayly prayer forgine vs our trespasses may suffice yet when we multiply sinnes haynous sinnes we must haue washing vpon washing many washings for many sinnes it is a perfunctorie repentance that wraps all such sinnes in one and thinkes that one washing wil cleanse a sinner from them all
and yet god knoweth there is two much of this kind of repentance in the world but to such penetentiaries will vse the words of salomon there is a generation that are pure in their owne eyes

and yet is not washed from their filthinesse they will vnhappily be found in the state of coruption at that day when there will be no comfort but for thorough or perfect sanctification

thorough or perfect sanctification was it that king dauid sought as you may perceiue by the next word munda this noteth the end for which dauid desireth the multiplied washing he would so be washed that he might be cleane he would not haue god laterem lauare take much paines and leaue him neuer a whit the better
it is true that god complaines of some

that they are washed in vaine can a leopard change his spots or a blackamoore his skinne if they can then there is hope that you will be the better but little hope of the one and as little of the other
but king dauid would not haue gods paines so wasted vpon him hee would haue it sort a good effect and make him to bee as without blame in regard of innocency so without spot in regard of sanctitie

we must desire that wee may bee renewed aswell as discharged as thoroughly renewed as fully discharged that we may be acceptable in gods eyes and comfortable in our owne

put now these two together the description of miserie and the petition for mercy and you shall finde diuerse remakable things therein
first that miserie presenting it selfe vnto mercy doth take a right course
nathan did charge dauid with sinne and threatned him many plagues you finde not heere that he doth mention gods plagues but his owne sinnes he spends his desire not in deprecating the plagues but in ridding himselfe of his sinnes
and this is good spirituall wisedome for seeing plagues come for sinnes wee are sure that we shall neuer eate of that fruit if we plucke this tree vp by the roots if sinne cleaue not to vs we need not feare gods wrath either we shall not feele it or we shall bee the better for it
pharoah and men haue an eye to their plagues not to their sinnes and therefore as he so they are eased of one plague to fall vnder another if gods mercy heare our prayers and ease vs of any affliction and doe not rid vs of our sinne let vs assure our selues that we are but like a prisoner reprieued that may bee hanged when he least feares death

secondly miserie must learne of king dauid to lay it selfe fully open that it may be fully cured

quis nostrum qui peccatum confitetur non perstringendum potius quam repetendum putet when we repent happily we can be contented to glance at our sinnes but we will bee loath to looke farre into them and search our wounds to the quicke but king dauid doth not so hee doth aswell amplifie sinne the cause of his misery as he doth distinctly sue for the branches of gods mercy

gods mercy and indeed god is the person to whom he sueth for mercy he directeth his prayer vnto him from him he doth expect this mercy
but here is a paradox for he that is ougly in his owne eyes how can he but be odious in gods and how dares a guilty prisoner offer himselfe at the bar of his iudge gods face is against those that do euill

to root out their remembrance from the earth
this is true and yet dauid goeth to him
and no maruaile there is no flying from him but to him hee only can restore a sinner restore him to his owne fauour and rid him of that that intercepteth the influence of the co~fortable beames of grace the church confesseth it in the collect it is gods property to haue mercy and it sayth it according to the scripture daniel confesseth it

to thee lord god belongeth mercy and forgiuenesse saint paul maketh god the father of mercies moses or god rather speaking to moses sheweeh vs that it is an especiall branch of gods glory in that proclamation which hee maketh exod
the lord the lord god mercifull and gracious long suffering

but as mercy is naturall vnto god so it is not comfortable vnto vs but as it is deriued through christ therefore we must marke the words chesed and racham words wherein king dauid doth expresse gods mercy for they note undefined span alphabet the affection· the bowells of a father towards his children
now god is not a father vnto vs but

by adoption and we are not adopted but in christ which is the onely sonne god doth except vs in his beloued in him it is that he hath mercie vpon vs therefore these very words louing kindnesse are in the new testament applyed to christ comming in the flesh christ also in the old testament is noted by the propitiatory or and in the new testament he is called our propitiation

and mercifull high priest
the nature of sinfull men without christ and god that is iudge of all the world are infestissimi inimici they will neuer agree together our infirmitie will be ouerwhelmed by the diuine maiestie but it is christ that turneth the dreadfull tribunall into a throne of grace

neither must we seeke onely for gods kind affection in christ but his gracious actions also no hope of dele nor laua but in him and by him
it is true that god by the prophet tells vs that it is he that blots out our sinnes for his owne sake

and bloteth them out like a cloud and casts our sinnes into the sea but hee doth not this immediately hee doth it by christ daniel teacheth

that hee was to finish wickednesse seale vp sinnes and reconcile iniquitie saint paul teacheth it saying that christ fastened and cancelled the obligation that was against vs on his crosse finally the father sent him and he sent his apostles with power to remit and to retayne sins which must needs implie that dele blot out belongeth to him

and as dele so laua
zacharie foretold it in that day meaning the dayes of the gospell there shall be a fountaine opened to the house of dauid

and to the inhabitants of ierusalem for sinne and for vncleanesse saint paul sheweth the accomplishment of it

christ loued the church and gaue himselfe for it that he might sanctifie it and clense it by the washing of water through the word that hee might make it vnto himselfe a glorious church not hauing spot or wrinckle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blame

neither must we be beholding to christ only for these gracious actions

but for their measure also
the text tells vs that there is not onely mercy in god but that mercy is of a large size it is called here rob we translate it multitude it signifieth also magnitude
the conscience of a sinner is afflicted some times with the number sometimes with the excesse of sinne least we should sinke vnder either burden this word must specially be heeded which doth assure a distressed conscience that there commeth not only mercy from god but great mercy also so great as that his mercy reioyceth ouer his iudgement there lieth an appeale from god vnto god from god the righteous to god the gracious and god in regard of his mercy is in a manner greater then himselfe with this moses presseth god significantly

now beseech thee let the power of my lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying the lord is slow to anger and of great mercy in the whole period hee importuneth him to shew that his mercy exceeds his iustice
the scripture doth amplifie this point by setting downe the dimensions of his mercy telling vs sometimes

of the hight of it it reacheth vnto heauen sometimes of the depth of it it fetcheth men from hell sometimes of the width of it it is ouer all his workes sometimes of the length of it it hath bin euer of old

his tender compassions faile not they are renewed euery morning

but all this is to bee vnderstood in christ his incarnation his passion the whole redemption that hee wrought is indeed magna misericordia a wonderfull mercy saint paul mentioning the breadth the length the depth and the hight of it teacheth vs that it passeth all knowledge

neither is it great onely but in this greatnesse we must obserue magnitudinem multitudinem
saint chrisostome doth excellently amplifie this poynt in regard of both branches ores nouas inauditas behold and wonder the first fruits of those that come to christ are those which were most desperately enthrauled to satan magi publicani meretrices latro blasphemus the conuersion of such persons is an vndoubted argument of the magnitude of his mercy
and touching the multitude beleiue his answer to saint peter

who asking christ whether hee should forgiue his brother seauen times replied not only seauen times but seauentie times seauen

at what time soeuer a sinner doth repent from the bottome of his heart will put all his wickednesse out of my remembrance sayth the lord

and verely were it not for this double greatnesse that is in gods mercy few should bee saued for

if thou lord shouldest bee extreame to marke what is done amisse who were able to stand but with thee there is mercy we would despaire of our cure if there were not such physicke of our great sores if there were not such a soueraigne medicine but this is our comfort where sinne aboundeth grace aboundeth much more

there is no sinne either so great or manifold which cannot be remedied by the mercifull bowells of christ
it was cains voice

my sinne is greater then can be forgiuen but a father saint austin thinke replieth to him mentiris cain this thy complaint is a blasphemous derogation from the vnmeasurable bowells of christ and the nouatians were long since condemned by the church which straightned the power of the remission of sinnes which christ hath left vnto the pastors

marke now the correspondencie of the branches of this text
wee found magnitude and multitude in the miserie of dauid and they did need a magnitude and multitude in the gracious operations of mercie and here we doe finde in the third place that mercy is so well stored that it can doe as much as is required by miserie
whereupon two thinges follow
it is vnbeseeming diuine mercy to bee scant in giuing and humane miserie is foolishly modest that is spare in asking
but this diuinitie must not be abused it was neuer intended to encourage presumption but god would haue it published to keepe men from desperation
it is wholesome doctrine for them that are miserabiles which labour and are heauie laden with the burden of their sin but it is dangerous to them that are onely miseri such as are grieuous sinners but haue no sense of their wretched state

the last point in the text is secundum misericordiam haue mercy vpon me according to that which is in thee not that which is in mee
nothing to moue god but onely the free goodnesse of god certainely to moue mercy nothing else can be pleaded by miserie dauid had

done many good things omnes voluntates dei as saint paul saith acts
hee had restored church and common weale and made many sweet songs to the honor and prayse of god but he remembreth none of all these in his prayer he doth not desire to speede for any of those
and why bona opera deo placere possunt deum placare non possunt while wee doe them though imperfect yet are they well pleasing vnto god thorough christ but if we doe contrary vnto them we may not pleade them for satisfactions for our sinne
no gods rule is eze
when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousnesse and committeth iniquitie all his righteousnesse that he hath done shall not bee mentioned therefore dauid prayeth discreetly when he referreth god to his owne goodnes and pleades nothing of his owne worth and we must in the like case lay before god only our beggery and commend that vnto gods mercy the lesse we haue the more wee shall find in him if wee are not ashamed to confesse our owne basenes and his goodnesse

but it is time to draw to an end
audi peccator orantem peccatorem whosoeuer thou art that art a sinner learne from king dauid the argument of penitent prayer it must represent a feeling miserie and a tender mercy and the feeling of misery must make vs seeke vnto tender mercy
it was a strange errour in saint peter that when he had seene a glimpse of christs glorie

brake out into these words goe from me lord for am a sinfull man hee should rather haue desired that christ would approach him for with whom should a patient desire rather to be then with his physitian or a sinner then with his sauiour surely saint peter at another time

though at first he made dainty that christ should wash his feete yet when christ told him except wash thee thou canst haue no part in me replied wash lord and not my feete onely but my hands and my head also
there is none of vs that doth not daily runne in arrerages to god that doth not staine that garment of innocencie which he receiued in his baptisme and what should we do then being in such a case but that our selues may be written in the booke of life desire that our sinnes may be blotted out of the booke of death that we be not cast out of heauenly hierusalem

as an vnclea~e thing wash our garments white in the blood of the lambe

no doubt but as king dauid so wee shall haue paroxismes sharpe sits of despaire when our conscience curiously suruaieth our miserie
but the eyes of our soule must not dwell there we must lift them vp vnto the et abyssus abyssum inuocet let the depth of our misery seeke a reliefe in the depth of gods mercy be our sins neuer so many bee they neuer so great we shall find more bowells of tender mercy greater loue kindnesse there then our sinnes can need
yea not onely finde them there in god but seele them also streaming from thence to the full reliefe of our distressed soules we shall feele them so acquitting so cleansing vs that we shall be assured that we are vessells of mercy though we deserue for our sinnes to be vessells of wrath

shut vp all with this prayer
lord righteousnesse belongeth vnto thee but vnto vs confusion of faces to our god also belonge

mercies and forgiuenesse though we bee plunged deepe in miserte and sinnes
cause thy face lord to shine vpon vs thy seruants and let not our sinnes seperate betweene thee and vs remit the guilt purge the corruption of vs miserable sinners which doe not present our supplications before thee for our owne righteousnesse but for thy great mercies though our sinnes witnesse against vs yet deale with vs according to thy name for great are thy mercies
amen

epigraph

psal
ver
for acknowledge my transgressions and my sinne is euer before mee

this psalme as heretofore you haue heard consists of two vowes both were made by king dauid one for himselfe another for his kingdome the first doth expresse his desire and his promise his desire to bee restored vnto and preserued in the state of grace his promise if hee speede hereof to performe religious seruice vnto god
in the former petition of his desire there are two remarkeable things the matter contained in it and the manner of king dauids redoubling it of the matter haue already spoken wherefore now come on vnto the manner
and herein we must obserue first the inference then the amplification that is how that which followeth is brought in vpon that which goeth before and how king dauid enlargeth himselfe in vnfolding the confession of his owne miserie and petition for gods mercy in the inference we shall learne that as god hath mercy so it is for such as are sensible of their miserie in the amplification we shall learne that hee which is sensible must shew himselfe not onely ingenious in displaying his owne wretchednesse but bee assured also of the remedie which is prouided by gods goodnesse

but to looke more particularly into the former branch of the amplification behold therein how king dauid doth rip vp his sinnes the branches the root thereof the sinne which himselfe hath committed and the sinne which hee hath deriued from his parents hee layeth open both both the debt and the vsury so saint chrysostom calls them

hee beginneth at the sinne which himselfe hath committed he vseth not the querulous prouerbe of the iewes the fathers haue eaten sowre grapes

and the childrens teeth are set onedge the remembrance of his wofull inheritance doth not make him forget his owne graceles purchase no hee mindes this first hee first amplifieth the debt which himselfe hath contracted

in laying open this he obserueth two things the naturall properties

thereof and the supernaturall euent which followeth thereupon the naturall properties are two a malignity and an impiety he handles the impietie in the next verse the malignitie in this that haue now read vnto you

malignity is a vexing euill first there is euill in his sinne hee toucheth a double euill euill of the heart and euill of the head of the heart noted by the word peshang which signifieth a rebellious inordinatnes of the will of the head noted by chata which noteth an erring iudgement or misleading aduise these two euills are in sinne enormous sinne and where they are there they vexe for they are coram or contra before vs or against vs the word beareth both significations and therefore it is translated both wayes and if we couple them as well we may then you shall finde that enormous sinne committed doth haunt our thoughts and afflict our wills
neither onely doe they so but they doe so incessantly so saith the text they are semper coram semper contra alwaies before vs and against vs alwaies vexing both our head and our heart
of this king dauid is ingeniously feeling and testifieth the truth of it in his owne case in his owne case say for the sinne which he remembreth is his owne my transgressions my sinnes the disease of mine owne head and mine owne heart therefore saith king dauid am feeling feeling in my head and feeling in my heart for agnosco acknowledge it acknowledging importeth a worke of the head which is noscere to know and a worke of the heart which is agnoscere to acknowledge the vse of knowledge the applying of it to our liues

neither is king dauid only feeling hereof but ingenious also in publishing the same for he did acknowledge it in this psalme
these bee the particulars which offer themselues in this text and whereunto god willing shall now speake more fully and answerably vnto this

occasion

but must first touch at the inference and shew you how these and the following words are brought in vpon those that goe before haue mercy vpon me lord saith king dauid for acknowledge my transgressions obserue then mans deuotion must follow gods direction neither may we hope otherwise to speede then we are waranted by his promise
now god doth not promise mercy but to those that are feeling of their miserie in the beginning of the leiturgie we heare daily out of ezek

at what time soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne from the bottome of his heart will put al his wickednesse out of my remembrance saith the lord

and therefore out of ioel we are called vpon to rent our hearts and not our garments and turne vnto the lord our god because hee is gentle and mercifull patient and of much mercy and such an one as is sorric for our afflictions

to this purpose doth our sauiour christ in the gospell pronounce them blessed that hunger and thirst after righteousnes saying

they shall be satisfied and inuiteth those that labour and are heauie laden saying he will refresh them

although then wee doe yeeld that the mercy of god is infinite and

that it is readie to releiue all wretches yet wee may not forget that in obtayning it there are partes nostrae as chrysostom speaketh there is some thing that god requires on our part hee requires that we approue vnto him our repentance
saint austin sets it forth in a prettie dialogue betweene god and king dauid quidergo quaeris miserecordiam pecatum impunitum remanebit what saith god vnto king dauid doest thou seeke for mercy so that thy sinne may remaine vnpunished respondet dauid respondeant lapsi
king dauid replied and all sinners must ioyne in this answer with king dauid non domine nay lord my sinne shall not bee vnpunished know his iustice whose mercy implore my sinne shall not passe vnpunished but therefore would not haue thee punish it because doe punish it my selfe and so chrysostome
see my sinne lord therefore doe not thou see it register it in this psalme therefore doe thou blot it out of thy booke agnosco ignoscas therefore pardon because am penitent

and indeed it is the apostles rule that if we would iudge our selues wee should not be iudged of the lord

yet may we not corrupt this doctrine as the church of rome doth by mans penetencie and esteeming it to bee satisfactorie satisfactorie say dignitatesuâ for any worth that is in it though it may goe for satisfactorie dignatione diuinâ because god is pleased to rest contented with it
paululum supplicij satis est patri to the indulgence of a father small sparkles of grace make a good satisfaction for a great fault committed by a child but he were a gracelesse child that would so his fathers good nature as to deeme a few sorrowing teares a full ransome of his offence our condition of being gods children by faith in christ and the affection of god respecting vs in christ as his children are the true ground why god requires no more of vs and he that instead of this relation plods vpon a proportion betweene his repentance and gods vengeance doth not onely corrupt a comfortable doctrine by his errour but for his pride deserueth to forfeit gods gracious pardon
let vs keepe the right path neither godly sorrow neither yet neglecting it seeing god hath vouchsafed it so comfortable an effect let vs all especially you that are the penitents be feeling of our miserie that god may releeue vs with his mercie
and let this suffice concerning the inference come now to the amplification to consider so much of it as is contained in this verse here told you king dauid doth display the malignitie of his sinne
malignitie is a vexing euill therefore in the sin here specified we must obserue first the euill and then the vexation thereof and we find a double euill noted by the two names that are giuen to the sinne haue on former verses spoken of these words but the present occasion hath made me looke farther into them and obserue moreouer that which is not vnworthy of our knowledge

these words then will teach vs that sinnes especially if they be enormous haue plaine characters of the diuell hee is resembled to a serpent and to a lion in regard of the first christ calleth him a lier

in regard of the last a murderer and where he instils sinne hee leaueth the

steps of either of these of his lying in the errour of mens iudgements of his murdering in the rebelliousnesse of their affections the second of these is noted by peshang lawlesnesse the first by chata aberration from the scope where at we ayme he desireth not to haue men to halfes he endeauoureth to venome both the fountaines of the reasonable soule and soldome shall you find a man misled in his iudgement whose affections are not violent
see the truth of this first in moralitie then in diuinitie
let a man bee giuen to drunkennesse if the serpent haue taken him by the head and made him conceiue that that beastly qualitie doth well beseeme a man the lyon will take him by the heart and hee will grow mad against those that will not bee as mad as himselfe the bloud that is shed in quarrels of this nature are too dayly proofes of this truth for vnchastitie you neede no better euidence then the storie of the sodomites

it is no great matter to gather proofes touching other morall defects but the occasion remembreth me especially to instance in matters of diuinitie here you shall see if euer that the enemie of mankind hath left the markes of either of his persons

how the serpent preuailed against the pharisees hee knoweth not the gospell that doth not know christ doth therein discouer manifold errours of their iudgement and that the roaring lyon had entred their hearts is witnessed by their persecuting of christ and his apostles how fouly the arians were deceiued concerning the deitie of christ we read in the storie of the first nicene councell and in the ecclesiasticall storie we read how barbarous how bloudy they were as the serpent had bit them so the lyon raged in them come on to the papists is not their erronious iudgement accompanied with most furious affections as they are not ashamed to put the diuels properties into their creede teaching an art of periurious lying and meritorious murdering so doe they act them both publishing lyes by their tongues and pennes and practising murders by their inchanted assasinates the is a monument hereof to their eternall infamie
the anabaptists came fairely after them whose opinions were not more grosse then their dealing seditious not so few as a hundred thousand persons perished while with their rebellious sword they laboured to make good the forgerie of their braine they made it plaine that as well the lyon as the serpent had taken possession of them this the germaine stories relate at large and our owne stories will tell vs that wee haue not wanted some that haue beene kinne vnto them hackets coppingers and others that though they haue not gone so farre yet had gone farther then beseemes those whose profession is truth and practise should bee obedience they haue receiued nay they haue vented some thing of the serpent and some thing of the lyon

thinke you see by this time what meane meane to lance the sores of these penitents to let it appeare that the serpent hath got into their head and the lyon into their hearts they haue had a false light that deluded their iudgement and an vnkind heat that hath warmed their affections they haue scanted gods bountie in permitting vnto vs the

vse of his creatures and entertained a iewish conceit of the vnlawfulnesse of eating bloud

and as their opinions haue beene erroneous in regard of christian libertie so haue they beene also concerning ecclesiasticall societie thinking they may seperate themselues from the church if those whom they esteeme irreligious liuers be not excommunicated by ecclesiasticall censures yea so farre hath the serpent preuailed as to make them if not denie at least to doubt of the lawfulnesse of the leiturgie the ministrie yea to question the very root of all the ecclesiasticall authoritie both of prince and pastors
so farre hath the serpent beene with them
and if he get in before the lyon will follow after and indeede he hath followed in them for what auctoritie haue they not set at naught ecclesiasticall ciuill either of them more then once and trod vpon them more waies then one and how they would haue beene if they had had power answerable to their will god knoweth the proofe wee haue had of others may make vs iustly suspect the worst
this onely wish them to take to themselues that in their sinne there was this double euill and if they do not therein discerne this dou ble euill they doe not as they ought looke into their sinne which not withstanding they should doe because so to doe is the first step of repentance
the second step doth consider the vexation that doth accompanie this euill
as it seiseth vpon the head and vpon the heart so doth it vexe them both for it is coram nobis and contra nos both before vs and against vs
the word neged doth containe both praepositions and therefore the interpreters haue differed in their translations but because sin cannot be before a penitent but it will bee against him therefore will conioyne them both will shew you that it doth haunt our thoughts and afflict our hearts

sinne then is fitly resembled vnto a harlot painted that her countenance may by art worke what by nature it could not doe while she doth wooe her louers that which she offereth to their view is the paynting but when she hath drawne them into her snare she giueth the leaue then to see hir natiue hue· she reuealeth then what before shee concealed euen so sinne hath a faire but the inside thereof is foule it puts on the one to allure but when men are allured then it sheweth them the other wee are easily tempted to the act of sinne for pleasure maketh vs swallow the bait when the act is determined the sight of the pleasure vanisheth but the sight of the guiltie corruption abideth by vs the painting is quickly wiped off and the vglinesse thereof appeares and the angell of light is quickly turned into an angel of darkenesse though wee striue to cast our sinnes behind vs will we nill we they will thrust themselues before vs
and why

they are grauen in memoriâ conscientiae as chrysostome calls it they are registred in the booke of conscience which we are forced to read euen when we would be most glad to be rid of it but the relation thereof cannot be supprest our thoughts cannot be freed from it
and this is the first vexing propertie of sinne it doth vexe our thoughts

but not our thoughts only it vexeth our hearts also it is not onely coram but contra not onely before vs we cannot but thinke of it but also contra nos

we cannot but be tormented with it
saint ambrose saith it is vltrix imago a verie furie it is a hell going before hell and rackes vs before wee are put vpon the racke the harlot suddainely turneth into a souldier and giueth vs as many deadly wounds as she gaue vs counterfeit kisses

iob expresseth it in a verie fine similie wickednesse is sweet in the mouth and the wicked hideth it vnder his tongue but this meate in his bowells is turned it is the gall of aspes the wiseman speaketh it plainely men entertaine sinne as a frend and make a couenant with it but what is the issue it consumeth them and bringeth them vnto naught and as saint peter speaketh

it fighteth against their soules

neither is this vexing momentanie it vexeth semper alwaies alwaies before alwaies against a sinner is the double euill of sinne in the night in the day in prosperitie in aduersitie while hee is alone while hee is in companie a sinner that is rowsed to see his sinne cannot but be vexed with the euill thereof

nec prius hi stimuli mentem quam vita relinquent
qui{que dolet citius quam dolor ipse cadet

the torments will not end before death and in the reprobate after death this vexation shall be much increased
but of this vexation more anon when come to couple the first part of the text with this latter let vs come on then to king dauids ingeneous feeling of this malignitie malignitie of his owne sinne

and indeed it is his owne sinne that he is feeling of
many studie sin and they can see euill enough in it but it is other mens sinne in other mens eyes moates seeme beames

but beames in our owne eyes seeme not so much as moates most men are like the laodiceans thinke themselues rich encreased in goods that they want nothing euen then when they are poore blind naked and miserable as christ tells that church reuel

hereupon it is

that they come to god like pharisees with thanke god am not like vnto other men but king dauid choose rather to play the publican to looke into his owne sores his errors his rebellions to amplifie his owne sinnes and fit them with their proper names to note the diseases of his owne head and of his owne heart

it were to be wished that you that are penetents had taken the same course
you haue traduced your pastors for the diseases of their head and reproached them by the names of baals priests you haue traduced your brethren for the diseases of their hearts and doomed them as vnworthy of the communion of saints and see how god hath rewarded your pride he hath suffered the diuell to wound you both in head and heart he hath made you spectacles of those diseases which you condemned in others

they may presse you with that question of saint paul thou that makest thy boast of the law by breaking the law dishounerest thou god and vpbraid you with the prouerbe

physician heale thy selfe

and it is a good warning that may be taken by vs all not to studie others

before we haue studied our selues and not to let our censure passe against any more seuerely then against our selues so did king dauid in his practise of repentance and so must we we must looke into our owne case not onely so we must bee feeling thereof also so much is meant by the word acknowledging

acknowledge doth implie knowledge and adde thereunto the vse therof
to vnderstand this we must obserue that for the ordering of our life god doth furnish vs with two helpes the one is called undefined span alphabet the other undefined span alphabet doth signifie or note the principles whereby wee doe distinguish good and euill undefined span alphabet noteth the application of these principles to our actions the first you may call morall knowledge the second morall acknowledgement the latter cannot bee without the former and the former should not be without the latter
but to touch at either of these for our present occasion
god hath set downe those principles which he thought expedient to guide a christian resolution but two euils haue the church the papists they breed vp the people in an ignorant deuotion and care not how litle they know the true grounds of conscience but bid them rest contented with an implicite faith and rest their soules vpon the authoritie of the church they offend in parum in of the peoples knowledge but the separatists runne into the other extreame they offend in nimium attribute too little to the church and exceed in knowledge or fancies which they suppose to be diuine knowledge
and what maruell when leauing the guides of their owne church then whom since the apostles dayes god hath not raised vp in any kingdome so many and so worthy they commit themselues vnto obscure guides that either lurke in corners or flie their countrie
no bookes are for their eyes but those which are of their penning and they that scorne our apocryphalls what apocryphall writings doe they dote vpon and as no writings please them but such so no mens sermons but theirs can edifie them and indeed they doe edifie but it is a babel their sancies are no better then that tower of confusion and yet to dwell in that they will forsake hierusalem it selfe
will not amplifie your fault that are penitents but a man may guesse at the modell of your knowledge by your librarie by the bookes any may guesse what principles you follow not of your owne church but of conuenticles and this is that that hath made you schismatickes hence forward you shall doe well to take your light from those starres whom god hath placed in this church especially seeing they refuse not to let those who with modestie desire to bee resolued see that their light is deriued from the sunne of righteousnesse and that as faithfull stewards they presse nothing to the consciences of their fellow seruants but that for which they haue warrant from their master christ wherein they differ from the popish pastors

but knowledge is not enough acknowledgement is required also vnto undefined span alphabet we must adde undefined span alphabet and the principles that we haue we must put in vre
as our knowledge must not be headlesse so must it not bee

heartlesse when we haue gone so farre as that the light of our vnderstanding can discerne betweene good and euill wee must then take care of our affections that the heate of grace giue them a good temper that they take a true taste of their obiects that loue and hatred desire and feare hope and despaire arise out of that which was designed to worke them

but to amplifie this a litle farther
we should vse knowledge in guiding of our actions before hand and trie what that is which offereth it selfe to be done before we goe about to doe it if a man were so aduised as timely to moue vnto his soule this question quid ago where about goe such prouidence if it would not preuent all sinne because of the manifold temptations and mans too naturall infirmitie either in neglecting grace which he hath or forgetting to pray for grace which he hath not yet would it put off many a sinne and make vs take lesse content in the sinnes which wee doe not put off yea this would bee a good inducement to the thorough feeling of our slips which is the after vse we must make of our knowledge and is vsually meant by acknowledgment for what is that but only that if sinne haue preuented our aduisednesse vpon a reuiewe we retract what rashnesse hath committed this is a profitable vse of knowledge
but sinfull soules are now become like corrupt bodies corrupt bodies haue often times great appetites when they haue but small digestion so many desire much knowledge whereof they put but a little in practice yea as meat that is not digested in the body doth incumber it and breeds in it many disquieting diseases so if our life bee not the better for our knowledge by our care to expresse it it will be much the worse by our quarrells that we will raise about it

socrates the ecclesiasticall historiographer reports a storie of one pambo

a plaine ignorant man such as you the penitents are who came to a learned man and desired him to teach him some psalme hee began to reade vnto him the
psalme when he had past the first verse said will looke to my waies that offend not with my tongue pambo shut the booke and tooke his leaue saying that he would goe learne that poynt when hee had absented himselfe certaine moneths hee was demanded by his reader when he would goe forward he answered that he had not yet learned his old lesson and he gaue the very same answere to one that many yeares after moued the same question
doe not desire that our people should haue so few sermons the canons of the church haue prouided for the people better then so but this desire that the people would make more vse of that which they learne and let their liues shew that they are the better for the ministers paines for sure am that it is their negligence that maketh the ministers diligence the more needfull and though knowledge be wanting in too many places of the land yet is acknowledgement wanting much more the fruit of our paines is so farre from preuenting sinne in the people that we cannot speed so well as to worke a feeling thereof in them when they haue committed it we finde not that tendernesse in their soules which nathan found in the soule of king dauid and which king dauid implies in his acknowledgment

but feeling is not enough that is not all that is meant by acknowledgement though the feeling bee no lesse in the heart then it is in the head therefore told you that king dauids was an ingenious feeling he published what he felt
if sinnes bee onely secret then the humiliation of the inward man may suffice in the sight of god it is enough to confesse his faults or in a generalitie to acknowledge them in the publike confession of the church without specification except the burden of his conscience giue him iust cause to reueale it that he may be relieued by ghostly counsell but if what he conceiued inwardly hee hath vented outwardly in word or deede to the offence not of god onely but also of the church then vnto the confession made vnto god in priuate must bee added a publike also in the face of the church such was king dauids sinne and such is king dauids confession he testified publikely to the church the religious feeling that hee had of his sinnes and this is thereason why called his dealing ingenious

and indeed herein standeth the great conflict that grace hath with flesh and bloud hardly are wee contented to be priuie to our selues of our owne sinfulnesse for though wee delight to commit sinne yet doe we not delight to behold our selues as we are sinners the more naturall the desire is in euery man to be reputed good the more vnsauorie is that search that sindeth him to bee nothing so and if wee are so vnwilling to know our selues to bee sinners much lesse will we endure that others should be of our counsell therein
stultorum incurata pudor malus vlcera celat
many will rather die then be knowne that they are sicke of some shamefull disease but men are lesse willing to haue their sinnes published then their sores
the more remarkable is king dauids ingenuitie rather to be wished then hoped for in this age wherein men sinne without shame but shame to acknowledge their knowne sinne outfacing of such challenge as was made to king dauid and excusing sometimes of the fact most vsually of themselues are the best pleas which are stood vpon by offenders though many exceed king dauid in the infirmities which appeared in this fall yet where is the man that commeth neere the least degree of his in confessing of his fault where such stupiditie is and men hide their sinnes like adam it is a signe that the principles of conscience are dull and dead as it is a signe that they liue and are quicke where contrarie ingenuitie doth appeare

which you the penitents should consider well and let the church see in your humble confession what true contrition there is in your soule whether your conscience bee senslesse or feeling of that state whereinto you are brought by sinne to worke this degree of penitencie in you will somewhat enlarge a point which did but glance at before
know then that there are two sorts of the laying open of the malignity of sinne the one is voluntarie the other is compulsorie the voluntarie is that whereof haue spoken which is medicinall and prepares miserie to receiue mercy for therefore doth god put a distance betweene our ill dealing and faring ill that grace husbanding that distance

thriftily and wee iudging our selues before we are iudged might preuent that faring ill which is due vnto our ill deseruing

add hereunto that if we willingly ser forth the malignitie of our sin the obiect will be proportionable to our sight and we shall so bee confounded therewith that we shall not bee confounded our godly sorrow shall haue an happie issue but if we will not doe this willingly we shall be constrained to doe it happily in this world certainely in the world to come but whether now or then the obiect will bee too strong for our sight and our soules will be ouerwhelmed therewith
in this world it falls out very often that satan which tempts many vnto sinne doth tempt them afterwards to despaire and how doth hee doe it but by representing vnto them the malignity of their sinne the euill whereof proueth so vexing that it maketh some as restlesse as cain and some as vnnaturall to themselues as iudas and both of them that spared to let their tongues confesse penitently did not spare desperately to publish their owne shame but if happily god doe not permit so much power vnto sathan in this world yet in the world to come he will force all the wicked vnto this confession the worme then will so bite and the bookes of their consciences will be so legible god will so set their sinnes before them that they shall power forth a full confession and giue glory vnto god though little to their owne comfort as it is excellently set forth wisd
wherefore this penitentiall confession enioyned by the church should not seeme irkesome vnto you seeing it is so behoofefull for you for you doe by this preuent a worse preuent an vncomfortable one that will be forced vpon you by this medicinall one if you performe it voluntarily out of a godly sorrow for your sinne

but conclude

non peccare vltra humanam naturam cognoscitur it is not to bee hoped that wee should runne the race that is set before vs and not take any fall before wee die least therefore we should so fall as not to rise againe god hath prouided a remedie he will spare vs if we doe not spare our selues if we take notice of our sinne god will not enquire into it if it be grieuous vnto vs god will neur greiue vs for it neither shall we euer be forced to confesse to our confusion if we bee willing to confesse it to our saluation seeing then god hath giuen vs our choyce whether our confession shall be a medicine or a torment let vs not reserue our selues for the torment by despising of the medicine
but let vs not be like vnto those that behold their naturall face in a glasse

and going away presently forget what manner of persons they were that will make out repentance but like a morning cloud which quickly passeth away and no wonder if men often relapse into sinne if they so quickly forget their former sinnes hee that will hold himselfe in must imitate king dauid his humiliation must be as lasting as his life we should neuer forget what wretches we haue beene least withall we forget how much wee are bound to god the presence of our sinne forgiuen will make vs more sensible of the forgiuenesse of our sinne

wherefore if at any time we finde grace in gods eyes as which of vs

doth not often finde it in this life let it not greiue vs to say with saint paul that wee are chiefe of sinners

though god should doe vs the like honour he did to him and make vs chiefe apostles in a word though we haue sped of our pardon as dauid did from the mouth of nathan let this be our constant confession vnto death doe know mine owne wickednesse and my sinne is euer before me

lord haue proued that satan is a serpent and that hee is a lyon he hath besotted my wits he hath enraged mine affections when he did this he transformed an angel of darkenesse into an angel of light and cloathed a foe vnder the habit of a friend was deluded and he entertained but now hee appeareth in his owne likenesse the light is gone the darkenesse remaineth and my counterfeit frend is an apparant foe these fraudes disquiet my thoughts and how is my heart afflicted by this vnexpected danger finde no remedie but to make knowne my case to thee to lay open these diseases of my head of my heart before thee grant that may so feele them that thou mayst vouchsafe to cure them that thou mayst vouchsafe to couer them also let me neuer be ashamed to discouer them let me whet the dull sense that haue of thy mercy by the quicke sense of mine owne misery let this neuer die that that may liue euer so shall by a godly sorrow speed of a heauenly ioy and by a medicinall confusion in the church militant make my selfe capable of eternall saluation in the church triumphant
amen

epigraph

psal
the first part of the
vers
against thee thee onely haue sinned and done this euill in thy sight

king dauid in this penitentiall confessing that sinne which himselfe had contracted obserueth the naturall properties and supernaturall euent thereof
the naturall properties are two a malignitie and an impietie which are in sinne of the malignitie spake last come now to the impietie
we must then obserue that in all sinne besides the offence there is a partie offended and the partie offended setteth the measure to the offence as he is so is that he maketh it to be greater or lesse therefore in a full confession the partie offended must not bee omitted certainely king dauid in his exemplarie confession doth not omit him hee doth not forget to expresse whom hee had wronged against thee onely haue sinned and which is more whom he had contemned haue done this euill in thy sight

but more distinctly
in the confession that concerneth the partie wronged you shall find something that is common to all sinners
tibi

peccaui haue sinned against thee must euery one say for whosoeuer sinneth sinneth against god but here is some thing also proper tibi solj peccauj against thee onely haue sinned can none say but a king because there is none aboue him but onely god and therefore none but god can challenge him
as this must bee obserued in the confession of the partie wronged so in the confession of the same partie contemned we must obserue first what contempt is in generall it is malum facere coram oculis not onely to wrong a partie but to wrong him to his face
secondly how this contempt in speciall is aggrauated two wayes
by the eye of the partie offended oculis tuis for gods is no ordinarie eye
by the sinne wherewith that eye was prouoked malum hoc the sinne committed was no ordinarie sinne
these are the particulars which meane to handle on this text wherfore resume them that may runne them ouer briefly and in their order

first then the whole text is an amplification of sinne in regard of the partie offended and the partie offended maketh it plaine that there is impietie in the sinne
persons with whom we conuerse are some our equalls some our superiours if equalls and we offend them the offence is properly called iniquitie as taxing the vnequall dealing of equall persons but if the persons be superiours and be offended then the offence is properly called impietie because all superiours are instar parentum either they are or they are vnto vs instead of our parents now the vertue which must moderate our carriage towards our parents is called pietie and therefore is our misbehauiour towards them no lesse then impiety
and if they deserue this censure that offend the fathers of their flesh how much more is it due to them that offend the father of their spirits

seeing the fathers of our flesh challenge our pietie in regard that they represent vnto vs the father of our spirits therefore it belongeth much more vnto him whom they represent whereupon it followeth that to offend him can be no lesse then impietie and impietie will proue a naturall propertie of sinne

but let vs come to the branches of the confession
the first is that which toucheth the person as he is wronged and here told you wee finde some thing that is common to all sinners tibi peccaui all sinners must say that when they sinne against whomsoeuer they doe sinne they sinne against god
will make it plaine by foure euident reasons
the first is taken from that which we abuse in sinne
all creatures as they are made by god so doe they still belong vnto him so that wee cannot abuse them but in them we abuse him euery man may perceiue this in his one familie he that wrongeth a wife in the wife wrongeth the husband the abuse offered to a child redoundeth to his father yea a master an owner is feeling of whatsoeuer hurt is done either to the seruant or else to his goods and shall we thinke then that any creature can be violated the creator not touched therewith all adulterers murderers whatsoeuer malefactors must remember they abuse the creator while they vse his creature amisse

a second reason is this that wee cannot abuse nor wong

others but withall we abuse our selues much more that which we do to them is but iniurie but that which we doe to our selues is deprauation wee corrupt our selues with sinne when wee doe vnto them onely a wrong now the reference which our selues haue vnto god maketh the deprauing of our selues an offence against him we are not our owne

god hath made vs and not we our selues yea we are bought with a price euen the precious bloud of our sauiour christ yea the holy ghost by christ hath made vs a temple vnto himselfe and we are vouchsafed to bee his resting place for euer
looke how many references we haue vnto god so many waies doe wee offend him when wee imploy our selues in sinne by creation we should beare the image of god and what an abuse is it of his image by sinne to transforme it into the image of the diuel by redemption we become the members of christ and how doe we vilifie him when we make them members of an harlot we are vouchsafed to be temples of the holy ghost was christ so offended with the abuse of the materiall temple when the house of prayer was made a denn of theenes

and thinke you that the abuse of the spirituall doth nothing concerne him certainely his spirit must needs be grieued therewith

a third reason is this
the naturall duties that we owe man to man and creature vnto creature are imposed vpon vs by a law and that law is gods we swarue not from our duties but we breake his law
and if we breake his law how can we but offend him especially seeing his law is the image of himselfe of his being and of his doing in it wee haue a tast of his holy nature and of that which is remarkable in his owne workes now what lawmaker will endure that his law shall be broken especially whereas he imposeth no other law on his subiects then on himselfe and that law requireth nothing but an outward resplendencie of an inward glory that we should let our light shine before men

that they may see our good workes and glorifie our father which is in heauen the breaking of such a law must needs offend the sacred lawmaker

a fourth reason is the blasphemie of the wicked occasioned by sin
they that know not the true god measure him by that which they see in his seruants thinke that as they are so is he impotent in affections impure in conuersation hereupon do they open their mouthes against heauen
nathan toucheth this in his reproofe of dauid the iewes are often by the prophets taxed for giuing this occasion of blasphemie and the christians had wofull proofe of it in the primitiue church witnes the strange imputatio~s that the heathen did cast vpon the christian religion whereof a man may finde more then enough in the heathenish writings of those times
neither do we want proofe in these daies the barbarous crueltie of the first inuaders of the indies how did it cause those infidels to blaspheme the name of christ what infamie is dayly cast vpon the reformed religion by the aduerse party whose chiefe proofe is the vnreformedliues of the professors therof it ca~not then be denied but that though in the eye of flesh bloud when we sin wee satisfie our lusts vpon the creatures mandoth iniurie vnto man as dauid to vriah to bathsheba yet the offence redounds vnto god and god is a party against

whom we sinne whensoeuer we sinne
tibi peccaui haue sinned against thee must be put in the confession of euery sinner

besides this confession that is common to all sinners here is added another confession which is proper vnto kings tibi soli peccaui against thee only haue sinned could no man say but he that is a soueraigne
but to open these words more fully we must obserue that some vnderstand them absolutely some comparatiuely and of those that vnderstand them absolutely some vnderstand them onely de facto some de iure some consider only what was done some what ought to be done these different senses agree all well with the text and because the knowledge of them is vsefull will touch at them all
first at the sense which conceiueth in these words that which was vsually done

great men especially kings are beset with flatterers that will rather blanch sinne then set it forth in its owne colour pleade for it rather then against it they turne princes vices into vertues and adore their imperfections as if they were heauenly perfections and so if they begin to bee bad they neuer leaue vntill they haue made them starke naught to glorie in their shame

which they see others magnifie
but god hath no respect of persons he soweth no such pillowes vnder the elbowes of kings neither will hee couer their ruines with such distempered morter when their subiects doe sooth them

he will speake home and be a swift witnesse against them when all others hold their peace hee feareth not the faces of the mighty neither will he spare to strike the greatest monarch iob toucheth this more then once and the author of the booke of wisedome doth euidently amplifie it neuer a booke historicall in the bible that hath not some examples of it
and this may be the first thing that king dauid meaneth in these words he might haue slept and died in his sinne for ought was sayd or done vnto him by men but hee found one that rowsed him that searched his wounds to the quicke and that was onely god when the prophet when the priest the councellors of state all were silent none made any remonstrance to the king of his sinne god put forth his voice

yea that a mighty voyce that shiuered both the soule and body of king dauid and made him acknowledge the difference betweene his soueraigne in heauen and his subiects on earth saying against thee onely haue sinned

as these words are true de facto note what is vsually don so are they true de iure also note what lawfully may be done
in sinning there is a double difference betweene a subiect a soueraigne the one is ratione praecepit commandments lawes the other is ratione paenae mulcts and chastisements the subiect hath two obligations vpon him the law of god and of the king hee is bound to yeeld his obedience to them both neither can hee dispence with his obedience vnto either of them the king is absolutely bound only to gods law ouer his owne lawes hee hath power although hee should vse them as directions for the good of his people yet when there is iust cause he may dispence not only with himselfe but with others also in this respect do the lawiers affirme that a monarch is solutus legibus that a king in regard of his own

lawes cannot deale vniustly because in foro soli hee onely is to iudge when it is expedient for him to dispence with his lawes so then when a subiect offendeth he offendeth against the law of his soueraigne and of god but when a king offendeth against the lawes of a soueraigne he cannot offend hee offendeth onely against the lawes of god
and so in that sense it is true tibi soli peccaui

besides the precepts of lawes there are sanctions these containe the penalties which they incurre that breake the lawes as manifold as the lawes are so manifold are the sanctions
and here commeth in a second difference betweene a subiect and a soueraigne
a subiect is liable to both sanctions to the sanction of his soueraignes lawes the sanction of gods lawes if he offend he is punishable by both but a soueraigne is subiect but vnto one law so but vnto one sanction that sanction which is annext vnto the law of god to the sanction of his owne law he is not subiect
nature abhors progressum in infinitum as in philosophie so in policy therefore subordination of persons that ariseth by degrees must rest when it commeth to the soueraigne all within his territories are subiect to his chastisement but hee to the chastisement of none

tutus est imperij potestate saith saint ambrose it is the principall of his roiall prerogatiues and vpon this point doe most of the fathers insist that haue occasion to speake of these words euen from the verie dayes of the apostles haue they made these words a sanctuarie vnto kings and a sacred plea for their exemption from the censure of any vnder god

this doctrine is the rather to be vrged in this age because the two extreames that impugne the truth papists on one side and schismaticks on the other are both vsurpers vpon the crowne and scepters of kings both will giue them lawes both will correct the errors of their liues and gouerment one by the pope the other by the people
but both their vsurpations are condemned in this text tibi solipeccaui against thee only haue sinned confuteth them both and subiects that will not passe for rebells must be contented to take not to giue lawes to suffer from not to inflict punishments vpon their soueraignes

yet though this be the duty of subiects princes are not lawlesse neither is this a doctrine of impunity for though it bee peccaui soli tibi yet it is peccaui and tibi god is their lawginer and will call them to an account for breaking of his law et potentes potenter

the greater they are the greater shall their punishment bee

though they bee exempted from the power of man they are reserued vnto a greater power the power of god
this may stop all mutinous mouthes and hold in all treacherous hands that declame against the vnbridled power of soueraignes and thinke it long before iustice is done vpon them

but enough of the absolute sense of these words
some obserue besides this a comparatiue sense king dauid offended god and men though the offence were great against both yet was the former infinitely greater then the latter the men against whom hee offended were his vassalls god was his soueraigne vnequall obiects make vnequall

sinnes and as is the sinne so must our apprehension be greater of greater sinne
the apprehension then of the greater did cleane take away the apprehension of the lesser as when a man is afflicted with two paines the sharper drownes all sense of the duller so that though king dauid were not without feeling of the wrong done to his subiects yet was hee more feeling of the wrong done vnto god especially considering the amplification of the many fauours which god had vouchsafed him the more he was indebted to god the more reason he had to bee sensible of the offence which hee had giuen to him and so in comparison to greiue only for that
and so should we in our repentance make the measure of gods fauours to vs the measure of that repentance which the sinnes against our neighbors doe at any time draw from vs
and thus much for the first branche of the confession come now to the second

wee haue heard whom king dauid offended wee must now heare how farre that appeareth in these words haue done this euill in thy sight
to offend god is to doe him wrong but to offend him in his sight is to improue that wrong vnto contempt and that is to doe wrong in the highest degree
but more distinctly
as before you heard there was some thing common in the wrong and something proper so must you obserue the like in the contempt also
to offend a man before his eyes is not only to wrong but also to contemne him take an example from your selues he that abuseth a mans wife doth him great wrong but if it bee done before the husbands face how much doth that scorne multiply the wrong there is much odds betweene a seruants abusing his master and abusing him to his face for this is not onely to displease but also to despise him if it bee so betweene man and man how much more betweene man god that which is common to all wrong we may not denie vnto that wrong which we doe vnto god
especially if you consider the inequalitie of the eyes for as the eyes are so is the let a drunkard see one drunke and an adulterer one committing of adulterie though in cold blood out of some reliques of conscience he will be moued yet nothing so much as he ought because the obiects of his eyes are such as himselfe is
but the eyes of a sober a chast man are affected with such spectacles answerably to their sobrietie and chastitie the more vertuous they are the greater impression of griefe doe these vices make in them
and this leadeth vs to that which is proper vnto god in this contempt doth aggrauate the same for there is an undefined span alphabet in coram oculis tuis before thy eyes and thy eyes implie three properties that are peculiar vnto god
for his eyes are

most piercing

most pure
most powerfull

most piercing
a man that breaketh wedlocke saith the sonne of sirach saith thus in his heart

who seeth me am compassed about with darknesse the walles couer me what need feare such a man onely feareth the eyes of men and knoweth not that the eyes of the lord are ten thousand times brighter then the sunne beholding all the waies of men and considering the most secret parts he knew all things or ere they were created so also after they

were perfected he looked vpon them all

dauid hath made a whole psalme concerning this peircing eye of god saint paul comprehendeth it in few words all thinges are naked before his eyes

and herein standeth the prerogatiue of gods eye aboue mans man can see onely the face god looketh on the heart man beholdeth the operation

god the verie intention of the worke
so that though dauid committed this sinne in secret carried the matter as he thought very cunningly yet was god too sharpe sighted for him by nathan brought to light what hee thought was hid in darkenesse and in vaine shall we affect these couerts we can neuer be out of gods sight

the second prerogatiue of gods eye is that it is most pure it can abide no iniquitie such as bee wicked cannot stand in his sight
the best of men are compast with infirmities and though they bee not as bad as others yet it is possible they may be and this possibilitie may hold them in from being so censorious as otherwise they would they that brought the adulteresse to christ

when christ bid him of them which was without sinn to cast the first stone at her slunke away one by one and their owne guilt checked the forwardnesse of their iudgement but god is as farre from the possibilitie as from the act of sinne and therefore may his holinesse make him more free in the abhorring of sinners

the last prerogatiue is the powerfulnesse of gods eye for it is the eye of a iudge the iudge of all the world a iudge which is armed as well with power as right to take vengeance euen of the greatest monarches in the world put the case that all king dauids subiects had beene priuie to his fall yet had they no right to call him to an account but god could doe what they could not his eye was undefined span alphabet an eye that could take vengeance and chastise the king according to his deserts

lay now together all these prerogatiues of gods eyes and see how they exaggerate king dauids conte~pt
it was great immodestie to sin before the eye in that it was so piercing an eye not to feare a witnes that was so through a witnes from whom he could not conceale any part of his fact nor the least circumstance that did cloath his fact greater immodestie to sinne before so pure an eye from which he could expect no extenuation of his fault because it was free from all communion in corruption it must needs as fully abhorre as it did throughly discerne the fault but the greatest immodestie was the sinning before so powerfull an eye the eye of his lawgiuer before whom he was to appeare and from whom he was to expect his doome to be carelesse of such an eye must needs bee the hight of contempt for whom will hee regard that regardeth not his iudge such a iudge that hath so piercing so pure so powerfull eyes

the eyes of the iudge doe exaggerate the contempt so doth the enormitie of the sinne also for it is not onely malum but hoc malum
sinnes are of diuers degrees some of ignorance some of infirmitie these men daily commit before the eyes of god and they ought daily to repent of them because they testifie their neglect of gods eyes but there are sinnes of a higher straine which men co~mit with a high hand the diuines call them peccata vastantia conscientiam they argue that undefined span alphabet

is fallen asleepe and so is undefined span alphabet too when wee vse neither the directiue principles before hand nor the correctiue after hand but as wee shewed our selues gracelesse in committing sinne so shew we our selues senslesse in not iudging our selues for sinne
king dauid seemed not to be farre from such a case and therefore hee had good reason to exaggerate his contempt by calling his sinne not onely malum but hoc malum not only euill but this euill so exasperating euill before so sacred eyes

and indeed the lesse excuse wee haue for sinne the more we should deplore it deplore that we make that the obiect of gods eyes which hee so much detesteth especially seeing hee hath vouchsafed to bee so gracious vnto vs as to make vs the delightsome obiect of his eyes for his children are as the apple of his eye

though all the world bee before him yet his contenting obiect is his church the walles of ierusalem are euer in his sight and hee beholds his israel as the seale on his arme and signet on his right hand
certainly the delight that god desireth to take in beholding vs when wee doe well doth much aggrauate our contempt when wee are not respectiue of his priuitie to our couersation whensoeuer we offend him

but conclude
out of all that which you haue heard the lesson that we must learne is religiously to amplifie our sinnes from the circumstance of the person against whom they are bent
secondly wee must obserue how many wayes the euill done on earth reflecteth vpon heauen
thirdly how much the presence of heauen on earth adds vnto sinne especially if it bee a crying sinne
fourthly we must learne that our sinnes offend the more the more neere wee are ioyned vnto god
finally none should more insist vpon these points then they that taste deeply of the mercie of god the more they are indebted for his fauours the more should they bee afflicted with godly sorrow when wittingly and willingly they offend before his eyes
god grant that the reference that we and those with whom wee liue haue to god and the presence that god hath continually with vs both may make vs as sensible as wee ought to be of the impietie that is so naturall to all sinne making it reach as high as from earth to heauen and arguing the small regard that sinfull man hath of his righteous god so may this sense worke in vs such repentance as may finde mercie with him who onely can forgiue sinne and that stroke of iustice which for the wrong done to him and the contempt of him whom wee offend besides and aboue our neighbours may iustly bee feared by vs and may wofully destroy vs amen

epigraph

psal
the latter part of the
vers
that thou mightest bee iustified when thou speakest and bee cleare when thou iudgest

king dauid confessing the sinne which himselfe committed openeth vnto vs the naturall properties that are therein and the supernaturall euent that followed thereupon
of the naturall properties you haue heard heretofore
come now vnto the supernaturall euent
the supernaturall euent then is the praise of the iustice of god
the iustice of god here touched is twofold fidelity and integrity
fidelity is iustitia in verbo a persons being as good as his word
integritie is iustitia in facto the vprightnes of his doome god hath the praise of both of fidelity for he is iustified when he speaketh of integritie for he is cleare when he iudgeth
this is the praise of gods iustice and this praise in reference to king dauids sinne call a supernaturall euent
an euent because it floweth not from and yet it followeth vpon the sinne but this euent is supernaturall because it must be a diuine prouidence that must make these figs to grow from those thistles and so cleare light to shine out of so grosse darknesse
these are the contents whereof shall now entreat wherefore will now resume them that may open them more fully and you more profitably heare them
iustice then is the argument of these words
god that is soueraigne aboue all dealeth with all according to an euen rule the rule is well squared and being well squared is applied well also fortune or chance haue no place in his gouerment whether hee contract with or take an accompt of the sonnes of men vpright reason and euennesse are the properties of his actions and all things serue to commend them they are the vpshot of all his prouidence as will appeare in the more distinct vnfolding of these words
the first branch then of iustice here remembred is fidelitie
fidelitie as told you is iustitia in verbo gods being as good as his word we must then find out first what word is heere meant and you shall read it
sam

where god sendeth by nathan a comfortable message a message that containes manifold and those gracious promises for it concerneth a crowne and the entaile thereof read it at your leasure but in your reading marke that the message is verbum mysticum mixtum
it is a mysticall word for it consisteth of a type and a truth the type was dauid and his posterity the truth was christ and his church saint paul hath taught vs so to vnderstand it heb
where he applieth the very words of nathan vnto our sauiour christ

as it is verbum mysticum so is it verbum mixtum also the message is a temper of the law and the gospel yet so that the gospell hath the vpper hand of the law god will not haue his presume and therefore hee vseth the law as a curbe to hold them in but hee will lesse haue them to despaire the gospell serueth to keepe them in heart
this is the word and god will euer be as good as his word his fidelitie warranteth as much

fidelitie is a compound vertue it consisteth of veritie and constancie first there is verity in it no word in the tongue that commeth not from the heart and the tongue is a true looking glasse of the heart for god speaketh in veritate mentis without all simulation or dissimulation without all equiuocation or mentall reseruation whensoeuer god speaketh his speech is true
and as he speaketh in veritate mentis so doth he in certitudine veritatis also

his word is as stable as it is true his promises are not nay and amen all are amen that come from him god is not like man that he should lie

nor the son of man that he should repent but his promisses are without repentance heauen and earth shall passe but his word shall neuer passe he will neuer lye against his owne truth and therefore is he in the reuelation stiled

the faithfull and true witnesse
fidelitie then there is in gods word which is the first branch of iustice

the second is integritie integritie told you is iustitia in facto when iust deeds are squared by iust wordes
the deed heere is iudging and this word must lead vs to another chapter the
of the
of sam
where the same nathan commeth vnto dauid with a second message a message that containeth a performance of that which god promised in the former message hee promised that if he did sinne hee should smart and there hee maketh him smart hee promised that hee should not so smart but hee should haue good proofe of gods greater mercie and there he feeleth it in the absolution from his sinne
so that gods deeds in iudging keepe good correspondencie with his wordes therefore is integritie ascribed vnto them for what is the integrity of a iudge but the true temper of seuerity and mercy if god be iudge the gracious mixture of the law and the gospel where both these are put in practice and put in practice as they ought there is integrity so much is wanting of integritie as is wanting of these if seuerity bee administred without mercy or if mercy haue not the vpper hand of seuerity there wanteth integritie in the gouerment of the because he is commanded of god so to temper his iudgement
and god may seeme to come short of his integritie if hee did not mixe and mixe so his law with his gospell as he himselfe being otherwise free hath by promise laid a tie vpon himselfe
hee couenanted with dauid to administer the law vnto him and chastise his sinnes but citra condignum with the rod of a man and not of god he couenanted with him to administer vnto him the gospell but vltra condignum not after the manner of men but after the manner of god
thus to administer both law and gospell so to dispence mercy and seuerity is gods clearing himselfe in iudgement called it his integritie

ioyne these now together promissionem et praestationem the
and the
of the
of sam whereof one containeth the promising word the other the performing iudgement and couple the integrity of the performance with the fidelity of the promise and you haue an excellent picture or representation of the iustice wherewith god doth gouerne his church

now this iustice must haue its praise
as god is iust in speaking so must hee bee iustified as hee is cleare in iudging so must hee be clarified that may so say that is glorified
these two verbes doe not import that the creature can infuse any perfection into the creator will wee nill wee these things are in him fidelitie is inseperable from his wordes and integrity from his iudgements all that can be done by vs is cognitio recognitio we are bound to take notice of them and not to smother our knowledge but yeeld god the glory that is due vnto them
to this end doth god manifest his perfections vnto the reasonable creature and in their owne cases doe they feele and see in other mens cases the experience of them

saint paul seemeth to read the latter part of the text otherwise then here is exprest for hee hath

that thou mightest ouercome when thou art iudged whereas heere it is that thou mightest be cleare when thou iudgest
they are not words of a contrary meaning but saint pauls text which followeth the septuagint doth adde an obseruation ouer and aboue that which you haue heard that is though god be iudge of all the world yet worldly men sticke not to take vpon them to iudge god yea and god is pleased to put his iustice vpon tryall as wee read esay
micah
and elsewhere so carefull is hee that not onely his proceedings be iust but his iustice euident also so euident as that whosoeuer shall contend with him in iudgement shall bee driuen to yeeld
the best haue oftentimes doubts and disputes they question gods integritie how the gospell and the law can stand together and god at the same time condemne and absolue and yet bee iust god would settle their consciences vnbeleeuers not onely quarrell with but deny also gods integritie but the mouthes of all gainsayers shall bee stopped they shall bee forced to subscribe to confesse that god is cleare in iudging free from all drosse of contradiction that mercy and truth may kisse each other and the law goe hand in hand with the gospell as after appeares
and so haue declared vnto you the praise of gods iustice

come now to shew you the reference that it hath vnto dauids sin which that may the better do you must obserue that the former words against thee against thee onely haue sinned and done this euill in thy sight may be vnderstood either materialiter or formaliter as a description of sinne or a supplication of a sinner
some vnderstand them after the latter fashion and so king dauid non not at finem peccati sed precationis hee noteth not the end of his sinning but the end of his praying non dicit quo fine fecerit malum sed quo fine nunc faciat bonum hee doth not shew vs whereat he aymed when he sinned but what he desireth now heeprayeth
hee desireth that as in amplifying of his sinne hee doth

by a comparison amplifie gods iustice for contraria iuxta posita magis elucescunt vertue neuer shineth more gloriously then when vice is made a foile vnto it so his recouery may bee a monument of gods mercy
and we may well propose vnto our selues in our confession the setting forth of gods glory and this may be the end of it yea comfortles were our confession if it were not for this end god would not accept it neither should wee haue good of it the more we humble our selues to magnifie god the more wee doe our duty and the more wee shall tast of his mercy
to make good this sense some take in some of the former words acknowledge my sinnes yea goe backe as farre as the beginning of the psalme haue mercy vpon me lord
and indeed those two must concurre the humble repentance of a sinner and the gracious indulgence of a good god that god may be iustified in his sayings and cleare when he his iudged lord saith gregorie if thou doe not forgiue the penitent thou wilt haue none to whom thon mayst performe thy couenant ruffinus and diuers other fathers doe amplifie this sense and restraine it to the particular case of king danid as if the gracious promise in the of the the
of sam must needs fall to the ground if the indulgence specified in the of the
of sam
had not released the forfeiture which god might haue taken for king dauids sinne

though this be a religious and a true sense of the word yet hath saint paul taught vs another that doth better fit the contexture

wherefore saint chrysostome and other fathers tell vs that the particle vt noteth not causam but consecutionem not the end but the euent of sin called it a supernaturall euent

an euent is that which followeth vpon a former thing accidentally though naturally it cannot flow from it
sinne is destructiue of good and therefore cannot aduance the prayse of god wee see it in euery particular for what are they but breaches of that law in the performance where of standeth gods honour but what neede vse any proofe the last sabaoth day shewed you that impiety is one of the natural properties of sinne it cannot be expected then that so great a good should naturally spring therfrom as is the the praise of god
therefore though old impure hereticks and the latter familists that turne the grace of god into wantonnesse that vse christian liberty as a cloake of their maliciousnesse that hold let vs doe ill that good may come thereof blaspheme gods holy truth

and their condemnation is iust no man may pretend a good intent for his doing ill nor compasse a good end by ill meanes except he meane to goe for a libertine

but though gods prayse doe not naturally flow from sinne and so be the proper end thereof yet an euent it may bee and follow thereupon
but this euent cannot be naturall for the creature that is mutable may ruine it selfe of it selfe and of it selfe dishonor god but hauing ruined it selfe and dishonored him it cannot of it selfe repaire either its owne state or his honour it is onely god can doe this this is a worke of diuine prouidence it doth exercise al the branches therof gods wisdome to contriue it gods goodnes to affect it and finally it cannot be effected

without his power
the mixture of the law and the gospell is such a secret of gods wisdome as could neuer haue entred into the heart of a creature that the fall of man should be foelix culpa produce a more glorious raising of him who could euer haue dreamd or to keepe my selfe to my text may not we all stand amazed when we read that such a son as solomon should be born of bathsheba with whom dauid had committed so foule an offence but as we must admire gods wisdome in such works so must we much more his goodnes that testifieth his loue to sinfull man in being willing that his wisdome shall yeeld such remedy to mans distresse
but god is pleased to let the world see in the freedom of his loue quod dare non dignis res mage digna deo such goodnes can be found no where out of god
finally the power of god shined herein which was to encounter with so many difficulties we hold god omnipote~t because he made heauen earth of nothing but the fathers hold that the restitution is a greater worke then the creation if the former need an omnipotent power much more the later
the reason is because as there was nothing to help so there was nothing to hinder in the creation but in the restitution god was encountred ab intra ab extra fro within and from without
from within by his own iustice he was faine to ouermaster it with his mercy from without by the powers of darknes who stroue to keep possession of man yea by mans own peruersenes who is too willingly a slaue to sin satan

but of satans temptation we may vse the words of ioseph to his brethren vos cogitastis malè deus autem bene
ye thought euill against vs but god meant it vnto good and concerning our owne peruersenes wee may vse the words of the psalme as a father pitieth his children

so the lord pitieth vs marke the reason for he knoweth our frailty he remembreth that we are but dust
it is god only god that can cause such euents

and miserable were the state of the world if he did not cause them for else the church had long since come to nothing
how quickly had adam dissolued the couenant and when god had restored it by such a supernaturall euent the sonnes of god dissolued it againe god was faine to redouble the euentin noah in his posterity it fayled the third time and a third time was god faine to renew the euent in abraham
and thus hath it gon on in all ages of the world god hath bin faine to shew that the infidelity of man cannot euacuate the fidelity of god that hee will be true though all the world be liars

that hee can draw light out of darkenesse when darkenesse hath extinguished light
such is his omniscient wisedome and omnipotent goodnesse
the ground of all which proceeding is the freedome of gods loue that had no cause without him when it first began it is continued by no cause besides himselfe for those duties the performance whereof doe seeme to entertaine gods loue what are they but the influences of his free grace

wherefore conclude with saint bernard maior est dei pietas quam quaeuis iniquitas or rather with gods own words ego deus et non mutor am the lord which change not

therefore you sonnes of iacob are not consumed it is of the lords morcy that we are not consumed

because his compassions faile not they are renewed euery morning great is thy faithfulnesse the

same god that told noah

will not againe curse the ground for mans sake and giueth this for a reason for the imagination of mans heart is euill from his youth doth implie that we must seeke for the cause of this strange euent not on earth but in heauen wee must hold it to bee not an earthly but an heauenly euent and so to be not naturall but supernaturall as at first told you
and this refutes all manichees who dreame of two gods a good and a bad and will haue the good only to intermeddle with things that are good and the bad with the things that are bad but here we may learne that there is but one god and that one god is good though good yet intermedling with that which is bad intermedling with it out of bad to draw that which is good and so to make it matter of his glory for malum non quâ malum sed quâ ordinatum as saint austin teacheth cedit in gloriam dei

and so haue opened vnto you the meaning of this text so farre as finde it in this psalme that is in hypothesi applied to king dauids case
and there is no doubt but king dauid in speaking of them had an eye to himselfe and in reference to himselfe did penitentially vtter them
but saint paul hath taught vs in the epistle to the romans to turne this hypothesis into a thesis

and apply this text to the whole church
and indeed if you remember that told you that the speaking here meant is verbum mysticum though the letter immediately note dauid and his posteritie yet in them the holy ghost representeth christ and his church here can be no question but the promise that in christ is made to the church hath a temper of the law the gospell the church in all ages doth experience the truth thereof

wherefore we must take the text vnto our selues and make vse of it in our owne case we haue no more promised then dauid had nor shall we feele lesse then he did as his so ours both verbum iudicium promise and performance are mixt of the law and the gospell but so that the gospell hath the vpper hand of the law deus vincit malum bono god doth euer ouer come euill with good
non ex merito peccati sed ex beneficio misericordiae non ex dignitate nostra sed dignatione suâ not that sinne deserueth this at his hands but god is pleased to shew the goodnesse of his nature and to be gracious vnto vs when we carrie our selues gracelesly towards him
and indeed it argueth wonderfull goodnes when it is vouchsafed to such as are so vnworthy thereof
the vse of all that you haue heard serueth first to direct our faith vnto its true obiect which told you is verbum mixtum we must so apprehend a mercifull god as that we forget not that hee is iust and so remember that he is iust that we forget not that he is mercifull we cannot omit eyther of these but we shall either presume or despaire if wee forget him to be iust we will bee apt to presume and bee apt to despaire if we forget him to be mercifull

but we must add a cautionarie rule in this limitation of the obiect of our faith and that is wee must not apprehend gods mercy and his iustice as coordinata but as subordinata speake not of them as these things are in god for so they are more then coordinata they are in his

simple nature all one but as they shine in the effects which are produced by him for so they are alwaies subordinate
in those that are vasaira we may perceiue that mercy is subordinate to iustice for the fauours that they receiue out of gods mercy through their abuse of them serue but to set a sharper edge vpon the sword of gods iustice
but in those that are vasa misericordiae the iustice of god is subordinate vnto his mercy and his strokes on them worke such a godly sorrow and good amendment that gods mercies are thereby redoubled vpon them
thus must wee learne to conceiue of the true obiect of our faith

and our faith so informed will add sinnewes to our hope for what better support can our hope haue then verbu mixtum to conceiue that god will not suffer vs to runne wild though our nature bee luxuriant but will timely vse the law and represse the breaking forth of sinne and correct what is awrie within vs
and when wee smart is it not a comfortable support of hope that god cannot forget to bee mercifull nor shut vp his louing kindnesse for euer in displeasure he will supple that wound with oyle which he scoureth with wine and the sweetnes of the gospell timely administred shall make vs forget all the sowernes that we felt in the law
finally as this text serueth to direct our faith support our hope so doth it to inflame our loue for can there bee a greater motiue vnto loue then this mixtum verbum for therein we haue reall proofe of gods loue therein we finde that hee loueth vs verè though seuerè though with correction yet to saluation and can wee doe lesse then requite loue with loue loue him dutifully that loueth vs so mercifully neither are we only taught that we must loue god but how we must loue our neighbour also our charitie to our brother must imitate gods charity towards vs wee must ioyne therein the law with the gospell first humble then comfort them that goe astray so shall wee neither cherish sinne nor yet destroy a sinner

and if wee haue the like proofe of this verbum mixtum as king danid had we must giue glory vnto god as dauid did
there is none of vs but sinneth and expecteth fauour let vs not bee libertines and make gods fauour the end of our sinne as it is to bee feared ouer many doe but let vs repent and when we repent let vs admire and adore that diuine prouidence that with a spirituall indignation doth breake the serpents head that bruised our heele and tread satan vnder our feete that made vs tread awry let vs consider the reason why the hainousnesse of our sinne doth not depriue vs of heauen which is onely this that god will be good vnto vs for his owne name sake

because he hath chosen vs to bee his children and therefore let vs say not vnto vs lord not vnto vs

but vnto thy name giue the prayse

in a word let gods dealing with vs teach vs how we should deale with others wee must doe them good notwithstanding they deserue euill let vs not suffer our selues to be ouercome with euill

but ouercome euill with good

epigraph

psal
verse

behold was shapen in iniquitie and in sinne did my mother conceiue mee

the sinne which king dauid confesseth in this psalme is partly that which himselfe committed partly that which he inherited from his parents of that which himselfe committed haue already spoken whrefore must now come on and open vnto you that which he inherited
it is exprest in these words which now haue read vnto you here king dauid doth acknowledge and plead it hee acknowledgeth
what this sinne is and
that himselfe is taynted with it hee pleades it in great humility the strongest motiue to worke gods pitty
these poynts offer themselues in this text and of these will now speake briefely and in their order
beginne at his acknowledgement whereof the first branch teacheth vs what sinne inherited is

but before open it vnto you may not omit a good obseruation of gregorie the great which sheweth vs how this point of confessing sin inherited

springeth from the confession of other sinnes which our selues haue contracted saepe dùm quaedam malè gesta plangimus ipsa amaritudinis ad discutiendos nos excitati alia nobis plangenda inuenimus
he that is seriously penitent for one sinne is rowsed by godly sorrow to make a farther inquirie into himselfe which leades him to a discouerie of many other sinnes which his memorie or his conscience passed by vnregarded but whereof hee then becomes so sensible that he thinkes the worthy to be repented of heartily certainely dauid did so he is not only pressed and burthened with the conscience of adulterie and of his murder but he is pained also with an old disease a disease which hee brought from his parents loines and cannot be quiet except he be eased of that except that be healed also
and our euill deeds when wee bethinke our selues of them wil discouer their fountaine which is our euill nature neither haue we sufficiently searched into our selues vntill wee finde the euill tree that beareth euill fruite the root of bitternes that fructifieth in all our euill deeds
this we must obserue by the way as a fit preface shewing the reason of this branch of king dauids confession
let vs now come closer to the text and see what this sinne is which he acknowledged and that is a natiue corruption iniquitie wherein man is shapen sinne wherein his mother conceiues him

that you may the better conceiue this must first remember you of certaine grounded truthes which giue light hereunto without which it cannot be easily conceiued
the first is that in the creation god put this difference betweene angels and men that angels had their seuerall creations not so men but as saint paul teacheth acts

god of one blood made all the nations of men that were vpon all the face of the whole earth he would haue them all propagated from one
secondly as all mankind is deriued from one so with that one god was pleased to enter into a couenant for all and all were liable vnto and to communicate in that which befell that one this is cleare in the comparison which saint paul maketh betweene the first and second adam
rom
thirdly the first adam failed in his obedience so forfeited that which was couenanted on gods part was subiect vnto that which was deserued on his owne no man can doubt of this that reades the third of genesis
fourthly by the tenour of the couenant man failing wrapt all his posterity in his transgression and condemnation

the apostle is cleare for this also by one man sin entred into the world and death by sin so that by the fall all mankind becomes first guiltie then punishable both these euils doth adam communicate vnto his posteritie
must open the latter branch a little farther because it is most proper to my text

the punishment then of adams guilt was the losse of holinesse and happinesse holinesse wherein and happinesse whereunto hee was created in the losse of holines stands so much of original sin as my text doth occasion me to speake of
the fathers vse to expresse it by the parable of the man that passing fro ierusalem to iericho fell amongst theeues

who robbed him and wounding him left him halfe dead the schooles abridge it thus supernaturalia sunt ablata naturalia sunt corrupta both which being discreetly vnderstood containe a sound truth which expresse more plainely thus
the losse of concreated holinesse consisteth in a priuation and a deprauation adam was depriued of the image of god according to which hee was created they call it vsually original righteousnes and the powers that remained after he was thus stript were miserably peruerted he became not only auerse from god but aduerse to him also

sinne is an auersion from god and a conuersion to the world or a forsaking of god and things eternall to imbrace the world and things temporall
god left adam in the hands of his owne councell to chuse whether hee would follow rationem superiorem or inferiorem as the schooles speake that is cleaue to god or to the world but with this condition that which way soeuer hee bent thither should his inclination bee for euer after he preferred earth before heauen and so his propension hath been euer since out of loue of this earth to make head against god and goodnesse so that his deprauation is not only physicall but morall not only an impotency vnto good but an opposition to it also his vnderstanding is not only blind but a sophister his owne iudgement is a snare whereby he entangleth himselfe in error his will is so farre from making a good choice

that it commands alwaies for that which is worst all his affections distast and abhorre the good which they cannot rellish and therefore not ensue finally the flesh is become illecebra peccati sinne needes no other bait then mans senfualitie all the frame of the imaginations of the heart of man are euill only continually from his youth and in his flesh dwelles no good thing the

is deceitfull aboue all things and hee beareth about him a body of sinne and death and this is that massa corruptionis and perditionis that woefull being whereunto sinne brought adam
whereby you may perceiue that though he hath lost his goodnes hee hath not lost his actiuenes and though sinne be non ens a priuation yet it is in ente a dreprauation also by reason wherof men that were reasonable creatures by nature yea and spirituall also

are vouchsafed no better names in the state of corruption then those of undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet sensuall and fleshly men

hauing thus opened the miserable case whereunto adam brought himselfe it wil not be hard for you to vnderstand the words of my text and acknowledge with king dauid the natiue corruption of mankind or the originall sinne meant in this place

first then the want of originall holinesse is in the text called iniquitie or sinne and well may it so bee called for what is sinne but undefined span alphabet an vnconformitie to gods lawes and how vnanswerable is his being herein vnto that state wherein he was made were he only vnanswerable it were sinne how much more when he is opposite thereunto and is become a rebell vnto god can any thing in the reasonable soule be lesse then sinne

that tempts vnto sinne but concupiscence is domesticus hostis a traitour in our bosome that doth seduce vs and whose lusts doe sight against the soule

neither only doth it tempt to sinne but produce sinne also

et simile producit sibi simile wee must needs make the tree euill that beareth such euill fruit
neither can it be excused seeing the leauen of concupiscence hath seasoned all the powers of the soule euen of the reasonable soule and so maketh the whole man come short of fulfilling the law

thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy minde with all thy strength ioyne that generall precept

with the generall prohibition non concupisces thou shalt not lust and by them measure the state of a naturall man and he must be verie senslesse that doth not acknowledge sin in this corruption he must needs make the habits of no other nature then are the actions which proceed therefrom
they that yeeld it to be vitium but not peccatum if they meane vitium morale as they must needs in this argument grant what they deny though they would shift it by acknowledging nothing to bee sinne but that which hath a concurrencie of our will which is too scant a desinition if it be admitted will excuse not only habituall corruption but our ignorances also and omissions from being sinne
but enough of this poynt

a second thing that is to be obserued in the name giuen to this corruption is that it is called sinne in the singular number
and indeed that which is originall is but one euen the first one that was committed by adam only that and the euill of that is propagated to posteritie
the difference betweene the couenant of the creation and the euangelicall couenant stands in this that without any imitation of ours or sinning after the example of adam wee are guiltie of his first transgression and the consequents thereof fall vpon vs whereas hee communicates no other of his sinnes and all other successiue parents vntill the time of our

birth communicate no sinnes of theirs but such as we imitate and make our owne by imitation and in this sense must we vnderstand the
of ezekiel where it is said

that the children shall not beare the iniquitie of their fathers the second commandement must haue the same interpretation although we may not deny that temporally god doth visit the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children to the terror and example of others whom magistrates in their politicke lawes imitate herein for the good of their state therefore that extension of punishment must be vnderstood non absolutè but secundum quid not of originall but of actuall sinnes and those not propagated but imitated

the sinne then is but one but yet that one is such a one as is vniuersall and seminall vniuersall if you looke to the act which adam committed for it was an vniuersall apostasie and the diuines which looke curiously into it doe finde in it all kinde of sinnes both of the first and of the second table
but time will not suffer me to particularize

as it is vniuersall in regard of adams act so in regard of the corrupt habit that followed thereupon and is an expresse image thereof it is seminall it containeth the seede of all kinds of sinne so that there is no kind of sinne whereunto the nature of man is not prone saint iohn reduceth all that is in the world to three heads

the lust of the flesh
the lust of the eyes
the pride of life that is couetousnes voluptuousnes and hautinesse and who is there in whom this seede is not found and from whom doth it not fructisie more or lesse as men haue more or lesse of the grace of god saint paul speaketh significantly when he sayeth that it is undefined span alphabet a sinning sinne

and that operatur omnem concupiscentiam it worketh all kind of lusts in man

and the septuagint whom the vulgar imitates may happily meane the compound nature of this sinne when it rendreth the word in the plurall number which the originall hath in the singular
these properties must be obserued because by them we may stop the mouthes of all profane persons that extenuate the greiuousnesse of originall sinne

as that which hath befallen our nature by adams fall may iustly bee called sinne so is this sinne fitly called natiue or originall for as the text teacheth man is shapen therein and therein doth his mother conceiue him it is such a sinne as wee deriue from our parents
but our parents are of two sorts earthly and heauenly wee haue our being principally from god so saith iob vnto him thy hands haue made mee

and fashioned me together round about thou hast powred me out as milke crudled me like cheese thou hast cloathed me with skin and flesh and fenced me with benes and sinewes thou hast granted me life

david obserues the very same psal
and psal
lo saith hee children are an heritage of the lord and the fru of the wombe is his reward but concupiscence is not of that father for all that he made was good and only euery good and perfect guift commeth from him therefore must we fetch this from other parents our parents that are below from the wombe that bare vs and the paps that gaue vs sucke the mother is here named and indeed from the woman was the beginning of sinne and in her we all die but not in her only

for the apostle tells vs that by one man sinne came into the world and that man was adam
philosophie teacheth that in generation the man is principium actiuum he is the principall cause of our being and therefore of our being corrupted and indeed the woman could not conceiue which is a passiue action except a man did infuse the seede therefore is he implied in this text though he be not exprest

and as wee receitie from both our parents our being so doe wee our being corrupt

what saint bernard sayd of adam and eue is true prius peremptores quàm parentes they had first murdered before they ingendered their children and what of successiue generations ambrose ante vsuram lucis originis excipimus iniuriam et antequam nascimur maculamur contagio our parents beget children after their owne image

dead in sinne and by nature children of wrath
and how can it bee otherwise

the seed whereof wee are made is corruptible seede so that that which is borne of flesh must needs bee flesh neither can any man draw that which is cleane

out of a nature which is vncleane therefore seeing old adam is propagated in all all must bee called transgessors from their youth

but there is a curious question how this sinne is conueyed from the parents to the child from the dayes of pelagius it hath much troubled the church argued by the fathers by the schoolemen by the reformed diuines yet so as that the most iudicious haue beene most sober and least aduenturous to define the manner
will not trouble you with that altercation saint austine hath said enough for the pulpit in those few words the propagation is continued iusto but occulto dei indicio god in so punishing hath done no more then he threatned in the couenant although how he doth execute this iudgement hee is not pleased to reueale but leaueth men rather to adore such secrets then to prie too farre into them especially if their curiositie proue so vaine as to denie that which is euident because they cannot finde out that which is hidden as hereticks haue done which haue denied originall sinne
their sobrietie is tolerable who supposing the vndeniable truth of that radicall sinne seeke only the waies of clearing gods iustice in this propagation wherein as in such darke and doubtfull cases it often falls out saluà fide holding the fundamentall point they differ about that which is not necessarie vnto saluation

that which is most vsefull for vs is to know rather how we may be rid of it

then how we doe contract it which saint austin expresseth in a fit parable of a man fallen into a ditch to whom hee that findeth him there should rather lende a hand to helpe him out then tire him with inquiries how he came in wee see that our ground is ouergrowne with briars thornes yet we know that god made the earth to beare better fruits doe good husbands mispend their time in reasoning how they came there or doe they not rather with their plough and other instruments seeke to rid them thence surely they doe and we in the case of our soules should imitate them so doing
that originall sinne is in vs no man can doubt that seeth how children die euen

in their mothers wombe or so soone as they come out of it and the wages of sinne is death in them of actuall it cannot be

it must bee then of originall if they liue wee make hast to baptize them and what doth baptisme implie but that they need a new birth vnto life seeing their first was no better then a birth vnto death add hereunto that our sauiour christs conception had not needed to be by the holy ghost if so bee naturall generation did not enforce necessarily the propagation of originall sinne which they should consider that magnifie ouer much the conception of the blessed mother of christ
let it suffice vs that the church catholique of old and the reformed churches haue resolued vniformly that we are sinners so soone as we begin to bee and this leprosie is hereditarie to vs all that our worser part hath gotten the vpper hand of our better and we are by nature no better then a masse of corruption and the serpents brood the sense whereof should make vs all cry out with the apostle wretch that am

who shall deliuer mee from this body of death

king dauid doth not onely confesse that there is such a sinne but also that himselfe is tainted therewith was shapen in iniquitie and in sinne my mother conceiued me
the words must not be wrested some haue mistaken them as if sinne were the cause of generation
that opinion though it bee found in some ancients yet it is so grosse that it is not worth the refuting for we reade gen
multiplie and increase

spoken to mankind before euer adam and eue committed sinne except happily this were their meaning that before the fall the lust of generation was in the power of man to fulfill or restraine it as reason saw fit but after the fall reason became subiect vnto lust and man fulfilled it not when reason would but when lust vrged him and this opinion is not improbable

a second mistake is that dauid should lay the blame of his sinne vpon his parents and taxe their sinfull lusts in the act of generation but besides that he could not conceiue so ill of his vertuous and chast parents this were to make dauid a cham and so to deserue a curse while hee seeketh a pardon for his sinne
the fathers abhorred this sense and obserue that king dauid here speaketh not of the personall sinne of his parents but the naturall which deriued from them he had in himselfe and that he was in the state of sinne before he saw light

but this is strange his parents were members of the church circumcised not onely outwardly which is most certaine but inwardly also which is very probable and if circumcised then discharged from originall sin and in the state of grace how commeth it about then that they should engender children in the state of corruption saint austin answereth briefly parentes non ex principijs nouitatis

sed ex reliquijs vetustatis generant liberos they that are regenerated doe beget children not according to the new adam but according to the old not according to grace but according to nature for grace is personall the corruption is naturall and god will that they shall only communicate their nature and leaue the dispensation of grace vnto himselfe
saint austin

illustrateth it by those who being circumcised begat children vncircumcised and corne which being winnowed from chaffe brings forth eares full of chaffe

and yet notwithstanding a prerogatiue the children of the faithfull haue

which saint paul toucheth at rom
if the roote be holy so are the branches
but this holinesse is in possibilitie rather then in possession and there is a distance betweene naturall generation and spirituall regeneration though by their naturall the children of the faithfull haue a right vnto the blessings of gods couenant yet doe they not partake them but by their new birth which ordinarily they receiue in baptisme

which is therefore called the bath of regeneration
where hence we may gather the truth of saint hieromes saying christiani non nascuntur sed siunt wee may not vainely boast with the iewes we haue abraham to our father

ruffinvs giueth another good note hereof qui ad munditiae locum iam peruenit
he that is in the state of grace must not forget the state of nature if we remember whence we come we shall the better esteeme the estate whereunto we are brought no man can be so proud as to arrogate vnto himselfe the praise of that which he is if hee mind well what without gods grace he was

but king dauid was long before regenerated how comes he now to make mention of originall sinne how comes hee now to lay the blame of his actuall vpon that surely not without good cause
circumcision in the iew as baptisme in the christian did absolue from all the guilt of originall sinne by meanes of iustification and by meanes of sanctification did impaire much of the strength thereof much say but not all there are still in vs reliques of the old man a law in our members rebelling against the law of our mind

the flesh and the lusts therof disobedient to gods law and resisting his spirit
saint paul cals it undefined span alphabet

sinne that cleaues so fast so fast that it cannot be loosed from vs a conceptione ad funus saith saint bernard though we bee working on it and weeding out of it from the beginning to the end of our life
epiphanius hath an excellent resemblance of a getting into a wall

and spreading his rootes therein which well may it bee pruned yet can it not be vtterly kild except the stones bee taken asunder and the wall new built againe euen so is this natiue corruption rooted in vs that vntill our dissolution we shall not be rid of it
the same god that left the canaanites in the to exercise the israelites leaueth also originall sinne in vs thereby to trie how we will serue and obey him vntill death we shall haue some thing which we must alwayes watch resist keepe downe mortifie if we doe not god will humble vs therewith and wee

shall receiue many a foyle thereby dauid had triall hereof and so haue others had also euen all the sonnes of men more or lesse except not ieremie nor iohn the baptist though the aduocates of rome confounding the gifts of edification with the gifts of adoption would priuiledge them from the common condition of the sonnes of adam
but let vs not forget no more then king dauid doth this fountaine of temptation which in those that are of age will neuer bee idle it will find vs worke either of triumph if we get the vpper hand of it or of complaint with saint paul rom
if it proue too hard for vs

you haue heard king dauids acknowledgement
come now in a word to speake of his plea
his plea is for pitie but he maketh the motiue thereunto to be the displaying of his miserie and this he doth in the first word behold wherein he doth not so much informe god as humble himselfe god cannot be ignorant of that which man knowes but he is pleased that man should in his deuotion expresse vnto him how feeling he is and how desirous to bee vnburdened of that which brought him to offend god

but we must obserue that there is a double ecce or behold a carnall or a penitentiall whereof the one extenuates the other aggrauateth the sinne
the carnall mans ecce behold commeth out thus haue done ill what then vitijs nemo sine nascitur what needeth so sharpe a reproofe all men are ill by nature if all what blame deserue wee would detest a debter who by his vnthriftinesse hath brought ineuitable beggerie vpon himselfe or a diseased person that by ryot hath ouerthrowne his body if either of them should bee so senselesse of his woefull case as not to blame himselfe and deplore his state with a longing desire and earnest endeauour to be rid therof
and may we then brooke such apologies of prophane men that haue runne so farre in debt vnto god and haue made themselues such spirituall lazars through sinne farre be it from vs to thinke that dauid did so excuse himselfe to god no but as a discreet patient who throughly had searched into his own disease and desired to bee wholy cured he openeth his sore to the bottome and concealeth nothing from his physician
he that desires to be freed from his actuall but to continue his originall sinne desireth onely to put off one punishment that he might deserue another
but a true penitent desireth so to be forgiuen that he may bee preserued from offending againe
we commend prisoners for their wisdome who knowing they are guiltie more wayes then one desire that all the indictments may bee brought in against them before the verdict passe vpon them that so they may be throughly discharged and hee that arraigneth himselfe before the barre of god should not leaue any thing vnrepented of whereof he knoweth himselfe guiltie nor conceale any part of his miserie that needeth the helpe of gods mercie the rather because wee need not doubt least the multitude of our miseries should tire or ouerburthen gods mercie happily it may bee so with men he that will forgiue seauen will hardly be brought to forgiue seuentie times seauen faults but with god it is farre otherwise in whom the sight of miserie especially

if it bee presented with penitencie the greater it is the more compassion it moues
what a miserable case was adam in euen in that woefull case which haue described vnto you in this text yet no sooner came he into gods sight but god was so moued that he was pardoned before he was doomed and the iust doome was made very tolerable by the mercifull pardon

after god had drowned the old world what moued him to be more tender towards the new

but the pitie that hee tooke vpon this natiue corruption the euill frame of the heart of man excellent is the place of ezekiel where the church is represented weltring in her bloud when no eye did pitie her god said that then was the time of his loue hee said vnto her liue

yea he said vnto her when shee was in her bloud liue ezek
king dauid psal
like as a father pitieth his children so the lord pitieth them that feare him

but marke what a reason he giueth hee knoweth our frame he remembreth that we bee but dust
doth god pitie the miserie of man when there appeareth no penitencie in him and will hee reiect him when it doth appeare no penitencie maketh miserie to pierce more deepely the tender bowels and compassions of god
wherefore let our behold be exprest by the sorrow which we conceiue for our sinfull corruption and wee shall find that nothing can more effectually moue commiseration

but must end
we are at length come to the depth of king dauids ingenuitie and certainely in repentance a man can goe no farther
the first confusion whereunto a penitent sinner may put himselfe is to bring his sinne before the eye of his owne conscience dauid did so vers
the second is to haue it published before men as in the solemne satisfactions made to the church dauid did so as appeares in the title of the psalme
the last is to present it before god to draw gods eyes to behold as well our originall as our actuall sinne
in the first will diminish much of the shame and our communion in the same corruption doth much impaire the second but there is nothing can lessen the third so pure so vnpartiall are the sacred eyes of god so that dauid could not be more humble more could not bee expected vnto a full repentance

saint ambrose vpon this consideration hereof breaketh out into these words quis tanto affectu agit paenitentiam where shall a man finde his parallell suscepit personam generis humani sayth saint austin king dauid spake no more in his owne person then may beseeme the person of euery man especially if he be a christian and therefore his practise should be a patterne vnto euery one of vs we are as hee was si dauid talis rex talibus parentibus in peccato natus quanto magis nos the fountaine of corruption runnes as high now as euer it did well may wee deeme our selues worse better without intolerable arrogancy wee cannot deeme our selues therefore his ecce behold will well beseeme vs and we may well fall as low as he in the confession of our sinnes
presse this the rather because this is a secret which philosophers could not hereticks would not know and so indulgent are we to our selues that we

are too willing to be ignorant of at least to forget that which our proud nature doth not easily brooke
the lesse the old man doth like it the more should the new man studie it
and that we studie it not in vaine let vs all pray god that wee may haue grace to exemplifie so good a sampler that we may so deepely launce our spirituall woundes as that they may be the better cured by our heauenly physitian and the more seuere we are against our selues we may finde our sauiour more mercifull vnto vs amen

psal
vers
behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisedome

dauid in that vow which in this psalme hee maketh for himselfe prayeth that he may bee restored vnto and preserued in the state of grace
to this end hee layeth open his own wickednes and layeth hold vpon gods goodnesse how he layeth open his own wickednesse you haue heard at seuerall times as vnfolded the verses that goe before and you shall god willing heare particularly how he layeth hold vpon the goodnesse of god as shall haue opportunitie to expound vnto you the following verses
but my text commeth in betweene these two maine poynts so that it is hard to say to whether of them it referreth most for surely it may fairely be referred to either of them it may bee referred either to king dauids vnfained repentance for his sinne or steadfast considence in the mercy of god therefore it is diuersly expounded by others and it will not bee amisse if shew you how the words looke backward and forward respect king dauids either godly sorrow or hope of grace
to come to the text the argument of it is remarkeable sinceritie
sincerity is fitly described in these words truth in the inward parts without truth there can be no sinceritie but the truth that maketh perfect sincerity must be in the inward parts
touching this sincerity wee are moreouer taught first of what regard it is secondly how we may attayne it it is of principall regard because entertayned with the best affection that is delight and this affection is in the greatest person it is in god god desireth this truth in the inwards parts

but how may it be had surely not without diuine instruction of our inward man the inward man is noted by the secres part that must be furnished with good grounds which here are meant by wisdome and this wisedome must come from heauen god must make vs know it
these particulars wherein sincerity is set forth in this text are remarkeable

particulars so wee are taught by the first word behold behold they are euident they may not be denied behold they are vsefull euery one must make his profit of them

and so haue set before you the contents of this scripture which shal now farther enlarge as the time shall permit and we may best be edified
but before doe enter vpon the distinct poynts must acquaint you with the language of the holy ghost which vseth often times to mention parts of our bodies when it meaneth the powers of our soules the reason whereof is in vulgar experience because so long as the soule dwelleth in the body the powers therof in their working make some sensible impression vpon the parts of our body those parts which euen for this cause haue by the wisest philosophers and most iudicious physicians been reputed the proper seats if not of the whole soule yet of the seuerall faculties therof my text doth occasion me to instance in two parts the kidneys and the heart which are here to bee vnderstood though in the translation they are not exprest in the originall the kidneys are plainely mentioned which because they are two therefore they are translated parts and those inward or hidden parts because in the body the kidneys are vsually couered with fat
the heart is a single entrall and therefore called by the name of a part also a hidden part because of the couerings wherein it pleased god that naturally the heart should be inwrapt vpon these two parts seuerall powers of our soule doe worke at least when they worke or are wrought there will be some sence thereof in these parts in the kidneys of affections as of resolutions in the heart this euery man that obserues himselfe may easily assure himselfe to be true
hauing thus opened vnto you the reason why the holy ghost thus speaketh let vs now come and looke a little farther into the things by the inward parts then are meant the kidneys and by the kidneys the affections that discouer themselues therein now our affections haue long since by those that haue been curious obseruers of them been reduced vnto foure heads wherof two are exercised with euill and two with good euill if it be absent wee feare and if it be present we grieue as for good that which we haue not we desire and we ioy in that we haue
to apply this to my text told you that it looketh backward and forward to dauids repentance and to his confidence if to repentance then to euill malum culpae the euill of sinne for which hee grieued and malum poenae the wages of sinne which he iustly feared
if to confidence then to good to mercy which so farre as he had receiued hee ioyed in and desired so much as he had not yet receiued these are those inward parts the affections of king dauids soule that are to bee vnderstood in this place in these it is that sincerity must appeare so much is intimated by the word truth

but what is truth surely nothing else but a conformitie of one thing to another whereof the one is the sampler and the other is the exemplification
all that is in mans nature receiued its being from god and was formed according to the patterne of gods eternall decree which hee exprest in the creation and which hee often toucheth at in the reproofes

which taxe the obliquities of our nature we should bee in our affections as god first made vs and that is the first truth required in them a truth that is opposed vnto vanity that vanity which doth dimimish the of our nature and so farre as it doth diminish it of something maketh it nothing for nothing can truly be sayd to be farther then it is partaker of god of the being which he giueth vnto it who only can say am that am

besides the truth that is opposed to vanity there is another which is opposed to hypocrisie and that is the correspondency of our outward actions to our inward affections for as our outward affections must haue their stamp from god so must they endeauour to print their true stampe vpon our actions for as the seede that is sowne in the ground beareth the like seede aboue ground and the fruit is not vnlike the tree no more should it be in our moralities wee should not sustayne one person in our bosome and another in our countenance bee painted sepulchers full of dead mens bones we should be iacobs undefined span alphabet plaine men nathaniels without all guile

for undefined span alphabet saith basil undefined span alphabet saith chrysostome the character of an honest man is to be single minded

single tongued he that hath a heart and a heart a tongue and a tongue hath not truth in his inward parts

this being the nature of sincerity if wee will try the world by it thinke we may iustly breake out in to king dauids complaint in another psalme helpe lord there is not a godly man left veraces defecêrunt a filijs hominum truth is perished from among the sons of men the periuries which are frequent at assizes and sessions

the deceit of citizens which haue denominated deceit it selfe for from them is astutia deriued quia nihil lucrantur nisi admodùm mentiuntur whose thrift is fitly called craft because did they not circumue~r they would come short of much of their wealth
as for statesmen all chronicles do witnesse that they vse the foxes case more frequently then the lions skin and policie is one of the words that is degenerated from a laudable to an infamous signification and is become a synonymon for machiauelisme this is the cause that leagues and contracts though confirmed with neuer so religious bonds are rather snares whereby one state seeketh to intrap another then pledges of their mutuall security
but the quintessence of all falshood is the popish aequiuocation and mentall reseruation then which the diuell neuer hatched a more pestilent fraud to bane societies and desame christian religion
the reason of all these obliquities and aberrations from truth is for that euery man squareth vnto himselfe a measure of his owne but that measure of sincerity which here god hath squared out is euery where neglected the papist hee maketh the catholique cause his measure the politician his greatnesse the citizen his wealth the iurour the preseruing of his customes or pleasuring his friends these and some such like to these cautions and conditions doth the world patch vnto truth without which they will not entertayne it
the way to reforme all is to trie our sincerity by the rule here set down by truth in the inward parts first that truth that is opposed vnto vanitie

for hereby must wee correct our inward affections reduce them to the temper which god first gaue them and keepe them within the bounds which gods law doth set vnto them and when we haue done this then must we come on to the truth that is opposed to let our conuersation be the looking glasse of our affections and let not any thing appeare in the outward man that is not in the inward so shall wee be sincere wee shall haue truth in our inward parts
and let this suffice for the nature of sincerity

such sincerity is of great regard that appeareth first in the affection wherewith it is entertained the affection is desire and desire is a compound affection of louing and wishing for wee cannot desire that which we doe not loue and what wee loue if wee want it for that wee wish so that sincerity is a louely thing and indeed how can it choose but be louelie that holdeth together all societies domesticall politicke ecclesiasticall without which iealousies must needs arise and so destruction follow euery man commits himselfe securely to him in whom he suspecteth no guile as where he doth suspect it hee thinketh himselfe safest when he hath least to doe
secondly as it is louely where it is so where it is not there it is longed for for man being by nature sociable cannot but wish for that qualitie in euery man without which there can be no society therefore those whom otherwise wee hate because wee cannot but haue to doe with them wee wish them all this vertue truth in the inward parts which should make all sorts of persons carefull to nurture those that are committed to their charge parents their children masters their seruants pastors their people magistrates their subiects in this vertue and sharpely to correct their pronenesse to the contrary the world groaneth vnder the mischiefes of falshood yet as if it yeelded no mischiefe euery where may you find a schoole thereof undefined span alphabet euery such master breedeth such a scholar as maketh him a proofe that he hath profited in his art

but the affection only doth not shew the regard it is improued much by the person in whom this affection is found shewed you that sincerity is louely and longed for but it skilleth much who the person is that loueth it and longeth for it for our nature is corrupt and with our nature our affections wee mistake euill for good and we misplace our affections often vpon euill rather then good it is not so with god as hee is so he affecteth he is most holy and such are his desires also what he loueth is louely indeed because he cannot loue amisse and what he longeth for that we want because if we did not want it he could not long for it and indeed he must needs loue sincerity because it is the image of himselfe for he is truth and there is nothing counterfeit either in him or from him yea his truth is the ground of all our faith our hope our charity were it not for that these could haue no ground faith could haue no ground without his truth in promising hope could haue no ground without his truth in performing charity could haue no ground without his truth in louing
therefore there is truth in him and who

what is in him he loueth in others for euery thing delights in his like when god had made all things and beheld that they were good he presently kept a sabaoth which importeth nothing else but the sweet content that he tooke in the worke of his owne hands
if in all things specially in those that did best resemble him and he is resembled in nothing more then in diuine vertue so that sincerity must needs bee exceeding louely in his holy eyes

as it is louely so it is longed for also when it is wanting in our nature
by the fall amongst other endowments this was lost

the sonnes of men are become vanity the sonnes of noble men are but a lie god then beholding them must needs finde wanting what in the creation hee bestowed vpon them and what hee findeth wanting that he desireth may be recouered behold how hee sheweth himselfe as a father that might deale with vs as a iudge what hee might exact hee desireth and desireth as a father the supply of that the want whereof hee might punish as a iudge hee taketh more delight to see vs recouered mercifully then iustly to perish in our sinnes

the words must not be vnderstood exclusiuely hee desireth truth in the inward parts as if he desired it not also in the outward the inward is his peculiar a closet whereinto none can enter but himselfe and as his residence is specially there so doth his eye principally looke into that wee may not thinke that the holinesse that will content the creature will content the creator also when we go about to reforme wee must goe as deepe as gods eye goeth and not thinke that all is well vntill all is well there but when we are prouided for that

wee must let our light shine also before men the outward parts must haue truth in them also god that is the author of societies loues the bands of them also and by commanding the obseruation and commending the obseruers testifieth his good will towards them to the confusion of all equiuocaters that diuorce the inwards from the outwards and care not how much fraud they vse outwardly while they please themselues with a counterfeit truth inwardly wee must entertaine both such a truth in the inward parts as manifesteth it selfe in the outward and giueth good content both to god and man

but marke god that desireth truth in the inward parts commendeth not undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet he doth not bid vs root out our affections but order them aright he calls not for stupidity but simplicitie he wills vs to flie all serpentine wiles but to entertaine a singlenesse of mind undefined span alphabet

vnleauened affections are much set by of god and sincerity is a vertue that yeelds sweet sauour vnto him

finally our repentance our confidence must specially be seasoned with this vertue for vnto them is the text specially applyed
and let this suffice for the regard that is yeelded to sincerity

come now to the meanes by which it may be had and that is by diuine instruction of our heart
the heart is here meant by the hidden part which elsewhere is called the hidden man of the heart why it is called

hidden in some sort told you before as also why it is called a part and not parts the entrall is single and it hath a couering as it appeareth in the anatomizing of our bodies

but by the entrall is meant the vnderstanding the thoughts whereof are knowne onely vnto god they that write of the temple of salomon doe many of them parallel it with our persons which are temples of the holy ghost as that was partly vncouered and partly couered so haue wee an outward and an inward man and as that part of the temple which was couered was partly sanctum and partly sanctum sanctorum so haue we in our inward man a couert seate of our desires which must be holy as you haue hitherto heard and a couert seate of the rule of our desires which must be more holy and that is our heart there doth god reside as in his most holy place and from thence by our conscience giueth order to the whole course of our life

this place or power must be furnished with wisedome the apostle doth teach vs to distinguish betweene the wisedome of this world and the wisedome of god whereof the former is seeming the latter is wisedome indeed this wisedome is nothing but that guiding knowledge wherewith the conscience must be furnished our desires haue no reason of themselues that which they haue they haue by participation of the higher power which is therefore called undefined span alphabet because it is the guide of the inferiour powers now you know the vertue of a guide is wisedome take away wisedome hee will bee but a bad guide a bad did say nay a blinde guide for wisedome is his eye and you know what our sauiour christ saith

the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single the whole body shall be full of light if thine eye bee euill the whole body shall be full of darknesse
this wisedome is nothing else but those good and sound principles of direction which should giue order to our affections which of them should stirre when and how farre did not wisedome giue this order out of a true iudgement past vpon the obiect feare would stirre where hope is called for and we would ioy where wee should grieue but that each affection taketh his proper turne and obserueth its iust measure wee are beholding vnto wisedome

but whence is this wisedome

iob moued the question who hath put wisedome in the inward parts or who hath giuen vnderstanding to the heart hee answereth himselfe fully in the
chapter and the summe of his answere is that god is the giuer thereof the reason may be taken from the nature of wisedome which is answerable to the name thereof

so saith the sonne of syrach undefined span alphabet wisedome is as the name thereof importeth and it is not reuealed vnto many

now it hath its name from tzaphah which signifieth to couer and indeed true wisedome had a double couering in the dayes of king dauid a couering of ceremonies that darkened the things and a couering of infidelity that made most men incapable of them only god could remoue these couerings cleare the mysteries of religion and giue men eyes for to discerne them not that god vseth not the ministery

of men and by men informeth vs of our duties but they can goe no farther then the outward man

cathedram habet in coelo qui docet corda none but our master which is in heauen can open our hearts and worke these good instructions into our consciences this is the tenour of the couenant of grace behold

the day is come saith the lord that shall make a new couenant with the house of israel and with the house of iuda will put my lawes into their inward parts and in their hearts will write them and so saith saint paul

where the spirit of the lord is there is libertie libertie from both the couerings so that men with open face behold the glory of the lord

and indeed who should repaire these guifts when they are forfeited but he to whom they are forfeited the author of nature must bee the author of grace and hee is so abundantly in our sauiour christ for in him are all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge hid

in making him knowne hee maketh true wisedome to bee knowne vnto vs

it is not in vaine that dauid saith thou shalt make me know wisedome for though in gods acts the holy ghost doth indifferently vse all times past present and to come because they are continuall yet it is not amisse to obserue that in this life we cannot haue so much grace but wee still want more therefore wee should not rest in the first fruits of the spirit but bee still hungring and thirsting after righteousnes

and forgetting those things which are behinde bee still pressing forward in wisedome that we may be forward in sincerity

marke that if you lay both these parts together the meanes of getting sincerity to the regard that god yeelds to it it followeth fairely that whatsoeuer in vs pleaseth god is a guift that god bestoweth vpon vs neither indeed can any thing that commeth not from him bee acceptable vnto him so that wee may well pray with saint austin da domiue quodiubes iube quod vis let it bee thy good pleasure lord by grace to enable me and then bee thy commandement what it will it shall most readily be obserued by me

secondly sincerity is not immediately from god hee worketh it by heauenly wisedome neither may wee euer hope to be sincere except wee first be wise if the heart be nor first qualified the reines will not be reformed the world hath yeelded too many smatterers in either of these but because they put asunder what god conioyned they haue beene good in neither our ancestours that liued vnder poperie were good meaning men as they say of them and the church of rome did cherish in them good intentions but good indeed they could not be because they were misguided wee are very inquisitiue after our guide and god be thanked wee haue a good one and happily wee conferre often with him about a good course but here is our fault wee doe but conferre with him commit our selues to his guidance wee doe not wee entertaine not wisedome into the inward part therefore haue our inward parts little truth we are as foolishly wise as our ancestours were falsly sincere it were to bee wished that we would ioyne both as king dauid doth to be wise in the hidden part that so our inward parts

may be true especially when wee make our atonement with god and humble our selues before him if euer then beg wisedome the wisedome of the heart which may wholy order our affections that our repentance and our confidence may both testifie that there is truth in the inward parts

the last thing that obserued is that this sincerity is remarkable wee are taught it in the first word behold which word noteth both veritatem diuinam and vtilitatem nostram the vndoubtednesse of these rules and the vse which we must make of them ecce hoc patens est saith ruffinus this is as cleare as the noone none but those that are blind can denie that god loueth sincerity and that he giueth that wisedome from whence sincerity streams and as no man can doubt it so euery man must make vse of it euery man must desire this sincerity that so he may be acceptable to god euery man must desire to be furnished with wisedome from heauen that he may be furnished with sincerity we are by nature full of vanity and hypocrisie our corruption was displayed in the verse that goeth before but contraria contrarijs illustrantur we cannot so well conceiue how bad we are as if we clearely see how good we should be when we obserue that god requireth truth in our inward parts then may we perceiue how miserable wee are in being conceiued and borne in sinne so the ecce here giueth light to the ecce that goeth before
as this giueth light to that so that must be a whetstone to make vs to affect this
and seeing god taketh all excuse from vs by making vs to know wisedome we must receiue wisedome into its proper seate that from thence it may produce this acceptable worke we must with dauid be able to say ecce behold thou hast made mee to know wisedome in my hidden part that wee may also say ecce behold lord that truth which thou desirest in my inward parts
conclude all behold here the doue and the serpent which christ commends for patterns to his disciples wee must haue the simplicitie of the doue and the wisedome of the serpent hee that can mixe the wisedome of the serpent with the simplicitie of the doue shall neither be sottishly sincere nor deceitfulluy wise
god that searcheth the hearts and reines so qualifie both by his grace that being guided by him wee may be accepted of him accepted for wise sincerity and sincere wisedome in the whole course of our life but specially when we turne to him and turne from sinne with vnfained repentance and assured confidence
amen

psal
vers
purge me with hysope and shall bee cleane washmee and shall bee whiter then snow

king dauid desirous to be restored vnto the state of grace doth first lay open his owne wickednesse sincerely and then doth he sincerely lay hold vpon gods goodnes
of the former you haue hitherto heard and are to heare of the latter hereafter in opening whereof you are to obserue how aptly the remedy doth answer the disease in the disease wee found a double wickednesse one which king dauid committed himselfe another which hee inherited from his parents the remedy cures both it cureth the wickednesse which king dauid committed the malignity the impiety thereof the impiety by expiation in this seuenth verse the malignity by consolation in the eight
as it cureth the wickednesse which himselfe committed so doth it that which he inherited from his parents that was a natiue euill and the remedie doth cure it as it is an euill in the ninth verse by forgiuing and as that euill commeth by nature the remedie cureth it by regeneration as we shall learne verse the tenth

at this time shall handle onely the first branch of the cure the cure of the impiety of that sinne which king dauid himselfe contracted this told you was done by expiation or purification for the better vnderstanding wherof we must guide our selues by a good rule of saint ambrose benè veteris testamenti sacramenta non euacuat et mysteria euangelica praeferenda docet these words are typicall therefore they haue a compound sense a ceremoniall and a morall dauid acknowledgeth both true but withall teacheth in which standeth the greatest comfort the ceremonial was not to be omitted because of gods ordinance but the morall was principally to bee intended because that contained the body whereof the other was but a shadow which must the rather be noted because the holy ghost doth often times taxe the iewes for either wholy diuorcing the morals from the ceremonialls or for that they were at least preposterously zealous preferring the ceremonials before the morals but our rule must bee to obserue whatsoeuer god commands but so that we value euery thing according to the rate which god sets vpon it we are freed from the ceremoniall law of moses yet are we not left altogether without ceremonies for we haue sacraments in participating whereof we must obserue saint ambrose his rule we must not neglect the visible signes wherewith god sustaynes our faith yet must we pierce farther into the inuisible grace and that must be the principall comfort of our soules so likewise in prayer we must fall low with our bodies but much lower with our hearts lift vp our eyes but

soare higher with our affections in a word hoc oportet facere illud non omittere neglect not ceremonies but intend moralities chiefly in all the seruice of god

but whereas told you that the sense of these words is double ceremoniall and morall before can informe you in the morall must first resolue you what is the ceremoniall sense and here wee find not all agreed some finde the ceremonie in the booke of exodus some in leuiticus

some in numbers in exodus we read that the children of israel were commanded to sprinkle their with the blood of the paschall lambe that so when the punishing angel came to destroy the first borne of egypt he might passe by them

chrysostome apprehends that king dauid in these words prayeth against gods wrath and desireth by such a sprinkling to bee sheltered from that and indeed though god forgaue dauids sinne yet did hee by nathan foretell that the sword should neuer depart from his house

therefore well might he deprecate plagues but though wee find mention of hysope in that law yet none of sprinckling the person but the nor finally any mention of purifying but of preseruing

therefore other of the fathers find this ceremony in leuiticus

in the law of clensing the leper and surely the words of my text speaking rather de malo culpae then poenae as appeareth by those phrases shall bee cleane shall be whiter then snow may haue good cognation with that ceremony the rather because the fathers not vnfitly make leprosie a liuely representation of the nature of sin· but in that ceremony though hysop were vsed for clensing of the leper yet the clensing of the leper there was declaratory rather then operatory wherupon hierome doth parallel it with the absolution of the priest who doth not remit sin but declare that it is remitted of god as the priest saith he did not make the leper cleane but vpon examination pronounce him to be cleane

but my text speaketh not of a declaratorie onely but an operatorie purification

wherfore we must seeke farther into the booke of numbers in the
thereof wee shall sinde a ceremonie that exactly sitteth my text sitteth it in the phrase as they that are skild in the originall doe know and sitteth it in the matter as you may perceiue if you reade the chapter there god commandeth the burning of a red cow slaine by the priest

with which was to be burnt scarlet cedar wood and hysop and of the ashes which came hereof and running water was to be made a holy water wherewith hee was to be purisied that touched the dead

a clean person taking hysop dipping it in the water and sprinkling it vpon the vncleane

saint paule to the hebrewes moralizing that ceremonie speaketh thus if the bloud of bulls and goates and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the vnclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the bloud of christ who through the eternall spirit offered himselfe without spot to god purge your consciences from dead works to serue the liuing god out of which words we may learne to giue a true commentary vnto this text and obserue a good correspondency betweene the ceremoniall and the morall part thereof

which that we may the better do obserue that the whole text is a petition wherein wee must obserue first seuerally what king dauid beggeth and of whom then ioyntly how confident hee is of the successe of his petition which he maketh to that person
that which he beggeth is purge wash the person to whom he directeth this petition is god for to him he praieth but he would haue him doe this through christ for christ is meant by hysop

if god grant this request as he doubteth not but that hee will grant it for it is prophetica or atio he prophesieth in praying he then vndoubtedly assures himselfe of a double effect that shall be wrought vpon him innocencie shall be cleane and beautie incomparable beautie shall bee whiter then snow
let vs looke into these particulars and carrie along the ceremoniall with the morall

first then see what he beggeth purge wash but these words presuppose some thing that is not here exprest and that is from what he would be purged and cleansed read the
of numbers there you shall see the ceremonie it was from the impuritie that was contracted from touching the dead and this impurity did exclude them from accesse vnto the tabernacle saint paul heb
teacheth vs the moral of this ceremonie

and that the touching of the dead did figure our intermedling with dead workes that is sinnes for they that are infected with them are sayd ephesians to bee dead in them and our sauiour meaneth as much by the prouerbe let the dead burie their dead

and indeed sinnes are fitly termed dead workes

for they had their originall from him that hath the power of death that is the diuel

and they are in vs the sting of death so venoming our vnderstanding

and our wil that they bereaue vs of the life of god to whom we liue only by the true knowing of him and louing him as we ought finally

the wages of sinne is death and death in sinne bringeth vpon vs death for sinne the spirituall death in this world an euerlasting in the world to come

as hee that hath to doe with sinne hath to doe with death so hee that hath the contagion of death cleauing to him is vnfit for the house of the liuing god for that is the house of the liuing for god by couenant is not the god of the dead but of the liuing

they that are planted in the house of the lord saith the psalmist shall flourish in the courts of our god marke then in what case a sinner is

in the state of death secluded from the liuing skin for skin and all that euer a man hath he will giue for his life though it be but his naturall life which is temporall how much more would be giue for his better life if hee knew it meane his spirituall life which is eternall if it bee a thing desireable to hold our soule in our body how much more desireable is it to enioy god in our soule especially seeing the soule may bee in the body and afflict it with hearts griefe but no soule enioyeth god that is not filled with vnspeakeable ioy

but life is not the vttermost of our desire we are by nature sociable and solitarines is a kind of death it is so if we be only excluded from the

societie of men

how much more if we be debarred the communion of saints king dauids psalmes shew how passionate he was when hee was debarred the visible communion by banishment how much more passionate thinke you was he when he apprehended his exclusion from the inuisible through the deadlinesse of his sinne these things out of the moralized ceremonies must we set before vs as the motiues vnto this petition purge me wash me me that haue lost the comfortable presence of my god the life of my soule and haue contracted the contagion of death by my sinne and for this contagion am vnworthy to haue accesse vnto thy house in the companie of thy saints the loue of that life maketh me abhorre the state of this death the desire that haue to that societie maketh this spirituall excommunication tedious vnto me and giue mee no rest breake my silence make me importune thee god with purge mee wash mee expiate this impurity that hath so wofully distressed me

these two words purge and wash looke to two parts of the ceremony

in the aforenamed
of numbers you shall sinde that hee that had touched the dead was first sprinkled with the holy water and then was to haue his whole body bathed incleane water
these two acts ceremoniall looke to the two parts of spirituall purification in sin there are two things the guilt and the corruption the taking away of the guilt was signified by the aspersion or sprinkling of holy water and the corruption by washing in cleane water

god that hath giuen his law for vs to obey hath added a sanction vnto it to hold vs in that wee should not dare to transgresse for feare of wrath and ordained that a deformity should accompany sinne and make it more odious vnto vs out of the loue that we beare to our selues when wee enter into consideration of our sinne the first thing that we should apprehend is the guilt the danger that we stand in to god ward wee should set him before vs as a seuere iudge armed with vengeance ready to lay on vs deadly strokes this should make vs breake into the first petition purge mee lord free me from guilt let mee stand on good termes with my god
but when wee haue made our peace with him and all is safe from without religious must make vs looke home suruey our selues fixe our eyes vpon our soules and take care to remedy the blemishes thereof deformity in our outward man wee cannot endure would we could endure it as little in our inward wee desire the exactest proportion the fairest complexion and where nature faileth wee helpe it by art and thinke no paines too great no cost too deare that is bestowed that way our better part deserueth the greater regard by how much wee should desire more to recommend our selues to the eyes of god and angels then to the eyes of mortall men yea to the eyes of our owne soules rather then to the eyes of our bodyes for that these are truer iudges and iudges of the best things certainly king dauid thought so who knowing that sinne carrieth with it not only a guilt but a staine also prayed no lesse wash me then purge me free mee god both from staine and guilt

but the consequence must not be forgotten the staine and the guilt themselues desire this fauour were there no euill beyond them how much more when as shewed you in the ceremonie they are necessarily accompanied with an excommunication so that purge me and wash me must imply a desire of restitution also a restitution into the church and into the communion of saints a blessing that followed vpon king dauids person being purified from his guilt and staine and king dauid must bee thought to haue correspondently to the law aymed at that blessing

and let this suffice touching that for which king dauid prayeth
come now to consider the person of whom hee beggeth it in his prayer
the person is god for it is to him to whom hee directs the whole psalme and indeed none but god can doe this that hee prayeth for for who can free from guilt but hee to whom a sinner stands obliged by his guilt hee that set the sanction to the law must quit vs from the danger that is due from that sanction and who is that but god and as god onely can purge the guilt so hee onely can wash away the staine hee onely that made vs can new make vs and hee reformeth man to his image that first made him after his image this is the worke only of god

but see here is a limitation of gods power hee would haue god to purge him but doe it with hysop as if without hysop hee could not doe it shall say god forbid hee can doe more then wee can conceiue they are too presumptuous that set such bounds vnto god

that is a most absolute lord no doubt hee might haue saued vs otherwise then he did this wee may boldly say hee would not doe it without hysop and his will is that which doth menage his power what he hath freely decreed out of his good will that hee bringeth to passe by his vnresistable power hee spake the word and made vs but he was pleased that the redeeming of vs should cost him more paines hee would vse the helpe of hysop

hysop is literally vnderstood in the ceremonie so wee finde it in that often cited
of numbers but spiritually by hysop the fathers vnderstand christ and make a correspondencie betweene him and that herbe in two respects in regard of the smalnes of the herbe and in regard of the vertue thereof the smalnes representing christs humility that vouchsafed to take vpon him the forme of a seruant the vertue noting christs efficacie for as that herbe worketh vpon our inwards

so saith saint austin doth christ worke vpon the inward man

hysop worketh principally vpon the lungs say the fathers which are the bellowes of our body and are an excellent embleme of pride and it was pride wherby we lifted our selues vp against god that christ came to cure with his humility when he stooped vnto the ignominious death of the crosse

but it was not hysop alone wherewith hee desired to be purged but hysop dipt in the holy water and this doth intimate yet more fully that

the expiation was to be made by christ for to say nothing that the red cow slaine whose blood was sprinkled directly before the tabernacle was as all other sacrifices a type of christ those things that are principally to be marked in christ were most liucly represented in the things that were burnt with the cowe for there were to bee cast in cedar wood hysop and scarlet the cedar is the highest of all trees and well representeth the deity of christ

hysop in the history of solomons knowledge in naturall things is opposed vnto the cedar as the lowest of plants and may well note christs manhood the scarlet is an excellent representation of his bloody death according to that in the prophet esay

who is this that commeth from edom with died garments from bozra wherefore art thou red in thy apparell
and indeed christs blood is the bath of purification it clenseth from all our sinnes if wee haue our hearts sprinkled therewith wee shall bee free from euill consciences

our consciences shall bee freed from dead workes to serue the liuing god
finally his spirit is that fountaine that is opened vnto the house of israel

and the cleane waters that in ezekiel god promised to poure vpon his church without christ the vertue of his death and worke of his spirit god purifieth no man
the heathen had their aquam lustralem their holy water and so hath the church of rome also but the heathen holy water had no respect vnto christs blood the romish would seeme to haue but sanctifying ceremonies without gods warrant are fruitles not only so but spirituall vsurpations if we expect purification from sinne wee must tye our selues vnto christs death and not looke to partake the benefit of it but by such meanes as are ordained of god

for the spirit breatheth where it will not where wee will so that in vaine shall we serue god if therein wee follow no better guide then the commandements of men
and let this suffice touching the person to whom king dauid directs his prayer

hauing thus seuerally considered what king danid begs and of whom by ioyning the points together wee must see with what confidence hee expects the successe of his prayer
the first point of confidence is implyed in the words purge wash for the original hath it thou shalt purge thou shalt wash
and indeed such future tenses are propheticall wishes and why faith in prayer hath an eye to gods promise and therefore a hope of his performance

and why god cannot deny himselfe hee euer will be as good as his word numbers hee commands the carnall purifying and promiseth the successe and shall hee deny successe vnto the spirituall if wee obserue it certainly hee will not

a second branch of considence appeareth in the resolute affirmations shall bee cleane shall bee whiter then snow which import that as god will bee constant in keeping his word so hee will bee powerfull in accomplishing the deed no doubt of the effect when hee is pleased to bee the efficient

a cleane person saith the ceremonie shall purge him that is vncleane and hee shall bee purified and who so cleane as god in comparison of whom the best of his

creatures are vncleane if the carnall purification may be expected from a mortall man how much more may we expect the spirituall from our immortall god

but marke here is not onely expected a freedome from sinne but also a furniture of grace not only innocency spirituall but beauty also so saith dauid shall be cleane that is innocent yea shall be white that is beautifull parum est mundari a sordibus peccatorum

nisi contingat decorari candore virtutum it is a cold comfort to bee freed from impurity except wee be beautified with sanctitie but where sinne abounded

grace abounded much more sinne stripped vs of our originall righteousnes and wounded vs in our naturall power and grace doth not only heale vs againe but restore vs also to whatsoeuer we lost
the same god that in the law commanded that when a captiue israelite was set free he should not goe away empty

but be furnished liberally with whatsoeuer god had blest his master is not fast handed towards vs when hee freeth vs from the death of sinne but adornes vs as beseemes the spouse of christ

white is the colour of saints

it appeares in the transfiguration of christ and in the apparitions of angels in the reuelation of saint iohn more then once as likewise in daniel so that that phrase implyeth that the effect of christs purifying is not onely grace but glory also yea vnspeakable glory so the comparison will haue vs vnderstand it when dauid saith that he shall be whiter then
it was a gracious promise that was made psal
though yee haue hen amongst the pots

yet shall ye be as the wings of a doue couered with siluer and her feathers with yellow gold yea when the almighty scattered kings for his church shee was as white as snow in salmon here dauid goeth a step farther

whiter then snow and indeed well may wee resemble spirituall things by corporall and eternall by temporall for that the one doth somewhat resemble the other but equall them we cannot we may not by reason of the many degrees wherby the corporall is exceeded by the spirituall and the temporall by the eternall

conclude who can say haue made my heart cleane am free from sin

no man for habet cor vniuscuius{que saith austin in his confessions quod offendat oculos dominisscio fateor there is not the best of vs that hath not touched the dead that is not infected with dead works it beseemeth the best of vs to say with austin scio fateor know acknowledge it but we must go on with austin quis mundabit who shall make me cleane and resolue with him cui alteri praeter te domine clamabo ab occultis munda me domine

lord haue none to whom may hopefully call but to thee lord clense me from my secret faults or in the words of my text purge me with hysop and shall be cleane wash me and shall bee whiter then snow
amen

god grant we may all so wash our garments white in the blood of the lamb during these dayes of grace that we may hereafter walk with him in white robes when we shal be receiued into the state of glory
amen

epigraph

psal
vers make me to heare ioye and gladnesse that the bones which thou hast broken may reioyce

in the desire which king dauid expresseth of being restored to the state of grace haue told you more then once that he layeth open his owne wickednesse and layeth hold vpon gods goodnesse
hauing at seuerall times sufficiently shewed you how he performed the former began the last time to open the later vnto you
the first thing that then obserued was that the medicine doth point for point answere the disease the disease was of double wickednesse one king diuid committed himselfe another hee inherited from his parents
shewed you that here was a cure of both
in the sinne which himselfe committed we found malignitie and impietie it vexed king dauid and offended god each of these hath his proper cure the sinne as offensiue vnto god is cured by expiation of that you heard the last time as it is afflictiue of king dauids person it is cured by consolation and of that you must heare at this time

but before we enter vpon the text marke the method of the holy ghost consider how the cures are digested the expiation of sinne must goe before the consolation of a sinner and why sinne had neuer beene afflictiue if it had not beene offensiue we then began to bee in distresse with the guilt of conscience when we displeased god by breaking his law therefore if we be not first at one with god we must neuer looke to be at one with our selues

learne it of saint paul being iustisied by faith we haue peace with god and else where more fully the kingdome of god is righteousnesse peace and ioy in the holy ghost it beginneth at righteousnesse which is all one with the expiation of sinne then vpon righteousnesse followeth peace and ioy in the holy ghost and what are these but that consolation whereof shall now intreate onely giue you this note by the way that when so euer you shall neede the like cure you neglect not this sacred order that you tender not your owne case before you haue atained gods fauour such preposterousnesse will cause that your spirituall physicke will neuer sort a wished effect
but let vs come to the text

told you it containeth a cure of the malignitie of sinne of the malignitie of sinne we haue here set downe the power and the author the power it breaketh a sinners bones the author of this power is god so saith the text the bones which thou host broken the cure is restoratiue comfort comfort noted by two words ioy and gladnesse that is internall and externall comfort and such comfort is restoratiue for it will make euen broken bones for to reioyce

but whence commeth this comfort and what hope is there of it surely it commeth from god dauid beggeth it of him make mee to heare of ioy and gladnesse marke euery word is significant the meanes by which we receiue it is the eare but god conueieth it by the eare yea the capacitie of our hearing is the gift of god all these three things are contained in these words make me to heare

as god is the giuer of it so there is no doubt but hee will bestow it the phrase imports as much and so doth the contexture for though in my text it bee read as a petition make me to heare yet in the originall which our vulgar reading psalmes doe follow it is a plaine assertion thou shalt make me to heare adde hereunto the contexture the inference of the cure vpon the application of the remedie make me to heare of ioy and gladnesse what will follow the bones which thou hast broken shall reioyce
you heare whereof must speake pray god that may so speake that you may heare and learne the meanes of true consolation in the distresses of your soules
the first thing then to be obserued is the power of the disease the malignitie of sinne and that is the breaking of a sinners bones the bones are but a part of the body but they are vsed here to note the whole and well they may in this case for if they faile the rest cannot continue the bones are the pillars as it were and foundation of the other parts the ligaments are fastned to them the muscles the entrals the skinne all are borne vp by them
adde hereunto that they being of the strongest substance that which can crush them cannot bee resisted by any other part well then may the bones signifie the whole body and the breaking of the bones the consumption of the whole
but what the wound is in the soule how commeth the disease then to be in the body surely there is euident reason for it the body of it selfe is but a lumpe of earth the life and vigour that it hath it receiueth from the soule and according to the influence of the soule is the health and strength that appeareth in the body take a similitude from the sunne and the earth the earth a huge globe made to be the nurserie of varietie of plants beasts birds while the sunne shineth comfortably vpon it how cheerefully doe all things looke how well doe they prooue and prosper but remoue the sunne from it as in winter or eclipse the beames thereof how squalid is the face of the earth how doe all things euen languish as it were and die euen so fareth it betweene our soules and our bodies our bodies are in good liking they are if they bee cherished by our soules but if our soules neglect them then they grow and droope

and how can they but neglect them when the distresses of a guiltie conscience haue seized vpon the roote of life that is the heart if that once be cast into a spirituall melancholy it groweth senselesse and carelesse of all other imployment and if the soule wither at the roote how should the branches flourish how should any facultie performe its proper worke when the heart that is the common director strengthner

of the rest giueth ouer her worke they that have seene any conflicting with this passion might easily obserue how neither food nor friends nor family nor children nor any thing that either nature or reason doth endeare are any thing regarded by them but feeding vpon that pyning humour they seeme to take no content but in their disconrent and spend all their thoughts in complayning of this fretting and consuming humour
read king dauids penitentials if any where you shall there see the picture of such a languishing person especially in the
psalme where expressing his disease sinne in the fourth verse hee amplysieth the power thereof working vpon his body there is no soundnesse in my flesh there is no rest in my bones my wounds stinke and are corrupt am wearie am bowed downe greatly you may read the rest at your leasure

and it is worth you reading that you may clearely see the truth of that saying of salomon a wounded spirit who can beare what body can choose but languish that is possest by a languishing soule a man cannot be so wounded in the inward man but you may read it plainely in the outward

the fathers doe allegorize the phrase and by the bones vnderstand vertues vertues that are to the soule as bones to the body for a man as hee is a reasonable creature doth subsist in them euen as the body is borne vp by the bones as it is a liuing creature the cardinall vertues the theologicall are our supporters those as we are men these as wee are christian men
the conscience of sinne shiuers these figuratiue bones also for looke vpon a man distressed by a guiltie conscience what prudence in him that can giue no good counsell to himselfe and as for iustice he cannot haue that for he is vnsociable his temperance is to starue himselfe and his fortitude to sinke vnder his griefe there is not a cardinall vertue that hath place in him as a man and as a christian man theologicall vertues haue as little place hee maketh no vse of his faith to sustaine himselfe with the promises of god his hope is heartlesse for he forecasts onely fearefull things and little sense hath he either of gods loue to him or his loue to god
not one of these bones continueth sound all of them sinke and are crusht vnder the burthen of sinne
a pitifull case and yet such is the case of euery one that secleth the worme of conscience of euery one that is stricken with the sting of that serpent

but whence hath sin this power who giueth this wounding strength to sinne surely god the text saith so tufregisti thou hast broken my bones

and so in the
psalme thy arrowes sticke fast in me thy hand presseth me sore

it is true that god vseth meanes our conscience within vs and satan without vs to afflict vs for sinne but both worke vpon his command and according to the measure which he prescribes touching conscience

saint austins rule is very true iussisti domine factum est vt omnis anima inordinata sibi ipsi esset paena god to hold vs in from sinne hath placed in vs a conscience whose office amongst other things is this to torture vs for sinne and as for satan we see in iob that hee is

but gods executioner and stirreth not but when and as farre as hee hath leaue leaue giuen vnto him of god but whether it be conscience or satan that which they harrow vs with is the arraigning of vs before gods tribunall setting him forth in the dreadfull maiestie of a iudge and amplifying our vilenesse that cannot denie the indictment that is brought against vs these be the engines wherewith they set vpon vs this is the painefull racke wherewith they torture vs

and no wonder if such a spectacle distresse them who are guiltie of some sinne that hath distressed the most religious seruants of god

esay saw god sitting vpon his throne of iudgement high and lifted vp his traine filled the temple
then said he woe is me for am vndone because am a man of vncleane lips and dwell in the midst of a people of vncleane lips for mine eyes haue seene the king the lord of hosts
habakkuk had the like vision and what saith he when heard

my belly trembled my lips quincred at the voice rottennesse entred into my bones

daniel that is called vir desideriorum when a vision was presented vnto him being in the companie of others obserueth that a great quaking fell vpon them and they fled to hide themselues as for himselfe hee saith that his comelinesse was turned in him into corruption and that he had no strength in himselfe
moses that had his prerogatiue to talke with god face to face yet when god appeared in his maiestie to deliuer the law when he beheld the flaming fire heard the sound of the trumpet and felt the earth trembling vnder him saint paul hath obserued heb
that he said exceedingly feare and quake but what doe instance in these our sauiour christ who knew no sinne but yet put on such affections as belong to a sinner when our sinne was imputed vnto him presenting himselfe in the garden before god and apprehending his maiestie armed with vengeance to repay the sinnes of the world how was he afflicted into what an agonie was hee cast the gospell doth tell vs that hee sweate great drops of bloud if the prophets if moses which were not priuie to themselues of any enormous sinne if christ himselfe that was free from all sinne was so affected and distressed at the sight of gods iudgements if their bones were so broken how shall they be ground into pouder that come before him laden with enormous with crying sinnes

if the righteous scarcely be saued where shall the vngodly and sinner appeare surely when god with rebukes doth correct such men for their iniquitie hee shall make their beautie to consume away like a moth

they shall be like the withered grasse when he consumes them in his anger
as smoake is driuen away before the wind and as waxe melteth before the fire so shall the wicked perish at the presence of the lord

and thus much of the punishing power of sinne what it is whence wherein you may behold two things most liuely set forth before vs the true nature of griefe and the cause that it hath such a nature
the philosophers teach that dolor is solutio continui the renting in sunder of that whose content stands in vnion and the breaking of bones what is it but a rent the soule denyeth succour to the body the parts of the body each denieth his seruice to the other yea the powers of the soule grow strangers

betweene themselues and vertue it selfe is bereft of vertue he cannot want woe thathath such a distraction in his little

griefe there is then

and that hath a cause saint austin shall tell you what it is fluendo deserit amatore suum corpus quia ille hoc amando deseruit deum your bones are broken and you are payned therewith will you know why the body breaketh with the soule because the soule first brake with god if your soule doe rend it selfe from god by sinne it shall find litle rest in that house of clay whereon it doteth this will make hast to returne to dust when our better part giueth it selfe ouer vnto vanity
and let this suffice touching the disease

let vs now come on vnto the cure
that is exprest in two words ioy and gladnesse although the words may note one the selfesame thing yet may we not vnsitly distinguish the remedie as we did the disease the broken bones were vnderstood properly and figuratiuely properly for the languishing of the body figuratiuely for the languishing of the soule this being the cause whereof that is the effect or that being as it were the redundancy of this
seeing then the medicine must be of the same extent with the disease we must finde in it a comfort for the soule and a comfort for the body the comfort of the soule noted by ioy and the comfort of the body noted by gladnesse so that the whole comfort must make vp iubilum which as gregorie the great noteth in his moralls is such a chearefulnesse as taking roote in the soule doth manifest it selfe in the body and the light of the countenance doth argue the peace that is in the conscience

but saint austin vpon the gospell of saint iohn hath taught vs to distinguish of ioy there is gandium veritatis and vanitatis a true and a false ioy ioy of it selfe is nothing else but the content that euery part of our body and power of our soule taketh in the obiect that was made for to please it as the eye hath ioy in colours the eare in sounds the palate in meates if these bee proportioned to the temper of the sense so fareth it with the powers of our soule but sinne hath distempered vs within and without and we can rellish no better then we can discerne wee doe as ill rellish true ioy and sorrow as wee doe distinguish good and euill therefore that we mistake not our cure we must take heed that we doe not mistake ioy and gladnesse gaudium vanitatis for gaudium veritatis false for true ioy that you may distinguish the one from the other will shew you three markes wherby they may be discerned true ioy is first purum it is affected with nothing but that which is good that which is euil should properly be the obiect of sorow therfore all that delight in drunkennesse adultery blasphemie or any other sinne though they seeme to haue ioy yet indeed it is no true ioy for it is

but as the crackling of thornes as salomon speaketh or as iob like poyson sweete in the mouth that killeth so soone as euer it commeth into the maw of such christ saith in the gospell woe be to you that reioyce for you shall weepe
the second marke of true ioy is that it is solidum it spendeth not it selfe vpon toyes but vpon that which is of worth wee obserue it as a difference betweene children and those that are of riper

eares that children value things as they affect those that are of riper discretion value them as they are a child will preferre an apple before a iewell and we sinile at it but how many of vs doe more glory in fantasticall fashions then we doe in the greatest vertues but we shall bee driuen in the end to write vpon them vanity of vanity all is but vanity yea those toyes will helpe to breake our bones for they will proue vexation of spirit and why they want the second property of ioy there is no solidnesse in them
the third property of true ioy is that it is perpetuum it resteth not vpon that which is transitory which may be taken from vs or we from it that is a deceitfull ioy the rich man was told so

who said vnto his soule soule be merry eate and drinke thou hast goods for many yeeres but hee heard thou foole this night shall they take thy soule from thee and then whose shall these things be

wherefore wee must prouide our selues bagges which waxe not old a treasure in heauen that fadeth not where no thiefe approacheth neither moth corrupteth where such treasures are there let our hearts bee also
but all this while haue but distinguished true ioy from false haue not shewed you what this medicinall ioy is

est gaudium saith saint austin quod non datur impijs sed ijs qui te gratis colunt there is a ioy whereof the wicked neuer partake it belongeth only to them that are thy faithfull seruants and what is that horum gaudium tu ipse es they haue no ioy but thee and they thinke their liues most blessed when they ioy in thee and for thee

but how can a man that is a sinfull man come to haue god for his ioy surely in christ and by christ so saith the angel to the shepheards

behold bring you tidings of great ioy which shall be vnto all people for vnto you is borne a sauiour which is the lord christ
in the prophet esay

christ speaketh thus the spirit of the lord is vpon me because hee hath anointed me to preach good tidings vnto the meeke hee hath sent mee to bind vp the broken hearted to proclaime liberty to the captiues to giue vnto them that mourne in sion beauty for ashes the oyle of ioy for mourning

and elsewhere speaking of christs birth they shall ioy before thee according to the ioy in haruest and as men reioyce when they diuide the spoile
and indeed hee that knoweth the case of one and bound in fetters like a slaue cannot deny but the newes of liberty the newes of plenty must needs bee good newes ioyfull newes vnto him and such is the newes of saluation by christ when we heare son be of good cheere

thy sins are forgiuen thee when christs spirit beareth witnesse to our spirit that we are the children of god wee must needs embrace these blessings with exceeding ioy as in samaria there was great ioy so will there be in any city where this saluation commeth to sinfull men

you haue heard what is the disease and what is the cure you must heare whence it commeth not from earth but from heauen
it is vsuall with too many when the worme of conscience biteth them and they smart from that inuisible sting to sort themselues with iouiall company by them to driue away melancholly and to charme this serpent with variety of sensuall delights but little doe they thinke that these

are medici nihili

physitians of no worth as iob speaketh and that when they returne to themselues againe and looke againe into themselues they shall find that the worme hath crept in farther and biteth more smartly the sting gets faster hold and paineth more grieuously and no maruell for may a man expect to be cured by that which caused his disease or shall he not rather be the worse the more he applieth that physicke

there is none but god that can create light and darknesse good and euill that can wound and heale kill and make aliue againe therefore if in so desperate a case we desire to haue recouerie wee must repaire to him and none but he must be our physitian

he cureth but how per auditum by the eare
wee haue two rationall senses and contentions haue beene made about their precedencie the bookes that are giuen vs to studie will easily resolue the doubt they are gods workes and his words if the sight of his workes might haue recouered vs we should not haue needed the preaching of his word but the infirmitie of the former is argued by the supply of the later and whatsoeuer philosophie thinkes diuinitie must hold that wee are beholding much more to our eare then to our eye for sauing wisedome when name the eare meane the bodily the enthusiasts haue an eare but it is onely for gods spirit but we must haue an eare for gods ministers for ordinarily god dispenseth not the comforter but by their ministerie

and this is the highest commendation of sacred orders and that which must worke the greatest reuerence of the people towards them for that god conueieth heauenly treasure by these earthen vessels

and into their hands hath put the power of the keyes yea to their tongues hath he in a maner tyed the efficacie of his word they bind and loose mens soules they open and shut vnto them the king dome of heauen

they doe it did say rather god doth it by them so are we taught by my text god must make dauid to heare it is not enough that god send his word and great be the number of preachers god must breath also with his spirit

and when paul hath planted and apollo watered he must giue the increase

if god doe not then open the heart as hee did lidia's we may be no better then francis spera whose bones being broken with the conscience of his sinne he could not be cured because the many exhortations that were giuen vnto him by the words of men could haue no entrance into his heart there wanted there the spirit of grace therefore we must with dauid begge that god would make vs heare

but hasten to the last point you haue heard who giues the physicke you must heare what hope there is that dauids petition will succeed there appeareth good hope good hope in the phrase for it is not onely supplicatorie but assertorie
obserued the like vpon the former verse will not repeate it
but there appeareth more hope in the contexture for there dauid is confident that the medicine shall not bee applyed in vaine the bones that thou hast broken shall reioyce so it is in the originall marke an excellent difference betweene gods children and others reprobates in such a case optare possunt sperare non possunt they may wish themselues in a better case but they cannot hope for better but the children

of god when their bodies are euen brought to the graue and their soules to the gates of hell yet will they trust in god and trust to see the louing kindnesse of god in the land of the liuing
we doe not belieue that the sunne hath lost his light though the skye be with clouds

neither will we thinke that god hath forgotten to be gracious euen when hee layeth deadly strokes vpon vs

the chaldee paraphrase obserues not onely a reall ioy of the broken bones but a vocall also not onely shall our soules be comforted and our bodies with our soules but out of the sense hereof wee shall breake forth into the praises of god we shall praise our god with ioyfull lips
finally marke the method the sorrow of the inward man casteth the outward into a consumption so likewise the outward shall partake of consolation if so be consolation by the eare be distild into the inward caro vt cor no lesse the flesh then the spirit being quickned shall reioyce in the liuing god

conclude all as we are all subiect vnto sinne so are we not free from the distresses of conscience
when we are put to it let vs heare what the lord will say for he will speake peace vnto our soules if our sorrow be godly let vs not be without hope blessed are they that mourne so for they shall be comforted let vs rest assured that though wee sow in teares yet we shall reape in ioy the lord will turne our captiuitie

he will sill our mouthes with laughter and our tongues with songs
amen

vers
hide thy face from my sinnes and blot out all mine iniquities

the remedie that king dauid sought in this penitentiall was answerable to his distresse that which distrest him was sinne whereof the onely remedie is grace
the sinne as you haue oftentimes heard was two fold first that which himselfe committed and secondly that which hee inherited from his parents he seekes a remedy for both in grace
you haue heard that it yeeldeth a remedy for the sinne which himselfe committed for the impietie thereof by expiation and by consolation for the malignitie that is therein
it followth that now you heare of the remedy which grace doth yeeld to the sinne which he inherited from his parents that is a natiue euill we commonly call it originall sinne grace cureth this partly by forgiuing and partly by regenerating forgiuing of the sinne and regenerating of the sinner
these two points are commonly knowne by the names the first of iustification the second of sanctification of sanctification by regenerating our sinfull nature you shall heare in the next verse on this verse must speake of iustification from by forgiuenesse of originall sinne

to come to the breaking vp of the text there is something therein implyed and something exprest that which is implyed is gods prouidence that which is exprest is gods indulgence of gods prouidence we haue here intimated two acts his eye seeth all things and all things are recorded by his hand
did hee not see all things it were needlesse to pray hide thy face and it were as needlesse to pray blot out were not all things recorded by his hand such prayers must needes presuppose those workes

besides this prouidence of god so implyed the text will teach vs the indulgence of god which is here fairely exprest for the better vnderstanding whereof will open vnto you first the suite that king dauid maketh for it and then the possibilitie that there is of his obtaining it
in the suite wee shall see how answerable his desire is vnto gods worke gods worke is to see and record and his desire is that hee would not see hide thy face that he would cancell blot out
but in the prayer we must marke to what
how farre he would haue his desire extend
to what not to his person but to his sinnes hide thy face not from me but from my sinnes blot out not mee but mine iniquities hee restraineth then gods acts to their proper obiect
but hauing so restrained them he inlargeth their worke vpon that obiect to the vtter most he excepts no sin but would haue them all pluckt vp by the rootes hide thy face from my sinnes blot out all mine iniquities
this is king dauids suite a hard suite you may oubt whether it can be granted you may doubt whether such indulgence may stand with the diuine prouidence how he that seeth all can hide his face from any thing and how he can blot out any thing that keepeth a record of all must therefore in the last place shew you the possibilitie which king dauid hath of obtayning his desire shew you that such indulgence doth not preiudice gods prouidence and gods prouidence not hinder such indulgence
you haue the particulars which are contained in this text which will now farther vnfold pray god it may be to our edification

but before enter vpon the particulars must giue some light vnto the phrases which are darke because figuratiue and may if they bee taken as they sound
whereas then here is mention made of a face wee may not conceiue that god hath a body made of flesh and bloud they were long since condemned for hereticks that did so grossely mistake the scripture god in such phrases by a resemblance informeth vs as far as we are capable of his incomparable essence
consider then the vse of our face it is the instrument of knowledge therein are the senses placed of seeing hearing smelling but yet though they appeare there we must not impute the sense vnto the body but vnto the soule that quickens the body philosophie teacheth that anima est quae videt quae audit and there is sensible proofe of it when the soule is departed from the body though there be an eye left and an eare yet there is neither seeing nor hearing whereupon it followeth that the

vertue of seeing and hearing is in the soule these are the faculties of a spirit so that god may haue them though hee haue properly no face hee may haue that which is signified by the face the power of discerning things

a second vse that is made of the face is that it serueth for a lookingglasse wherein to behold our affections this vse followeth vpon the former for that which wee apprehend outwardly by our senses doth inwardly content or discontent the euidence of either you may reade in our countenance if it content we looke vpon it cheerefully and turne from it wrathfully if it discontent hereupon it commeth to passe that the face is vsed to note sometimes gods fauour and sometimes his anger according as that which is presented before him doth please or else displease
out of both these vses of the face applyed vnto god we must learne that there is no perfection in man which is not in god that beflowed it vpon man but wee must conceiue it in god as it beseemeth god according to the vncompoundednesse and infinitenesse of his nature
the second phrase of blotting out which presupposeth a booke wherein things are written is also a phrase borrowed from men whose brittle memory maketh them haue recourse to such helpes least otherwise many of their affaires should either be forgotten by them or denyed by others the booke supplies both these defects and what is entred there serueth our owne memory and resolueth the doubts of others we haue proofe hereof in our oeconomicks no good husband which taketh not this course at home and in the politicks there is no well aduised state that is without a register and maketh not vse of annals and iournals
to apply this
god is master of his house the church the world is his kingdome wherein hee reignes wee may happily thinke that though hee seeth all yet he may forget much to refute so vaine a dreame the scripture doth remember his booke not meaning that his memory wanteth a helpe but that it is as firme as ours is with such a helpe yea much more firme for our helpes are as much subiect to casualty as our selues are but gods booke is nothing but himselfe and himselfe is no more lasting then is his record we must therfore sublime our thoughts when wee thinke of gods booke and fancy nothing which is not diuine

but leaue the phrase and come to the matter told you that gods prouidence intimated by these two phrases consisteth of these two acts the first is omnia nouit hee hath an vbiquitary eye all things as saint paul speaketh are naked before his eyes elihu in iob

his eyes are vpon the wayes of man and hee seeeth all his goings there is no darkenesse nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselues

king dauid hath made a whole psalme wherein hee sheweth how vaine a thing it is for a man to seeke a hiding place from god

the sonne of syrach in few words the eyes of the lord are ten thousand times brighter then the sun beholding all the wayes of men and considering the most secret parts he knew all things ere euer they were created and when they were created hee looked

vpon them

therefore doth god in esay cry out against them that take counsell but not of him and that couer with a couering but not of his spirit and it is not without cause obserued as a great folly in our first father adam that hee thought a thicket of trees would hide him from god
the same discase is inherited by his posterity wee may gather it out of the phrase

wherein the holy ghost describes sinnes calling them workes of darkenesse because as christ telleth vs qui male agit odit lucem adulterers and theiues choose darkenesse when they will fulfill their lusts and they that are drunken saith the apostle are drunken in the night but silly wretches while they thinke no eye seeth them the eyes of god are vpon them

and hee is priuy to their most inward thoughts for night is to him as the day and darkenesse is as the cleare light
this is the first worke of prouidence omnia nouit hee knoweth all things

the second is omnia notat he maketh a record of all things that is implied in the book

often mention is made therof in the psalms in daniel in ezekiel in the reuelation and the platonists mundus intelligibilis and idaeaes seeme to import the very same but that which principally obserue is that god doth not see things as if they did not concerne him but as salomon speaketh his try the sonnes of men and hee pondereth all their pathes yea hee doth make a record of them whether they bee good or bad

of the good you haue an excellent place malach
chap
when the atheist had blasphemed then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and there was a booke of remembrance written before him for them that feared the lord and thought vpon his name
and that the bad pathes of men are also recorded

wee read deut
where god hauing reckoned vp diuers enormous sinnes speaketh passionately thus is not this laid vp in store with mee and sealed vp amongst my treasures he alludeth to the manner of kings whose records were kept in their as you may gather out of ezra

where the roles are said to bee kept where the treasures were laid vp in babylon

the vse of this note is made by the wise man

beware of murmuring which is vnprofitable refraine from backbiting we may adde from all manner of sin for there is no word so secret that shall goe for nought yea inquisition shall be made into the very thoughts of the vngodly
god keepeth an exact record of all

these two acts of gods prouidence refute two athiesticall positions the first is their tush

god seeth not is there vnderstanding in the highest eliphaz in iob expresseth it most elegantly how doth god know can hee iudge through the darke clouds thicke clouds are a couering to him that hee seeth not hee walketh in the circuit of heauen so would they put out but cannot that eye which they blaspheme
the second position refuted is tush god careth not suppose that he seeth yet he careth not for the things below he leaueth euery man to shift for himselfe and they think that the memory of their liues doth not their breath they feare no reckoning so they blaspheme gods hand we shall doe well by acknowledgement of these two branches of gods prouidence

to auoid these two rockes whereat many old feare me new atheists also doe dayly suffer shipwracke

hauing thus farre opened vnto you what is implyed in my text come now to open that which is exprest therein told you it is indulgence and touching it obserued first the suit that is made for it wherin you may see that dauid doth make the branches of his petition answerable to the branches of gods prouidence the first branch thereof is god seeth all and answerably to that doth king dauid pray that god would hide his face and no maruell for god is a god of pure eyes

as habakuk speaketh and can abide no iniquity therefore in whomsoeuer there is the conscience of sinne there must needs arise feare and shame when such a party is presented before god feare for his eyes are as flames of fire and sinners are but as dry stubble moses in a penitentiall representation of the calamity of the israelites in the wildernesse

layeth this for the ground of it thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sinnes in the light of thy countenance and in ieremy thus speaketh the god of israel mine eyes are vpon all their wayes they are not hid from my face neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes what followeth will recompence their iniquity and their sinne double because they haue defiled my land reade the like amos cap


the lord hath sworne by the excellencie of iacob
and the imprecation against iudas is fearefull

let the iniquitie of his fathers bee remembred of the lord

as feare so also shame ariseth wee learne it of the same prophet ieremy by whom the lord saith thus vnto israel

thy sinne is marked before mee hee addeth as the thiefe is ashamed when hee is found so is the house of israel ashamed and indeed shame is an inseparable companion of the conscience of sin when it is arraigned before a iudge wee see how malefactors hang downe their heads and children blush when they are taken in a fault seeing then there is such feare such shame that ariseth from our guiltinesse appearing before gods eyes we cannot wonder that dauid in his first desire doth deprecate the first act of gods prouidence and would haue him hide is face that so hee might stand boldly and cheerefully before god

his second desire respects the second act of gods prouidence deus notat omnia god keepeth a record of all dauid therefore desireth that god would raze his booke
to open this desire wee must obserue that in the scripture there is mention made of foure bookes which keepe the records of finne
the first is gods memory that is the most exact booke all things with all their circumstances are precisely set downe therein it is the expresse image of his omnisciencie of that booke haue said enough before

lest the truth of that booke should be questioned god hath prouided three other bookes that are without exception which will iustifie his record against the most wrangling sinner
the first is our owne conscience which shall accuse or excuse in the day when god shall iudge the secrets of men by iesus christ
it is of this booke that ieremy speaketh

the

sinne of iuda is written with a pen of iron

and with the point of a diamond it is grauen vpon the table of their heart by the heart meaning the conscience

as saint iohn doth where withall he aduertiseth vs that this record in our bosome beareth witnesse to the record that is in heauen if saith he our heart condemne vs god is greater then our heart and knoweth all things but god is not contented with one witnesse he hath a second and him without exception also that is our bodies and soules they euerie one retaine the staine of sinne when the act is past and gone and from this staine euery part and power receiues a new name our throates are called open sepulchres

our lips poysonous aspes our eyes are said to bee full of adulterie our hands bloudie our feete mischieuous our vnderstanding darknesse our will peruersnesse finally our affections nothing else but impuritie
a sinfull man is a spirituall lazar and the leprosie wherwith he shall appeare will vndeniably proue what a life he hath led
to these two god adds yet a third witnesse and that is a third record the creatures which we abuse in sinning shall beare witnesse when wee are challenged for our sinne

the hornes of the altar saith ieremit shall beare ingrauen the sinne of israel the stones shall erie out of the wall and the beame out of the timber shall answere it

saith habakkuk your gold and siluer is cankered saith saint iames and the rust of them shall witnesse against you nothing that we abuse be it meate drinke apparell goods or lands but retaines a stampe of our abuse it is a booke of record
now then in ore duorum aut trium testium stabit omne verbum if so be doubt should be made of the first booke the booke that is in heauen it must needs bee put out of all doubt by the threefold booke or record of our sin which god hath prouided here on earth

now wee throughly know the bookes let vs come to king dauids dele the blotting out of that which is in the book or rather the record or bill of indictment for as such must we apprehend these bookes
there is no doubt but dauid is primarily sollicitous of the first booke and indeed that is the ground of all the rest and the rest are but imperfect exemplifications of that and if the booke bee cancelled that is in heauen these on earth will be of no validitie god will not leaue them longer vncancelled if god raze our sinnes out of the booke of his memorie hee will giue an acquittance also to our conscience hee will plucke out the tongue of the staines that are in our bodies and soules and put to silence the clamours of those creatures which wee haue abused all those records shall be cancelled and it is for the cancelling of them all that king dauid doth pray

but marke that hide thy face is not enough except blot out be added
god may dissemble the sinnes of men for a time and punish them at length

moses is taught as much when hauing prayed that god would forgiue the israelites idolatrie committed with the golden calfe god was intreated so farre as to hide his face to forbeare them but not to blot out

that is to forgiue them for he addeth neuerthelsse in the day when visit will visit their sinnes vpon them the like is to bee obserued in the case of solomon ahab manasses and others
dauid prouideth better

for himselfe then so he ioyneth both in his desire and prayeth not onely hide thy face but blot out also and so must we when we seeke forgiuenesse of sinnes
it is a cold comfort to a debtor to obtaine of his creditor that he will not looke vpon his obligations hee is not secure except he haue them cancelled neither is a prisoner without feare that is onely repriued and why he may be hanged when he little looketh for it a sinners case is no better then this prisoners or that debtors except god be pleased as well to blot the record as to hide his face

but in the petition obserued that king dauid doth not only expresse what workes he expects from god but he sheweth withall whereto and how farre he would haue these works extend
whereto not to his person but to his sinnes hide thy face not from me but from my sinnes for if god should withdraw his countenance from vs destruction and annihilation must needes fall vpon vs our being and our liuing depend vpon the influence of his countenance and indeed our being and our liuing they are his workmanship and to pray god to hide his face from his owne workmanship must needes imply that we would haue god hate what himselfe hath made but god delights to behold that which is of him because it is like him neither doth it feare or blush to come before him it is that which we haue patcht vnto his workmanship which he abhorres to see and which abhorreth to bee seene of him
therefore king dauid discreetly limiteth the obiect of gods workes and will haue them worke not vpon his person but vpon his sinne and we may not in our petitions confound these things that are so different wherof the one may endure the other may not these acts of the prouidence of god what so euer we haue which is of god may without endure his eye and all recording hand therefore wee may not craue in regard of them either hide thy face or blot out both these desires must be restrained to our sinnes

and to them all
as dauid doth wisely restraine the acts to his sinne so doth he as wisely extend them to all his sinnes
hee was not ignorant of that maxime of law maledictus qui non permanserit in omnibus

cursed is he that abideth not in all that is written in the law for to doe it ill doth the shipwright prouide who stopping all other leakes leaues but one for the water may enter thereat and drowne the whole ship euen so seeing euery sinne is mortall wee may not looke for lesse wages for any one sinne then eternall death yea saint iames his rule is reus vnius omnium guiltie of one and guiltie of all
and why

though in conuersion to the world sinners doe differ yet in auersion from god they all agree he that setteth light by god in breaking one co~mandement doth not out of the feare of god keepe any one happily it is because he is not so prone to or gaineth not so much by other sinnes or some other carnal reason there is but certainly out of the feare of god he doth not forbeare them
therefore king dauid would haue his sinne pluckt vp by the roots not one sprigge left in him as before hee confest them all ingenuously so doth he here desire that they may all gratiously

be pardoned as in the
verse he begged great mercy so doth he here expresse how great he would haue it

the last thing that obserued vnto you was the possibilitie that king dauid should speed in this petition for it may seeme strange that such indulgence should stand with the diuine prouidence that god should see all and yet not see something and gods memorie to be a record of all and yet to haue something blotted out
notwithstanding that this is a truth we learne of god himselfe in esay ego sum qui deleo iniquitates am he that blotteth out sinnes and remember them no more the like doth god affirme in ieremie

yea that which the heathen orator spake flatteringly of iulius caesar

is most true of god nihil obliuisci solet nisi iniurias he forgets nothing but the sinnes of penitent suppliants

wherefore to cleare this doubt we must call to mind what told you before touching gods face that it signifies not onely his knowledge but also the consequent thereupon his answerable affection now his knowledge is necessarie his affection voluntarie so that though it be impossible that god should be ignorant of any thing yet he may be affected as pleaseth himselfe haue mercie on whom hee will haue mercie and harden whom he will as saint paul affirmeth out of moses when as then hee is moued in pittie towards any whom he is not ignorant to be sinners

hee is said to turne his face from their sinnes non aduertit saith saint austine in quod non animaduertit his indisposition to punish it is ment by his hiding his face from it so likewise his blotting out is not gods hauing no record of our sinne but not to vse it as an indictment against vs in iudgement and so because in law idem est non esse non apparere that whereof no vse is made is figuratiuely said to be blotted out so that the words are not to bee vnderstood absolutely but metonymically and ruffinus doth well qualifie them with a quasi quasi abscondit faciem suam and quasi delet god so dealeth with a penitent as if his face were hid and as if his booke were razed in regard of the sinfulnesse of his person

a second proofe of the possibilitie of king dauids speeding in his petition may be taken from the ceremoniall law of moses wherein gods presence was figured in the cloud so moses calleth it in exodus now betweene that and the place where the israelites did sacrifice vnto god there hung a double vaile

whereby gods countenance was hid from seeing their imperfections when they humbled themselues penitently at his altar
adde hereunto that the propitiatorie was betweene gods face and the tables of the couenant which the israelites entred into with god and by which in iustice god might measure all the passages of their life
these are types of greater things saint paul calleth christs flesh a vaile and hee cals him undefined span alphabet the propitiatorie rom

and indeed so it is

god doth not behold vs but in christ through the vaile of that flesh that suffered for vs in him that hath cancelled the obligation that was against vs not with the eyes of a righteous iudge but of a mercifull father

and this sense must bee added to the former to make the defence compleate and a penitent hopefull that hee shall speed of such a prayer

conclude all with a good note of theodoret who layeth this verse to a former know mine owne wickednesse my sinne is euer before me thereupon saith hee it followeth well turnethy face away from my sinne if wee fixe our eyes feelingly vpon our sinnes god will turne his eyes from them and god will not keepe them in his booke if wee record them penitently
wherefore that god may looke off let vs looke on our sinfull selues let vs booke all our misdeeds that god may blot them out so shall we finde him in christ not a iudge but a father his loue shall not suffer him to see that whereof hee cannot be ignorant neither will hee euer indict vs though the record bee neuer so faire and full that hee hath against vs whereupon wee may with king dauid pray no lesse hopefully then humbly turne thy face from our sinnes lord and blot out all our offences
if thou lord marke what is done amisse who is able to abide it

vers
create in mee a cleane heart god and renew a right spirit within mee

ovr naturall corruption is cured by grace and grace doth cure it partly by forgining and partly by regenerating of the forgiuenesse you haue heard on the former verse and on this verse you are to heare of the regeneration
and that which you shall heare is first what then whence it is
in opening what it is the text will leade me to shew you first in what part wee must haue it and secondly of what guifts it consists the part is set downe first in generall it is our inwards wee must haue it within but within wee haue many inwards whereof here are two distinctly exprest and they are two principall ones the heart and the spirit whereof the one noteth the soueraigne and the other the actiue power of our soule these are the parts that are to bee regenerated
now the guifts whereof this regeneration consists are holinesse and stayednesse holinesse of the soueraigne power and of the actiue stayednesse the first wee haue if our heart be cleane and the other if our spirit be right
this is regeneration
but whence is it surely from god to him king dauid seeketh for it create in me a cleane heart god

as it is fom him so it is no ordinary guift of his it is a worke of his great might for it is a creation create in mee and of his great mercy

for it is a renouation renew in mee our forfeiture maketh vs indebted vnto gods mercy renewing not onely to his creating power

these be the particulars which this text doth occasion me to consider in regeneration what remaineth but that our regeneration may be furthered by them wee listen vnto them with a religious eare as they shall be further vnfolded briefly and in their order

the first point then is the part wherein wee must haue regeneration the text saith wee must haue it within
ambrose lest we should grossly mistake our corporall inwards for our spirituall tels vs that the inwards here vnderstood are intelligibilia viscera the reasonable powers of our soule and of them our sauiour christ saith in the gospel

not that which goeth in but that which commeth out defileth a man now where sinne first began there must regeneration begin also but sinne began in the inwards

for man being in honour had no vnderstanding yea were it not for the vnderstanding a man could not sinne for it is an vndoubted maxime bruta non peccant no creature that is deuoid of conscience can contract guilt and it is as true that in whom there is no reason there can be no vertue for reason is the proper subiect of vertue and because of vertue therefore of regeneration which is the roote of all heauenly vertues see then why king dauid desireth regeneration within because there is the proper seate of it

and indeed except it begin there well may a man bee an hypocrite religious he cannot be

he will be but like a painted sepulchre as christ speaketh that within is full of dead mens bones
liuing temples of the holy ghost must bee like the materiall temple of salomon whereof the the innermost part was the place of gods residence and therefore was sanctum sanctorum the most holy place the next place was sanctum holy and the rest sanctuarium partaking of holines though in a lower degree so much lower as it was farther from the place of gods residence euen so though regeneration must sanctifie our bodies yet more our soules though it must sanctifie our vnderstanding yet must it sanctifie our will much more and that which is most inward must bee sanctified first
conclude this point with christs admonition giuen to the pharisees mundate quod intus

when we desire regeneration let vs desire to haue it specially in the inward man to haue our reasonable inwards new moulded by grace

but what inwards here are two mentioned the heart and the spirit these words are often vsed the one for the other and therfore may seeme to import but one thing but nazianzene doth distinguish them and so doe others both greeke and latine fathers will not trouble you with repeating of their words thus conceiue the heart noteth the soueraigne the spirit the actiue power of the reasonable soule

the heart then is the soueraigne power for as in a kingdome there are sundry ministers of state but the maiesty is in the king so in our litle common weale our senses inward and outward attend and informe but with submission alwayes to the pleasure of the will so that the will is as it were a king in the person of man therefore it is that

the scripture maketh so frequent mention of the heart in points of morality

but the soueraignty thereof appeareth in two speciall poynts in commanding of the whole man and in seasoning all his workes that it commands appeareth by that receiued maxime inclinatio voluntatis est inclinatio totius suppositi let the will once incline and all the whole person bends with it whether it be to loue or to hate what the will hates the eye will not indure to behold the eare to heare of the tongue to speake of the feet to goe to the head to thinke of finally no power of our soule or part of our body will haue to doe therewith except it bee to detest or to destroy it but on the other side what the heart doth loue the eye is not satisfied with seeing of it nor the eare with hearing the tongue cannot talke enough neither the hands doe enough for it it will euer be busying our wits and wee can neuer thinke enough thereon such power hath the will in commanding the seruice of the whole man and so readily doth euery part and power obey wee need not seeke proofe of this truth euery man may be an instance or an example of it vnto himselfe
as the heart hath this commanding power so hath it a seasoning power also it giueth a moral seasoning vnto all our workes the rule is actio tantum habet virtut is aut vitij quantum voluntatis looke how farre our will doth intermedle with our works so farre are they either vertuous or vitious a good will maketh the worke good and the worke cannot bee good if the will bee euill wherevpon nazianzene obserues well that god hath equalized all men in that ability which doth most commend or discommend and that is the ability of the will hee giueth an instance in liberality the widowes mites by the forwardnesse of her will were made a greaten offering then that which out of their superfluity the rich did offer in greater measure measure of coine but not of will wee may apply it vnto any other workes of wisedome of strength of learning and whatsoeuer els hee that is lesse able and more willing may bee preferred before him that is better able and lesse willing in doing well and in doing ill men are doomed accordingly this is the soueraignty of the heart so to command and so to season

but as this power is soueraigne so there is another power that is actiue a power that putteth in execution the resolutions of the former power it is here called spirit our common phrase sheweth that this word noteth an actiue power for wee say that a man is of an excellent spirit a great spirit a high spirit when wee meane that hee is fit for and forward in action and when we meane the contrary wee say that hee is of a quiet a meeke an humble spirit

that is as the psalmist speaketh hee doth not exercise himselfe in great matters which are too high for him that which the philosophers obserue concerning the concupiscible and the irascible faculties of our soule tends this way for they make the soule actiue in pursuing of her obiects the concupiscible hasting vs to them and the irascible encountring all difficulties that may hinder vs from

them so that the soueraigne power resolues not in vaine because of this actiue power that executes so well but certainely were it not for the actiue power the souer aigne power were in vaine god hauing so lincked them we must not seuer them and seing either of them is so necessarie to the other we must desire to haue our regeneration in them both

out of this which you haue heard you may gather that though our inward man is named yet the outward is not excluded because though a part is named yet the whole is meant seeing the whole followeth the condition of these principall parts wee cannot be regenerated in these principall parts but the regeneration will redound vnto the whole man

but what is regeneration of what gifts consists it told you of holinesse and staydnesse which are meant by cleannesse of the heart and rightnesse of the spirit where first marke that regeneration doth not concerne the substance

but the qualities of our nature nicodemus conceiued grossely that thought a man must enter into his mothers wombe and so be borne againe that he may bee new borne and they conceiue as grossely that thinke that originall sinne is any part of the substance of man wee lost not our being but our well being as the moone in the eclipse ceaseth not to be a starre but to be a bright shining starre the ayre in the night ceaseth not to be ayre but to be lightsome ayre the earth in the winter is earth still though it be not a flourishing earth finally when we haue lost our health we lose not our bodies though they become but sicke bodies

yet may we not conceiue superficially of originall sinne it is not as a painting but as a dying of our nature you know that painting is a colour layed on but the dye is a colour that sincketh in we may wash off or scrape out a painting the body continuing the same but a dye cannot be so taken out but it sincketh cleane through the wooll or the cloath and the inwards of the stuffe are coloured as well as the outwards

the same may bee illustrated by the former similitudes but will not be so troublesome onely this obserue that as illyricus and others haue racked originall sinne too farre so the pelagians old and new haue shrunk it too much we shall doe well to keepe the meane and hold the truth
it is a corruption that though it be not our substance for that can not stand with the articles of our creed as the learned haue proued abundantly against illyricus yet is it throughly incorporated into our substance neither is there any the least particle of our soule and body that is not infected therewith whereupon god passeth his censure the frame of the imaginations of the heart of man is euill

that continually from his youth

and paul maketh his confession know that in me that is in my flesh there dwels no good thing therfore when we come to regeneration we must conceiue of it as of a cure that worketh out a deep rooted corruption yea the termes of cleannes and rightnes must so be conceiued as that the cure doth not only worke out corruption but work in the contrary perfection as we see that the eclipse of the moone is remedied by the imparting vnto it the brightnes of the sunne and the darkenes of the night by the succeeding of the the winterly hue of the earth is

exchanged for the flourishing of the spring and the weaknesse that wee seele being sicke by the vigour that we haue from health euen so fareth it with our soules we put off the old man by putting on the new and the root of originall sin by being indued with originall righteousnes

this being obserued concerning regeneration in generall wee must now descend to the regeneration of the parts in particular the first of which is the regeneration of the heart it is here called cleannesse will not fall into the common place of the defiling nature of sin haue touched at it more then once on the former words of this psalme will keepe my selfe to that which is peculiar to this part
told you it is the soueraigne power of the reasonable soule and the first point wherein the soueraigntie appeares is that it doth command now the blemishes of a commander are two
folly and
impotencie either he knoweth not what directions to giue them that are vnder him or else contrarie to his iudgement he is by his affections take an example of solomon the father and rehoboam the sonne solomon was wise the wisest king that euer was and no wise king was euer more impotent in his affections as appeareth by his so doting on his heathenish wiues that to content them he entertained all kind of idolatry the son of solomon rehoboam went as far in folly as his father in impotency the son of syrach calls him the very foolishnesse of the people

and well he deserued to be so called that forsooke the counsell of the sages and listned vnto brainsicke youths and so lost ten tribes of twelue

in these two kings we may behold the defects of our commanding parts for somtimes the iudgment of it is so weak that it misdeemes good for euill and euill for good light for darknesse and darkenesse for light and this error is predominant in those that are without the church for of infidels it is most true that they haue a foolish heart

yea when they thinke they be most wise in their reasoning they shew themselues most foolish it were endlesse to descend to particulars if should reckon no more then those which are toucht in the scripture how much more if should discouer it out of there owne writings there speculatiue learning their practicke their theologie their policy their ethicks their oeconomicks all are spiced with folly

though this folly be predominant in those without the church yet is there more then a good deale of it within the church also were there no other proofe contentious writings proclaime to the world that many beleeuers cum ratione insaniunt haue a crackt braine and weake iudgement working vpon false principles or working out such conclusions as will neuer spring from truth

folly is one defect of the commanding part but not the onely it hath another which is impotencie though the iudgement doe not faile in setting the heart right yet the affections doe transport it that it cannot resolue right video meliora probo{que deterior a sequor wee know our duety oftner then wee can bee perswaded to doe it
and this disease though it be in infidels as the former verse doth witnesse and saint paul much more rom
saying that they detaine the truth of god in vnrighteousnesse

and that though they haue no law they are a law vnto themselues yet is this disease more common in the church whose sins spring more commonly from the impotency of their affections then from the ignorance of their iudgement as it is plaine by those that teach others but teach not themselues and commit those faults themselues which they condemne in others there are few reasonably bred that know not their creed and the ten commandements yet when they are put to a reall maintenance of their faith or obseruance of the law who is hee that staggers not that yeelds not to his affections

well seeing these are the defects of the heart as it is a commanding part you easily conceiue what the cure thereof must be and what is the first property of a cleane heart it is the rectifying of it in regard of folly and impotencie the making of it first wise and vnderstanding the furnishing of it with good and sound principles the knowledge of the good and acceptable will of god in a word a right iudgement in all things this paul meaneth

when hee saith we haue the mind of christ so that bee the scrpent neuer so crafty bee sinne neuer so sweetly sugered euill neuer so curiously blancht be the suggestions of our aduersary neuer so sophisticall yet shall wee not bee circumuented wee shall not be deceiued by it

that our commanding part be so freed from folly is not enough it must bee freed from impotencie also wee must haue obedient and religious hearts

be as ready to doe as to know loue nothing in comparison of god and doing our duety not father mother brother sister wife yea we must deny them all

say too little christ goeth farther we must hate them all if they be an impediment to our following of god and keeping of his commandements if we are so far masters of our selues as to make our affections conforme themselues vnto our iudgement then is the commanding part cured in regard of impotencie and so the commanding part so farre as it is rid of folly and impotencie is truely regenerate

but there is in the soueraigne part besides the commanding power a seasoning power also and that must bee regenerated
it seasons all our actions with vertue or vice according as it is good or ill
as the knowledge of god is the regeneration of it as it is the commanding part so is the loue of god the regeneration of it as it is the seasoning part or rather the coniunction of the loue of god to the knowledge of god
so that for a vertuous action wee must bee sani boni viri it must bee the worke of a well aduised and a man so that the latter part of regeneration is but a consequent vpon the former and the heart if it command well seasoneth well and seasoneth ill if it command ill according to the commandement our workes doe proue either vertues or vices

you haue heard what is the regeneration of the soueraigne power here is another power specified which is the actiue nazianzene calls

it undefined span alphabet it is that which executeth what the commanding part resolueth
the word in the originall signifieth either directum or erectum that which keepeth right forward or standeth vpright
the actiue power of our soule is subiect to two defects it may straggle out of the way through rashnes or stagger in the way through faintnes while we are in the way allurements of diuers kinds draw vs into we are set vpon by the crafty serpent and if that succeed not then with terrors wee are startled and made either to come to a stand or else to march cowardly
the cure of all this is a right spirit when god is pleased by grace to set strait steps vnto our feete and strengthen our feeble knees so that wee step not aside out of the way nor halt in the way our spirit is directus it keepes good correspondency with our iudgement and executeth no more then it hath in charge and it is also erectus it bends no more then our affections whether it pursue or encounter any thing resolued vpon by the soueraigne part it sheweth continually a religious stayednesse
finally whereas grace maketh a double cure one on our heart and another on our spirit and the regeneration of our spirit is but an attendant vpon the regeneration of our heart wee may not diminish the number of the parts nor inuert the order but when wee will trie our selues whether and how farre wee are regenerated wee must looke into our inwards see how we finde our selues there but specially to these fountaines of life the heart and the spirit see whether grace command in the heart before the heart command and that it may season our workes well whether it selfe bee seasoned first with grace and hauing taken this suruey of the heart wee must come on to the spirit and see whether our execution be as holy as our resolution if grace preserue vs from allurements and support vs against disheartning affrightments then is our spirit as right as our heart is cleane both are regenerated by the spirit of grace

the fathers vnderstand here a double grace not onely the grace of regeneration whereof you haue heard but the grace of prophesie also wherewith king dauid was endued as appeare in his psalmes wherein are many excellent prophesies
it was no small griefe vnto him to haue that diuine influence suspended and to haue withdrawne from him those heauenly reuelations therfore they conceiue the words thus dauid desired a cleane heart that so hee might haue a right spirit for blessed are the pure in heart they shall see god saith christ

and the holy spirit of discipline will not abide in a soule when vnrighteousnesse commeth in
the holy spirit of prophesie is long since ceased and wee cannot be depriued of that which we neuer had but of this we may be sure that sin in our heart doth not a little bleare our eyes when we come to consider of gods truth in his word and endeauour though not our selues to be yet to vnderstand those that were vndoubted prophets
but enough of regeneration so farre as this text doth teach vs what it is

come on to shew you briefly the last point of the text which is whence it proceeds
it proceeds from god of him king dauid beggeth

it create in me a cleane heart god and well may he aske it of him for god doth promise the gift of this grace a new heart will giue you and a new spirit will put into you saith god eze cap

and paul in his epistles doth often direct his prayers for these vnto god

how then doth eze
bid vs make vnto our selues new hearts and new spirits and moses in the law deut
bids vs circumcise the of our hearts surely not to note our power but our want that out of the conscience thereof we should seeke vnto the father of lights from whom commeth euery good and perfect gift

or if it be to note any power of ours it is but power to vse the outward meanes but the effect wished hath a higher cause which is the spirit of god

and indeed the true cause why the holy ghost speaketh so differenly sometimes calling vpon vs and sometimes willing vs to call vpon god is because gods inward worke is seldome without our outward though the honour which god doth to the vse of the meanes must not derogate ought from gods totall producing of the effects
the more to be blamed is the church of rome who by aduancing the meanes impaire that honour which is due vnto god
let it stand then for a grounded truth that regeneration is the gift of god

as it is gods gift so it is no ordinary gift of his it is a worke of his great might and of his great mercy of his great might for it is a creation
creation is either to make something of nothing or at least if that whereof it is made be something yet that thing hath no disposition to become that which it is made if you looke to the gift that is giuen by regeneration surely that is made simply of nothing it is an effect that proceeds immediately from the spirit who hath nothing out of which to worke that effect but his owne almighty power for non educiturè potentia naturae nature sendeth forth no such fruit
if you looke vpon the person that receiueth the grace then also regeneration will proue to be a creation for so farre is he from being disposed fitly to receiue grace

that hee is naturally opposite vnto it the wisedome of the flesh is enmity against god so saith the apostle and the prophet will tell vs that regenerating is like the changing of the nature of tygers lyons and wolues a hard worke saint austin goeth so farre that hee thinketh it a harder matter to bring a sinner accustomed to an euill course into a right way then to create a world especially to bring him to entertaine the christian faith which is foolishnes to the gentile and a stumbling blocke to the iew

the more absurd is the patronage of free will in the case of new birth the very word creation doth refute it

which saint paul vseth more then once and thereby both testaments put vs in mind that wee can doe as little towards our spirituall creation as we could towards our naturall in regard of both we may vse that of the psalm
it is god that hath made vs and not we our selues both waies made vs by the power of a god

neither is it onely a worke of great power but of great mercy also that is intimated by the word renew pulchre dixit innoua saith chrysostome it is well said renew the house was built before which sinne ruined and

grace doth and indeed that this is not the first time that we are beholding to gods grace the very word regeneration may teach we had this cleane heart and right spirit when we were first created for wee were created after gods image sinne lost it grace restored it now you know that if a tenant forfeit his lease and a after restore it to him againe this is a worke of his goodnesse which is more then a worke of his ability for many are able and doe it not therefore if any being able doe it the inducement is not his ability but his goodnesse the like must we conceiue of god it was his pittying mercie that imployed his almighty power to repaire what we had ruined to recouer what we had lost to restore what we had forfeited a cleane heart and a right spirit

finally both the creating and the renewing are actus continui workes that god neuer intermitteth otherwise we should quickly come to nothing or rather which is worse then nothing become of hell for wee dayly forfeit by sin and god may daily take aduantage of our breach of his couenant
adde hereunto that our regeneration is not in facto but in fieri and therefore needeth a perpetuall influence and supportance for this cause though dauid were now in the state of grace yet doth he begge grace of god though god had created in him a cleane heart yet doth he desire that god would create a cleane heart in him and though he bad renewed in him a right spirit yet doth he pray that god would renew a right spirit within him so doth he wisely prouide against forfeitures and religiously beg the increase of that which he had receiued
but conclude sicut rogauit dauid it a debet vnusquis{que nostrûm saith hierom dauids prayer is a praier that beseems vs all we all beare about vs a body of sin and we should all desire that it might be abolished

we should indeed but who doth who doth enquire into the vncleannesse of his heart and the crookednesse of his spirit or who taketh notice whether there be in him at all any part of regeneration nay who doth shew that there is any nazianzene oratione
writing de doth giue a good obseruation how a man should know whether his heart haue any part in this creation or his spirit in this renouation yesterday thou wert a time seruer to day thou art not ashamed of thy sauiour christ yesterday thou didst affect the praise of men to day thou settest more by an honest life yesterday thou wert delighted with vain spectacles to day thou art giuen to diuine meditations if thou find such a change haec mutatio dextrae excelsi god hath put to his mercifull power to make thee a new man if it be otherwise with thee and the day following find thee as bad as thou wert the day before thou hast no part in regeneration
a fearfull case because the psalmist mouing the question to god

who shall ascend into the mountaine of the lord who shall stand in his holy place answers euen he that hath innocent hands and a pure heart

wherfore be ye renewed in the spirit of your minds put on the

which after god is created in righteousnes true holines or because this is a worke too hard for any one of vs let vs euery one pray with dauid in this place create in me a clean heart god renew a right spirit within me
amen

epigraph

psal
vers
cast mee not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from mee

king dauids desire set forth in the first part of this psalme is that hee may be restored vnto and preserued in the state of grace
how he desires to bee restored you haue hitherto seene you haue seene how hee sueth first in generall that gods mercie would relieue his miserie gods great mercy his deepe miserie secondly in speciall how hee brancheth his owne sinne and gods grace hee confesseth sinne which himselfe committed and that which he inherited from his parents and hee beggeth a grace that the cure may be proper to each kind of sinne finally he would not haue a plaister narrower then his sore nor a medicine that could not throughly remedy his disease
thus he desires to be restored

but to be restored is not enough a penitents desire must carrie him farther for how shall it appeare that hee doth vnfainedly sorrow for sinne and affect goodnesse except he be as desirous to continue in as to bee brought vnto the state of grace

nay saint peter will tell vs that it were better neuer to haue knowne the way of righteousnesse then after wee haue knowne it to returne like dogges to our vomit and like swine to our wallowing in the myre
wherefore the second desire was necessarie for king dauid and must bee exemplarie vnto vs
let vs come then to it

it is set downe in this and the following verse and conceiued in a double prayer first in deprecation and secondly in supplication a prayer against that which king dauid deserued and a prayer for that without which king dauid could not perseuere we will meddle now onely with the former prayer

but in the passage may not forget a good note of saint bernards where he commends king dauids method

and obserues that after hee hath prayed create in me a cleane heart lord renew a right spirit within me he prayeth seasonably cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me
when we offend we fall into sinne and out of fauour and when we repent wee must not desire to be receiued into fauour vntill we are first acquitted from sinne otherwise wee shall betray that we wish there were no sanction of the law but as for the transgression of the law we are not much moued therwith wheras the least sinne must be more irkesome to a repenting soule then the most grieuous punishment
but let vs breake vp this prayer wherein will note two things
the manner and
the matter the manner is a prayer against the matter is that which king dauid deserued
now that which he deserued

comprehends two fearefull iudgements
reiection and
depriuation will cleare these two tearmes vnto you

while we are in the state of grace wee haue communion with god and god hath communion with vs god receiueth vs into his family and we attend him we weare his liuerie and are knowne to belong vnto him the first giueth vs free accesse vnto his presence and the second is a participation of his holy spirit
sinne as much as lieth in it dissolues both these communions for we deserue by it first that god discharge vs of his seruice giue vs no longer place in his family which is that which called reiection
secondly we deserue that god take from vs his liuerie leaue vs no marke of our reference to him and this is that which called depriuation
but more distinctly in reiection we will obserue
from what place and state both are included in gods presence secondly with what disgrace and danger a sinner deserues to bee reiected we may gather them both out of the words cast out
in the depriuation we will obserue first whereof secondly how farre a sinner may be depriued
whereof first of what gift of the holy spirit then what worth there is in the gift spiritus tuus thy holy spirit or the spirit of thy holinesse a most precious gift of this a sinner deserueth to be depriued
but how farre that appeareth in aufer as the taking away which wee will resolue into these two notes the first is the taking backe of the spirit which god once gaue him and therefore some render it ne recipias withdraw not secondly the spirit is so taken backe that nothing of it remaines with a sinner it is not a diminution but an ablation a stripping him wholy of the spirit of god
finally both these reiection and depriuation must bee considered not in themselues but also in their consequences and the consequences are two and they much aggrauate the fearefulnesse of the iudgement the first is we cannot be reiected of our old good master but wee shall fall into the hands of another who is much worse and wee shall be forced to weare a much worse liuerie if we be stript of his looke whatsoeuer good we lose we shall fall vnder the contrarie euill if we bee reiected if we be depriued
this is the first consequence
a second is that such a sinners case is desperate god will heare no mans praiers for him and he wil giue him no grace to pray for himselfe
and what can follow but that being brought into so bad a case he senselesly runne a gracelesse course which commeth to the maine point of my text which told you was a desire of perseuerance in grace whereunto nothing can bee more opposite then this reiection and depriuation which is prayed against by our penitent king
and so haue broken vp this text the parts whereof shall now open farther vnto you god grant they may further our religious repentance

first then of the manner of the prayer told you it is a deprecation a praying against
when we are in danger we must not be senselesse bee it but corporall how much more if it be spirituall now that we are sensible

wee can giue no better proofe then if wee pray against the danger yea the more earnest wee are in prayer the more doe wee manifest the prouident feare of our soules
dauid had committed enormous sinnes adultery

murder of adulterers saint paul tels vs that none shall enter into the kingdome of heauen and of the murderer saint iohn tels vs that hee hath not eternall life abiding in him king dauid finding himselfe in this danger had reason to fall vnto this kind of prayer especially hauing before his eyes the wofull example of his predecessor saul

but what needed hee

god had promised that it should goe well with him and with his seed also and that when they sinne though hee will punish them he will not withdraw his mercy as he did from saul whom hee cast out from before his eyes yea and dauid for his particular had his pardon brought vnto him by nathan
it is true
but it is as true that he that doth recouer out of a desperate danger is not so soone secure as hee is safe behold it in a corporall danger if a man were ready to fall into a deepe pit and a stander by timely stretch out his hand and recouer him hee cannot so soone recouer his spirits as hee saued his life you shall see him looke wan feele his heart tremble scarce get a word from him or make him stand vpon his feet he will aske some pretty time before hee can come to himselfe againe
and may we thinke that hee that found himselfe vpon the brinke of hell that saw himselfe entring at the gates of aeternall death that was singed with the flames of that vnquenchable fire and felt the palpable darkenesse of that euerlasting night though by gods mercy hee tumbled not into the pit came not into the chambers of death was not deuoured of the fire nor cast into the vtter darknesse thinke wee say that hee can soone forget those affrighting spectacles that hee can suddainly calme those stormes which they raised in his soule that hee can as soone be secured as hee is safe certainly he cannot they that haue beene exercised in such conflicts yeeld vndenyable proofe and therefore wonder not that king dauid notwithstanding gods gracious promise as if hee did forget it maketh this kind of prayer vnto god

adde hereunto that god doth not giue his promises to make vs idle but to exercise our faith in importuning god for a performance

pietie hath the promise both of this life and of that which is to come yet doe wee not forbeare dayly to say the lords prayer that we may speed of both
our rule then is that wee must vse gods promises as directions in not as dispensations from the deuotion we owe vnto god
and let this suffice touching the manner of the prayer

let vs come now to the matter and first let vs looke to the reiection wherein the first particular was the place from whence a sinner deserueth to bee reiected that is here called the presence of god
god from the beginning of the world had a speciall place whereat hee appeared to the patriarkes and they performed their deuotions at it the learned gather it out of the
of genesis where god threatneth that cain should bee a vagabond and cain complaineth that hee was cast from the presence of god that is excommunicated from the visible church

and the seuering of the sonnes of god from the sonnes of men seemeth to haue bin in regard of the meeting in that speciall place

but howsoeuer that may be doubted it is out of all question that when god made the israelites a nationall church hee had a visible presence amongst them hee commanded the tabernacle to be built for that purpose whereinto he entred in the cloud and rested betweene the cherubims on the this was the typicall presence of a spirituall residence of god of his gracious dwelling amongst his people
this was a thing so much reuerenced by the patriarkes

that they held it a great blessing to enioy it vnum petij aith king dauid one thing haue desired of the lord and that will still require that may dwell in the house of the lord all the dayes of my life to behold the faire beauty of the lord and to visit his holy temple

as it was a comfort to them to enioy it so was it no small punishment to bee depriued of it king dauid confesseth as much

when hee breaketh out into those passionate speeches how amiable are thy tabernacles lord of hosts my soule longeth euen fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh cryeth out for the liuing god and againe as the hart panteth after the water brookes so panteth my soule after thee god my soule thirsteth after god euen the liuing god when shall come and appeare before god amplifie this ancient respect vnto the place that therehence you may gather the greatnes of the losse thereof

but what is this to vs those types be long since past but they had a truth which shall remaine vntill the worlds end and that is gods gracious presence in the gospel learne it of paul who describing the dignity of the gospel setteth it forth in these words god which co~manded light to shine out of darknesse hath shined in our hearts

to giue the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of iesus christ and againe wee all with open face beholding as in a glasse the glory of the lord

are changed into the same image from glory vnto glory so that our churches haue a residence of god a residence much more glorious then that of the iewes and the losse thereof if by any meanes it bee brought vpon vs wee are not to esteeme it vnworthy a deepe sorrow

but as the presence noteth a place so doth it note a state also that doth accompany the place will reduce it to two heads gods speciall prouidence and his gracious acceptance
where god is pleased to reside he taketh a speciall care of the persons his care may be reduced vnto two heads mentioned in the
psalme god is a sun and a shield that is he blesseth and defendeth them that are his people
it is a pleasant thing saith the preacher to see the sun the corporall sun how much more the spirituall the sun of righteousnes king dauid will tell you how much more there bee many saith hee that aske

who will shew vs any good but lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs and thou shalt put more ioy into our hearts then they whose corne and wine and oyle is encreased and no maruell for in thy presence is fulnesse of ioy

and at thy right hand are pleasures for euermore
is god a sun vnto his church then euery good and perfect guift will come downe vpon it from the father of

lights
they are happy that dwell with the sun but hee that is happie would be safe also and he that is the sun is also a shield hee hideth his seruants in his pauilion

in the secret of his tabernacle he doth hide them hee that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide vnder the shadow of the almighty

hee shall not be afraid of terror by night nor of the arrow that flyeth by day read the whole psalme it is nothing but a description of the shield in the entrance to the
psalme dauid compareth god to all kind of munition and saint paul ephes cap

teacheth that god doth furnish vs with compleat armour
who can doubt then that god is a shield vnto his you see what is gods speciall prouidence ouer his church beside that the state doth containe a gracious acceptance also

they that are neare are deare the eyes of the lord are vpon them and his eares are open vnto their prayers they find grace in his eyes with noah and hee smels their sacrifice he pittieth their defects ouervalueth their good endeauors punisheth them lesse but rewardeth them more then they deserue finally as hee appropriateth as it were himselfe to them so doth he them vnto himselfe
cannot stand to amplifie these things onely marke this if the losse of the place bee a punishment there is a great accesse made to it by the losse of the state if it be a punishment not to come neere god what a punishment is it to bee out of such a to be without such a shield what a punishment is it that neither wee nor our workes should find any grace in the eyes of god wee must put these things into the scales when wee weigh our iudgement

but not these things onely the manner of the reiection doth aggrauate it not a little that is intimated in the word cast out it is actio indignantis wee must set before vs a person highly displeased and behold with what countenance hee throweth from him that which he detests dauid was a king and he knew well the mood of an angry king what wofull effects it produceth against those with whom they are angry reduced them to two heads disgrace and danger take for example ahasuerus wroth against haman vpon queene hesters petition first hee was disgraced his eyes were couered that hee might not see the kings face and danger came not far behind disgrace for he was presently hanged on a gallowes
if the casting out of a subiect by the command of a mortall king draw with it this double euill how is it improued when it is acted by the king of heauen but will open it vnto you in a resemblance or two

this casting out is called a diuorce now you know that if a husband for adultery put away his wife shee forfeits her honour and her dower she is branded for an infamous person and destituted of her maintenance

christ as the prophet speaketh doth marry vs vnto himselfe and thereupon communicateth vnto vs his honourable name wee are called christians and endoweth vs with his whole estate maketh vs heyres of the kingdome of heauen how great is the disgrace then how great is the danger that doth accompany the diuorce the disgrace that declareth vs vnworthy of our name and danger that cutteth off our title to so glorious an inheritance

a second similitude is the discommuning of vs we were gods peculiar treasure a kingdome of priests so is our prerogatiue expressed exod
yea we are made as the gospell speaketh a kingdome of heauen what greater worth what greater wealth can bee conceiued then is in such a state but if god be prouoked to pronounce against them

you are not my people will not be your god our worth our wealth vanish both they melt with the heat of that fierie doome
might amplifie it by other similitudes the cutting off the oline the vine branch mentioned rom
and ioh
by the histories of cain and of saul by the censures of cutting off from gods people remembred in moses and christs let him be vnto thee as a publican and a heathen but will not tire out your patience
onely this would haue you obserue that there is neuer a particle that haue insisted vpon that is not fit to augment the grieuousnesse of the iudgement the iudgement which casteth a sinner out of the presence of god

should here take leaue of this point but that cannot leaue out a good note of cassiodores cuius faciem timet eius faciem inuocat a strange thing two verses before he prayed hide thy face and here he prayeth cast me not out from thy presence hath the king forgot doth he contradict himselfe by no meanes marke his words and see a difference in the things wherof he speaketh

the same difference which before obserued out of ruffinus when hee prayeth hide thy face he limited his petition to his sinnes but here hee commeth to speake of his person and conceiueth a contrarie prayer hide not thy face from me we must euer pray that our selues may be still in gods gracious eye and we must pray also that his reuengefull eye be neuer on our sinnes

haue done describing the first punishment which is the reiection come now to the second which is the depriuation
and here wee must obserue first whereof we are depriued of the holy spirit and what is that that which maketh all saints

this very day is a sacred memoriall of the gift if said no more you might reasonably conceiue it but it is sit speake more happily you will vnderstand the day better
the holy spirit as told you is gods liuerie his cognizance

none haue it but they that are his christ tels vs so will pray the father and hee shall giue you another comforter euen the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receiue because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but yee know him for he dwelleth in you and shall be in you

but to what end there are two principall vses of the holy spirits inhabitation he is vnto vs the oracle of god leading vnto all truth without whom we cannot perceiue the things of god yea they will be foolishnesse vnto vs but if we haue him

wee haue an vnction that will teach vs all things yea we can search the deepe things of god
king dauid had him in a double sort an ordinarie vnuailing his eyes that hee might see the wonderfull things of gods law an extraordinarie illightning him to secrets of the kingdome of christ which were then yet to come the chaldee paraphrase and many of the fathers vnderstand the holy spirit in this later sense for the spirit of prophesie
that is true which

they say but it is not enough king dauid had also the spirit of adoption and he doth not forget that in his prayer against depriuation
yea he must be thought principally to ayme at that for by the other gift wee may serue god on earth but without this we shall neuer goe to heauen for so saith christ

many shall say in the last day haue we not prophecied in thy name but they shall be answered depart from me you workers of iniquitie know you not therefore no doubt but king dauid had an eye to that oracle which wrought in him a sauing faith and did as wee must feare to be depriued of that

as the holy spirit is an heauenly oracle in our heads so in our hearts it is an heauenly fire
god who instituted sacrifices to be offered by the church would haue them offered with no other fire but that which should be sent by him from heauen yea the vsing of strange fire was capitall as appeares by the storie of nadab and abthu
that type doth informe vs of a greater truth it teacheth vs wherewith spirituall sacrifices must be offered vnto god
the first sacrifice spirituall must be a patterne to all the rest christ by his eternall spirit offered himselfe vnto god wherewith his propitiatorie therewith must our eucharisticals be offered saint iude speaketh it plainely we must pray in the holy ghost

the gift you see what it is but you doe not yet fully see what is the worth of it that gathered out of tuus it is not onely a holy spirit but also the spirit of gods holinesse or gods holy spirit
our soule in vs is a spirit and we loue it so well that sathan said not vntruely skinne for skin and all that euer a man hath will he giue for his life the angels are yet better spirits

higher in dignitie then men their titles as saint peter affirmes confirme it

and the psalmist saith that they exceede in power and we haue reason to respect them because they pitch their tents about vs

yea god hath giuen a charge vnto them ouer vs to carrie vs in their hands that we dash not our feete against a stone
but there is a spirit beyond both these euen the spirit of spirits without whom the former cannot bee and from whom they receiue whatsoeuer good they haue hee is the fountaine of being and to them both
if wee loue our owne soules and the safegard of angels be deare vnto vs how should we loue gods holy spirit that is so farre beyond them in infinitenesse of power and excellencie of being yea without whom they cannot be nor stirre without his command

the phrase doth not onely import that the spirit is gods but also that it is the spirit of that which is most desireable in god that is his holinesse which doth much improue the gift when the liuerie that it giueth vs and whereby he would haue vs knowne to be his doth make vs partakers of this diuine attribute wherein to resemble him should bee the highest ambition of a reasonable soule

but will not wade farther in vnfolding the gift what hath beene said is able to make vs sensible of their losse that are depriued thereof especially when shall haue added thereunto the manner of losing which called a depriuation
the word is rendered vulgarly take not away
but this taking away hath two remarkable things in it it is a taking backe of

that which was giuen and a leauing vs not so much as any relique of the gift in regard of the first some render it ne take not home againe in regard of the other ne spolies strip mee not altogether so the arabicke
will touch a little at both of them
first at the taking backe

hee that loseth what good he had is much more sensible of the losse then if hee neuer had it hee that was borne sickly and hath a long time languished in a disease is not so much pained as hee that being healthy and strong is shaken with a feauer or tortured with some ache pouerty and disgrace are more bitter to them that haue liued in plenty and honour then they can bee to him who was neuer of better condition then a begger or a drudge miserum est fuisse foelicem the memory of a better doubleth the misery of a worse estate it doth so corporally and it will doe so spiritually if euer we be put to the triall of it yea we shall find it will doe it so much the more by how much the touch of conscience is more tender then any other sense and the gift which we lose is infinitely more precious then any other gift

the taking backe doth much amplifie the depriuation but how much more doth it amplifie that nothing is left behind though the haruest be caried away yet if there be some gleaning behind though a tree be cut downe yet if there bee a roote left in the ground though the sunne goe downe yet if it be twilight these small remainders of greater goods are no small refreshings to a loser it doth a man some good to keepe some monuments of his better estate especially when they are pledges of some sparkle of good will towards vs continuing in him vpon whose iust displeasure we forfeited all
as god in fauour giueth the holy spirit so in displeasure doth hee take him away and we cannot guesse better at the measure of his displeasure then by the measure of the depriuation
if he take it but in part then mercy tempers iudgement but if he leaue no sparkles of grace that may be kindled again then we become loruhama

we are cleane shut out of the bowels of his compassion
and this is that which king dauids trembling conscience doth deprecate in these words ne auferas take not away

haue opened vnto you the nature of spirituall reiection and depriuation and doubt not but by that which you haue heard you conceiue that they are grieuous iudgements but the bottomes of them are not sounded except we also take notice of the consequents two wofull consequents
the first if man be reiected of god as before you heard hee must looke for a cleane opposite condition hee loseth the place of gods presence and whether shall he goe but euen to the pit of hell hee loseth the state of that blessed place and hee shall fall into the state of the cursed
god doth disgrace him dares any creature yeeld a good looke vnto him god layeth him open to danger and whose indignation then will not burne against him whose hand will spare him vpon whom god layeth his heauie hand guesse what will become of them that are reiected by the king of heauen by that which you see befall them who are reiected by kings on earth

the first consequent of reiestion is bad neither is the first consequent vpon depriuation better he that loseth the holy spirit shall be possessed by an vncleane spirit

it was sauls case the text is plaine the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an euill spirit troubled him where god is not satan will be
some would bee neutrals in the world but indeed none are man is either a temple of god or a synagogue of satan yea and looke how much god taketh from vs of his spirit so much wee shall be sure to haue of the vncleane spirit as darknesse taketh vp all the roome that is not filled with light if we haue no portion of gods spirit those vncleane spirits will possesse vs wholy
a miserable exchange and yet is this the consequent of depriuation

you would thinke had brought the iudgement to the height but haue not there is another consequent a consequent worse then the former omnis spes veniae tollitur so sayth gregorie the great the case is not only very bad but it is past all recouery and why is a man reiected no other man may intercede for him see this in the case of a king how long saith god vnto samuel wilt thou mourne for saul seeing haue reiected him from raigning ouer israel see it in the case of a kingdome will cast you out of my sight saith god as haue cast out all your brethren euen the whole seed of ephraim he speaketh of the kingdome of iudah and therefore pray not thou ieremie

for this people neither lift vp crie nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for will not heare thee
a pittifull case a man may haue no mediator if he be reiected
how much more miserable is his case if he be depriued for then he cannot pray for himselfe it is saint pauls doctrine we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit maketh intercession for vs with groanes which cannot be vttered and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god
you see there is no prayer can be made hopefully but must be endited by the spirit and the spirit prayeth in none but in those that are saints therefore they that are depriued of the spirit are depriued of the grace of prayer as zacharie also witnesseth which ioyneth them both together zach
when a man is brought to this case that hee hath no friend to stand vp for him and he cannot be a friend vnto himselfe how desperate is his case what remayneth then but that hee betake himselfe vnto a wretched course surely cain did so when hee was reiected hee became the father of such giants whom nothing could mend but the generall deluge and what a life led saul after hee was depriued so ill a life that his owne death could not make amends for it but many of his children were faine to be hanged vp long after to pacifie the wrath of god
yea the parable of the vncleane spirit witnesseth that they that haue beene in the state of grace and by reiection and depriuation are fallen from it are much worse vpon the relapse then euer they were before they first began to be good
no wonder then that dauid conceiued this deprecation against so fearefull iudgements
yea most gracious was god vnto him that gaue him time for to deprecate that put a distance inter meritum iudicium betweene his ill deseruing and

gods iust reuenge he deserued to be cast out but continued still in gods presence he deserued to be depriued but he retayned still gods holy spirit
see what good vse hee maketh of gods patience while hee is in the presence hee preuenteth the casting out and preuenteth the taking away of the spirit while yet the spirit abode within him and his preuenting is nothing but deprecating
and while we haue the like time we must vse no other meanes how long doth god forbeare vs when wee grieuously prouoke him were we better aduised we would be more prouident and not the time allowed vs for deprecation lest to our endlesse griefe we find that when we are vnder these iudgements our state is past recouerie

should here end but must speake a little of this solemne time

and of the blessed sacrament which wee shall now receiue and my text is well fitting to them both to the time for turne the deprecation into a supplication and what will it sound then but king dauids desire to continue a saint what is a saint is it not a person that is vouchsafed to attend the presence of god and is furnished with the holy spirit of god and he that prayeth take not from mee thy holy spirit cast mee not out of thy presence what doth hee desire but this lord continue mee what thou hast once made me let me euer bee a saint
and now you see how true that is which at the entrance obserued my text is a prayer for perseuerance in grace it was king dauids prayer it must bee the prayer of all saints hope wee are all such and that wee may neuer be other let vs timely pray against those fearefull iudgements of spirituall reiection and depriuation pray so we must and that wee pray not in vaine loe yonder is a gracious answere to our prayer wee shall find it at the table of the lord that may touch at the sacrament as haue done at the time
would any man be sure that hee is of gods family what better euidence can he haue then that he is fed at gods table certainly hee is not cast out that is allowed his ordinarie there
doth any man desire to continue in him the possession of gods spirit loe yonder is the fuell that feeds that heauenly fire the bread the drinke are both spirituall they are pledges they are conduits of the spirit of god the spirit will neuer faile them that worthily doe partake of these
and why it is christs spirit and where christ is his spirit must needes goe also
but yonder is the fariest picture that euer was made of christ goe to it receiue it that thou maist become one with it and it with thee so shalt thou be euer sure euer to be of the familie of god thou shalt stand before his presence thou shalt euer weare his liuery and keepe possession of his spirit
feare not thou hast christ promise

him that commeth to me will not forth and god hath said

will neuer leaue thee nor for sake thee
onely le not be senselesse of our danger nor carelesse of these good meanes

lord our sinnes are many they are great but thou hast giuen dauid a prerogatiue beyond saul to the family of dauid beyond the family of saul to true penitents beyond gracelesse sinners
vouchsafe

vs all to be such penitents that we may enioy there prerogatiue when we sinne let vs not forget to returne in time and that we be not swallowed vp of these fearefull iudgements of reiection and depriuation heare vs graciously when we cry humbly cast vs not away from thy presence and take not thine holy spirit from vs

epigraph

psal
verse
restore vnto me the ioy of thy saluation and stablish me with a free spirit

king
dauids desire to bee continued in the state of grace is conceiued in two prayers one against that which himselfe deserued another for that without which hee could not perseuere
haue alreadie opened the former prayer come now to the later
this later prayer then that you may the better vnderstand will obserue therein what king dauid beggeth and of whom
that which he beggeth is a restitution and a confirmation restore stablish
wee must moreouer obserue in the restitution whereof it is and in the confirmation wherewith it is wrought
the restitution is of a comfortable sense of gods grace
gods grace is noted by saluation whereof the comfortable sense is ioy
the confirmation is wrought by a generous disposition the disposition is meant in the word spirit which that it may be generous must be free
such a comfortable sense and such a generous disposition are the two supporters of perseuerance by them are the children of god continued in the state of grace
but whence doe they get them surely only from god it is he that withdraweth in displeasure and therefore it is hee that in mercie must restore the comfortable sense as our being so our well being subsists only in him and therefore only by him can we be confirmed therein therefore king dauid desirous to speed of these meanes of perseuerance seeketh them where they may be had hee beggeth them at the hands of god
these are the contents of this text which will inlarge and apply in their order

but in the passage may not forget to obserue vnto you that for obtayning perseuerance the deprecation will not suffice without a supplication it is not enough to be freed from the impediments except wee bee vouchsafed the meanes of perseuerance put the case our master should neuer in this world turne vs out of his family which is the church nor strip vs of his liuerie which is his holy spirit yet if wee bee not prouided of meanes heartning and exercising vs in this seruice better neuer to continue then to continue so in that blessed societie
the vnprofitable seruant that hid his talent in a napkin abode in the house with his fellowes that were more thrifty

and emplyed their talents to their masters aduantage but at the reckoning day that idle one was

cast into vtter darknesse there to weepe and gnash with his teeth when his fellowes vpon their better account did enter into their masters ioy
god hath done vs all this fauour as to continue our entertainment in the church we must not neglect our employment in his seruice if wee doe well may gods fauour increase our paine wee must neuer looke that it will yeeld vs comfort
for perseuerance is not a bare continuance in gods church and participation of his gifts it requireth that wee make vse of it and aduance his glorie
this by the way let vs come now to the particulars whereof the first is saluation

the fathers by this word vnderstand our sauiour christ and indeed old simeon calleth him so in his song taking christ in his armes he speaketh thus to god lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace for mine eyes haue seene thy saluation and saluation is included in the name of iesus therefore in the kings bibles the latine hath the name of iesu insteed of saluation

saint peter in the acts telleth vs that there is no other name vnder heauen by which we may be saued but only the name of iesus he is that salutare dei so often remembred in the prophets and the sauing grace of god mentioned in saint paul

but we must not vnderstand only the person by this name saluation but also the fruit that springeth from him spirituall and corporall
the spirituall haue handled vpon former verses it is the discharge from the from the corruption of sinne sinne which king dauid contracted himselfe sinne which hee inherited from his parents
iesus saued king dauid from them both this was his spirituall saluation

but he had a corporall also god was with him in all his warres and bare downe his enemies before him hee played with lions as kids and with beares as with lambes hee slue the giant goliah subdued the philistines and all the bordering nations whereupon the people sung those words

the king shall reioyce in thee lord how exceeding glad shall he be of thy saluation in the case of king dauid wee must ioyne all three significations first the person of iesus secondly the spirituall redemption thirdly the corporall deliuerance

this obserued touching the saluation we must now consider what is meant by ioy ioy told you is a comfortable sense betweene reasonable and vnreasonable creatures this is a speciall difference that though both partake of blessings from god yet a true sense of them none haue but those that are reasonable pleasure animals may haue but ioy they cannot haue for ioy is an affection of a reasonable soule
and reason hath taught naturall men not to receiue good but to be affected answerably to the good which we receiue
in things that belong to our naturall life euery man giueth proofe hereof if a man bee what comfort will he expresse if one shall bring him sustenance he that shall be eased when he is tortured with paine how merrie will hee bee and how will his heart dance for ioy that should be receiued againe into the kings fauour after some great disgrace whatsoeuer our worldly distresse is we cannot choose but manifest our content when wee obtaine a release
whereby we may easily gather that ioy and good should

goe together they doe so in god they should doe so in all that partake the image of god as hee so they should ioy in that which is good

a second thing that we must marke is that according to the good must the ioy be as great as manifold
as great heauenly things call for greater ioy then earthly and those things that concerne our eternall life must yeeld vs more comfort then those things that belong vnto our temporall
this discouers a great defect in the worlds ioy if our hungry bodies be sed wee ioy god daily feedeth our soules with his word and we ioy not if our bodies of sicke be made whole we ioy but who ioyeth in that medicine that restoreth his soule from death to life who ioyeth in the recouerie of gods fauour that would bee almost beside himselfe for ioy if hee might bee vouchsafed but a little fauour from a mortall king
so farre are worldly men from equalling their ioy vnto the worth of good that the greater good can haue no share while the lesser taketh vp all their ioy yea that whereunto the scripture hath in a manner appropriated ioy findeth little entertainment in our affections and that is the gospell and christ the substance thereof whose attendant the angels the prophets the apostles in the old in the new testament make to be the affection of ioy
in their sermons you shall find ioy and saluation coupled together they make the newes of saluation not only gaudium magnum a great ioy but also gaudium solum the only ioy

and that with an absit god forbid that reioyce but in the crosse of christ

how much to blame then are wee that are so farre from making it solum our only ioy that wee are not come so farre as to make it magnum matter of any extraordinary ioy yea in the most it findeth nullum no affection of ioy at all
what shall say then those things which god hath conioyned let no man put asunder least at the iudgement day ioy and we be put asunder when we shall wish but wish in vaine that god would ioyne vs together

as ioy must bee as great as the good we haue so must it bee also as manifold
a manifold good must not bee entertained with a single ioy
haue shewed that saluation is threefold and so a threefold good
dauid was a prophet and had reuelations of the incarnation of christ that hee should be borne of his seed that he should be the sauiour of the world and he ioyed in this saluation in this blessed contemplation of the kingdome of christ hee could not with abraham see that day but hee must needs reioyce
as the of christs incarnation wrought in him ioy so could he not reape the fruit thereof to his owne redemption but he must ioy also the participation of it cannot but bring pleasure which wee cannot but with great pleasure behold therefore no doubt but king dauids soule did sing his daughters magnificat and his spirit reioyced in god his sauiour
neither did his temporall deliuerance passe vnsaluted by this affection witnesse the eighteenth psalme which is nothing else but an amplification of the ioy which hee tooke therein
according to this good example should we learne to multiply our ioy as god multiplyeth his saluation
certainly the church meant wee should doe so when it multiplyed the feasts which in the old phrase of the

church are called gaudium gaudie dayes not so much from the corporall refection as from the spirituall exultation it meant we should ioyne ioy and saluation together spirituall ioy with spirituall saluation
but the corporall hath almost worne out the spirituall ioy so much more doth the comfort of our bodies carrie vs away then the comfort of our soules

but all this while we are not come vnto king dauids prayer the first branch of his prayer that concerneth this ioy of saluation
his prayer is as said for restitution restore hee that prayeth so giueth vs to vnderstand two things that he feeleth a want and that hee remembreth what is the supply thereof both good signes of grace
we hold it a signe of grace in regard of things temporall those poore and sicke that are in and paine we hold worthy of compassion when we heare there lamentable complaints but vagrants that euen in the prison being loaden with irons naked and halfe starued can be frollicke and glorie in their misery we hold as vnworthy of our pitie as they haue little feeling of their owne bad case
apply this now vnto our soules and see the difference betweene men and men and iudge thereby what regard they deserue to find at the hands of god
how many bee there that want this ioy of saluation in whom notwithstanding there appeareth little sense that they haue of such want surely they doe liue as if eternall saluation did nothing concerne them such are all prophane persons that say let vs eat let vs drinke to morrow we shall die quibus anima data eft pro sale ne putrescerent which make no more account of their soule then of a preseruatiue that keepeth their bodies from turning into dung whose labour is only to make themselues euerlasting fuell for hell
god regardeth them accordingly and they receiue as little of this ioy of saluation as they would seeme to want it
but if wee meane to receiue wee must first feele that we doe want and our want must be declared as king dauids was in this supplication restore
for god then begins to take pittie when men are brought to the knowledge of their wants yea he giueth men a sense of their want before he vouchsafeth a supply thereof
but redde doth not only imply a sense of want but a remembrance also of that which sometimes we had
it is a good thing for a man to bee feeling of his want but there is no small accesse made vnto that gracious sense if we apprehend withall that our want proceeds from our owne vnthristinesse that what wee want wee had and that it is through our owne fault that we are brought vnto this want
and indeed if euer wee be in want we want through our owne default for god made vs perfect and we became not naked but by eating the forbidden fruit and since that time men haue beene more or lesse vnthriftie and haue mispent the portion which god hath giuen them
therefore wee must not come to god with the simple verbe da that imports only that we are in want we must vse the compound redde we must confesse our selues prodigals that is the right voice of a christian penitent

but whereto shall we apply this restore to the saluation or to the ioy distinguish quod fieri debet quod fit our deseruing and gods dealing and the answere is plaine no doubt wee forfeit our saluation

god might strip vs of it if hee did reward vs according to our sinnes gods couenant is like a lease that hath a clause of but leaueth a power in the to vse extremitie or deale mercifully with his tenant god is vnto his children as a kind vnto bad tenants he doth not take forfeits as often as we make them hee doth not vpon our tenement nor strip vs of our saluation we are often damnable yet we are not damned
notwithstanding hee doth not suffer vs to scape when he doth not take the forfeiture hee taketh nomine poenae he doth inflict some penaltie yea and that a sharpe one too for he taketh euen from his dearest children the ioy of their saluation hee casteth them into sad moodes hee afflicteth them with heauie hearts when they looke vpwards they see cloudes cast ouer gods countenance and cannot but sorrow for it when they looke downe they see hels mouth gaping for them they cannot but tremble at it such agonies ouertake them and make them smart for their sinnes wherewith they offend god agonies say of sorrow and feare
take a similitude from the sunne which may make a day or a sunshine day while it is aboue our horizon it is often day when the sunne doth not shine but thicke clouds breathed from the earth make a sad skie as if it were night yet cannot we say the sunne is gone downe euen so many times are we in the state of saluation the sunne is with vs wee are children of the day yet haue wee no ioy of our saluation our sunne doth not shine wee haue no cleere day
but from king dauid you may learne that to bee sure of saluation will not content a religious heart except hee may haue the ioy thereof also
conclude this point let vs take heed that pleasure strip vs not of pleasure worldly of heauenly let vs not grieue god lest he grieue vs grieue him with sinne lest he grieue vs with sorrow for we see in king dauids example that god inflicts such penalties and if at any time we suffer so for our desert let vs not continue stupidly in this distressing want but importune him with king dauids restore restore mee to the ioy of thy saluation
and so much of the first part of the supplication

come now to the second from the restitution to the confirmation stablish me with a free spirit
where first we must see what spirit is here meant
there is a spirit in man and there is a spirit of god some vnderstand the one some vnderstand the other wil ioyne both together
for indeed the attribute belongs to both gods spirit is free and so is mans but gods by nature mans by grace couple gods spirit vnto mans and then you shal find the saying of the apostle true where the spirit of the lord is there is libertie

for it is the spirit of adoption and if thereby the sonne of god make vs free then are we free indeed
therefore told you that here by the spirit vnderstand our disposition
but this disposition of ours must bee considered as it is by nature so it is seruile as it becomes by grace so it is free
called it a generous disposition and indeed so the word signifieth

but to open it a little more fully

we learne of christ that sinne maketh a slaue it appeareth plainly in that which we call free will and the attendants thereon
freewill is resolued into the iudgement wee passe vpon

things and the choice wee make according to the iudgement now no man hath a more slauish iudgement then a wicked man for sin blindeth his eyes what he doth not desire he doth not beleeue and you shall seldome see a man possest with any enormous sinne in whom affected ignorance is not euident yea sinne maketh him put that out of all question which if he would vse his owne iudgement hee would find had no credibilitie
had it not beene for this seruilitie of iudgement pharaoh could neuer so long haue held out against moses israel haue murmured so often against god scribes and pharisees haue so fearefully blasphemed our sauiour christ the church of rome so shamefully withstand the truth and atheists so prophanely scoffe at the reproofe of their sinnes not one of these many leud ones which hath not a seruile iudgement
neither hath seruilitie taken possession only of our iudgement but of our will also wee can make no better choice then our iudgement will giue vs leaue if that be seruile this cannot be free
not free nay it were well if it were no more seruile then our iudgement but indeed it is much more for how often doe we see what we should doe and yet to please sinne chuse to doe the contrarie whether we be regenerate or whether we be vnregenerate for the text is vnderstood of both by seuerall diuines we may say with the apostle

see a law in my members rebelling against the law of my mind and carrying me captiue vnto sinne we haue vncircumcised hearts and doe resist the spirit of god
take an example or two the pharisees could not denie the resurrection of christ the souldiers brought them direct word of it but see what a peruerse choice they made

rather then they would giue glorie vnto god by acknowledging the truth they bribe the souldiers to it with a grosse lie
this seruilitie of there will is more plainly set downe in the acts
chap where after peter had healed a creeple in the name of iesus they therefore apprehended him and iohn and fall to this consultation what shall we doe to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath beene done by them is manifest to all them that dwell at ierusalem and wee cannot denie it a man would expect that their will should yeeld vnto such cleere euidence yet doth it not for marke how they resolue that it spread no further amongst the people let vs straightly threaten them that they speake henceforth to no man in this name
seruile will

neither are these principall faculties only but their attendants also seruile first the concupiscible or that faculty whereby we ensue what wee suppose good the seruilitie thereof is most palpable
god made all these visible creatures to serue vs and vs to serue only himselfe but what creature is there which man doth not aduance aboue himselfe yea deifie that he may be a drudge vnto it our meates and drinkes so rauish vs that esau sold his for a messe of pottage our money and wealth how base doth it make vs

there is nothing worse then a couetous man saith the sonne of syrach for such a man will sell his soule for a morsell of bread
the apostle calleth the couetous man a plaine idolater which is nothing else but a slaue to an idoll
and to whom is not an ambitious man a slaue whose eyes are obseruant of euery mans lookes

whose eares attend euery mans tongue whose tongue pleaseth euery mans humour whose feet goe whether whose hands doe what euery man will that can inch him forward to the place whereunto hee aspires
finally looke whatsoeuer humour possesseth vs there is no slauerie which for the satisfying thereof wee doe not willingly affect yea marke that the baser things are the stronger are mens affections that bow to them as we see in epicures wantons couetous and other wicked ones it is hard to see a man so humbly so earnestly to serue god as they doe serue their earthly lusts

neither is the irascible or the facultie wherewith we encounter difficulties while we pursue good lesse seruile then the concupiscible is in pursuing of vanitie and toyes it maketh pigmies seeme gyants vnto vs euery danger is as vgly as death euery frowne will ouer awe vs and the least terrour cast vs into a feuer
if we be put to it whether we will lose heauen or earth god or the world we will quickly betray with what resolution we are carried vnto the best things and how hardly we brook walking in the narrow way though it lead vnto the kingdome of heauen how hardly we endure momentany afflictions though they worke vnto vs an exceeding and eternall weight of glory

read the storie of the israelites passage from egypt to canaan in them you may read what we haue seruilitie hath so cowardized all our fortitude that we set lightly euen by god himselfe if we may not possesse him easily and speedily

need say no more by this time you see what a base and seruile spirit we haue certainly by nature it is most base and seruile
haue amplified this that you might see there is great reason why king dauid should make this prayer and perceiue better what that is which hee desireth and what he meaneth by a free spirit
hee meaneth not a libertines freedome hee would not bee a sonne of belial haue a cloake for licentiousnesse but hee would bee enthrawled to none but god
and indeed his seruice is perfect freedome he would haue his iudgement free he would walke by no light but by the light of heauen his vnderstanding he would haue captiuated only to the wisdome of god and then he is sure he shall neuer mistake his true obiect truth because gods word is truth and he can neuer erre whom god doth guide and verily hee is the wisest man that maketh gods commandement the rule of his iudgement his iudgement is free indeed
and what is a freewill sure that which chuseth the only good that whose souereigne good is only god he chuseth all that chuseth him so that hauing him the will misseth nothing of her proper obiect let it pitch vpon other goods and it will bee if not deluded yet certainly skanted because nothing can satisfie which is lesse then that for which the will was made

as grace doth thus free the reasonable facultie so doth it the sensitiue also it freeth our desires though there be no law to compell yet doth a man readily run the way of gods commandements he thinketh hee cannot speed fast enough nor haue enough of that good which a holy will guided by a wise iudgement recommends vnto him vnto him modus

diligendi deum est diligere sine modo hee drinkes himselfe drunke at the riuer of diuine pleasures and is so vnsatiable in that that he passeth in the world for a foole and a
this is the freedome of desire it made king dauid daunce in an ephod before the arke it made abraham follow god whithersoeuer hee did call him and many holy men to affect solitarinesse that they might haue the more of the societie of god and his angels such a desire is no hireling it loueth good for good and will serue god onely out of the content it taketh in his seruice and such seruice god requireth and such a desire is a free desire

the last facultie that is free is the irascible the courage of a man must be made free saint paul hath exprest that excellently rom
who shall separate vs from the loue of christ shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakednesse or perill or sword no am perswaded that neither death nor life neither angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor heigth nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate vs from the loue of god which is in christ iesus
behold a free courage such a martyrs courage as will readily obey and runne to christ though he must be loaden with the crosse that will be contented to hate father and mother wife children if they hinder him from being christs disciple
put these together and you may reasonably conceiue what king dauid meaneth by a free spirit
and such freedome is to be desired by vs all we must all desire to be so free in our iudgement will desires courage and so we shal become generous persons such as stoupe to no base things and shall sticke at the bestowing of nothing we haue though it bee our owne selues whereby we may compasse the true the soueraigne good

there is one thing moreouer meant by this phrase which is peculiar vnto dauid and doth somwhat concerne all those that are in authority

and that is an heroicall spirit

god gaue him one when hee anointed him first to be king so did he vnto moses

and the elders which were chosen to assist him
though euery child of god must by a noble spirit testifie his parentage and that kingly degree whereunto he is called of god yet they that are set ouer others must haue a principall spirit in a higher measure answerable to their charge must their gifts be seruilitie beseemes none lesse then those who are appointed guides to lead others out of thraldome

the next point is king dauids prayer vphold or stablish
his late wofull experience had taught him that he was labilis and fragilis that he was apt to take a fall and with the fall a bruise therefore hee had good reason to pray god to hold him vp to strengthen him yea the best are mutable creatures as they were made of nothing so of themselues they would turne to nothing againe
therefore hee that standeth must pray that he may not fall that his house rest not vpon the sands to be blowen downe by the winds or borne downe by the waues but vpon a rocke which will hold out against them both

secondly this word importeth that he that hath recouered a fall

desires that he may no more relapse vilificat libertatem qui iterùm vult amittere

it is a shrewd argument that he setteth light by a free spirit that doth not desire as well for to keepe it as for to haue it and the desire for to keepe it doth argue at how deare a rate we set it

thirdly saint bernards rule is true quae modo sunt modo non sunt is qui verè est non acceptat nec in caducis istis potest vera aeternitas sibi complacere
vertue be it neuer so eminent pleaseth not god except it bee lasting he will haue euery one striue to resemble him as well in constancie as in sanctitie

finally this comfortable sense and generous spirit are the two supporters of perseuerance for what should moue him to fall from god that is heartned with the comfortable sense of gods fauour and established by a generous spirit to doe him seruice therefore gregorie the great giueth vs a good note

that if wee meane to perseuere wee must take heed that we doe not seuer these solet quibusdam contingere it falleth out too often saith he that men luld a sleepe with the ioy of saluation forget how feeble their knees are and begge not to be held vp with a free spirit and so slip before they are aware wherefore he addeth ita me correctum sac gaudere de veniâ vt tamen nunquam desinam esse suspectus de culpâ let me neuer so ioy in the pardon of my sinnes as that out of the consciousnesse of my owne frailtie should not desire to be strengthned against sinne

the last thing noted vpon this text is who is the giuer of these gifts and it appeareth to bee god for to him king dauid prayeth and what better proofe then that euery man seeketh it of him and thanketh him

if that he haue it what meane we saith saint cyprian by all the lords prayer nisi vt in eo quod esse cepimus perseueremus whereunto agreeth saint augustine and the apostle telleth vs that he that glorieth must glorie in the lord vntill we come to god we can find no ground of stabilitie how glorious were the angels in heauen how holy was adam in paradise both left vnto themselues are monuments of the frailtie of a creature
if they how much more we that come so short of their gifts wherefore god hauing shewed vs how little stedfastnesse there is in the foundation of nature

buildeth vs vpon a surer foundation he buildeth vs vpon himselfe hee is become our refuge and the strength of our considence

and as he only can establish vs with a free spirit so only he can restore vnto vs the ioy of his saluation
the earth may breath forth vapours and intercept the but not the earth but the sunne it selfe must dispell those vapours that with his brightnesse hee may cheere the earth againe our sinnes may cloud the light of gods countenance only gods mercie can make it breake through that cloude and shed a comfortable influence into our soule say only god that for sinne withdrew it from vs

it is not meant that hereupon we should grow idle but wee must not our endeuours

wee must take heed that our lampes goe not out that there be not in any of vs an euill heart of infidelitie to depart from the liuing god

we must gird vp our loines and we must watch
but yet

wee must still remember that except the lord build the house they labour but in vaine that build it except the lord keepe the citie the watchman waketh but in vaine tutiores saith saint austin

viuimus si totum deo damus non nos illi ex parte nobis ex parte committimus wee are most secure while we value our owne endeauours at nought and giue all the glorie of our stabilitie to god
heare yee me house of iacob and all that remayne of the house of israel which are borne of mee from the wombe and brought vp of me from the birth therefore vnto the old age am the same euen will beare you vnto the hoarie haires haue made you will also beare you and will carrie you and will deliuer you
if god put his feare into our hearts we shall not depart from him if hee keepe vs none shall be able to take vs out of his hand
reade colos

philip


conclude though we can say with saint paul

haue fought a good sight haue finished my course haue kept the faith there is laid vp for me a crowne of righteousnesse which god the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day yet let vs with the foure and twentie elders cast downe our selues and our crownes before him that sitteth vpon the throne and the lambe saying

prayse and honour and glorie and power be vnto him that sitteth vpon the throne and to the lambe for euermore
amen

epigraph

psal
verse
then will teach transgressors thy wayes and sinners shall bee conuerted vnto thee

when brake vp the first part of this psalme told you that it was a vow and therefore obserued therein the parts of a vow a desire and a promise for when a man voweth there is something that he would receiue and something that hee must render render out of thankfulnesse for that which out of the goodnesse of god he receiues
haue ended the first of these two parts king dauids desire hath beene vnfolded vnto you the briefe whereof is he desired to be restored vnto and preserued in the state of grace
let vs now goe on and heare king dauids promise heare what he will render thankfully if god vouchsafe mercifully to grant his desire king dauid doth promise that hee will religiously serue god this is the summe of his promise
but in the pursuite of this point we shall be led to see first of what kind his seruice is and then what reason hee giueth for his choice
gods seruice is either morall or ceremoniall

the seruice which king dauid doth promise is morall this is plaine in my text and the two following verses
will you know the reason of this his choice you haue it in the
and
verses the reason is gods good pleasure his choice is guided by that god delighteth more in morall

then in ceremoniall seruice absolutely he doth so and especially in pacification for such enormous such hainous sinnes

but let vs looke into the morall seruice which he promiseth there me thinkes the first thing see is that kiing dauid hath sped of that which he desired last he desired a free a liberall spirit and surely but from a free a liberall spirit so large a promise could not proceed
his promise taketh vp both tables of the decalogue his dutie to god his dutie to his neighbour
his dutie to his neighbour he will edifie others his dutie to god he will glorifie him
at this time will insist only vpon his promise to edifie his neighbour for that is the proper argument of my text wherein shall shew you first seuerally what meanes he vseth and what successe he hoped for
the meanes are the teaching of gods wayes gods wayes the best of lessons but such a lesson as cannot be knowne without teaching
his successe is the conuersion of those that are taught
but more distinctly in the teaching wee must consider quis quos who is the master and what schollers hee taketh in hand
the master is king dauid king dauid newly conuerted by grace ego docebo will teach
but whom transgressors sinners those that are such as was and indeed such schollers need such a master those that goe astray such a one as is newly returned home
this we must obserue in the teaching
and in the conuerting we must moreouer obserue vnde quo from whence and vnto whom these schollers shall returne
whence that is implyed in their name transgressors sinners then must they returne from their transgressions and from their sinnes that is from their owne wayes
but whether vnto god from whom they went vnto him they must returne and to returne vnto god is to returne vnto gods wayes and so to learne the lesson which their master teacheth them
hauing thus seuerally considered the meanes and the successe wee will consider them ioyntly wee will see how fitly they are coupled together
there is no true conuersion without teaching and teaching must worke that conuersion which must bring a sinner vnto god
you heare the particulars wherat god willing shall now touch pray god may so doe it that wee may all carrie away a true touch thereof

but first you must take a lesson from the connection of the parts of king dauids vow of his promise with his desire and the lesson is wee must not be vnthankfull when god is mercifull vnto vs not that god can be bettered by ought which we doe for the psalmist doth teach bonum meum nihil ad te

my good reacheth not vnto thee but we should testifie that we receiue not gods grace in vaine our fruit must shew what trees wee are and because we are it by an others gift ingenuiest agnoscere imitari benefactorem suum there is no truer character of ingenuitie then an humble acknowledging whose creatures we are and a careful resembling of our creatour
especially seeing our gifts are bestowed vpon vs not only vt ornamenta but instrumenta not only to recommend vs but also for the good of others
we see it in the frame of the whole world in heauen

and in earth neither of them is more beautifull then vsefull yea the more glorious the more commodious are the parts of the great world which should make our little world blush if wee vse our indowments as many doe their garments for pride and not for profit that fooles may gaze on vs and no body be the better for vs
this lesson we must take in the way

let vs now come to the particulars whereof the first is the meanes that are vsed the teaching of gods wayes
gods wayes told you is the best of lessons for wee are in this world viatores men and what should men spend their studie vpon but that which is answerable to their name that is a way
yea seeing we are not only wayfaring men but as the apostle teacheth peregrinamur a domino

we are absent from the lord what other wayes should we studie but vias domini the lords wayes the wayes that are here mentioned in my text
surely that must needes be the safest way for it is sine diuerticulo sine praecipitio it is a very straight way it hath no turnings where a man may lose himselfe and it tends all vpward no feare of tumbling into the gulfe of perdition

but the way of the lord though in it selfe but one is yet considered two wayes first as god doth trauell in it vnto vs secondly as we walke in it vnto god for both causes it is called via domni and good reason for god is such a lord as doth praeire not onely praecepto but also exemplo he leadeth vs not onely by good lawes but also by his owne good deedes and doth before vs whatsoeuer he commands
if hee command vs to be holy iust true mercifull

the lord himselfe is righteous in all his wayes and holy in all his workes and in another psalme all the wayes of the lord are mercie and truth
but what need any more proofe

when our goodnesse is but his image and our liuing well but a shewing forth of the vertues of him that hath called vs so that if a man were to choose a way

hee can desire no better then the way which the king doth goe in himselfe and can a christian haue a better then is the way of god

way or wayes the holinesse is but one but it sheweth it selfe in many formes in wisedome in righteousnesse in temperance in patience in whatsoeuer other vertue the charitie is still but one but such a one as is able to giue fit entertainement to euery obiect and because the entertainement is various wee reade sometime vias the wayes of the lord and wee reade sometimes via because the charitie is alwayes but one and we should haue such grace as may answere all occasions neither is it true regenerating grace that is vnprepared for any alteration that can beare prosperitie but not aduersitie that can conuerse with god but not with men that can not bee militant as well as triumphant
this propertie is a good toueh stone for euery man to trie his grace thereby

but to leaue the lesson and come to the teaching
the way is such as no man can goe without a guide and no maruell for no man euer went it twice no man euer passed from earth to heauen and being there came downe to the earth to returne to heauen againe haply if he did he might haue remembred the way and so goe it the second time without a guide but god alloweth not a second iourney to heauen therefore is euerie

man a stranger in this way whereupon it must needes follow that euerie man doth need a guide or else he cannot be sure that he goeth a right especially seeing the way he must goe is bee set on either side with so many broad but pathes
teaching then is necessarie for those that meane to goe the way

hauing thus in a generalitie shewed you the meanes that is vsed wee must now distinctly consider quis quos who is the master ego king dauid saith he will take vpon him to be the master
but king dauid must be considered as a newly conuerted paenitentiarie as one restored vnto and established in the state of grace he had plucked out the beame out of his owne eye before hee offered to plucke the moates out of his brothers eye hee was illightned himselfe before he offered to illighten others and he would not purge others before hee was purged himselfe

nazianzene hath a good rule cauendum est ne admirandae virtutis malipictores simus we must take heede that we blurre not the vertue which we desire to limme
a man that goeth about to teach another the wayes of god is by that father resembled vnto a painter that draweth gods image vpon his brother now he accounts him a good painter that is himselfe a good patterne of the virtue that he doth teach but hee is but a bad painter that blotteth out with his life what hee painteth with his tongue who may bee cast off with that scornefull medice cur a teipsum who will beleeue him whose deedes discredit his words dauid was not such a painter he taught not others before he had learned himselfe

but how did he teach two wayes exemplo verbo his very case was a good sermon a sermon of the wayes of god of his way of iustice of his way of mercie dauid was a monument of both
a monument of gods iustice who though he were a man after gods owne heart yet did god not suffer his sinnes vncorrected
a monument of gods mercie for though his sinnes were very grieuous yet vpon his vnfeined repentance they were graciously pardoned
so did he teach by his example teach men not to presume because in him they may see god is iust teach them not to despaire because in him they may perceiue that god is exceeding mercifull
as he teacheth by example so doth hee by his word also witnesse this psalme wherein he taught the church in his time teacheth vs now and shall teach men vntill the worlds end for what is the contents thereof but this come vnto me hearken vnto me
will shew you will teach you what god hath done and for my soule

adde hereunto that dauid was a king and his care that hee voweth may goe for a teaching for kings communicate in the name of pastors in the scriptures they are more then once called by the name of shepheards and constantine the emperour said well that kings were episcopi ad extra they haue a kind of bishopricke and must be carefull of the ghostly of their charge
but we may not mistake dauid did not take vpon him the as vzziah his successor did and was plagued for doing it he kept himselfe within his bounds hee did but that which all that are trusted with ciuill authoritie are bound to doe except

what in this kind he did as a penitent or as a prophet and his example is a good admonition for of all his ranke all in his case yea it may admonish all it was caines voice that said numquid ego sum custos fratris am my brothers keeper yea god hath giuen saith the sonne of syrack a charge vnto euery man concerning his brother
the law will not suffer a man to neglect his brothers oxe or his asse going astray or sinking vn his burden hath god care of oxen or doth he not intimate there how much more wee must care for the master of those beastes it is the propertie of good men that the good which they receiue from god they dispense to others and are as carefull of other mens saluation as of their owne according to the rule thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe

we haue found the master let vs now seeke out the schollers wee find them here to bee transgressors sinners an vntoward subiect you would thinke for a master to worke vpon to tame such colts and bring such persons to a better course and yet nihil aptius nihil acceptius no schollers are more fit to be vndertaken by such a master and such a master cannot better please the master of masters that is god then by vndertaking of such schollers vndertaking to teach transgressors and sinners to teach them gods wayes that haue gone farthest our of the way for such must you vnderstand by these words
it is euerie mans worke to set them forward that are in the way to teach the righteous it is a harder taske to fetch them in that are gone out and such a master must put himselfe to the hardest taske
a souldier that hath plaid the coward cannot recouer the reputation of a valiant man by aduenturing no farther then ordinarie souldiers but by vndertaking some dangerous assault or trying his valour vpon an enemie of note and no teaching is worthy of a conuert but the teaching of those that are much auerse for how should hee shew that he doth throughly detest sinne that hauing rooted it out of himselfe can indure it in another no his owne passion will fill him with compassion the remembrance of the losse which himselfe sustained of the smart which himselfe hath felt the experience say of this double euill will not suffer him to stand as an idle spectator while the spirituall thiefe the murderer doth spoyle doth slaughter others he will be aiding to such forlorne ones with his best with his readiest succour
adde hereunto that they that are conuerted were corrupters while they were in the state of sinne they led many out of the way and who doth it be seeme better to be stir themselues for the recouerie of sinners then they by whom many haue beene made sinners it is fit that by this care they doe redeeme that fault surely diues in hell shewed a desire of such a thing when he praied abraham to send teachers to his brethren who might reclaime them before they came to hell it implieth a sorrow though a fruitlesse one which he had for that hee had corrupted them and he is worse then diues who being conscious to himselfe that he hath beene an instrument of others doth not desire to conuert at least as many as he hath corrupted

as there is nothing fitter for such a master then the dealing with such schollers so there is nothing wherein hee can better please his master

god by taking with such schollers
god is compared vnto an husbandman all the world is his farme now you know a good farmer that hath many pcels of ground ouer growne with bryars and thornes taketh great comfort to see them grubbed vp and the ground made good pasture or arable euen so god who would haue all men and come to the knowledge of his truth is well pleased with their that are instruments thereof therefore doth he conuert some that by them hee may conuertothers you may it out of christs words to saint peter

haue prayed for thee that thy faith should not faile tuantem confirmafratres when thou art conuerted streng then thy brethren

this lessen is excellently shadowed in a vision of ezekiels where the waters running from the sanctuarie into the dead sea healed it and presently vpon the bankes grew vp of life of which we read in the on

that their leaues were for the healing of the nations
and indeed all the famous conuerts that we read of euer thought they could not dee god better seruice will instance but in two saint paul and saint austin saint paul had beene a persecutor a blasphemer hee obtained mercie and god put him into the ministerie that as his eyes were opened so he might open the eyes of others and what paines did he take

becomming all to all that hee might winne some to christ
saint austins confessions shew what his first life was how sicke he was in head and heart in faith and life and his workes doe shew how carefull he was after god gaue him the light of his truth and feare of his name to reforme others and heretickes and worke into them a true knowledge and loue of god
conclude this point as many of vs as find grace at any time must after the patterne of king dauid labour to present some conuert sinner as an eucharisticall sacrifice vnto god
and let this suffice for the vnfolding of the meanes that this king doth vse

come now to the successe which is hoped for which is a conuersion
conuersion is not a locall motion but a morall change the making of vs of old new men a as saint paul calleth it a changing of vs into a new image
but the nature of this conuersion will better appeare if first vnfold vnto you the two termes vnde quo from whence and to whome sinners are conuerted
from whence you cannot better learne then by their names they are called transgressors such as leaue gods wayes to follow their owne the deuices of their owne braine the desires of their owne heart
god made man saith the scripture after his owne image but the image of god in man was much like the image of the sunne in the moone so long as the moone is in opposition to the sunne we see what a goodly light body it hath no sooner doth it diuert to either side but it soone loseth its light euen so a man keeping himselfe towards god receiueth an impression of his sacred image which vanisheth when he turneth himselfe from god
yea you see daily that when you walke in the sunne if your face be toward it you haue nothing before you but bright shining light and comfortable heat turne your backe to the sunne and what haue you before you

but a shadow and what is a shadow but the priuation of the light and heate of the sunne yea it is but to behold your owne shadow that you defraud your selfe of the other for there is no true wisdome no true happinesse but onely in beholding the countenance of god looke from that and we loose these blessings and what shall wee gaine a shadow an emptie image insteade of a substantiall to gaine an emptie image of our selues we loose the solid image of god and yet this is the common folly of the world men preferre this shadow before that substance

when we are willed to turne we must remember that wee are auerse from god when we goe our owne wayes we turne our backes to god as the scripture teacheth euerie of our wayes goeth from him and when we conuert we must turne from our owne wayes our euill wayes for such are all ours we must cast away the workes of darknesse put off the old man so the scripture varieth the phrase of conuersion
but there are three conditions that must be obserued in our conuersion
first

it must be ab omnibus vijs malis god loueth not mungrels if a man haue beene a drunkard an adulterer a swearer hee may not leaue his drunkennesse and retaine his swearing leaue swearing and follow whooring therefore moses tels the israelites that they must returne to god toto corde with their whole heart
a second condition is deliuered by esay

conuertimini sicut in profundum recessistis looke how profoundly wee entertaine sinne so deepe must our conuersion goe wee must search our wounds to the very bottome we must leaue no creeke vnaltered it must bee verum cor our inside must be like our outside so saith paul heb
thirdly our conuersion must be constant wee must not bee like vnto lots wise whose feet caried her from sodome and her eyes were backe vpon it that will argue that we repent of our resolution and that we can easily be perswaded to become againe what we were before
this is the first branch of conuersion we must if we returne so remooue iniquitie farre from our tabernacle yea from our selues

the next branch is to whom we must returne if you will returne returne vnto me saith god in the prophet many doe returne but it is from one vanity to another such a turning as salomon describeth in ecclesiastes and there are examples euery where many of prodigall turne couetous and of profuse become base many a stoicke turneth epicure and of senslesse becommeth shamelesse many an atheist turneth superstitious and as if he did repent that he had beene long without a god maketh his fancie the forge of gods of such turning there is too much in the world
but our returne here meant is a returne to him from whom wee went we went from god therefore to him we must teturne againe lost sheepe that we are we must returne to our shepheard from whose fold wee straied the onely and great shepheard of our soules prodigals that we are we must returne to the father that we forsooke euen to our father which is in heauen or to keepe my former simile we turned from the sunne to the shadow and so became darke and cold ignorant and vntoward we must turne from the shadow to the sunne againe that we may bee light and warme and recouer againe the knowledge and the loue of god
a

quo habet homo vt sit

apud ill im habet vt benè sit if at any time we bee ill wee must not looke that it will be well with vs vntill we come to god that made vs

put now these two points together vndè and quò and we may resonably conceiue what conuersion is it is that which by another word is called repentance and indeede the word in the originall doth import that vertue
but marke that whereas repentance is a compound thing of our turning from the world and turning vnto god it hath its name rather from turning vnto god then turning from the world turning from the the world hath no commendations in it except it be to the end that wee may turne vnto god as also turning to the world is no sinne it deserueth no blame vnlesse in doing it we turne from god the offence is properly in turning from god as repentance consists properly in turning vnto god

such a kind of turning is the successe which king dauid hoped would follow vpon his teaching conuertentur the sinners the transgressors will be conuerted if teach them thy way a confident speech yet very likely whether you looke vpon vias tuas thy wayes or docebo will bee the master gods wayes are gods lawes now of gods lawes we read in another psalme

that they are perfect conuerting the soule his testimonies are sure

and giue wisedome to the simple they are the power of god vnto saluation in them is the euidence of the spirit they are sharper then any two edgedsword sinally they are able to make a man wise vnto saluation there is then good hope of conuersion from the efficacie of gods lawes and indeede they are able to worke fidem infusam a sauing faith

docebo is a good ground of hope also for that is able to worke fidem acquisitam a morall perswasion it worketh that which maketh way to the other while what we thinke credible by reason of the speaker wee are wrought to belieue by the word which hee speaketh wicked men commonly scorne good men as fooles when they tell them of the vanitie of the world and the danger of sinne they suppose because that they had neuer any experimentall acquaintance with it the iudge of it most absurdly but when they shall haue a nebucadnezzar an antiochus one that hath beene as deepe in sinne as themselues can goe turne penitent declaime against dehort from an ill life they cannot but muse they cannot but doubt they cannot but bethinke themselues in what state they stand
or if they may shift of such a teacher because they thinke noueltie doth abuse his iudgement and the nature of man is delighted with change yet when they shall heare a salomon a dauid a prodigall that was first in the state of grace and hauing fallen foule into sinne is come to himselfe againe and vpon an experimentall comparison of both passeth an indifferent iudgement giueth grace giueth sinne each his due his thundrings and lightnings against sinne cannot but shake the greatest oakes the tallest cedars make the obstinatest sinners to tremble and bring them vpon their knees to sing the psalme of mercie the adder that cannot be charmed by this inchanter will neuer be rid of his poyson vntill his poyson riddeth him his case is desperate hee that will not

heare a penitent malefactor will neuer be conuerted by any preacher

haue dwelt long enough on the vnfolding of the meanes and the successe as we are to looke into them seuerally let vs now in a word or two consider them ioyntly and see how reasonable it is that those meanes be vsed for this successe teaching for conuerting
a man is a reasonable creature and conuersion is an act of the reasonable soule and therefore not to be expected but from meanes that can worke our reason ordinarie meanes of this kind there is none but teaching feare of the sword may the outward man and hinder vs from doing what wee would but it cannot alter the inward man and make vs well what wee should whether it be truth or goodnesse that is commended vnto vs it is not but instructing that must make vs belieue the one and loue the other magistrates may compell to the vse of the meanes but without the naturall meanes no hope that euer any one will entertaine these vertues
the more barbarous hath beene and is the tyrannie of the church of rome which vseth the inquisition insteed of instruction and laboureth to conuert soules by subuerting of whole states

secondly as without teaching there is no conuerting so if a man should be conuerted without teaching his conuersion cannot please god

for quicquid non est ex fide est peccatum as good that were neuer done which we doe without the guidance of our conscience because god looketh that in his seruice especially wee should shew our selues reasonable
wherefore let vs leaue monkes to their blind obedience and the superstitious papist to his implicit faith let vs turne to god but so that we first be taught his wayes let not our conuersion out runne our instruction let them walke hand in hand together

conclude there is not one of vs which doth not sometime or other by bad counsell or euill example mislead others out of the way what must we doe then we learne here of king dauid let vs by good counsell by good example bring them or some others into the way againe the rather because it is a worke of the highest perfection to be gods instrument to bring sinners from hell to heauen

daniel hath foretold that teachers shall shine as starres in the firmament and saint paul that the conuerted shall be the conuerters crowne and glorie in the day of the lord

lordwe are all apt to goe astray and how many stumble at vs that fall before vs when thou doest vs the fauour to lend vs thy hand let not vs denie ours to them that are downe let vs teach them what thou hast taught vs and let it profit no worse with them then it doth with vs let vs both be conuerted thereby and let vs each hasten other in our returne toward thee let vs be carefull to saue not our selues onely but others also that each may bee the others ioy when we shall both be presented spotlesse and blamelesse at the appearing of christ

psal
verse
deliuer me from bloud guiltinesse god thou god of my saluation and my tongue shall sing aloude of thy righteousnesse

the religious seruice which king dauid vowed is the edifying of others and the grifying of god how he will edifie others you haue heard and are to heare how he will glosie god
god may be glorified either in regard of the particular sauom sheweth vs or the generall worth that is in himselfe dauid promiseth to glorifie god in both respects
at this time my text doth occasion me to speake of the former wherein will obserue first a spirituall pange taketh his deuotion and then the deuotion it selfe
in the pange we shall see what he seeleth and to whom he slieth he feeleth a sting of conscience a remorse of and being pained herewith he seeketh for ease he crieth deliuer
but he seeketh discretly and ardently discretly for he seeketh to him that can deliuer to the lord who is interested in the consciences of his creatures and as he can so he will he is the god of his childrens saluation
this is his discretion which he warmeth with zeale hee is earnest in his petition which you may gather out of the doubling of the name of god deus deus salutis meae
hauing thus ouercome the spirituall pange that interrupted him hee falleth to his deuotion wherein you must marke first the argument that he insisteth vpon and that is god righteousnesse secondly the manner how he doth extoll it which is publike and cheerefull publike for hee will vtter it by his tongue cheerefull for his tongue shall sing aloude
these bee the particulars which wee must now looke into farther and in their order
and first of spirituall pangs in generall

king dauid had a pardon of this sinne particularly besides a generall promise that god would neuer withdraw his grace from him and yet we find him here perplext and distrest in conscience
though did on a former verse touch at the reasons hereof yet will it not be amisse that a little farther enlarge this point
there can be no doubt but gods truth is infallible he cannot denie himselfe hee will neuer recall his word but yet quicquid recipitur recipitur ad modum recipientis the vertues wherewith we entertaine gods promises are as wee are imperfect because we art partly flesh and partly spirit our faith is not without doubting if their be imperfection in our faith which is the foundation of our spirituall life our hope will be answerable it will not be without distrusting neither will our charitie be better we cannot so loue but we will feare and why could we cast our eyes onely vpon god his goodnesse must needes appeare wonderfull and so leaue a kind of amazednesse in vs neither

can we easily beleeue that he should vouchsafe such fauor vnto man but we more often cast our eyes vpon our selues vpon our wickednesse whereby we haue broken gods lawes vpon our vnthankfulnesse which haue set light by gods blessings and this is able to stagger our faith much more especially when the serpent shall plie vs with the representation of gods iustice thereby indeauouring to our meditations vpon his mercies and shall presse vnto our conscience the imperfection of our faith hope and charitie so farre as to perswade vs that they haue no truth at all
spring those spirituall pangs in so much that euen in those which by grace haue giuen sinne a deadly wound you shall perceiue many pangs as it were of spirituall death and as men that are recouered out of an ague haue many troublesome grudgings thereof that disquiet them not a little euen so penitents aster enormous sinnes must looke for many a smarting twitch of the worme of conscience

but to leaue spirituall pangs in generall and come to that which in particular is toucht here in my text he feeles are morse of the euill he feeles is exprest by the name of blouds so the word is in the originall and is vsed to note either our originall corruption or actuall sinne king dauid in the former part of this psalme confesseth both that sinne that he inherited from his parents and that which hee contracted himselfe therefore of the interpreters some pitch vpon the former and some the later
saint austin pitcheth vpon the originall sinne and supposeth that dauid was moued with remorse of his corrupt nature which is the cause of all sinne and indeede they that are borne in concupiscence are said to be borne of flesh and bloud

and saint paul meaneth that wee must put off that before we can be fully blest when he saith that flesh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of heauen
finally it is that where at god pointeth ezek
when he speaketh thus to the church when passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine owne bloud said vnto thee in thy bloud liue
the reason of the phrase is because vitaest in sanguine as the law speaketh the animall life subsisteth in the bloud and the abundance of bloud is the fuell of concupiscence whereupon some coniecture not improbably that to note this the legall expiation of sinne was made by the effusion of bloud

some goe not so farre as originall sinne but vnderstand the word of actuall which is the fruit of originall and because of actuall sins some are by diuines called spirituall some carnall spirituall such as mooue from and are transacted principally by the reasonable faculties of the soule and haue but sequelam a concomitancie of animall carnall those that are suggested from and acted by the animall soule principally and haue but a concomitancie of the rationall by blouds they vnderstand that later kind of sinne
and indeede such were the sinnes whereof king dauid had now remorse his adulterie his murder both sprang from bloud adulterie from bloud luxuriant which made him transgresse in his concupiscible facultie murder from bloud ebullient which made him transgresse in his irascible facultie the word sanguines being plurall is by the

fathers obserued to note plentie and varietie of sinne some in one word parallell it with the first verse of this psalme where dauid mencioneth all his iniquities and then there is a synecdoche in the word species pro+genere the carnall sinnes put for all kind of sinnes which some resolue into sinnes past present and to come
but it is best to keepe our selues vnto the argument of that storie whereunto this psalme alludes and then varietie shall note adulterie and murder and plentie shall consist in the many murders that followed the adultery vriah was treacherously slaine and that he might be slaine treacherously many others were slaine with him and these murders brought out another murder euen the murder of dauids owne child for though he died iustly by gods hand yet was dauid the murderer of him by reason of his sinne to say nothing of absolons rebellion which shed much bloud and was denounced for this sinne of dauid dauid attending vnto these manifold iniquities of his doth wrap them vp all in this word blouds as being all the euill fruites of his sinfull flesh and bloud

but we must not vnderstand onely sinne by the name of blouds the scripture applieth the word vnto the punishment of sinne also and noteth

that all sinne proueth bloudy to the sinner and therefore the apostle obserueth that without shedding of bloud there is no expiation for sinne whereupon it followeth that all sinnes are mortall and doe slay the sinner

but of all sinnes this is especially true of murder the law in deutronomic doth intimate as much when it doth require so curious an expiation of vncertaine murder yea before moses dayes god exprest so much vnto noah not onely mystically when he forbids the eating of bloud but literally when he saith hee will require both from man and beast

yea he doth so abhorre murder and pursue it vnto death that hee commands that whosoeuer hath wilfully shed bloud shall bee violently taken from his altar if hee take sanctuarie there and bee put to death

goe higher to the old world and there see how murder is iustly called bloudy and proueth mortall to the murderer
caine was the first that shed bloud and caine is recorded for a monument of gods vengeance lamech speaketh fully who is thought by some to haue flaine caine and so to haue paide home bloud with bloud

haue slaine a man saith hee to my wounding and a young man to my hurt that is the stabbe which haue giuen to another proues a deadly wound vnto my selfe in murdering him haue become mine owne murderer so that in effect dauid in the phrase intimateth thus much bloud calleth for bloud and deserue to haue my bloud shed that haue shed anothers
this was that that perplext him the conscience of this was the worme that gnawed him

and no wonder he had heard from nathan that he might not build gods house because he had shed much bloud and yet the bloud which he had then shed was onely the bloud of the enemies of israel and it was iustly shed in battell how farre then might hee well thinke himselfe estranged from god that had so treacherously so villainously spilt the bloud of his owne subiects of his faithfull seruant yea of his owne child saint ambrose obserueth that seeing dauid was of so gentle a nature that

he spared the bloud of his aduersarie saul we cannot thinke but he grieued much when hee found himselfe with a sinne which the goodnesse of his nature so much abhorred gesse at his disposition by his speech vnto abigal who wisely charmed him when in a moode he would haue destroyed churlish nabal and all his family blessed bee the lord god of israel saith dauid to abigal which sent thee this day to meete me and blessed be thy aduice and blessed be thou which hast kept mee this day from comming to shed bloud
it were to bee wished that christian kings had as tender hearts and were as easily pacified as they are enraged there would not be so much christian bloud shed neither would they bee such vnnaturall butchers of their owne subiects
or because that is rather to be wished then hoped for though it would make much for the publike good that murder were preuented yet would at least that when it is committed princes were not so altogether without remorse of that which they haue done and in godly sorrow would imitate king dauid and be timely feeling of their offence and prouide for the safetie of their soules
though dauid were a king and free from the danger of his owne law yet found he a controller in his owne bosome and was indicted by his owne conscience from which the greatest monarches cannot free themselues nero emperour of the romanes richard the third an vsurper in this kingdome are in seuerall histories reported to haue felt the vexation of this furie and the biting of the worme and if monarches are not free how shall meaner men bee priuiledged and yet cannot without griefe behold the senselessenesse of many that embrew their hands in bloud whether in their cups or for their honour and neuer call themselues to an account neuer iudge themselues before they are iudged of the lord but smother their owne conscience with frollicke liuing vntill their wofull ends make them fearefull examples vnto others
it were well for them if they felt more smart that they might with king dauid desire ease and crie out deliuer

the word is vox confligentis or ingementis ingementis groaning vnder the slauerie of sinne peccatiseruitvs pessima sinne is the worst kind of and therefore no wonder if it force a crie and as the children of israel in their aegyptian bondage so men enthrawled spiritually crie deliuer
or if it bee not vox gementis it is vox confligentis dauid was now in a hard conflict a conflict with remorse of sinne a conflict with the feare of punishment both were able to wrest from him this word deliuer
sinne is compared to an armed man by the sonne of syracke all iniquitie saith he is as a two edged sword

the wounds whereof cannot bee healed it is there compared also to a serpent which will bite to the teeth of a lyon which slaies the soules of men he therefore counselleth vs to flie from it yea and we had neede crie out too sinne maketh a hideous crie against vs it crieth in the eares of the lord and calleth for vengeance it crieth in our conscience and gineth vs no rest there is good reason therefore why wee should crie out deliuer deliuer vs from the inward from the outward crie which so distresseth which so afflicteth

but when we crie out against the crie of bloud wee must remember

that there is mors sicca as well as mors humida many doe murder that shed no bloud si non pauisti occidisti hee that suffereth the poore to perish for want of food is plainely a murderer how much more if hee take their liuing from them whosoeuer doth either of these had neede pray deliuer me from bloud guiltinesse bloud euerie day and euerie where toucheth bloud as hosea speaketh and yet we see little remorse and few there are that with king dauid pray deliuer that pray to be loosed from the bands wherein they haue ensnared themselues and to bee eased of their guilt

told you before that bloud doth not onely signifie actuall but originall sinne and so the fathers some of them vnderstand king dauids desire as if he meant that he would not any longer be flesh and bloud hee would be rid of that which is the nurserie of sinne which slakes his life in grace and disheartens his hope of glorie and it is likely king dauid did not call onely for subuention against guilt contracted but preuention that he might contract no more he looketh backward and forward and it beseemeth vs all to pray against originall sinne

wretch that am who shall deliuer me from this body of sinne

finally as bloud signifieth not onely sinne but the punishment thereof also

so much the prayer be vnderstood to deprecate not onely sinne but the punishment also
dauid heard ringing in his eares caines doome maledictus because thou hast shed bloud therefore thou art accursed the doome against murder

which god denounced by noah thundered in his eare

he that sheddeth mans bloud by man shall his bloud be shed againe he could not forget that dreadfull voice which nathan vttered vnto him the sword shall neuer depart from thy house and out of sense of all these as if he were euen presently ready to perish fall vpon this supplication deliuer his penitertials doe shew what deepe impression the terrour of gods iudgements made vpon his soule and also vpon his body and no wonder if he that so felt them did pray to bee released from them

but marke how he prayeth first how discreetly then how zealously
very discreetly for he maketh choice of a person that can and will deliuer can for he is deus salutis it is his proper title to be a sauiour
in creatures you may find vanitie that will delude you or infirmitie that will faile you euen of kings themselues it is said that their breath is in their nostrels and that they are not saued themselues by their much strength dauid himselfe who so often deliuered ismel and was attended with so many worthies yet could hee not expect saluation from himselfe the prophet ieremies rule is peremptorie

cursed is hee that maketh flesh his arme
we must therefore resolue that saluation belongeth vnto the lord especially when wee speake of spirituall saluation such as that is wherewith wee haue now to doe which standeth in the remission of sinnes the peace of conscience and freedome from death for who can remit sinnes but god onely and except he iustifie vs how should we haue the peace of conscience god vseth ministers to worke these effects but they flow from grace not inherent in them but assistant to them and so they are the effects of gods hand
and to him also belongeth the issues of

death for as it is his iustice that inflicteth it so except he release none can free from it

but marke the phrase the god of saluation

is it not a periphrasis of the name of iesus and then behold a mysterie sanguis liberat a sanguine the bloud of iesus clenseth from all sinne and so deliuereth vs from bloud bloud whereof we are guiltie and rising againe he receiued the keyes both of death and hell and so can deliuer vs from the bloud whereunto wee are endangered

as dauid is discreet in seeking to a person that can so is he also discreet in seeking to a person that will deliuer for he calleth vpon him not only as a god of saluation but as a god of his saluation
god is a god of saluation as he is the sauiour of all men but no man can cal him the god of his saluation except he bee a faithfull man so that there are two remarkable things in the pronoune for it is verbum faederis euangelici fi et speclis dauid sheweth thereby that he is in couenant with god euen in the couenant of grace for no man can vse that word except he bee in so blessed a state no man can call god his except god haue appropriated himselfe vnto him and appropriate he doth not but by the words of the couenant ero deus tuus will be thy god
and when god doth so appropriate himself we must keepe the of the conenant in our prayers and direct our words vnto him as he is ours this is the exercise of a speciall saith and it is the greatest comfort of our prayer it is most likely that he shall speede that hath so neere reference vnto god he that can will helpe
and marke that though he were put to the conflict yet was hee not without armour of proofe he saw whence saluation might be had and commeth with boldnesse to the throne of grace more doe conflict with the horrour of conscience and terrours of death then preuaile against them to conflict is common vnto all sinners but to preuaile is the of the children of god the god ossaluation doth ease doth vnburden onely those that can truely say he is the god of their saluation
dauid prayed discreetly and he prayed zealously also for marke how he doubles the word god thou god nota in repititione magnum cor affectum saith gregorie such ingemminations proceed not but from ardent affections they importune god and they will take no deniall
and indeede god doth not like cold suitors for that betrayech cold defires which in one that is at gods mercie hath grieuously offended lyeth open vnto the sharpest wrath can find no fauour can promise it selfe no mercie we must therefore wrestle with god as did replie as the woman of canaan did treble our petition as did saint paul if we meane that our prayers shall pierce the cloudes climbe vp into the heauens and enter into the eares of god
neither sacrifice nor frankincense were offered without fire vpon the one altar or the other no more must any prayer come from vs which is not warmed by zeale quickning it and giuing it speedie wings to flie from earth to heauen and make our words a liuely representation of those desires that are conceiued in our hearts
and let this suffice for dauids spirituall pange

come now to the deuotion the argument whereof is the righteousnesse of god
but there is a double righteousnesse of god the one is legall the other euangelicall
the legall is that which dealeth with men according to their workes the euangelicall is that which dealeth with men according to their faith the latter is here meant and not the former from the former a sinner can expect nothing but condemnation because this is the tenour of it cursea is he that abideth not in cuerie point of the law to it from the later we may expect saluation because it stands in the renussion of sinnes therefore wee must ioyne libera that is gone before with and so you will find that it is iustitta liberans it is such iustice a freeth vs from iustice and therefore symachus translates it not amisle misericordia this iustice is nothing but plaine mercie mercie if your respect vs which apprehend it by faith for it is nothing else but gods vpon our repentance but if wee looke vnto god then it is pl
iustice for it is instice for him to keepe his promise

we must a step higher and in this word find christ the apostle vs that he is made righteousnes vnto vs

the prophet that he is the lord our righteousnesse
and verily this sweete temper of mercie and iustice is wrought in him and through him deriued to vs and therefore it is called the righteousnesse of saith and the righteousnesse of god reuealed without the when th apprehends stedfaly what god promiseth faithfully then is manifested this righteousnesse
and see how god putteth it out of all doubt that men are iustified by faith not by the workes of the law for though it be a true rule that it is so yet when we doe see the of worthy a person as king dauid the rule becomes more
wherefored will neuer bee in the number of those that presuming of their me its and willing to establish their owne righteousnesse will not submit themselues to this righteousnesse of god

but will goe in the the lord god and will make mention of thy righteousnesse euen of thine onely this mercifull righteousnesse of god

there is one more to be obserued in this argument of dauids denotion which may not omit it is made by gregorie the great vpon the word tuam videtur vt vlsciscatur inimicum dei consitenti relax offensam at the barre of man it goeth for if we repay all men as they but at the barre of god

we find another kind of iustice if we confesse our sinnes god is faithfull to forgiue vs our sinnes and to clense vs from all vnrighteousnesse the rule is generall all may haue the benefit of it though ouer and aboue the generall rule

king dauid had a speciall promise at the performance whereof he aymeth in this place

but enough of the argument
come now in few words to open the maner how he performeth his deuotion
his performance is first publike for he will vtter it with his tongue the tongue is in the scripture called dauids glorie

and the best member that he hath because by it hee did vent what he inwardly conceiued and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth did speake the angell giueth a good obseruation to young tobie

it is good to keepe close the secret of a king but it is honorable to

ueale the workes of god therefore we must not keepe silence when we haue found mercie the reason is cleare we must not be ashamed to acknowledge our benefactor so to doe would argue too much and pride and in so doing wee should take vnto our selues the glorie of god

secondly what god doth for vs he doth it to encourage others and how should they be encouraged

except we doe informe them what god hath done for our soule and the most naturall meanes of informing is by the tongue by that may we direct the eyes of men to behold gods doing yea and worke their affections also to entertaine them with due regard particular persons yea whole congregations may be rowsed may bee perswaded by the tongue therefore told you that the mention of the tongue doth import that the deuotion shall be publicke

neither publike onely but cheerefull also for so hee saith that his tongue shall sing a loude and well doth this beseeme king dauid for hee was the sweete singer of israel he would bestow his best abilitie in praysing of god
the word importeth two things first the propertie of thankes it must not be sullen and dumpish as blessings come readily from god so must they gladly be entertained by men he is vnworthy of them that doth not so expresse the comfort that he taketh in them
secondly the words note the character of a triumph which is exultation we heard before that dauid was pained with the horror of his sinne and danger out of this if he may escape see what he promiseth hee will make melodie to the lord he will conceiue his deliuerance in a psalme so you must vnderstand him he meaneth not a tune without a dittie but this as other of gods blessings hee will leaue of record it shall be entred into the booke of psalmes

but forget not to obserue that whereas the titles of the psalmes euen of this psalme shew that dauid deliuered his psalmes to the publike musicians of the temple by them to be sung at the seruice of god hee disdained not to act the same part himselfe as he daunced before the arke in a linnen ephod so it should seeme by many of his psalmes he did not thinke scorne to range himselfe also with singers with his hand with his voice to sound and set forth the righteousnesse of god
wee are naturally cheerefull after a danger escaped if it be but corporall how much more should we bee so when the danger escaped is spirituall how should our hearts daunce for ioy and our tongues breake forth into the praises of god
but must conclude in the whole text we may obserue three notable things the wisedome of faith the confidence of hope and the earnestnesse of charitie
the wisedome of faith stands in discerning the true helpe in trouble the confidence of hope stands in laying hold thereon according to our interest in the person the earnestnesse of charitie stands in our feruent importuning of him
secondly the wisdome of our faith stands in selecting the argument of our deuotion the confidence of our hope stands in our publike profession thereof the earnestnesse of our charitie stands in the alacritie of our spirit in the cheerefull resounding of that publication
of this double wisedome confidence and cheerefulnesse dauid is here an excellent example vnto vs god giue vs

grace to make vse of his example for we may all fall into his case boh of trouble and comfort bodily and ghostly

psal
verse
lord open thou my lippes and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise

you haue heretofore heard from me opening former words of this psalme that king dauid out of a thankfull heart promised to glorifie god
now god may be glorified either in regard of some speciall fauour which he vouchsafeth any of vs or in regard of that generall worth which he hath in himselfe dauid promised to glorifie god both wayes
how he would doe it in regard of the speciall fauour which himselfe had receiued shewed you when opened the verse that goeth immediately before and in opening the verse which now haue read must shew you how he would glorifie god in regard of that generall worth which is in god
this is the scope of my present text
gods generall worth is meant by his praise for praise is the due of worth god is most worthy and therefore most rightly to bee praysed
what god deserueth dauid will yeeld for he intends to be praeco a proclaimer of gods praise he will shew it forth narrando and enarrando the word signifieth both he wil not only deliuer a plaine history of it but he will also make a feeling co~mentarie vpon it
this he will do but wherwith that also is set downe in the text he will doe it with his mouth with his mouth that others might heare and that mouth shall bee his owne it shall bee the interpreter of his owne heart
you haue heard his good intent but it is a true man purposeth god disposeth therefore for the doing of what hee intended dauid presumeth not of himselfe but imploreth the helpe of god
lord open thou my lippes
the lippes are as the doore of the mouth a doore shut vp naturally in regard of the seruice of god and therefore he had reason to desire that it may bee supernaturally opened lord open thou god onely hath the key which will open this doore so open our lippes that they may shew forth the prayse of god
these points which haue touched offer themselues to our consideration in the parts of my text but if we lay together these parts there wil arise two other good obseruations out of the whole
the first is the true vse of our abilities when wee receiue them from god we must vse them to glorifie him if god open our lippes our mouth must shew forth his praise
the second obseruation is implied which is
if our mouth be vsed to worse purposes then certainely some other then god doth open our lippes

haue laide before you the contents of this scripture
god so open my

lippes and your eares that my mouth may shew forth and your hearts be affected with gods praises and our duties that shall be opened therein

the first point that specified was the praises of god
the word praise as many other elswhere doth signifie not the act but the obiect or to speake it plainely not the due but the merit of goodnesse so saint paul telleth the thessalonians that they are his hope his ioy

his crowne in the day of the lord hope that is the thing hoped for ioy that is the thing wherein he shall ioy and crowne that is the thing for which he shall be crowned so here the praises of god is that for which god deserueth to be praised so strict a coniunction is there betweene the act and the obiect and so inseparable should the one be from the other that the name of the one may very fitly be vsed for the other he that is good should receiue praise and he that receiueth praise should bee good

god saw all that hee had made and loe it was verie good and presently hee kept his sabbaoth whose natiue vse is glorifying of and glorying in that which is good and herein should god be a precedent vnto man hee should not put asunder what god hath conioyned but as the very word here admonisheth let praises be a synonymon for goodnesse

but when we come to determine what goodnesse is vnderstood in this word praise some will haue vs looke backe vnto the verse going before and will haue the goodnesse here meant restrained to the righteousnesse there specified to the euangelicall righteousnesse the mercie of god in christ whereof dauid had good proofe
and indeede that is the prime goodnesse of god and calleth for the highest degree of praise
god deserued praise when hee made man of the dust of the earth so goodly a creature of so base stuffe but hee deserued much more praise when hee redeemed sinfull man from the flames of hell and made him with his owne sonne an heire of the kingdome of heauen to bring so forlorne a wretch to so exceeding happines must needs bee a matter worthy of extraordinary praise

paul maketh praise the end of that great worke and in the reuelation the angels and saints all fall downe before the hrone and giue glorie for the same for that it was a worke· not onely of almightie power but also of vnspeakable grace therefore had they reason to giue glorie for the same
this is true but yet praise must not in this place bee so restrained dauid before his fall had more contemplations of god then one and made his psalmes accordingly and indeede the verie word here vsed for praise is tehillah and hath good cognation with tehillim the title of the psalmes therefore may we well extend the one as farre as the other the argument of the praise as farre as the argument of the psalmes and then you shall find that there is no booke in the bible whose argument will not come vnder some one or other psalme of dauids he hath psalmes of the creation psalmes of redemption psalmes historicall and propheticall legall and sapientiall psalmes hauing beene so copious and in such varietie hauing indited psalmes before his fall it is not likely that after his fall hee will confine his thoughts and not be so large in gods praises nor intermeddle with all sorts of them
certainely when god is called the praise of israell

it

must be conceiued in that widenesse which is mentioned psal
all thy workes praise thee lord for god is totus laudabilis nothing is in god nothing commeth from god that is not praise worthy

so that there is something to be obserued in the word tua thy praise that is the praise which is proper vnto thee
gregorie nyssen writing the life of another gregorie called thaumaturgus giueth a good note nulla vera est laus
there is no praise truely so called which consisteth not in that which the person praised may accompt to be his owne now that accompt his owne which abideth with him for euer
by this rule praise is proper only vnto god for with him onely in goodnesse is there no variablenesse nor shadow of change he that praiseth man cannot praise him but as a mutable creature so good to day that he may be bad to morrow hee waxeth and he waneth euen like the moone yea and when hee is full of goodnesse as the moone of light yet are there maculae in lunâ as staines in the moone so haue there beene blemishes in the best of those which haue beene but meere men the scripture that hath chronicled the patriarches liues hath chronicled their faults also
god onely is as the sunne

he is light in whom there is no darknesse at all as he is constantly so is he entirely holy

therefore praise when it is applied vnto men is a word of limitation it implieth inconstancie or defect it neuer so praiseth but leaueth some place for dispraise but when it is applied vnto god it is a phrase of equipollencie

it is all one with god which is fairely insinuated vnto moses whe he desireth to see gods face you shal find in the pursuit of that story that gods glory gods goodnes are aequipollent tearmes and it must be our endeauour
as far as humaine frailtie will permit herein to resemble god to be nothing to doe nothing but that which may deserue praise
and let this suffice concerning the first point the praise of god
let vs now see what king dauid intends to doe about this praise his intent is to shew it forth

told you the word doth signifie narrare and enarrare to deliuer gods praises by way of historie and then vpon that he studieth to make a feeling commentarie
in king dauids psalmes you may find all kind of histories you may well call them an abridgement of the historicall bookes yea and of the propheticall too which are a kind of historie there are few narrations that tend to the praise of god whereat he hath not touched
but his speciall commendations stands in the enarration in the commentarie that hee maketh vpon diuine history he maketh vs see herein that which otherwise we would not heede he maketh vs sensible of that which otherwise wee would not regard
take a touch of it in some particulars
hee hath made many psalmes of the creation reade the
reade the
reade the
see how powerfully hee doth worke the obseruation thereof into the hearts of men in the
psalme marke those words lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth and againe what is man that thou art mindfull of him or the sonne of man that thou visitest him and how powerfull are those words psalme the
the heauens declare the glorie of god and the firmament

sheweth his handie worke day vnto day vttereth speech but beyond all goeth
psalme blesse the lord my soule lord my god thou art verie great thou art clothed with honour and maiestie the
psalme is about gods prouidence but marke the burden that is added to euerie branch oh that men would praise the lord for his goodnesse and declare his wondrous workes that he doth for the children of men
the same method doth he vse in opening the redemption psalme
the law psalme
and
the deliuerance out of aegypt in many psalmes it were endlesse to goe ouer all particulars take it for a generall rule you shall find in him neuer a historie whereupon he doth not make such a commentarie wherein hee doth not point out some thing that is obseruable and endeauour to make vs sensible thereof and to entertaine it as matter of gods praise and this is that which he meaneth by shewing forth
wherby with all hee teacheth vs that the occurrents of gods prouidence which befall our persons fall out in our times or any way offer themselues vnto vs must be looked into with such a reflecting such an adoring eye that we must take notice of and giue honour vnto god for his power his wisedome his goodnesse his iustice his mercie that shineth herein and sheweth it selfe vnto the world
thus wee must learne to shew forth the praise of god

dauid addes moreouer wherwith he will shew it forth with his mouth with the mouth that others might heare the praises
and indeede ore fit confessio as fraudis so laudis

men therewith as they must confesse their sinnes so must they set forth gods praises shew them forth vnto the world for he that will not confesse god before men god will not confesse him before his blessed angels
the church is a body and what befals any member may befall euerie one be it matter of hope or feare sorrow or ioy therefore ought euerie man to communicate to the other his case and his knowledge to worke in them by the same meanes the like affection which hee feeleth in himselfe yea though we doe not feele it yet should we haue a each of the others affections wherof wee cannot ordinarily take notice except each be informed by the others mouth
the mouth being the ordinarie meanes of communication the trumpe whereby wee doe mutually stirre vp our selues vnto the prayses of god

but when mention is made of the mouth wee must not exclude the heart for though the instrument be the mouth yet the musitian is the heart he causeth the tune of the voice to sound and addeth the dittie to the tune and certainely the musicke will neuer be to god should any part of man be wanting thereunto

therefore dauid thus cals vpon himselfe blesse the lord my soule and all that is within me blesse his holy name

gregorie the great worketh this obseruation out of the word meum my mouth there be many saith he that praise god but not with their owne mouth such as are the couetous the wantons
they personate some other they seeme to take vnto themselues another mans tongue when they vtter that which they conceiue not in their own hearts
but let such

men know that their praiers shall neuer haue accesse vnto gods eares whose hearts are estrainged from righteousnesse
wherefore let vs imitate dauid in another place

who said that his soule should be filled as it were with marrow and fatnesse when hee praiseth god with ioyfull lippes
where withall we learne a good propertie of him that praiseth and that is hee performeth it with pleasure and indeede no man can sincerely praise

but he must delight in that which hee doth praise for praysing is undefined span alphabet as nyssen speaketh a louing disposition
and saint austin deum veraciter qui eum amat he praiseth god sincerely that loueth he loueth him vnfainedly and if our delight be not in him we must not thinke that we doe as we ought praise him

in a word you heard before that deus was totus laudabilis wholy to be praised and we must be toti laudantes haue no part of body or soule that must not be an instrument to sound forth gods praise our whole life should be a psalme thereof
and let this suffice touching king dauids intent
the intent is good but men may intend more then they can doe good men haue beene ouer consident in their good meanings
saint peter thought he would neuer forsake christ and hee would die in his desence yet when he was put to it hee not onely cowardly shrunke from him but also fearefully denied him wherefore dauid is well aduised hee presumeth not of his owne strength but hath recourse vnto gods helpe lord open thou my lippes

the lippes are the doore of the mouth a doore that is shut vp therefore neede to be opened and it is worth the marking that the word which we translate open is not onely of the same originall with a doore in the hebrew tongue but it is also a word which the prophets doe vse in foretelling the miracles of christ for he was amongst other things to open the mouthes of the dumbe and in the gospell working such a cure hee vseth the word ephata

be thou opened loosing the tongue by the eare

but we must vnderstand that in the corporall cure there was an intimation of the spirituall and indeede christ had neuer come into the world to cure the corporall had it not beene thereby to bring vs to an higher conceite of him that he was the physitian of our soules and came to enable them to speake the language of canaan and this is the opening of the lippes which king dauid here desires

this is a great worke great in regard of the difficultie that is in the thing

or the inabilitie that is in vs
there is a difficultie in the thing for we cannot praise god farther then we know him but how little a portion is heard of him

we may speake much saith the sonne of syracke yet come short when we glorifie the lord exalt him as much as wee can for euen yet will he sarre exceede and when you exalt him put forth all your strength and be not wearie for you can neuer goe farre enough
there are yet hid greater things then these be

for we haue seene but a few of his workes
dauid in few words tels vs that his praise is aboue heauen and earth that is the conclusion which he sets downe after he had summoned all creatures to praise the lord

seeing god then is aboue all praise it is certaine that he cannot bee worthily praised of vs by reason of the difficultie of the worke
but were there lesse difficultie in that yet is there great inabilitie in vs inabilitie from our affections inabilitie from our conscience
from our affections there are two preualent ones that hinder vs in this worke first spes lucri secondly metus periculi the wages of iniquitie will hire a balaam a iudas ro curse gods people the subiect of gods praise and though he be the top of gods praise to betray the sauiour of the world how many in all ages haue beene so farre bewitch with worldly honour and profit haue fallen downe and worshipped the idoll of mens fancies and blasphemed god and his truth

the hopc of gaine is a great tongue tie the feare of danger is a greater the verie apostles themselues fot a time felt the strength thereof and after their time it made many renegadoes and apostata's

skin for skinne and all that a man hath will he giue for his life he will redeeme that though it be with cursing of god himselfe the world hath had had too many spectacles of such feare of danger

but if we can master both these vnruly affections yet will the conscience of sinne be a bridle to our tongues it will make vs silent

or put vs to silence
cyril of alexandria moralizing those words of moses that he that is a leaper shall haue his mouth couered saith that he which is in the leaprosie of sinne hath lost all authoritie of speaking for how should he teach another that hath not taught himselfe

and nicètas to this purpose wittily allegorizeth those words of the psalme how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land a sinner is truely a stranger and hee that is in the state of sinne is farther from god then babylon from hierusalem therefore doth his conscience tell him that he is in no case to make melodie to the lord
certainely

esay when in a vision he heard the seraphins sing the lords song holy holy lord god of hoasts heauen and earth are full of thy glorie was thereby put in mind of the fault of his owne lippes and the lippes of the iewes which made him crie out woe is me that am a man of polluted lippes and dwell in the middest of a people of polluted lippes neither was he quiet vntill a seraphin touched his lippes with a coale from the altar

but put the case some man may be so that though he be a sinner yet will he not be silent he shall bee put to silence the vncleane spirit gaue glorie vnro christ when he said know thee who thou art the holy one of god but iesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace

and saint paul refused the testimonie of a spirit of diuination

though hee spake honourably of him and of his followers these men are the seruants of the most high god which shew vnto vs the way of saluation yet did hee command him out of the damsell and suffered him to speake no more
neither is this checke giuen onely to wicked spirits but euen vnto euerie wicked man saith god what hast thou to doe to declare my statutes

or that thou shouldest take my couenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction

and hast cast my words behind thee praise is not comely in the mouth of a sinner for he that is vnholy doth defile that which is holy

therefore no man

may presume to touch sacred things with prophane hands nor with a prophane tongue to speake sacred words
by this time you perceiue that the shewing forth of the praises of god is a great worke and whether wee looke vpon the difficultie that is in the thing or the inabilitie that is in man dauid had reason to pray aperilabia open my lippe

but to whom doth he pray to the lord lord open thou my lippes and he hath a good ground to pray so

solomon teacheth that the preparation of the heart is from man but the answere of the tongue is from the lord he is the of our mouth if he shut no body can open and if he open no body can shut

god tels moses that this is his power who maketh mans mouth or who maketh the dumbe haue not the lord and verily were it no more but our naturall speech that we desire wee must seeke it of him

in whom onely we liue moue and haue our being and who in the person of zacharie sheweth

that hee giueth and taketh away euen that speech at his pleasure
how much more must we accompt him to be the fountaine of our supernaturall speech certainely christ giueth the glorie thereof vnto him

the lord saith he hath giuen me the tongue of the learned and it was from god that the fierie tongues descended vpon the apostles

and inabled them to speake it is god that out of the mouthes of babes and sucklings hath perfected praise
men may be otherwise satis loquaces of eloquent of free speech who when they come to the seruice of god seeme to be possest with a spirit that is deafe and dumbe they had neede that christ should say vnto them ephata be thou opened they will not bee able so much as to say

iesus is the lord but by the holy ghost
but if god once open our lippes then we shall be able for to speake

neither to speake onely for there is more included in the phrase then so

but grace shall be powred into our lippes our words shall be poudred with salt as saint paul speaketh god that openeth the lippes will also suggerere materiam supplie the matter of our speech for that is it dauid aymeth at that he may againe be the of god and that his tongue may be the pen of a ready writer that hee may speake nothing but that which is indited by the holy ghost that his words may flow alwayes from the grace of sanctification and that he may as he was before be a prophet also and be inspired to speake by the grace of edification

neither doth he ayme in this prayer onely at the matter of his speech but at the manner also that he may speake with freedome and with wisedome with freedome that he be no more check't with his consciousnesse of sinne
and indeede ingenuous freedome in praysing of god is a good argument that our soules are possest with the peace which passeth all vnderstanding

and ioy of the holy ghost
as in the prayer hee desireth freedome so doth he desire wisedome of speech also it is gregorie the greats note illius os aperit deus god openeth his mouth who doth attend not onely what he saith but also when where and to whom
our tongue though it be a little member

yet it is an vnruly one saith saint iames life and death is in the power of the tongue which made the sonne of syracke to moue this question who shall set a watch vpon my mouth and a seale of wisedome vpon my lippes that fall not suddainely by them and that my

tongue destroy me not whereunto you may shape an answere out of prayer set a watch lord before my mouth

and keepe thou the doore of my lippes so that without this prayer he could neuer haue made good that promise which elswhere hee maketh

said will take heede to my wares that offend not with my tongue
one in the ecclesiasticall storie is reported to haue studied that short lesson many yeeres and yet in the end he profest that he could not attaine to the exact practise thereof
and which of vs is here that offendeth not in his tongue and therefore good reason haue the best euen the verie best to pray with dauid lord open thou my mouth and humbly to surrender the gouernement of his tongue vnto god

finally by this which you haue heard you may easily gather that lippes are to be vnderstood as mouth before this is no more exclusiue then that the heart the whole man must follow the lippes as before they did the tongue for looke with what we will praise god for that must wee craue gods guiding and assistance
and let this suffice for the particular points which are contained in this text

come now to the generall which arise out of the parts laide together
whereof the first is this that seeing dauid prayeth open my lippes and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise wee must not begge ought of god which wee meane not to imploy to his glorie that which commeth from him must returne vnto him againe he that is the first cause must bee the last end of all his creatures and of their gifts
therefore when god first opened zacharies mouth then presently he fell to

blessed be the lord god of israel

when god first endowed vs hee did it that we might the better serue him by our owne default we are disenabled and out of the sense thereof we must confesse that without a second gift of grace we can doe nothing not so much as thinke a good thought nor open our lippes vnto his praise he must worke in vs both to will and doe it

farre be it then from vs that we should with those prophane persons psal
say our tongues are our owne we will speake who is lord ouer vs and let tongues runne wild certainely god neuer openeth our lips for such hee doth not furnish vs with any gifts whereby we should oppose his glorie
but all that commeth from him doth shew forth his vertues vnto the world

and therefore if our tongues produce worse there is some other then god that openeth our lippes
vereor saith origen no sint aliqui quorum diabolus aperiat ora many so speake that a man may well feare that the diuell hath charge of their lippes for their words honour him he is a lyar and deceipt is vnder their lippes hee is a murderer and their throates are open sepulchers he an impure spirit and some mens talke is nothing but ribaldrie and doth not the diuell open their mouthes in some places the scripture speaketh it expresly

the diuell entered into iudas presently his tongue fell to conference with the high priest what hee might haue for betraying of christ satan filled the heart of ananias and saphira

and they fell to lying against the holy ghost a lying spirit entred into michaia the false prophet and he presently

seduced ahab to goe and bee slaine at ramoth gilead

and what else meane those three vncleane spirits like frogges that came out of the mouth of the dragon

of the beast and of the false prophet to gather the kings of the earth to the battell of the great day of god almightie certainely they are those impostors by whose tongues the diuell doth abuse the world

there are some that haue mungrell tongues out of whose mouth commeth blessing and cursing that can blesse god within the church and curse their brethren when they are without it whom must remember of saint iames his censure

my brethren these things ought not so to be can the fig tree beare oliue berries or a vine figges no fountaine can send forth at the same hole sweete water and bitter fresh and salt
what nature abhorreth in vnreasonable creatures sinne produceth commonly in creatures that are reasonable are not we then worse then they yea verily much worse in that they are but naturall monsters and wee are morall
it were much better for vs to be plaine dumbe then to be of gracelesse speech

for we shall giue an accompt for euerie idle much more for euerie euill word had rather then neuer speake then not speake to gods glorie

and yet mistake not god needeth not our praysing of him onely he would haue vs vse our tongues so well as that wee may be at the day of iudgement praised by him
yea praysing is a delightfull employment god would thereby cheere vp our spirits with a sweete foretaste of that life which we shall leade in heauen for praysing is the angels worke in the church militant we haue both praying and praysing but in the church triumphant there is onely praysing there is no praying at all that eucharisticall sacrifice shall continue when all propitiatories doe cease for praise is the euerlasting sacrifice of the new testament and of that the saying is true praise shall neuer depart from the mouth of a christian
iewes and christians haue both agreed to repeate daily this text in their liturgie out of that which you haue heard you may gather that it is not without cause that they haue so done wee say it daily pray god wee may haue learned this day to say it well hereafter so may we that now in gods house on earth speake his praise sing for euer halelu praise yee the lord with the saints in heauen
the words as haue opened them are conceiued in a prayer but as they are read in the salter they represent a prophecie the odds is not great because a good prayer if it bee conceiued for spirituall grace is indeede a prophecie for he that disposeth to sue doth purpose to grant

what shall we say then to these things but euen pray that seeing god hath the key of our eares as well as of our tongues and by the temper of our eares wee may guesse what will bee the temper of our tongues and he that hath a deligh to heare his dutie will haue a tongue readie to yeeld god his due and god will neuer open his tongue that suffers the diuell to keepe the key of his eare let vs say pray that by being willingly deafe we doe not become vnwilling dumbe but that christ by his ephphata would rid vs of the spirit both deafe and dumbe

that hauing heard these words as we ought we may vse our tongues as is meete
that we may so doe let vs all ioyntly present our humble petitions vnto god in the words of my text
lord open thou our lippes and our mouthes shall shew forth thy praise

blessed are they lord that dwell in thy house

they shall alwayes bee praysing thee

epigraph

psal
verse
for thou desirest not sacrifice else would giue it thou delightest not in burnt offering

king dauid in thankfulnesse for gods mercie promiseth religiously to serue him but whereas gods seruice is either morall or ceremoniall he voweth a morall and not a ceremoniall seruice of this choice he yeeldeth a reason and that reason is gods good pleasure he maketh gods pleasure to set bounds vnto his vow and is willing to enlarge or contract his vow according to gods pleasure
to contract it as appeares in that which he speaketh of the ceremoniall worship for he forbeares it and to enlarge it as appeares in that which he speaketh of the morall for that is it which he obserueth as acceptable vnto god
on this verse which now haue read wee shall heare of his conceipt concerning the ceremoniall worship and what hee conceiueth of the morall worship which is answerable thereunto when open the next verse shall then shew vnto you
the ceremoniall worship is exprest in two words sacrifice and burnt offerings which words may betaken either in a large or in a restrained sense
in a large so may you reduce vnto them all ceremoniall worship in a restrained and so they comprehend the two offerings which the law required for a ceremoniall reconciliation of a sinner
take them which way you will my text sets downe gods disposition towards them and king dauids conformitie to that disposition of god
gods disposition is twofold first he doth not desire them secondly he doth not delight in them before they are offered he doth not desire them neither doth hee delight in them when they are offered so must you in this place difference gods desire and his delight

to this disposition of god king dauid doth conforme his seruice he professeth that hee would haue tendered these ceremoniall offerings if god had affected them and onely because god did not affect them therefore he doth not tender them both these propositions are wrapt vp in these words else would giue it would giue sacrifices and burnt offerings

if thou didst desire them if thou didest delight in them but thou desirest not sacrifices thou delightest not in burnt offerings therefore doe not presume to giue them to reconcile my selfe by them

these be the heads whereunto purpose to referre whatsoeuer shall deliuer in farther opening of this text now because you may mistake in your deuotion as the iewes did be perswaded in the feare of god to listen attentiuely to what shall be said that you may learne of king dauid to passe a true iudgement vpon all ceremoniall worship and vpon all corporall seruice
let vs come then to the particulars whereof the first is those words wherein the ceremonies are exprest and they are two sacrifice and burnt offerings
which words may bee taken first in a large sense they may comprehend all kind of animat offerings that were burnt vpon the altar for of them some were merocausta burnt but in a part the rest was the priests portion alone or else he did share in it with him that presented the sacrifice
other offerings were called holocausta they were wholly burnt neither the sacrificer nor the offerer had any part therein god reserued it wholly to himselfe so that if wee thus farre enlarge these words they wrap in them all kinde of corporall sacrifices ruffinus and others giue them so wide a signification
that signification is true but happily it is not so proper to this text a more restrained sense may better fit this present argument
obserue then that these wordes doe containe the two offerings which god in moses law prescribed for the reconciliation of a sinner hee was required to bring one expiatory the law calleth it a and that is it which is here as meant by the generall name of sacrifice another dedicatory which was called an holocaust and is here translated a burnt offering but you must vnderstand it burnt not in part but wholly therefore it is sometimes called a
these two offerings went together in the ceremoniall reconciliation of a sinner we find it so in leuit at the purifying of a woman after chap
at the cleansing of a leper chap
finally at the expiation of the tabernacle or temple and therein of the whole church of israel chap
in all these places you shall find that they goe together

but to looke a little farther into these offerings there are two remarkable things in them
the mystery and
the method
there is a mystery in either of them

in the sacrifice that teacheth that the wages of sinne is death the innocent beast was slaine but the sinner first put his hands vpon him to note what we deserue and christ endured for vs from the guilt of our sinnes we are not freed but by the vertue of his death
the mysterie of the burnt offering is wee owe our selues wholly vnto god and to him must wee giue our selues but first wee must be mortified we cannot ascend in our thoughts vnto heauen except we mortifie our carnall lusts that grouell vpon the earth
to note this mortification and viuification of our selues intire mortification intire viuification which leaueth no hold vnto sinne in any part of our body or power of our soule and which withholds no part or power of either from the seruice of god

and which withholds no part or power of either from the seruice of god was the holocaust soe handled as wee read in the law first slaine then wholly consumed by fire

besides the mysterie there is a method to be obserued in these words dauid doth not only expresse them but digest them digest them according to the prescript of the law when they were both offered the sacrifice was presented before the burnt offering
the morall thereof is very good wee cannot haue the honour to serue god

except wee first find fauour to be discharged of our sinnes the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination vnto the lord and without holinesse it is impossible for a man to please god therefore we must offer our expiatory sacrifice before our dedicatory burnt offering wee must make our peace with god before we presume to come into his presence

finally we must take good heed that wee neither maine the parts of our reconciliation nor peruert their order
maine them we doe if we offer the sacrifice but withhold the burnt offering desire remission of our sinnes and take no care to become the seruants of god
or if wee offer the burnt offering and withhold the sacrifice put our selues into the seruice of god but yet doe cherish a root of bitternesse in our hearts doe not vnburthen our consciences of sinne
and how few are there that thus fully reconcile themselues to god and ioyne together both these offerings some can be contented to be rid of the vncleane spirit and haue their house swept and garnished but they keepe it emptie and vnimployed entertaine not god neither doe they deuote themselues vnto his seruice
othersome are contented that god shall dwell in them and they will be his temple but they will haue this temple to bee also an house of merchandise a denne of thieues a very synagogue of satan
so doe men maime their reconciliation they are loath to be wholly reconciled vnto god

as we must not maime our reconciliation so we must not peruert the parts thereof the burnt offering must not goe before the sacrifice neither must wee dedicate our selues to god before wee are cleansed from our sinnes that were to put new wine into old bottels

new cloth into an old garment which if we doe christ tels vs in the gospell what will become of it the bottels will breake and the garment will rent and grace will neuer abide in a sinfull soule hee will quickly returne like a dogge to his vomit and a swine to wallow in the myre we must be new creatures or else neuer let vs offer to be the seruants of god
and let this suffice for opening of the two branches of the ceremoniall worships come now to consider gods disposition towards them and that is twofold he doth not desire them he doth not delight in them

of the words desire and delight though one bee ioyned to sacrifice and the other to burnt offering yet doe they both reach either of them and doe oftentimes signifie the same thing but yet here they doe not so difference them and did it by warrant of the scripture which obserues two parts of gods disposition before these things are offered god doth not desire them that is he hath giuen no precept concerning them

god speaketh it plaine in ieremy

put your burnt offering vnto your sacrifice and eat flesh for spake not vnto your fathers nor commanded them in the day when brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices

and the psalmist sacrifice and offerings thou diddest not desire burnt offerings and hast thou not required
in the fiftieth psalme there is a plaine deniall of them will not reproue thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings because they haue not beene before me will take no bullocke out of thy house nor hee goate out of thy fold
these places doe iustifie the words of my text and shew plainly that god did not desire them before they were offered hee gaue no precept concerning them

and as no precept so no promise hee did as little delight in them after they were offered as he did desire them before they were offered reade it in ieremie

to what purpose commeth there vnto mee incense from saba and the sweet cane from a farre country your burnt offerings are not acceptable


in esay god doth passionately amplifie this poynt heare the word of the lord yee rulers of sodome giue eare vnto the law of our god yee people of gomorrah to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices vnto me saith the lord am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts delight not in the blood of bullocks of lambs

and of the goats and elsewhere he that killeth an oxe is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth a lamb is as if he cut off a dogs necke he that offereth an oblation as if he offered swines blood he that offereth incense is as if he blest an idoll

you may reade the like in micah and amos so that bee they part sacrifices be they whole sacrifices be they expiatory or be they dedicatory god doth not require them god delighteth not in them there is no precept that requireth their performance there is no promise that doth warrant their acceptance

and indeed though desire and delight or precept and promise are differenced as haue shewed you yet haue they a dependencie the one vpon the other for therefore doth not god delight in these things when they are offered because he did not desire that they should be offered vnto him for promise of acceptance depends vpon the precept of offering whereof there is a precept thereunto there is anext a promise and a promise doth presuppose a precept in all the seruice of god proue one and conclude both and you ouerthrow both if you can iustly denie either
so that if my text did not expressely affirme yet would it by consequence inferre that god maketh no accompt of this ceremoniall worship

but this is a paradoxe for sacrifices are the peculiar of god and no man euer offered them but only vnto him who was or at least was reputed to bee god neither any that haue accepted them esteemed themselues lesse nor would goe for lesse in the opinion of the offerers men and diuels that haue robbed god of his honour haue to that end chosen this kind of sacriledge by sacrifices they haue entiled themselues vnto the glory of god and doth not god out of his iealousie make it death for any man to sacrifice to any other but himselfe

and for himselfe hee giueth this expresse law

thou shalt not appeare before the lord empty and what is that but thou shalt sacrifice vnto him

but to come more close vnto the point
wee find directly in the law gods both precept and promise concerning sacrifice
his precept for in leuit to name no other place how curiously doth god distinguish the kindes set downe the circumstances of all sacrifices and the accessories thereunto and that by way of command the patriarches before moses did sacrifice and can we be so absurd as to thinke they did it without the direction of god no verily for they had a spirit of prophesie

as the precept is cleare so is the promise also you shall find it in the same place where you find the precept in the first and second of leuit
you shall find it called a sweet sauour vnto the lord in the
and
it is called an atonement

the first sacrifice that wee read of was abels and the text saith plainly that god had a respect vnto abel and vnto his offering the second was that of noah and of that the text saith

that god smelt a sauour of rest iob sacrificed for his friends

and the lord accepted him and when aaron offered his first sacrifice god testified his acceptance by fire from heauen

so that it is as cleare that god delighteth in sacrifices as that hee doth require them and the promise can be as little doubted as the precept

what shall wee say then to my text how shall wee make it agree with the rest of the scriptures surely we may doe it easily and fairely
god is and god is a spirit being hee cannot need them and being a spirit hee cannot bee sustained by them both these points are cleare in the fiftieth psalme where god sheweth that there can be no colour that he should need them seeing all the beasts of the forrest are his and so are the cattell vpon a thousand mountaines and god casteth off the absurdity of his being sustained by them with that pressing and conuicting question thinkest thou that eate buls flesh and drinke the blood of goates lucian scoffingly bringeth in the heathen gods as if they tooke great content in the nidour of the sacrifices but it were prophane to thinke so of the true god
the occasion then of instituting sacrifices was not from god and that is the first thing we must learne

whence then was it taken surely from man
we consist of bodies and soules and wee need by our bodies to bee put in minde of those things which concerne our soule and therefore did god institute them hee did institute them to helpe our infirmities
but what did hee intend to remember vs of by them first of our ransome

christ came not vntill the fulnesse of time but his death was to worke presently vpon the fall and in that respect he is called

the lambe slaine from the beginning of the world
that before christ came men should not forget by whom they had their redemption and the remission of sinnes god instituted sacrifices

secondly we were to be remembred of our homage we were to acknowledge

that what we held we had of god and were to seeke vnto god for what we did want and in remembrance hereof did god institute eucharisticall and votiue sacrifices

some thinke that they should haue beene offered if man had neuer sinned but the scripture is silent and will not be so curious as to dispute it
let it passe inter pie credibilia and it is as possible there might haue beene sacrifices as there were sacraments before the fall witnesse the two trees the one of life and the other of the knowledge of good and euill
you may adde a third reason which is obserued by the fathers and that is that god therefore instituted by moses the sacrifices to keepe his people from heathenish idolatrie and distinguish them from other societies which reason must bee warily vnderstood for it cannot bee meant that god took occasion from the heathen to institute sacrifices amongst the iewes for the heathen had it by tradition from the patriarches and god himselfe was the first author of sacrifices
but this is true that the heathen had corrupted foure things in a sacrifice
first the materials for they vsed to sacrifice those things which god forbad
secondly the forme for they corrupted it with many superstitions of their owne
thirdly the ende they knew not wherefore they were ordained and fourthly the owner they did not know to whom they did belong
from these deprauations god did clense the sacrifices in the law of moses and so did distinguish his people from other nations not by sacrificing but by sacrificing as they ought
the last end of instituting sacrifices was the prouision for the priests and the sacred feasts whereat the poore were relieued
these bee the reasons why god instituted sacrifices wherein you see that they all import a reliefe vouchsafed man
but yet we haue not found out the true ground why god doth not desire nor delight in sacrifice and burnt offerings for put the case hee did institute them out of compassion towards men yet may hee desire what himselfe had commanded and delight in that whereunto hee hath annext the promise of acceptance
wee must therefore goe on and obserue that sacrifices are bona quia praecepta non precepta quia bona they are things in their owne nature indifferent but they become more then indifferent they deserue the name of good in vertue of the commandement of god but they lose this worth if so be wee place it in the sacrifice and not in gods ordinance no sooner doe wee so misdeeme them but presently god doth not desire them god doth not delight in them

but to wade farther into their estimate and to discouer more neare grounds of that truth which is in my text

in the ordinance of sacrifices there are two things considerable opus operatum and opus operantis

the offering and the offerer
touching the offering austin hath a true rule omne sacrificium visibile fuit inuisibilis sacramentum sacrifices were but shadowes of good things to come as paul speaketh to the hebrewes there was in them a signe and a thing signified and the signe

was commanded not for it selfe but for the thing signified to represent our ransome or to testifie our homage
seperate or oppose the signe and the thing signified and presently you corrupt gods ordinance and then god doth not desire god doth not delight in such sacrifices
for in the case of our ransome if you separate what doe you but transferre the price of christs sauing blood vnto the contemptible blood of bulles and goates the legall sacrifices did purifie the flesh

and made men sit for the visible congregation not for the inuisible without their reference to the death of christ and therefore doth saint paul say that by him all that beleeue are iustified from all those things from which they could not be iustified by the law of moses
and what wonder seeing our ethicks or oeconomicks or politicks whatsoeuer vertue we haue priuate or publike if it find any grace in the eyes of god it is commended by the death by the obedience of christ

if wee may not seperate much lesse may wee oppose the signe to the thing signified set moses against christ and in defence of his sacrifices vilifie the sacrifice of christ and yet such blind zeale transported many of the iewes who so became guilty of sacrilegious blasphemie
that which is true concerning our ransome holds also concerning our homage wee may not separate wee may not oppose the signe and the thing signified
if wee separate what doe wee but giue a beast vnto god and a man vnto the diuell and seeing the gift measureth the respect to whom we giue the best it is an argument that wee loue him most hee that so sacrificeth in stead of honouring doth dishonour god

oppose the signe to the thing signified and then wee doe plainly dishonour our selues for if wee offer what wee thinke best then in our iudgement wee are not so good as a beast and hee that iudgeth so deserueth rather to goe for a beast then a man and how should god accept any thing from him that doth so basely vnderualew himselfe certainly when such persons come with such sacrifices it may truely then be said god doth not desire them god doth not delight in them

the rather because as told you god in his ordinance did prescribe as well opus operantis as opus operatum attendit deus saith gregory ad affectum magis quàm ad censum nec animaduertit quantum in eius sacrificio sed ex quanto proficiscatur sacrifices passe with god not according to the worth of the offering but the good will of the offerer if that bee wanting the rest findeth no acceptance

out of this which you haue heard you may learne why the prophets doe so declaime against the ceremoniall worship and why they speake so contemptibly of it they are not to be vnderstood absolutely but relatiuely relatiuely to the cautions of the law which are two first a sound opinion of the offering and secondly a religious deuotion in the offerer
when mens opinions did not conioyne orderly the signe with the thing signified or when they came not piously affected to the seruice of god then god did not desire their sacrifice he did not delight in their burnt offerings

in a word in their ceremoniall worship there was aliquid primarium and aliquid secundarium there was something to haue the preheminence and something that was but to attend that when two such things meet

then christs rule is good hoc opportet facere illud non omittere we must spend our greatest deuotion vpon the principall but not neglect the secundarie had the iewes kept themselues within these bounds god would neuer haue derogated from that which they did by his owne ordinance
and if for our abuse god so what himselfe commands how vile will corporall worship which man doth iustitute bee in his eyes when it is soured with the same leauen which yeeldeth a good item to the church of rome whose deuotion is most changeable in this kind

but all this while haue taken the words sacrifice and burnt offering at large told you that the argument of the psalme draweth them into a narrower roome
in relation to king dauids case they note vnto vs the two parts of the reconciliatory offerings the sinne offering and the holocaust and then my text is not only true in relation to the opinion and deuotion of men but absolutely true according to the tenor of the law
for sinnes for which a man may be reconciled vnto god by legall sacrifices are either only ceremoniall pollutions or if morall defects then they were onely such as came from ignorance or infirmitie as you may read in the fourth fifth and sixth chapters of leuiticus touching the latter and touching the former in the
and
chapters
but if a man sinned with an high hand if that which hee committed were a crying sinne god left the malefactors to the sword of the magistrate there was no sacrifice appointed to discharge him from such kind of guilt as god teacheth numb
and in this sense god sent eli word

that the iniquity of his house should not be purged with sacrifice nor offerings for euer

and to that purpose speaketh god also esay
of the enormous sinnes of the iewes surely this iniquity shall not bee purged from you

till you die saith the lord of hoasts stoning heading hanging were the expiation of such sinnes as iustin martyr teacheth

but wee may not mistake when god visited such enormous sinnes with corporall plagues then to stay his punishing hand from proceeding

sacrifice might be offered aaron with incense stood betweene the dead and the liuing when the plague of god was vpon israel and staid his wrath

dauid sheathed the sword of the punishing angel with a sacrifice on the threshing floore of araunah hezechias expiated the idolatry of his fathers time yea and by iob it seemeth that the wrath of may be preuented too for he sacrficed lest peraduenture his sonnes

hasphemed
but god would not exempt them by any sacrifice the magistrate he left their soules to take benefit of the dayly and their bodies to publike iustice who were disturbers of the like peace either of church or

where by the way you may learne how holy god would haue his people that in cases where the magistrate could not touch them would haue them touched in conscience and by sacrifice seeke their peace

with god and not giue the same priuiledge to their heauenly estate as he did vnto the worldly

but to apply this vnto king dauids case and therein to see the truth of my text his sinnes were in the number of those which are called crying sinnes for they were murder adultery treachery and blasphemie for such sinnes there was no sacrifice
iustin martyr obserues it in the place before cited if the gospel saith he had not opened vnto him the gate of repentance in lege seruatricem non inuenisset humanitatem he could haue found no reliefe in any ceremoniall expiation the kings condition herein was no better then the subiects as hee confesseth in my text
and though hee had no superiour on earth to question him yet doth he plead guilty and intimateth what hee deserueth at gods hand his sinnes are such which deserue the sword and gods sword hee could not but feare though hee were out of the feare of mans
adde hereunto that he doth not thinke that euerie light remedie will suffice a king as great men passe ouer the like sinnes with slight penance but litle doe they thinke that heauie punishments are their due which though they feele not from men yet they may feare from god

but enough of gods disposition towards this ceremoniall worship wee are now to see in few words how dauid doth conforme himselfe thereunto that is contained in these words else would haue giuen it
resolued the words into two propositions whereof the first was if god had affected these offerings he would haue tendred them it is the commendation which god himselfe giueth that

hee was a man after gods owne heart and hee would performe all his will and gods will in sacrifiting he did not neglect neither in peace nor warre
not in peace for when hee translated the arke from obed edoms house

at euery sixe paces hee offered oxen and fatlings so hee offered also when hee went to warre as it appeares by the peoples prayer for him

the lord remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifices
omit other places no man may reasonably thinke that hee would sticke at the offering of any sacrifice who gaue so bountifully towards the fabricke and furniture of the temple as you may read

chronic

much more dare say then any prince in christendome hath in his treasury or euer had
and indeed hee thought nothing too good for god how chargeable so euer the patterne of the temple was which was deliuered him hee most cheerefully made prouision for the full accomplishment of it wherein hee shewed himselfe a good patterne and teacheth all that be able to bee willing to aduance in the best sort the seruice of god

the second proposition is that because god would not haue them hee forbore these offerings hee would not prescribe to god the satisfaction that god requireth is arbitrary in him none but himselfe knoweth what will content himselfe therefore hee must goe before vs and wee must yeeld what hee doth chuse
hee must definitely concerning our necessary seruice and concerning our voluntary at least indefinitely expresse

his will or else wee cannot know or doe what hee will accept by meanes whereof our offering will bee thanklesse or fruitlesse for undefined span alphabet pleaseth me not it wil be cast off with quis requisiuit

who hath required these things at your hands and in vaine doe they worship mee teaching the traditions of men

and well may god so censure it for experience hath proued amongst the heathen yea and amongst christians also that when they leaue in such cases to be ruled by god men run wilde yea mad in their superstitions or rather impious pietie
the lash note giue vpon this text is that the fathers make it a prophesie of the wherein all carnall rites were to bee done away and men were to serue god in spirit and truth we liue to see it and see to our griefe too many enuy themselues the comfort of it the church of rome by a multitude of inconuenent ceremonies hath much darkned the light of the gospell and some are growen so absurd as to thinke that the iewish ceremonies shall be reuiued at hierusalem againe
but cannot stand to refute these follies let mee onely recommend two rules vnto you out of king dauids words
the first is the rectifying of your deuotion that you neuer so mistake the helpes which god affords our infirmitie as to giue the the honour of things heauenly vnto earthly or to let our bodies in god seruice be other then attendants vnto our soules

besides rectifying of our deuotion let vs learne to resigne our selues wholly vnto gods will remembring this that as wee must not be hastie and goe before him so must we not be slacke in in following him
if in seruing of god wee take this course and are led by this guide wee shall be sure that our seruice shall neither be amisse nor yet in vaine and may expect that comfortable doome

well done seruant faithfull and true enter into thy mastersioy

epigraph

psal
verse

the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart god thou wilt not despise

king dauid being resolued to serue god aduiseth how it may be done best in this deliberation hee taketh god for his guide and will make no other choyce then may stand with gods good pleasure
now touching gods pleasure hee informes vs that whereas there are two kinds of gods seruice a ceremoniall and a morall god maketh little accompt of the ceremoniall
you heard that point opened the last lords day that which hee regardeth is the morall and of that shall you god willing heare this day

my present text will tell you two things first wherein the morall seruice stands secondly how it is esteemed
it stands in the humiliation of the inward man the inward man is noted by the words spirit and heart two names but signifying the same reasonable soule which as it can subsist without the body is called a spirit and it is called a heart as it liueth in and doth manifest it selfe by the body
this inward man must be humbled it must be broken and contrite two words meaning the the same thing but not without some difference in degree the former notes the beginning the latter the consummating of our humiliation
this is the morall seruice and it stands in these points

he that vseth it shall find that it is well esteemed for what was denied vnto the ceremoniall seruice is yeelded vnto this god did not desire that but this he doth it is the sacrifices of god
wherein marke two things first god that careth not for the slaughter of a beast requireth the mortification of a man he will haue his heart his spirit broken and contrite
secondly this one mortification of man goeth in stead of the manifold slaughters of beasts for it is sacrifices
the second thing that was denied vnto the ceremoniall was that god did not delight in it but in the morall he doth he will not despise that in the word there is a litote there is more meant then is exprest for the holy ghost meaneth that this morall seruice doth speed of both the effects of sacrifices it yeeldeth a sweet sauour vnto god and he doth gratiously accept it it proueth a sauour of rest into man and his soule doth feele the comfort of it
finally out of the maine branches of the text wee will draw two paradoxes first a broken and contrite heart are gods sacrifices therfore this is a religious
secondly god doth not despise a broken and a contrite heart therefore god is neuer better pleased with vs then when we are least pleased with our selues
you heare whereof shall speake that you may learne to serue god truely by that which shall bee spoken listen to it diligently and with a religious eare
before fall vpon the particulars may not omit to shew you the coherence of this verse to the former the former did shew of how little worth ceremoniall worship is this sheweth the great worth of the morall
and well is this clause added vnto that for it is not enough to know what we must not doe in gods seruice our chiefe care must be to know what we must doe what good will it doe mee to know that turkes iewes infidels worship they know not what they know not how it must be my comfort to know the true god to know how to worship him as ought
the ground is cleare negatiues are but to attend affirmatiues and god doth not reward the forbearance of euill but the doing of good forbearance doth hold backe the impediments that would hinder vs in our way but wee must not only auoid them but also goe the right way if wee will come to our iourneys end in a word our abilities are bestowed vpon vs not only to decline euill but also to doe good
but to the text

the first thing that obserued was wherin morall seruice stands it stands in the humiliation of the inward man the inward man is here pointed out by two names the spirit and the heart
how these words differ all are not agreed vpon a former verse haue said something of them but in this place thinke they note one and the selfe same reasonable soule as it vndergoeth a diuers consideration
it hath a prerogatiue aboue the soule of a beast in that it can subsist though it be seuered from the body and so it commeth neere vnto the nature of angels and with them communicateth in the name of spirit which is a substance endued with vnderstanding and will
but besides this separate being it hath another which you may call coniunct it inhabiteth in and manifesteth it selfe by the body quickning and guiding our senses and our affections hence it is denominated from the body from the principall parts wherein it doth reside from none so often and so aptly as from the heart which is the the principall seate thereof

neither is it without cause that the reasonable soule is remembred vnder both these names the holy ghost thereby giuing vs to vnderstand that whether we consider the powers of the soule inorganically as vnder the name of spirit or else organically as vnder the name of heart either way considered they must be humbled wee must humble no lesse the superiour then the inferiour faculties of our soule for sinne hath infected both
a second thing that wee must marke is that in our seruice god calleth not for nostra but nos not our goods but our selues and to this end did hee command the people to put their hands vpon the sacrifices to signifie whom it did represent and to accompany the offering of the sacrifice with a zealous deuotion to testifie that themselues were to haue a feeling of that for which the beast was offered
and indeed it was fit that he should offer himselfe that had offended that hee might feare to offend when hee saw that hee must smart if a beast onely should die and the paine there of might rid a sinner of his guilt few would forbeare sinne if any thing make them feare it is this that they must beare the burden of sinne themselues

secondly as wee must offer our selues so that which of our selues wee must offer is the better part our spirit our heart
in all the legall sacrifices god reserued the inwards to himselfe his meaning was to point out the parts which he desireth in vs hee desireth our inwards they must be presented in our sacrifice

the apostles rule is bodily exercise profiteth litle certainly very litle of it selfe it hath all his commendations from the heart and the spirit

but there are two distinct reasons why these parts are principally required in morall seruice the first is because they are freest from hypocrisie

god cannot endure that we should turne vnto him in mendacio dissemblingly now simulation and dissimulation are manifest in our body for we can personate therein whom we will we may so bee mask't as that no body shal know who we are but in the inward man we are our selues wee can there seeme no better nor no worse then we are

there doth god behold vs and hee doth iudge of vs thereby

a second reason is the preualencie of those parts they haue the greatest hand in our sinne and must beare the greatest part in our repentance other parts and powers partake of sinne but by contagion which they contract by their attendance vpon the spirit and the heart attend then they must in repentance but the principall penitents must be the heart and the spirit vpon whom they attend
but enough of the parts which must bee humbled let vs now come to the humiliation of those parts they must be broken they must be contrite
betweene these wordes there is no great difference for contrition is a breaking very small and the breaking here meant is a shiuering the english to shiuer commeth from the hebrew here vsed which is shauar and you know that to shiuer a thing is to breake it all to pieces
or if you will put a difference betweene the wordes then the first may note the beginning and the other the consummating of this humiliation as you know a thing may be first grosse bruised and that is breaking and then it may bee pounded all to pouder and that is the contrition of it
but how doe these words agree with the former by the heart and the spirit you vnderstood the reasonable soule and hath the soule any parts can that bee turned into dust surely no therefore these words are figuratiue they are resemblances borrowed from corporall things which doe most liuely set before vs the humiliation that is spirituall

but it is a question whence these wordes are borrowed some fetch them from husbandry some from masonry either of them hath a faire ground in the scripture
they that fetch it from husbandry for ieremie and hosea speake of breaking vp the fallow ground of our hearts

that they may bee sowen now you know that they that breake vp their grounds vse the plough and the harrow the plough turneth vp the ground in great clods that is the first breaking of it then commeth the harrow and turneth those clods into dust that is the second breaking of it and so these two breakings represent corporally what you must spiritually obserue in a broken and contrite heart

the very same may fitly bee represented by the second resemblance that is taken from masonry the scripture doth often tell vs that sinners haue stony hearts and therefore they must be broken that they may be made fleshy hearts as tender and soft as flesh
now you know that when a mason or plaisterer will worke a rough stone into all kinde of shapes at his pleasure he first breaketh him being calcined or otherwise prepared all to pieces and then those pieces he poundeth into dust then that dust with liquor he can worke into a soft substance which will receiue any shape according to the fancy of the plaisterer
euen so must the heart and spirit of a man be hammered by gods word

broken and broken againe that so it may be made plyable vnto the wil of god
these be faire resemblances and might insist vpon them and by them illustrate the humiliation of a sinner but choose rather the resemblance that

offereth it selfe in my text and that is contained in the word sacrifices

in the temple or tabernacle there were two altars one of burnt sacrifice another of incense the sacrifice of either will fit our purpose
that of incense exod
where god telleth expresly of what spices the perfume should be made he addeth these wordes thou shalt beate some of it very small and put it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation where will meete with thee
the resemblance is very fit
but it is fitter if we take it from the other altar and indeed it is fit we take it thence for though my text be true of all morall seruice god requireth it god delighteth in it as might bee shewed at large if the time would permit and it were to my purpose yet now haue to doe with no more then concerneth king dauids case the reconciliation of a penitent so much morall worship as answereth to burnt offering and sacrifice whereof you heard in the verse going before now they did belong to the altar of burnt offerings wherefore there will wee and wee shall find our resemblance
for the sacrifices were first cut in pieces that was their breaking secondly being so broken they were burnt into ashes that was a contrition of them a contrition and a breaking which doth most liuely represent the breaking and contrition required in repentance
looke backe vpon them
the priest that did cut the sacrifice in pieces did as the iewish rituals obserue not mangle but ioynt the parts and what should wee doe in our repentance but orderly take asunder and in our meditations view apart the seuerall powers that are in our soule and not mingle the vnderstanding and the will but seeing each hath his owne defects we must feelingly consider the seuerall defects that are in each power
and this is the breaking of the heart and the spirit
but the parts of the sacrifice were not onely broken but they were brought to the fire and there they were burnt to ashes and it is not enough for vs in grosse to obserue the defects of the seuerall powers that are in our soule we shall find them intricate and a very labyrinth wee must hunt out euery lurking sinne and euery particle must beare a part in this humiliation the fire of spirituall affliction must pierce euen vnto the least iot of that which doth partake of corruption otherwise our heart and spirit are not as they ought broken and contrite

saint ambrose conceiueth that these words are meant of christ
and indeed he that doth but read the
of esay which is often alleadged by the apostles especially saint peter shall finde that christ had a broken and contrite heart and spirit indeed the euangelists doe expresse it in significant words

hee was in an agony his soule was undefined span alphabet on euery side encompassed with heauinesse euen vnto death he began undefined span alphabet to be euen astonished undefined span alphabet to droope to become euen heartlesse the sacrament what is it but a representation of the humiliation of our sauiour christ not in conscience of his owne sinne but for expiation of our pride was christ pleased to be humbled not onely in body but in soule also
and to him must we be conformed for he is the best patterne of a broken and contrite spirit

but marke in these words broken and contrite that euery kind of concussion

is not a poenitentiall humiliation

for the diuels they feare and tremble when they remember in what case they stand

and so did felix tremble when saint paul preached of the iudgement to come and how was pharaoh shaken when he was vnder the plagues of egypt

baltazar quiuered and his knees smote together when he saw the but their hearts and spirits were made of tough mettall not one of them brake or was contrite but after gods hand was off they continued whole and wholly the same persons
and so if wee doe and it is too common for vs to doe so crie we out neuer so much haue sinned and god be mercifull vnto me in our danger be it what it may be wee are not humbled as the morall seruice of god requireth
as we wound our soules so must we be contented to search those wounds and least they fester

search them to the bottome we must be contented as throughly to grieue for sinne as to take delight therein

but a little farther to wade into this point there are two kinds of griefe that the schooles speake of appretiativus and intensivus they apply it somwhat vntowardly but here wee may make a good vse of it for our spirituall humiliation must testistifie first at what rate wee doe set the fauour of god and hauing no better thing to wreck our displeasure vpon for the losse therof then our heart and spirit we vse them so roughly and choose them for the subiect of humiliation
secondly the breaking and contrition of heart and spirit doe shew that our sorrow is as intensiue as it is appretiatiue as the thing is most deare vnto vs which we afflict so there can be no deeper wounds giuen then those wherwith we afflict it
but sorrow is not enough vnto humiliation there are two other things that must goe therewith and are very clearly insinuated in this manner of breaking and contriting our heart
the first is the detestation of sin committed for how can a man more clearely expresse that he doth abhorre his own wickednesse then by so breaking and afflicting of his owne both heart and spirit if he make them suffer for it it is an vndoubted signe that hee doth detest it
a second thing required is that a man returne to god and that also is insinuated in a broken and contrite heart for seeing it is the hardnesse of heart that did shut god out what is the breaking of the heart but the letting of him in yea this breaking and contrition being borrowed from the sacrifice there was no incensio sine ascensione as the corporall so the spirituall fire doth not burne but it doth ascend therefore fitly doth the holy ghost call the altar vpon which the sacrifices were offered misbach gnoloth the altar of ascensions that is the altar of burnt sacrifices that doe ascend because all such morall worship imports a mans religious disposition to be reconciled vnto god
hitherto we haue spoken of the humiliation of a broken and contrite heart but we haue spoken nothing of the workemaster who it is that can so humble both the heart and spirit
hee seemeth not here to be exprest and yet it is fit he be knowen and if we enquire we shall find that there is a double author

the principall one is god it is a good rule of saint austins

firmiter tene neminem hic posse paenitentiam agere nisi quem deus illuminauerit

gratuità misericordià conuerterit
saint paul warranteth this rule the seruant of the lord must in meeknesse instruct those that are contrary minded

and see if god peraduenture will giue them repentance
but it is true also that the heart and the spirit that is broken and contrite hath a hand in its owne breaking and contrition of it selfe our owne vnderstanding doth discouer our sinne and our owne heart doth melt it selfe vpon the sight thereof yea it would be no vertue of ours were it not produced by our owne reasonable faculties

it is true that the crosse sometimes and sometimes discontent worldly discontent because things goe not with vs as flesh and bloud desireth or spirituall discontent because the worme of conscience doth bite vs and giueth vs no rest doe oftentimes humble vs but these things make not vp our broken and contrite heart except we be as well actiue as passiue therein as christ in his so we in our sacrifices must be sacerdotes sacrificium we must be both the thing that is offered and the offerers we must as willingly humble our selues as be deeply humbled

but here we must obserue a good rule of saint bernards when we say that this humiliation is from god

and from man from gods grace and mans freewill we doe not meane that these are but subordinate non partim gratia partim liberum arbitrium grace and freewill doe not share the worke betweene them sed totum singula peragunt each of them doth performe the whole worke grace doth it wholly freewill doth it wholly sed vt totum in illo sic totum ex illâ as the whole humiliation is immediately wrought by the freewill of man so is the freewill of man inabled thereunto by the grace of god grace determineth the wil if not physically at least morally

but to conclude this poynt we often read in the prophets that god doth threaten he will conterere peccatores crush sinners all to pieces saint basil telleth vs that there is a remedy against it that is contrition is to be opposed against contrition

if we will humble our selues god will neuer humble vs

haue dwelt long enough in opening our morall seruice come now to shew you how it is esteemed

here the first thing that find is that what was denyed to the ceremoniall is yeelded to the morall seruice
first there it was denyed that god doth require that but here it is affirmed that god requireth this for a broken and contrite heart is gods sacrifices
and see here at first we meere with a rubbe for in corporall sacrifices a man might not offer that which was broken or bruised

it should seeme that in spirituall he may
but the reconciliation is easie for those sacrifices did principally note christ who was without all blemish before he was offered and yet being such he was broken for our sinnes my text doth not compare man to the sacrifice before it was offered though we should all striue to be as good as we may when we present our selues to god but the comparison is of man to the sacrifice after it is offered and then it may without fault bee broken yea it is brought thither to the end that it may be broken neither except it be broken is it any sacrifice
but to the maine point

told you there are two propositions in these words the sacrifices of god are a broken and contrite heart
first that god which careth not for the slaughter of beasts requireth the mortification of men that is the slaughter which he requireth therfore is the name seuach giuen vnto it which signifieth a beast slaine
and this bringeth vs on to another note con+cerning a broken and a contrite heart and that is our humiliation is the slaying of the beastiality of our nature and indeed euery lust is a very beast and for them doth the holy ghost call men by the name of many beasts sometimes swine sometimes dogges sometimes foxes hee that doth abolish these lusts doth slay so many beasts

a second proposition is that one mortification of man is to god insteed of all the sacrificing of beasts
all that were required to reconciliation or all simply surely we may vnderstand it both wayes
it may be sacrifices if it comprehend onely the expiatorie and dedicatorie as it doth so farte as god requireth these from vs and accepteth vs in christ for he requireth no other expiation of vs then a godly sorrow detesting sinne neither doth he expect any other dedication then that wee be wholly conuerted vnto god and shewed you how both these are represented in the broken and contrite heart

will you extend it to all sacrifices you may

for all had some reference to reconciliation euen those which seeme to haue least the votiue and eucharisticall for though their principall ends were to acknowledge or obtaine some blessing of or from god yet the manner of the sacrificing so farre as it was common to the sacrifice for sin did withall deprecate gods wrath and acknowledge that sinne made the offerer vnworthy as well of that blessing which he had receiued as of that which he begged
which must bee obserued because this broken and contrite heart looketh to the praise of god which dauid not many verses before promised he would shew forth and indeed a repentant confession is in the scripture called a giuing glory vnto god

finally these broken spirit and heart are the sacrifices which god calleth for for he is a spirit and what can be more sutable vnto him then that which is spirituall therefore euer in the legall hee did ayme at the spirituall as you may gather out of the new testament the gospell is set forth in termes of the law to preach is undefined span alphabet to play the priest

the people conuerted are called undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet a sacrifice and oblation the skilfull handling of the scriptures

is undefined span alphabet rightly to diuide the word yea

the word it selfe is by saint paul said to bee sharper then any two edged sword or sacrificers knife piercing euen to the diuiding asunder of the soule and the spirit the whole passage is full of sacrificing phrases

may not omit one thing wee are called a spirituall priesthood

yea the whole body of the church is so called a priest must not bee without his sacrifice and here are the sacrifices which god will haue euery one offer euen euery lay man may offer these sacrifices vnto god

we may nay we must offer them but how will god accept them surely very well a broken and a contrite heart god will not despise
men vse

to make little account of yea they make themselues sport with those that are broken hearted and of a contrite spirit that mourne like doues and lament in the bitternesse of their soules dauid complaineth in his penitentials yea our sauiour christ himselfe in the
and other psalmes that when they were humbled then they were derided
and indeed in the iudgement of flesh and bloud these things seeme to be of no value they seeme to be contemptible but he that doth vse them shall finde that he shall neuer be confounded of god

the reason wee haue in ioel rent your hearts and not your garments for the lord is gratious mercifull long suffering

he will not breake a bruised reed nor quench smoking flaxe hee that would not despise ahab in his humiliation nor manasses will much lesse despise a mary magdalene a saint peter a publican verily undefined span alphabet he will neuer set them at naught

but the word hath in it a litote more is meant then is exprest god is so farre from despising that he maketh great account thereof
told you that it is vouchsafed the double effect of sacrifices first it yeeldeth a sweet smell vnto god

for there is ioy in heauen for one sinner that repenteth yea more ioy then for ninety and nine that need not repentance and in the prophet

to this man will looke euen to him that is poore and of a contrite spirit

and trembleth at my word
secondly it yeeldeth a smell of rest vnto man for so we read in esay dwell with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit to reuiue the spirit of the humble and te reuiue the heart of the contrite ones

saint bernard coupleth them both together animam poenitentiae lachrymis afflictam spiritus paracletus libenter consolatur frequenter visitat ad veniae fiduciam plenè reformat
therefore let vs learne of saint austin this good lesson

quaeramus lapidem quo percutiatur incredulus percussus quassetur quassatus comminuatur comminutus in puluerem conuertatur conuersus in puluerem compluatur complutus seratur satus ferat fructum non quod igne absumatur sed quod in horreo condatur

but may not dwell longer hereon
there are two other notes which drew the one out of gods desire of the other out of his delight in these sacrifices call them paradoxes
and so indeed they seeme to flesh and blood
god requireth a broken a contrite heart and spirit as his sacrifices then there is a certaine religious
and so there is a man may holily kill himselfe breake his heart and crush his spirit as it were to dust

but this must be done not corporally but spiritually as elsewhere we are willed to plucke out our offending eyes and cut off our offending hands we must mortifie not our nature but the corruption that cleaueth to our nature such slaying god allowes for indeed it is a quickening life in sinne is death and the death of sinne is life

the second paradoxe is that we neuer please god better then when we please our selues least seeing god doth not despise a broken and a contrite heart for we are full of imperfections of which god would haue vs rid our selues therefore he is glad when he seeth vs play the good husbands weeding our fields good physitians purging of our corrupt humours carefull not to foster or fauour ought that may offend him or cause our owne ruine now this we cannot doe without much disquieting

and afflicting of our selues omnis medicina salutaris facit dolorem our corupt nature will repine at such alterations

but to draw to an end what our sauiour christ said when he went to raise lazarus this sicknesse is not vnto death that must wee conceiue of all those whom we see to haue broken and contrite hearts

rather as he that was to be dispossest was immediately before the diuell came out miserably torne and turmoyld and euen left for dead vntill christ put out his hand and raised him vp safe and sound euen so shall wee feele the greatest conflicts with sin when we are euen ready to be set free by grace
saint austin setteth himselfe out for an excellent monument hereof in his confessions

secondly seing god is delighted with this sacrifice we are forbidden to despaire of our owne vnworthines as to presume of our righteousnes this text doth warrant vs this comfort when in these fits wee seeme to be furthest from god god bringeth vs then nearest vnto himselfe for this pang is a of health but senslesse sinners haue no part in this consolation
thirdly god in this morall seruice hath equalled the rich and the poore hee doth hereby take off their eyes from their worldly estate wherein they differ and sixeth them on that wherein they are equall
in these sacrifices the poore may bee as forward as the rich and if there bee any disaduantage it is on the rich mans side for he thinking that hee hath something to giue besides himselfe doth giue himselfe to god the lesse specially in this kind of seruice which rich men desire not to bee acquainted with god herein taketh downe their pride because he passeth by all their wealth and setteth his estimate vpon humiliation
as for the poore that hath nothing to giue but himselfe god by this text yeeldeth him this glory hee need not if hee will be vnprouided of the best gift that can be giuen that is himselfe poore selfe if he haue grace to be as poore in spirit as hee is in purse and lament the want of grace asmuch as he doth his want of wealth
finally this text is one of the prefaces to our dayly liturgie would we did as often practise it as we doe repeate it certainly there is great cause we should whether we respect sinne or woe whereof there was neuer more or any that deserued more humiliation
the times deserue that euery day should bee a day of humiliation and that euery man should affit his soule the more wee know god requireth this seruice and the better wee see that he accepteth it the more forward should we bee to performe it
and pray god wee may haue so heard this text opened that our hearts and spirits may relent with it so shall we not be iudged of the lord if we will iudge our selues nay sowing in teares we shall reape in ioy amen

epigraph

psal
verse
doe good in thy good pleasure vnto sion build thou the walles of ierusalem

when brake vp this psalme shewed that it consisteth of two vowes made by king dauid one for himselfe another for his kingdome haue ended the first that vowe which concerneth the king am now come vnto the second the vow which he maketh for his kingdome
this second vow as the first will be resolued into a desire and a promise
of the promise in the next verse the desire is contained in this
in opening of this desire
will obserue first for whom it is conceiued secondly what it doth containe
those for whom it is conceiued are noted in these words sion ierusalem which made vp the mother citie of the kingdome of israel an excellent type of the church for these king dauid maketh a suite and the suite for them is in effect the same which he made for himselfe
he sueth that they may be restored into the state of grace that is the meaning of these words doe well vnto sion
secondly that being restored they may be preserued therein which he beggeth in these words build vp the walles of
these be the blessings for which he sueth and hee sueth for them in a sense sutable to the places his suite is mysticall
but to whom is the suite made and for whose sake doth hee hope to speede surely he sueth onely to god to him it is that hee saith doe good build thou the walles and hee hopeth to speed onely for gods sake therefore doth he adde in thy good pleasure doe good in thy good pleasure and in thy good pleasure build thou the walles of ierusalem
lay together the parts of the text and then you will see in it two remarkable vertues confidence in god and compassion towards the church
confidence for in the beginning of the psalme dauid seemeth so deiected that he hath enough to doe to pray for himselfe hee so describeth his estate as if hee were not worthy to doe so much but towards the end of the psalme he sheweth himselfe another man hee taketh heart and becommeth a for all israel yea hee presumeth to begge for it the greatest blessing of god
but he doth it out of another vertue also which shineth here the vertue of compassion he is not contented to fare well himselfe he desireth the of his whole kingdome as hee made it obnoxious to gods wrath so he holds himselfe bound to bee a mediatour for gods fauour
such charitie in praying deserueth to be exemplarie wherefore let vs listen diligently to the vnfolding thereof that wee may learne to exemplifie it in our prayers

the first thing that we must enter vpon are those for whom king conceiueth this desire they are sion and ierusalem which words in the scripture are taken sometimes historically sometimes mystically that

is either they nore places in the holy land or else by those places represent vnto vs the church of god
because the mysticall sense cannot bee concerued but by the correspondencie which it hath vnto the historicall must first open the historicall that so may the better guide your apprehension in the mysticall

before doe this must let you know that sion and ierusalem were two distinct places yet it is vsuall in the scripture in naming either to meane both
in the second psalme haue set my king vpon my holy hill of sion sion there comprehendeth ierusalem for dauid who is meant in that text was king of both
in the beginning of ecclesiastes solomon is said to haue beene king in ierusalem we may not exclude sion for he was king in that also
this being briefely obserued come now to the storie of these words

where first you must obserue that either of these places were hills of sion the common attribute doth witnesse it for it is called mount sion and of ierusalem it is as true iosephus reporteth that it was built vpon the hill acra the psalmist beareth witnesse hereunto saying

he hath laide his foundations in the holy mountaines and the common phrase of ascending to ierusalem

secondly the whole tract of those hils was called the land of moriah which is by interpretation the place where god appeareth or is conspicuous there god appeared vnto abraham when hee was ready to offer isaac there did he appeare vnto dauid when the punishing angell vpon dauids prayer was commanded to sheath his sword finally there appeared the sonne of god in our flesh when he wrought the redemption of man

thirdly those places were two seuerall cities whereof one was in the lot of beniamin the other was in the lot of iudah ierusalem that was in the lot of beniamin was conquered by iosua but sion that was in the lot of iudah continued in the possession of the iebusites vntill the dayes of king dauid he subdued them though he did not wholly extinguish them as appeareth by the storie of araunah the iebusite dauid hauing gotten the possession of sion ioyned it with a wall to ierusalem and so of two made one citie one citie of those which before were two and that of two seuerall nations iebufites and israelites of this vnion we must vnderstand these words in the psalme

ierusalem is a citie that is compacted together in it selfe

fourthly dauid hauing thus vnited the cities translated thither the arke and god there designed a place where the temple should be built euen vpon a piece of ground that lay indifferently betweene the tribes of indah and beniam in and so it became the fixed place where god chose to put his name and where hee vouchsafed to reside betweene the cherubins it was gods sedes religionis the ordinarie place of diuine worship to this the psalme beareth witnesse thither the tribes euen the tribes of israel goe vp according to the testimonie vnto israel to praise the name of the lord

neither was it onely sedes religionis but imperij also it was the kings

royall chamber and there he kept his residence there were the thrones of iudgement euen the thrones of the house of dauid as it followeth in the same psalme

by the way
out of that which you haue heard you may gather the reason why when the ten tribes reuolted from the house of dauid beniamin and the leuites continued stedfast to it beniamin had a great interest in ierusalem and the leuites maintenance depended on the temple whereunto their seruice was confined

to goe on fiftly you must obserue that though these two places onely are named yet the whole kingdome is vnderstood for this was the mother citie though the honour of the prerogatiues belonged vnto her yet from her was the benefit both of pietie and policie to be deriued vnto the whole land yea vnto the whole nation for in whatsoeuer countrie an israelite dwelt he was free of ierusalem you may perceiue it by the answere made by the reubenites

gadites and halfe pribe of munasses when they were challenged for idolatrie because they erected an altar vpon the bancke of iordan before they passed ouer into their owne in heritance it is more cleare acts
where we reade that there were iewes dwelling at ierusalem of all nations vnder heauen there are reckoned some of africa some of asia some of europe
and further to make good this assertion philo iudaeus in his embassie to claudius the emperour maketh this a motiue why he should be good vnto ierusalem because in so doing he should preserue many nations amongst whom the iewes liue dispersed

finally these places as it hath been by many diuines obserued were seated in the midst not only of the holy land but also of the whole world the whole world say that was then known

so that as the tree of life in the middest of paradise so ierusalem in the midst of the whole world might easily bee repaired vnto by those that did desire it and it had fit opportunitie to spread it selfe into the knowledge of all the world

these things are to bee obserued in those places according to the historie
but all things came to the iewes in types therefore wee may not thinke that king dauid had an eye onely to the corporall places his eye pierced farther euen to that which was figured therein hee looked to the kingdome of christ

and indeede the church is in the scripture called by these names might referre you to the vision of ezekiel which taketh vp the last eight chapters wherein all agree that the church is delineated or the vision of saint iohn in the last of his reuelation wherein there is more perspicuitie but both of those places are darke will point you out plainer one in saint peter

behold put in sion a chiefe corner stone hee alleageth the words out of esay and sheweth it was a plaine prophesie of christ and his church saint paul affirmeth as much of ierusalem ierusalem saith he that is aboue

or from aboue is mother of vs all and in the epistle to the hebrewes both places are conioyned in this signification

you are come saith he to mount sion to the citie of the liuing god to the heauenly ierusalem

will not trouble you with more places there are store in the prophets come to more profitable matter
ecce typum ecclesiae behold the correspondencie that must bee betweene the church and those places
those places were hilly and had the valley of gehinnon vnder them

cannot giue you a better morall then is contained in that prouerbe of solomon the way of life is aboue to the wise that hee may depart from hell beneath or if you will take that of saint paul

set your affections on those things that are aboue not on those things that are below thoughts groneling vpon the earth bend towards hell god will haue vs raise our thoughts and testifie that our treasure is in heauen

the second correspondencie is taken from moriah where the church is there is god to be seene

in inda is god knowne his name is great in israel in salem is his tabernacle and his dwelling in sion without the chureh though god bee yet he is not by any gracious reuelation not by that transforming reuelation whereby god shining vnto vs in the face of icsus christ doth transforme vs into the same image both of grace and glorie

the third correspondencie standeth in the vnion wherevpon austen and others obserue the incorporation of the gentile into the church of the iewes it may bee saint paul meaneth as much when he speaketh of christs taking downe the partition wall

for while sion and ierusalem were diuers cities there was no open passage out of the one into the other as afterwards there was

howsoeuer to the ephesians hee teacheth that they became undefined span alphabet one body and partaked of the same prerogatiues meane the iewes and gentiles

the fourth correspondencie stands in the prerogatiues of this citie for it was sedes regni religionis the citie of god and of the king and what is the church but regnum and sacerdotium

first a kingdome of priests or a royall priesthood the church beareth a kingly mind free from coertion yet following the direction of the law whereunto accordeth that of saint paul lex non est posita iusto

righteous men are not led with the spirit of bondage to doe things out of feare but they are led by the spirit of adoption they will doe well though they haue no law
and indeed this is a true kingly mind

but as our mind must be kingly so must it be priestly also all our seruices must be sacrifices we must prefent them at gods altar and wee must offer them with the fire of heauen for therefore doth god separate his church from the world that hee may deuote it vnto himselfe neither would god euer doe vs the honour to make vs kings except he did expect honour from vs as we are his priests

the fifth correspondencie standeth in the extent of these prerogatiues though they were bestowed vpon ierusalem yet they were to redound vnto the whole land yea the nation of the israelites

saint peter hath moralized this to our hand of a trueth perceiue that there is no respect of persons with god but in euerie nation whosoeuer feareth him and worketh righteousnesse is accepted of him wheresoeuer we liue we may bee of the israel of god and partake the prerogatiues of the heauenly ierufalem

the last correspondencie standeth in the situation ierusalem was in the midst not of the holy land onely but also of the whole world a citie saith our sauiour christ built vpon a hill cannot be hid

and againe men doe not light a candle to put it vnder a bushell god was neuer so farre estranged from apostataes but he placed his church so as that before christs incarnation the iourney was not hard for any to come at it and after christs incarnation when god was pleased to seeke to men that in so many generations did not seeke to him and the law was gone out of sion

and the word of the lord from ierusalem the passage was the more easie for all parts of the world so carefull hath god beene to take all excuse from the murmuring disposition of sinfull men

the places yeeld these correspondencies which you haue heard there are besides these two other which spring from their proper names sion signifieth a watch tower ierusalem the vision of peace
applie this onely to the church militant and then this correspondencie ariseth the first representeth the nhture the second the fruit of faith
the nature of faith is to stand as it were sentinell and discouer with one one eye gods will and what we ought to doe with the other eye our spirituall foes and how they make towards vs from such a faith the fruit that we reape is peace for we shall haue peace with god if we take heede vnto his will and our foes will not much disquiet vs if they find vs standing vpon our guard

if wee applie it not onely to the militant but to the triumphant church also then sion signifieth undefined span alphabet our waiting for the adoption

to wit the redemption of our bodies or that same undefined span alphabet mentioned heb
the saluting a farre off of that which we hope one day comfortably to enioy
and that which we shal enioy is noted by ierusalem wherin we shall dwell as in a peaceable habitation

in sure dwellings and in a quiet resting place you may read at large hereof reuel

and conclude that quae nunc sion est futuraest ierusalem the church which is militant shall one day be triumphant

out of all this which you haue heard you may gather how due the commendation is which is giuen to this place it is called the citie of our god

the mountaine of gods holinesse beautifull for situation the ioy of the whole earth
esay calleth it a mountaine lifted vp aboue all mountaines ieremie calleth it the throne of the lord others giue it other honourable titles the psalmists concludes all in this short verse glorious things are spoken of thee thou citie of god

conclude this point
as that you haue heard is typus ecclesiae so it is also imago nostri as it doth represent the whole church so ought euerie man herein to behold what manner of person himselfe ought to be
in homogeneous bodies such as the church is what is commended to the whole must bee obserued by euerie part euerie part must bee though not in quantitie yet in qualitie the same with the whole as of a great wedge there is not a mite which is not as true gold as is the whole wedge

wherefore you must take all these correspondencies and applie them

to your selues and trie your selues by them for certainely euerie man is a citiz en either of ierusalem or of babylon and if you find not in your selues the characters of a citizen of ierusalem you haue reason to feare that you are of a worse societie of the societie of babylon and then reade in the prophets read in the reuelation of what a miserable corporation you are
leane the examination and comparison of these things to euerie mans priuate meditation and passe forward to my text

hauing found for whom king dauid conceiueth his desire wee must now see what he would obtaine for them and we shall find that it is in effect the same which he begged for himselfe he deliuereth his minde in fewer words but hee altereth not his meaning as you will perceiue when haue vnfolded the branches

first then he desireth that sion and ierusalem may be restored into the the state of grace so doe vnderstand these words doe good
that you may see doe not mistake them obserue that there is something which these words suppose and something which they expresse
they suppose that the contagion of king dauids sinne did cleaue to his people and surely so it did such is the reference betweene a king and his people that the finne of the one doth affect the other

manasses filled ierusalem with bloud and god was not pacified

till for manasses sinnes he gaue ierusalem into the hands of the caldeans you see there how the sinnes of the king doe affect the people
and contrarily the sinnes of the people doeaffect the king solomon speaketh it plainely for the sinnes of the people there are many princes god taketh them away by vntimely death as he did iosiah

this being true must not be mistaken for though each of their sinnes doe affect the other as farre as to bring punishments vpon them yet doth it not follow they should alwayes infect one the other and so deserue the punishment euerie man hath cause of punishment enough in himselfe by reason of his owne peculiar sinnes but the occasion of punishing them is often taken from another mans sinnes such an one as betweene whom and him there is neare reference

vpon this supposition doth king dauid make this prayer doe good as if hee should say my sinnes doe deserue that thou shouldest frustrate my good purpose and thine owne gracious promise vnto israel
dauid succeeding saul found the kingdome in a verie bad case you may read it in the beginning of the sixtie psalme and dauid set himselfe for to recouer it againe as appeareth psal
yea and god himselfe did promise by nathan that all should doe well
but now he might well doubt that god would let loose the raines vnto his enemies againe and interrupt all the peace and prosperitie of his kingdome and so he should haue no opportunitie to goe forward with this reformation he might feare least god would retract those gracious words spoken of sion this is my rest for euer here will dwell will aboundantly blesse her prouision

will satisfie her poore with bread and will also cloth her priests with saluation and her saints shall shout out aloud for ioy

hauing this iust ground of feare hee maketh this prayer doe good

and so the good which hee meaneth must be bonum indulgentiae and bonum beneficentiae hee prayeth god not to lay his sinne to his peoples charge nor for his sake to interrupt their prosperity but rather to grant that the sonnes of israel may bee as plants growen vp in their youth

that the daughters may bee as corner stones polished after the similitude of a pallace that their garners may be full affording all manner of store

but as before you heard that the places are taken not only historically but also mystically so must these words be answerable thereunto god then did good when he sent his sonne into the world dissolued the works of the diuell and gaue gifts vnto men
and we must not conceiue of the corporall prosperity of israel otherwise then as a type of the spirituall it is excellently set forth by the prophet esay

in this mountaine shall the lord of hosts make vnto all nations a feast of fat things

finally the word vsed by the psalmist signifieth not onely to doe good but to doe it with delight and so god speaketh in the prophets that hee will delight to doe them good and so doe it abundantly for we are not sparing in doing a thing when we de it with delight
yea and the good done as the word also signifieth

shall containe in it undefined span alphabet it shall be such as shall cheere vp the spirits of the israelites hee desireth that to them that mourne in sion may be giuen

beauty for ashes the oyle of ioy for mourning a garment of praise for the spirit of heauinesse
thus dauid would haue israel restored to the state of grace

not onely restored to it but also preserued in it so it followeth in the text build vp the wals of ierusalem
in muris tuitio salutis ierusalem could not be blessed but it would bee enuyed yea the more enuied the more it was blessed therefore it is not enough that it haue good it must also haue meanes to preserue that good otherwise better neuer haue it then to lose it againe non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri therefore is dauid as carefull of the safetie as the plentie of his people

and indeed he did strongly fortifie both sion and ierusalem the psalme testifieth as much

walke about sion goe round about her tell the towers thereof marke well her bulwarkes

but dwell too long vpon the materiall sion the church also needeth a preseruation and she must haue her wals but they are of another kinde
a lacedaemonian being asked why their city was not walled answered that they had valiant defendants which were in stead of wals vnto their cie the heauenly ierusalem hath no other wals the wals are the angels that pitch round about it

yea god himselfe doth enuiron it as a wall so saith the prophet

beside this inuisible it hath a visible wall the wall of the citie hath
foundations and in them the names of the
apostles of the lambe all gouernours that watch ouer gods people

and keepe away their enemies from them are as a wall vnto them for this is a liuing citie and all the parts thereof are liuing and therefore ierusalem is not onely said to bee trimmed as a spouse but also the spouse is said to bee faire as ierusalem

yea euery mans grace of perseuerance is a wall vnto himselfe and thereby doth hee hold out against all the manifold temptations wherewith hee is exercised while hee is militant our faith our hope our charity all our spirituall weale and comfort are secured by perseuerance

here is mention made not onely of wals but of building and building importeth an addition vnto the former fabricke and indeed great cities are not brought to their perfection in an instant rome wee say was not built in a day no more was ierusalem it did flourish in the dayes of dauid but it was to flourish more in the daies of salomon the temple was not yet built nor furnished with those orders which dauid receiued from god neither was the policie setled or the crowne entailed dauid wished that all these things might bee perfected and the state raised to that pitch of glory which it attained in the dayes of king salomon

but to the mystery
as the church wanteth wals in that it is militant so in that it is in via in that we are but on our way wee need edification and building vp churches haue their nonage and euery member hath no beter beginning then of a babe in christ wee must not alwayes feed vpon milke we must vse our stomacks to stronger meate

they that are young lings must grow on to the age of perfect men in christ they must grow on in faith in hope in charitie these must receiue dayly accessions so as wee liue in this world yea and wee must not thinke that here will be an end of our building our faith must end in the sight of god our hope in the fruition of god our charitie in vnseparable vnion with god vntill we haue put off our mortalitie and infirmitie and attained this perfection we haue not ended our building and there is no doubt but dauid looked thus farre

but here we must take heed of two errors
first we may not looke for new reuclations from heauen as if god would adde any thing to his oracles old and new heretickes fancying otherwise haue set on worke the forge of their idle braines and haue broached illusions of the diuell as diuine inspirations but gods truth is consummated in the writings of the prophets and apostles neither doth it admit any accession either of romish traditions or anabaptisticall illuminations such building is babylonish the building of ierusalem is onely the working of gods word into our heads and our hearts to make vs wise and holy men
the second error is of iudaizing christians who dreame of an earthly restitution of that citie and erecting of a glorious worldly monarchie there which shal not only ouer top but all the world
to countenance this fancy they corrupt many a prophesie and deserue no other refutation then that check which was giuen vnto the iewes vaine atempt in the dayes of adrian the emperor by his generall and in the dayes of iulian the apostata by the hand of god himselfe
certainly my text fauoreth no such building but that out of amos in acts
vers

you haue heard the contents of king dauids desire come now to

see to whom he doth direct it vnto god vnto him it is that he saith doe good build thou

and indeed to whom should he goe but to him that can and will grant what hee sueth for god onely can for hee that is goodnesse must doe good

euery good and perfect gift commeth from aboue it commeth from him the eyes of all looke vnto him hee openeth his hands and filleth all things liuing with goodnesse
in the creation hee gaue beginning to the goodnesse of a creature and if it faile no lesse power then this can restore it againe in a word there is none other good but hee and therefore none but he can doe good whether it be naturall or morall good good of grace or good of glory all are but drops whereof he is the ocean and hee is the sunne from whom these beames doe issue

his ability is not all the reason why the suite is directed vnto him but his promise also must bee ioyned thereto
take the words corporally then hath dauid a speciall promise both of the indulgence and beneficence of god

take them spiritually and then the blessings come within the generall promises of gods couenant for that hath the promises both of this life

and of that which is to come

for doe good you see there is reason to pray to god and there is as much reason for build thou the wals
men cannot so much as build corporally except the lord build the house he laboureth but in vaine that buildeth much more spiritually

seeing none can giue the spirit but himselfe and all our sufficiencie is from his spirit without which we can doe nothing god is the wall of our wall hee standeth about those that feare him as the hils about ierusalem

he will build vp ierusalem and gather together the of israel

but when wee make god the author wee doe not exclude the instruments our selues and others but shew their impotencie if he make them not both able and effectuall
the person is well chosen to whom the suite is directed but that is not enough there must bee some motiue also which may plead for the sutor
and here is the most preuailing motiue nothing without god euer moueth him to doe good many things from without may prouoke his vengeance but nothing can draw from him works of grace but that which is within him
and that which is within him the first mouer is alwayes his good will

gods will is alwayes good but wee then vse the addition of good when we feele the gracious effects thereof when god dealeth with vs according to the sweetnesse of his nature not the rigour of his iustice
and this phrase commeth then in seasonably when wee haue deserued the contrary as dauid now had and all men doe when they are put to this petition doe good build vp witnesse all the instaurations that haue beene since the beginning of the world
nothing can bee had from god by merit but we owe it all vnto gods mercie who for his owne sake doth repaire his church as at first he gaue it a being onely for his owne sake
and it is happie that that is the onely motiue for were it not for that wee should bee left comfortlesse but from this wee may receiue

more then wee can hope for hee dealeth like a god

and not like a man

secondly this phrase may note some remarkable thing touching the nature and measure of the gifts
the nature as if dauid did desire that most which would please god best and did not sue to god for other gifts then such as he taketh the greatest content in and so that he might obtaine gods good will for sion and ierusalem hee passeth not for all the rest and indeed it it is true spirituall wisedome to make let mee finde grace in thine eyes the vpshot of our suite and to seeme to minde no thing else but the recouery of gods good will

wee are sure then to speed with salomon of any other good though wee mention it not in our prayers

finally this phrase may note as the nature so the measure of the gifts it implyeth that we presume not to carue to our selues but leaue him to enlarge or contract his bountie as it seemeth best vnto him
and indeed as he knoweth best what is good for vs so is he the best proportioner of his gifts and will deale more freely the lesse we presume to prescribe vnto him
but let vs draw to an end
told you that in the whole text you might obserue two remarkable vertues shining therein the first is confidence

in the beginning of the psalme king dauid seemed to bee a very wretch so sinfull that he might well seeme vnworthy to open his mouth for himselfe yet hauing vnburthened his conscience and poured forth his soule for himselfe hee gathereth strength and groweth bold to pray for others for the whole kingdome yea for the whole body of the church hee presumeth to importune god to bestow the greatest of his temporall and spirituall blessings
and the conscience of sinne must not so dishearten vs but when wee haue made our owne peace wee may become suitors for others also it is an argument of the communion of saints and christ out of a hath taught vs to say our father

yea the apostle willeth vs to pray for all men

but as we must pray with this confidence like dauid so must wee bee like dauid in seasoning our prayers with compassion though we doe well enough our selues yet must we not be senslesse of other mens wants nor finde ease in ease while others are in danger especially if our selues haue beene the cause of their danger as dauid was who as much as lay in him exposed all israel to ruine and destruction
hee had reason therefore to remember it in his prayers and desire god to be gracious vnto it

god hath visited our land with a plague of raine and no doubt but our sinnes are the cause of so vnseasonable weather for

cursed be the earth for thy sake hath a constant truth and god doth not distemper the seasons except we be first distempered
you shall doe well therefore to looke vpon the land with compassion and remember in your denotion the distresses thereof

finally learne from king dauid to put into our prayers those to whom wee haue reference
would the time permit this note might be enlarged to parents masters magistrates pastors will insist onely on sion and ierusalem to that wee haue the neerest reference no consanguinity no affinity worketh so straight a band as doth the communion of saints yet is there nothing that moueth men lesse would it did moue more especially at this time when sion is as a wildernesse and ierusalem a desolation what with the turke and what with the pope euery where is the sword bathed in christian bloud if euer ne domine would now be a seasonable antheme wee should all pray be not wrath very sore lord neither remember iniquitie for euer
and would there were that compassionate disposition in vs which appeared in the captiue iewes

when they said if forget thee ierusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if doe not remember thee let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth if preferre not ierusalem before my chiefest ioy

god grant vs all such a disposition so will our dayly prayer bee vnto god doe well lord vnto sion build thou the wals of ierusalem

epigraph

psal
verse
then shall they be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousnesse with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings then shall they offer bullockes vpon thine altar

the later of king dauids vowes that which hee made for his kingdome doth present vnto vs a desire and a promise haue opened the desire am now to open the promise vnto you
in vnfolding whereof shall god willing shew you first what it containeth
secondly when it taketh place
it containeth a double vndertaking of king dauid hee vndertaketh first for god vnto the kingdome in these words thou shalt be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousnesse with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings
secondly he vndertaketh for the kingdome vnto god in the words that follow they shall offer bullockes vpon thine altar

but more distinctly
in king dauids vndertaking for god obserue a deuotion and the acceptance thereof the deuotion is noted by the name of sacrifice
and touching this deuotion we are moreouer taught that it is solid and full solid as appeares by the qualitie for it is a sacrifice of righteousuesse and righteousuesse maketh deuotion to bee solid
as it is solid so it is full gather that from the varietie for it consisteth of

burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings and these two as anon you shall heare will make vp a full deuotion

if the denotion be so solid so full it will find acceptance with god it will find acceptance for it will please and he that is pleased is no other then god to him dauid saith thou shalt be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousnesse
in the second vndertaking the kingdome is noted by this word they for it repeateth sion and ierusalem which were mentioned before that which for them dauid vndertaketh is that they shall be verie thankefull vnto god verie thankfull for they shall offer bullockes and they shall not misplace their thankfulnesse because they shall offer vpon gods altar
but when shall all this bee the text doth tell vs in this word then then shalt thou be pleased then shall they offer
when god hath fulfilled the desire whereof you heard in the former verse then shall follow the accomplishment of the promise whereof you shall heare on this
dauid vndersaketh this for if you marke hee speaketh without all peraduenture he affirmeth considently thou shalt bee pleased they shall offer
finally lay together the many parts of the text and behold a blessed accord betweene god and his church god graceth the seruice of his church and the church acknowledgeth the bountie of her god a better accord we cannot wish
and we may haue our part therein if we listen to that which shall be said as attentiuely as affectionately as hope we will am sure we ought

before we fall vpon the particulars we must take by the way this rule the promise must be vnderstood sutably to the desire that had a double sense a litterall and a spirituall and so must this haue also this rule must be carried through the particulars of my text whereof the first is sacrifice a ceremoniall word and importeth a legall seruice whereof the most part was performed at the altar either the brasen or the golden altar
but god was pleased to shadow a morall in that ceremoniall seruice as you may gather out of ezekiels last vision which is a prophesie of the new testament saint peter speaketh it plainely when he telleth vs that we must offer spirituall sacrifice through christ to god

and indeed what is a sacrifice but a visible prayer neither is prayer ought else but an audible sacrifice
yea looke how many kinds of prayers there are so many kinds of sacrifices was god pleased there should be
saint paul reckoneth vp foure kinds of prayers whereof the first

is

deprecation when the conscience of sinne maketh vs endeauour to pacifie gods displeasure vnto this answered the propitiatorie sacrifice
the second kind of prayer was

petition wherein man seeketh to god for supplie of his want vnto this answered the votiue sacrifice
either of these deprecation and petition may be made for others as well as for our selues whereupon prayer receiueth a third fashion and name which is called

intercession whereunto there was an answerable sacrifice as you may reade in the first and last of iob where hee sacrificeth for his children and for his friends
finally when wee haue receiued that which

we seeke at the hands of god by any of the three former kinds of prayer then come we to him with a fourth and that is a

thanksgiuing wherevnto did answere the eucharisticall sacrifice

seeing then there is such a correspondencie betweene morall deuotion and legall sacrifices the one may very well note the other and did not without cause tell you that deuotion was meant by the name of sacrifice
but touching this deuotion we are moreouer taught first that it must be solid for it must be a sacrifice of righteousnesse and indeede it is righteousnesse that maketh our deuotion solid
but there is a double righteousnesse a righteousnesse of the offerer and a righteousnesse of the offering will shew you both first in the ceremoniall then in the morall seruice
first for the offerer
there was about salomons temple a court which was called prophane beyond which no vncircumcised or vncleane person might come neither of them were deemed worthie to come into the court of israel or offer at gods altar except he were first circumcised if a gentile and if an israelite defiled except he were first ceremonially purified
whereby the holy ghost did giue vs to vnderstand morally that neither insidels nor vnrepentant christians are fit to serue god their sacrifice wanteth that righteousnesse that must bee in the offerer which is faith and repentance without which no man is worthie to come into his presence

there is a second righteousnesse and that is of the offering
in the law god commanded that no vncleane beast should bee sacrificed vnto him

and in those that were allowed for sacrifice he endured no blemish either inherent or adherent

they must not bee blind lame or diseased these were inherent blemishes neither must they bee ill gotten for god would not receiue the hire of an harlot
applie this morally and then yee must obserue that all impure thoughts and lusts must be excluded from our deuotion they are more abhominable then vncleane beasts a man may not begge of god that hee may speede in his adulterous his murderous his treacherous designes wee may begge nothing of god but that which god alloweth for good the lawfulnesse of the desire is the first righteousnesse required in our offering

but it is not enough that the desire be lawfull it must haue no inherent nor adherent vnrighteousnesse

inherent our deuotion must not bee blind we must pray with our vnderstanding it must not be lame we must pray with ardent affection finally it must not be diseased it must not be tainted with any corruption of hypocrisie vaine glorie no vnrighteousnesse must adhere to it if any doe our deuotion will not deserue to be called a sacrifice of righteousnesse

when we examine deuotion by these strict conditions wee shall find that there is no such sacrifice to be found but that onely one which was offered by our sauiour iesus christ in him was most absolute the righteousnesse both of the offerer and of the offering and therefore of the offering because of the offerer for one person was both and the stile of the person in the scripture is undefined span alphabet

the iust one and he is a priest for euer after the order of melchisedec which is by interpretation king of righteousnesse

therefore doe the fathers vnderstand christ in this phrase
but by participation of christs grace our deuotion may also passe for a sacrifice of righteousnesse

in the last vision of ezekiel the priesthood is entailed vpon the posterity of zadok wherein there is a mysterie

for zadok signifieth righteous and he was a type of christ so that not christ onely but his ofspring which we are may offer a sacrifice of righteousnesse

and indeed our persons and our gifts are both righteous if wee be truely incorporated into christ
but wee must obserue a great difference for christs sacrifice differeth from ours euen as it is onely iust for his righteousnes is perfect ours is but imperfect wee cannot exceed the measure of our regeneration and therefore wee may not ascribe vnto it more worth then it hath in it
notwithstanding wee must endeauour to haue it such as it is wee must endeauour that our deuotion may be a sacrifice of righteousnes that our deuotion may be solid

that is not enough although the sonne of syrac doth comfort vs euen in that respect when he telleth vs

that the sacrifice of the righteous maketh the altar fat
but here is besides the solidnes a fulnes also required in the deuotion gather it out of the varietie here specified burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings
the arabicke conioyneth these two words as if they noted but one thing but they are distinguished in the originall and in other translations and there is a good reason they should bee distinguished
for they note all kind of sacrifices for all are reduced to two heads they were either animata or inanimata they consisted of liuing creatures such as were birds and beasts and they come vnder the name of gnolah or else they consisted of things without life such as were floure oyle they come vnder the name of kalil here rendred whole burnt offerings these being the heads of either kind may well comprehend all the rest

secondly not onely all kinds of sacrifices are noted by these words but by consequence all sorts of persons for gnolah the burnt offering was offered for the whole body of the people whereunto kalil that is the whole burnt offering was to be added for the priest so that whereas the whole kingdome did consist but of priests and people all persons are comprehended vnder these words
thirdly these sacrifices were offered euery day early and late in the morning there was a gnolah a burnt offering and a kalil a whole burnt offering ioyned with it and as much at the euening no day was excused from either of them
fourthly both of these were wholly consumed no part reserued from god contrary to the condition of other sacrifices whereof alwayes the priests sometimes the people also had a share as in the votiue and eucharisticall sacrifice

these thing were ceremonially to bee obserued but in these there is a morality enwrapt and the morality is as manifold as was the ceremonie that fourefold and so is this
first of all things that we haue liuing or dead wee must make a present vnto god
secondly in so doing the

priest must not post ouer deuotion to the people nor the people to the the priest both must make their presents
thirdly euerie day must be a day of deuotion if not publikely in the communion of saints although that it might be publike was the true intent of the first founding of cathedrall and collegiat churches yea and of monasteries also yet priuately priests and people should day by day offer spirituall sacrifices vnto god
fourthly when we performe our deuotion we must take heede of sacriledge
as we must offer of all kinds so all parts of them to god

we must not bee vnwilling to forgoe any thing if it may aduance the glorie of god ananias and saphira their example most terrifie vs and it must make both priest and people willing to themselues close to the tenor of the law and to loue the lord their god with all their heart and with all their soule and with all their strength

you haue heard that the deuotion must be solta and full if it be such then it will find acceptance with god
acceptance for it will please the legall phrase is it will yeeld a sauour of sweete smell or a sauour of rest whereof the mortll is pleasing or delight and delight is the highestimprouement of loue
for loue doth first draw the eye to behold a thing secondly it draweth on the will to approue it thirdly it may open the hand to doe good vnto it but farther it cannot goe then to take content in it
so that this delight or pleasing she weth more then an ordinarie affection
but affections are as is the person in whom they arise no person greater then god therefore no delight can be like vnto his
but this is a paradox god is undefined span alphabet hee needeth nothing and what then can worke his delight yea it is a wonder that he should stoope to so base a solace that hath so incomprehensible pleasures in his owne nature
wonder not at it for it is condescensio paterna as parents vse to grace the small endeauours of their children so doth god the deuotion of his seruants non ex gnitate rei sed ex dignatione sua not that the seruice descrueth it but he vouchsafeth to respect it so that we may defraud our seruice of the honour but wee cannot defraud god of the comfort for gods comfort doth not depend on our seruice it is inseperable from his essence but the honour of our seruice depends of gods fauourable aspect which called gods acceptance

but how doth this acceptance appeare if you looke to the legall sacrifice god did testifie it to the corporall sion and ierusalem by fire from heauen which consumed the sacrifice but vnto the spirituall sion and ierusalem

he doth testifie it by the sensible comfort which by his spirit he doth infuse into their soules while they are militant and hee will testifie it more plentifully by the light of his countenance which shall shine vpon them when in the church triumphant they shall stand before his throne

marke here a correction of that which was said before you heard that sacrifices and burnt offerings were neither required nor accepted here you find the contrarie
and yet not the contrarie for there they bee refused in casu in a case wherein no sacrifice was allowed and they be also refused opposite if the morall be not ioyned with the ceremonial

but here wee haue no such case no such opposition god did accept them vnder the law as exercises of faith and he will accept the truth of them for euer for that is most agreeable vnto his nature a spirituall seruice to god which is a spirit
and let this suffice for king dauids first vndertaking

come now to the second his vndertaking for the kingdome
the kingdome is vnderstood in this word they it referreth to sion and ierusalem mentioned in the former verse they that haue the benefit are they that shal make the acknowledgement before it was ego the king spake in his owne person will shew forth thy praise will teach the wicked
now it is illi my kingdome priest and people both shall be as religions as my selfe
and indeed the kingdome as well as the king ought to be thankfull vnto god when god is good to both
dauid vndertaketh for his kingdome that it shall be very thankfull for they shall offer bullocks
a bullocke is a faire embleme of a spirituall sacrihce for it fignifieth an heyfer that is come to the age of beng fruitfull or it commeth of parah and yet it hath not borne the yoake nor beene put to any drudgery and such should euery one bee that serueth god he should be fruitfull and not seruile abounding in good workes but not be the slaue of sinne

there are two other things to be obserued in this word first it was the fairest of offirings
secondly it was the fittest for the offerers
amongst the sacrifices the fairer were the beasts and of the beasts the fairest was the bullocke
god commanded no sacrifice thet was greater then that
paul out of hosea doth moralize this sacrifice

calling it the calues of our lippes for by calues are these bullocks meant
we may adde that seing bullockes were the greatest of sacrifices we must thinke that nothing we haue is too good for god and we must make our offerings of the best

the bullocke was not onely the fairest offering but the fittetst for these offerers you shall read leutt

that whether it were the whole congregation or the priest that had offended either of them was to reconcile himselfe to god by the oblation of a bullocke and seeing they are meant in this place such a sacrifice doth best beseeme them but that the propitiatorie is turned into a gratulatorie
but to whom shall they be thankfull surely to him that doth deserue it to god they shall offer vpon his altar he that fulfilleth the desire hath iuterest in the promise they shall confesse that it is he that doth good to sion that it is he that butldeth the wals of ierusalem

secondly note that he saieth not that they will offer vnto him but vpon his altar the altar that was erected by his appointment
for though it be true that where the altar was there was god yet it followeth not that where god is there is his altar
god is pleased to confine not onely the substance but the circumstance of our seruice also

hee would not bee worshipped euery where

the ceremoniall altar is gon but the morall thereof abideth where christ is thither must we bend our seruice he is the altar that halloweth

our sacrifice on him and by him must we present it vnto god
againe the altar doth note that it is not enough for vs priuately to recount gods blessings we must divulge them publikely though the heathen had their priuate altars yet god had none but in a publike place therfore the setuice must needs be publike that is done vpon the altar

adde the bullocke and the altar together and then you shall find that this was operaria gratitudo the hand should testifie the thankfulnesse of the heart and the kingdome would be thankfull not in word onely but indeed also and indeed god doth good to sion and buildeth vp the wals of ierusalem that they may offer him such sacrifice
to conclude this poynt as dauid in his owne vow made gods praise the vpshot of his promise so doth hee in the vow of the people
and indeed the church must not desire prosperity otherwise then that god may haue the glory of it god made all things for himselfe and we must subordinate all things vnto him otherwise we substitute the creature in stead of the creator and cannot excuse our selues from idolatry from which dauid doth free his kingdome in saying they shall offer at gods altar
you haue heard of gods acceptance and the kingdomes thankfulnesse that these things shall bee performed dauid for both he vndertaketh to each of them for the other for marke how resolutely he speaketh thou shalt be pleased they shall offer
vox fidei fiduciae hee beleeueth it assuredly and therefore doth confidently affirme it
neither can their be any doubt but if our seruice be the sacrifice of righteousnesse god will accept it for he will neuer refuse what himselfe commanded
and it can as little be doubted that the kingdome will bee thankfull if god doe it that good for it is a speciall effect of grace to make vs so thankfull so that we may not doubt of either

haue sufficiently opened the promise vnto you one thing remaineth the circumstance of time when this promise shall take place it is exprest in this word then which is set before either of the vndertakings then shalt thou be pleased theu shall they offer except god fulfill the desire there is no hope of the promise but the performance of the promise will not be farre behind if the desire bee fulfilled
touching the ceremonie wee find it in the dedication of the temple when many thousands of bullocks were offered

and god appearing vnto solomon told him how well he was pleased therewith
and touching the morall though in figuratiue termes yet it is fairely set downe ezek
and malac

you haue it in a short sentence
psal
the people shall be willing in the day of thy power

and the beauties of holinesse and christ is as briefe when two or three are gathered together in my name am a mongst them

wee pray that wee may receiue grace and when wee haue receiued grace what temaineth but that we giue and wee shall giue glorie as we receiued grace imperfectly here on earth because our grace is imperfect but when our grace is perfect then shall wee giue glorie perfectly to god in the kingdome of heauen and of that glory which

is giuen in the church triumphant doe many of the fathers vnderstand this place

finally marke a blessed accord betweene gods acceptance and mans thankfulnesse it is an vncomfortable thing to serue and not to be regarded but if any thing will encourage it is this

that we shall heare euge serue bone well done seruant faithfull and true enter into thy masters ioy wherefore let vs hearten our selues that god will accept and knowing that let vs doe our best to please

am come to the end of of my text and withall to the end of the psalme but god forbid your profit should end with my paines
austin thought that euery man should sing ouer this psalme euery day and act a penitent as king dauid did
and indeed which of vs may presume better of himselfe then king dauid had cause and who may not desire if he be so bad to speed as well as king dauid did hee began at miserere fell as low in his humiliation as a mortall man can doe but you see how hee endeth his humiliation was not so low but his exaltation was as high and his ioy proued as great as euer his sorrow was
it is a witty obseruation which saint ambrose hath hee maketh this psalme a psalme of iubile hee gathers his note from the number in the septuagint which most of the ancients follow this is accounted the fiftieth psalme therefore doth that father parallel it to the fiftieth yeare
the fiftieth yeare was the yeare of iubile to the israelites wherein all debts were released bondslaues were set at liberty and hee that had sold it was repossest againe of his inheritance
and doth not that befall a man spiritually if he be penitent which the israelites enioyed corporally yea verily
he that was by sinne a slaue vnto sathan by repentance is mad a of god vpon our repentance are all our cancelled which wee haue either inherited or contracted finally it returnes vs againe to paradise out of which wee were cast for sinne a blessed comfort of repentance and therfore a blessed vse may we make of this psalme the contents whereof is this vertue of repentance
and what can wish you yea and my selfe also but that from the misery of sinners wee may ascend to to the glory of saints and

wee thy humble seruants beseech thee our lord iesu christ

that thou wilt be indulgent to our grieuous sinnes and grant that being humbled by true contrition of heart and hauing mortified all our corrupt lusts we may be prepared as an acceptable holocaust vn to thee and with the angels sing for euer haleluiah haleluiah

haleluiah in the kingdome of heauen

the text
but when the pharisees had heard that iesus had put the sadduces to silence they were gathered together

then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying
master what is the great commandement
iesus said vnto him thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soule and with all thy minde

the first sermon

no sooner had ended the doctrine of repentance which set before you in the example of king dauid but it came into my mind that the next way to perswade any man to follow it was to teach him how he might best bee acquainted with his owne state
for though it be true that euery man that knoweth himselfe to bee guiltie doth not repent yet it is as true that no man doth repent except he know himselfe to bee guiltie
now the apostles rule is

that the knowledge of sinne commeth by the law the law is a looking glasse wherein we may see what manner of persons we are
whereupon resolued to make the law my next text
not that law which was proper to the iewes and was abolished by the crosse of christ the ceremoniall and politique but that law which is common to all the world and shall neuer haue an end meane the

morall law which is contained in the ten commandements and indeed they are the great of cases of conscience
if euer a man be desirous to make a through inquirie into himselfe and giue vp against himselfe a true verdict they will set his sinne most clearely before his eyes and lay it most powerfully to his charge
they will
but not so well except a man be first prepared you must first learne a lesson that containeth the beginning and the ending of the decalogue and that is charitie all the ten commandements spring from this roote and this is the fruit that we must reape from them all they begin from and they end in charitie this charitie is the argument of those words that now haue read vnto you and the text is nothing but a preparatiue to the ten commandements let vs come then to it

the whole doth containe a conference betweene our sauiour christ and a pharisee wherein it was to appeare whether of the two had more skill in gods law
in breaking it vp will consider the occasion and the argument the occasion as giuen was christs conquest of the sadduces he had put them to silence as taken was the malice of the pharisees they were so vexed therewith that they no sooner heard it but conuenerunt they conspired to set vpon christ this was the occasion
thus farre the pharisee goeth meane to goe no farther at this time in vnfolding the text will begin then with the occasion first as it was giuen

christ in a dispute had foyled the sadduces the text saith hee had put the sadduces to silence
here we must learne first what these sadduces were they were a sect sprung vp amongst the iewes will briefely relate their originall as the hebrew storie hath it
antigonus sochaeus not long after the dayes of nehemiah was the chiefe rabbin in the great synagogue at ierusalem

who grauely instructing his disciples is said amongst other words to haue vsed those you must not be of seruile minds and doe your duetie for reward his disciples hearing this desired him to expound himselfe more fully
whereupon he addeth that men must not exspect the reward of in this world but stay for it vntill the world to come
to these words tzadock a chiefe disciple of his tooke exception and said he neuer heard of any such thing as the world to come
and thereupon hee with another fellow disciple of his called baithos turned apostataes and repaired to the schismaticall tempell built vpon mount gerizzim and became principall rabbins of the samaritans
and amongst them did tzadock first broach his heresie and taught them that there was no resurrection of the dead because no immortalitie of the soule and spirit and so consequently no iudgement for to come
therfore in this life was euerie man to make his fortune as well as hee could without any scruple of conscience and satisfie his lust whatsoeuer it were
if a man desire a fuller relation of their impietie let him but read the second chapter of the booke of wisedome where you haue a sadducee painted out to the full you haue his liuely picture
but that which specially marke vnto you is that the samaritans and the iewes were at deadly feude

they had no commerce one with an other
and here we find the heresie of the samaritans to haue corrupted the and that

euen in ierusalem there were many sadduces
say too little the sadduces were chiefe gouernours in ierusalem reade it acts
where you shall find that the chiefe priests to represse the apostles preaching the resurrection from the dead were assisted with those of the sect of the sadduces

flauius iosephus goeth farther and obserueth that the sect of the sadduces was most fauoured by those that were rich
and indeed it is most likely because they that haue a worldly state whereon to rest are commonly so addicted thereunto that they could well bee contented there were no other life so earthly so sensuall are their thoughts their hearts that they hardly beleeue and doe desire but coldly the things of a better life
yea they thinke all men senslesse and starke mad that make little accompt of things below that they may more fully enioy those things which are aboue
it is a lamentable thing to see a church degenerate so farre as not onely to endure but to giue countenance vnto a sect that did raze the verie foundation of pietie
but it was not their fault onely though christendome hath none knowne by the name of sadduces yet sadduces it hath too many too many that not onely liue as if there were no resurrection but also where they may be bold are not ashamed to maintaine so impious a conceite and perswade men out of conscience to liue lewdly who before did it onely out of impotencie of affections
magistrates are too patient to negligent in finding them out in rewarding them as they deserue

goe on in my text you haue seene what these sadduces were now see how christ putteth them to silence
the word is markable it is undefined span alphabet he bridled their mouthes which is a phrase borrowed from fierce and stomackfull horses which are impatient of the ryder yet are they held in by a strong bit and so subiected to the will of the rider perforce not out of their owne tractablenesse
men are resembled in the scripture to such horses be not like horse and mule which haue no vnderstanding

but must be held in with bit and bridle least they runne vpon vs wherein you may perceiue that the bridle doth not alter the disposition of the horse but onely stay him from doing what otherwise hee would euen so did our sauiour christ silence the sadduces though they were ill affected to him and men as you heard of great authoritie among the iewes yet did christ so clearely dissolue their sophismes and resolue their doubt with that authoritie that they became had not a word to returne vpon him
which is strange whether you consider and compare the meane wherein christ appeared with the great countenance of the sadduces or the out facing of heresie with the modestie of truth

but though christ stopped their mouthes yet did hee not alter their hearts for though they could not defend sadducisme yet did they continue sadduces as appeares acts chap
and chap
the reason wherof is because they moued their question not out of a desire to know the truth but with a purpose to scoffe at christ
when men seeke with such minds vnto god god is pleased to bring the scorne vpon them

but hee leaueth them in their grosse ignorance
adde hereunto that when men haue resolued to make the satisfying of some corrupt lust the vpshot of their endeauours they accept or refuse all things in reference thereunto and stop their eares and hearts so that they heare with a deafe eare and with a dull heart entertaine whatsoeuer maketh against them
hence is it that the ministers paines taken with those who make their their god or commit idolatrie with their gold or incline to any erronious conceite or sinful affection is co~monly so fruitlesse christs was who will wonder that ours is
the vse we must make hereof is this neuer to moue question in religion but out of the loue of truth bringing with vs a desire to yeeld when it is reuealed vnto vs secondly we must take heed how we set our affections vpon any thing for if that become once our last end a will assoone change his skin and a leopard his spots as we will be remoued from it
and let this suffice for the occasion giuen

no sooner was it giuen by christs foyling the sadduces but it was taken by the pharisees for vpon the hearing of it
conuenerunt in they fell to consultation
but here must briefely shew you what these pharisees were

we find in the booke of maccabees that when antiochus epiphanes had taken ierusalem and as the prophet daniel foretold had put downe the seruice of god and interdicted the obseruance of the law many religious iewes chose rather to feare god then the king
and when manie apostate iewes made couenant with the gentiles and vncircumcised themselues the religious held on the circumcision and obserued the law strictly they are there called by the name from the hebrew chasidim

which signifieth men of pious or religious hearts in time they changed their name into chacamim that is wise men and became the oracles of the people and were consulted in doubts of religion
religion by this time was come out of their hearts into their heads
they changed their names a third time and were called pharisees they went still from better to worse
for a pharisee is he that is separated from other men you may learne it of the pharisee in the gospell

thinke god am not like other men so doth he vaunt in his prayer to god
and indeed they thought themselues too good to conuerse with the vulgar sort
but the ground of this conceit is worth the marking for by that time they tooke vnto themselues this name the forgerie related in the apocryphal esdras began to be current

it began to be beleeued that moses in mount sinai receiued not only a law which he writ but another also which he deliuered by word of mouth that ioshua receiued it from him and others from ioshua that so it continued by succession vntil it was conueied into the talmud the new testament calleth it the traditions of the elders the iewes themselues mishne which the fathers render undefined span alphabet yea they are not ashamed to enter into a blasphemous comparison of the written law with the vnwritten giuing the preheminence to the vnwritten aboue the written
the church of rome hath dream't the verie same dreame in the new testament as they did in the old and hath fained a traditionarie gospell as the other fained a traditionarie

law
and she commeth fairly after them in the blasphemous comparison the time will not suffer me to inlarge the parallel others haue done it you may reade it in them
will insist no longer here vpon the story of the pharisee shall meete with him againe onely if you compare the sadducee and the pharisee and obserue how one did pare from the other patch to gods word how the one bent to atheisme and the other to superstition you will see how hardly men keepe a meane either in knowledge or conuersation some some reach not home
but wee must hold it the truest piety to confine our wits and conforme our liues to that will of god which we haue of record

hauing sufficiently described the persons we must now consider their taking of the occasion when they heard they came together
a strange thing for what was that which they heard was it not the making good of their tenent against the sadduces the prouing of the resurrection of the dead a man would expect that they should congratulate christs victory and reioyce in the refutation of the sadduces
haply they would haue done so if there had beene nothing else but christ got credit by the sadduces silence the people wondred at it this was a corasiue to the pharisees they were that what christ gained they lost
therefore they maligned his successe and malice hath no eyes to see good turnes or to bee moued with them
nay see christ was taking their part against the sadduces and they reuenge the sadduces quarrell vpon christ
malice doth not onely not see good turnes but it can forget also ill turnes to doe a mischiefe vnto those that are good
the sadduces and pharisees were profest enemies yet both of them agree to take part against christ so were pontius pilate and herod made friends to crucifie him
the extreames though most opposite yet doe either of them impugne the meane in morality couetousnesse indureth not prodigality nor prodigality couetousnesse yet both concurre to ouerthrow liberality as it is in the abstract so it is in the concrete men carry themselues according to the qualities wherewith they are seasoned
and this is the reason why as in the time of christ so in our times the orthodoxe christian is assaulted and battered as well by the superstitious as by the prophane

haue not yet shewed you the depth of their malice it was much that it would not let them see christs more that they did not see the of the sadduces but wonder at neither of these blindnesses malice suffereth them not to see their owne desperate aduenture for they had not long before as it appeareth in this chapter set vpon christ and went awy with disgrace if they would not take warning from the sadduces foyle they might from their owne
but it is a true rule malitia ambitio nutriunt temeritatem impudentiam where a mans heart is possest with ambition or malice hee will bee commonly and past shame hee will venture without of his present ruine and hee is shamelesse and senslesse though hee haue neuer so much cause to blush and take heed
the diuell tempted christ and though he were twice repulsed yet he set on him the third time his schollers

haue the same resolution
which must make vs not to wonder at the replications

and triplications of the aduersaries of our church audi homo sidelis saith an ancient father hearken to me whosoeuer faithfull man thou art that willingly dost encounter an hereticke if the pharisee could be quiet then is there hope thou mayst quiet an but it is no more possible for to quiet an hereticke then it was to quiet a pharisee
for what art thou stronger then christ that thou shouldest quiet them whom christ could not quiet no we must still beare in minde that the church is militant when we haue put off one storme we must look for another christ was so exercised and so hath his church euer beene and shall bee vntill the end of the world
finis vnius est gradus alterius christian men by one conquest doe but make way to another conflict

and the enemie of the church saepe confunditur nunquam placatur though often confounded will neuer be appeased
and let this suffice for the occasion

come now to the conference whereof the first part is the question moued
here told you wee were first to see who moueth it
laying the words together found there were two sorts of actors many plotted for conuenerunt in vnum all the pharisees laid their heads together and they repayred all to christ all their wits did hammer it and all their persons countenance it they were not vnaduised vpon that which they spake and they did afford it their best assistance which maketh much for the amplifying of christs wisedome and his constancie that could reply so sodainly to that which so many heads had premeditated and was not daunted with the presence of so many great rabbines
what grace hee gaue to his disciples he wanted not himselfe

dabitur in illa hora his spirit did suggest in an instant what he should speake and he had a mouth giuen vnto him which the aduersaries could not resist

as many plotted the question so there was but one that did propose it chrysostome and other of the fathers obserue a policie herein for the pharisees had reason to doubt of the successe vpon their former proofe therfore they handle the matter so that but one should speak if he preuailed they would all triumph because he was of their sect but if he were foyld then they would put it off and say it was but his priuate conceipt
the like stratagem doth the church of rome vse they publish their opinions by single men whom we haue refuted they tell vs they are not bound no not to the writings of bellarmine himselfe
as for the pope he is carefull to resolue few doubts out of his chaire
and so they prouide that they will not be refuted no not when they are refuted
but chrysostome giueth them a good item leuis est consolatio si quis in seipso confusus est quod ab alijs ignoratur it is but a cold comfort for a man to set a good face vpon a businesse when the conscience is sensible of its owne confusion

although the person were but one yet was he no ordinary one hee is set forth here two wayes first as very great in shew great for his learning for he was a lawyer marke calleth him a scribe
and here must open one antiquity more
if we looke into the originall of the iewes religion

which is moses law we shall find that god committed the teaching of his people vnto the priests and leuites
whereupon is grounded that saying of the priests lips should preserue knowledge

and the people should aske the law at his mouth
and to that end were the priests and leuites not onely to minister in the temple and teach in the synagogues but to be of councell also in the synedrion at ierusalem and in the inferiour senates throughout the whole holy land
but when corruption had the church of the iewes and the priests and leuites had degenerated then started vp certaine vsurpers that tooke vpon them the doctrinall part of their function
of whom christ speaketh in the gospell the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses chaire

which two seemed to differ as genebrard thinketh no otherwise then the canonists and the schoolemen in the church of rome
or to speake more properly to the iewish aniquities the scribe was a textuarie and the pharisee a traditionarie diuine
vnderstand me not exclusiuely for the pharisee did allow the text and the scribe the traditions but it should seeme they were not both alike studied in or zealous for them both
neither must you thinke that all scribes were vsurpers for if they were of the tribe of leuie as was esdras their calling was lawfull
but they did vsurpe moses chaire if they were of any other tribe
much like vnto the orders of fryers which started vp in the night as it were of christendome and taking aduantage of the ignorance of ordinarie pastors encroach't vpon their function and ingrost all deuotion into their hands

when you heare this questionist called a lawyer you must vnderstand that he was by degree a rabbin or a doctor of the law
for there were nouices which were brought vp at the doctors feete as paul at the feete of gamaliel
yea they had as the friers haue lay dominicans lay franciscans and lay iesuites who hold it no small ghostly comfort to weare the badge of any of those fraternities and to be partakers of their merits
and the fraternities doe gladly imbrace such followers they thriue not a little by their almes and their countenance
but such followers are called disciples they haue not the honour to bee called rabbins neither come they vnder the name of lawyers or scribes whereupon it followeth that this man was great for his learning
but this greatnesse was onely in shew for though they were accounted doctors by their nouices yet were they but ill seene in gods law legis verba tenent hi scribae saith saint ambrose vim ignorant they were readie at the text but altogether ignorant of the sense like anabaptists and brownists
christ obserueth two notable defects in them the one was that they did reatch the ceremoniall law too farre and the other that they did shrincke the morall law too much
so that their key of knowledge did open the kingdome of heauen neither to themselues nor others
wherupon saint paul doth not without cause moue the question where is the wise where is the scribe

where is the disputer of this world so wee may conclude of this scribe that hee was great for learning but that greatnesse was onely in shew

he was not great onely for learning hee was great for holinesse also for he was a pharisee and pharisees were saints among the iewes
for they did supererogate liued not onely according to the written law but according to the traditions also
whatsoeuer did concerne solemne prayers or religious worship was learned from them and they were a law vnto the people

flauius iosephus saith that they had gotten such authority by their holinesse that though they did oppose king or priest yet the people would giue credit to them
wil not trouble you with particularizing their superstitions they were as apish as the friars are
and they were as great busie bodies as either the iesuits or our precisians are
but all this holinesse was but in shew if the things themselues did not speake it our sauiour christ in the gospel doth paint out the vanity thereof
saint paul after hee had beene a pharisee and was become a christian telleth vs that he accounted all his pharisaisme was no better then losse and dung

epiphanius passeth a very true censure vpon it when he telleth vs that it was spontanea superflua religio nothing but a packe of willworship and that which setteth a man neuer a whit forward towards heauen nay it set them backward rather christ giueth the reason they made the commandements of god of none effect by their traditions

or at least they leauened them
so that when say he was a great man whom they made their champion meane great in their eyes but not indeed or in christs eyes
what he was indeed and what he appeared to christ is intimated by that which followeth he came with a sword in his heart hee was a tempter what is that but a diuell it is one of the titles which saint paul giueth vnto him and all tempters doe resemble him tempters in that sense which is here meant for god is said to tempt not as ignorant of vs but to make vs to know and shew our selues and not with any ill meaning towards vs but intending our good
but diuelish temptation proceeds either from infidelitie when it is bent against god and sheweth that wee doe not beleeue that which wee ought to acknowledge in god namely his wisedome his power his holinesse so the iewes are said to haue tempted god in the wildernesse or else it proceeds from malice when it is bent againstman and seeketh some aduantage to worke his destruction
the temptatation that in my text is bent against christ is mixt it proceeds partly from infidelity and partly from malice they did not belieue that hee was the messias and they would willingly haue destroyed him because hee affirmed himselfe to bee so
in this sense they often tempted christ somtimes tempting his power luke
sometimes his clemencie ioh
sometimes his zeale in the question of diuorce math

sometimes his allegiance as in this chapter in the question of tribute

that which we must marke in the temptation is that as temptation presupposeth ignorance of the person whom we tempt both what he is and what he will doe so there is great difference betweene simple ignorance which in simplicity of heart maketh triall for better resolution such a triall as nathaniel was willed by phillip to make of christ

come and see when hee doubted whether any good could come out of nazareth

and that of the samaritanes ioh
who being bid by the woman to come and see a prophet went heard and belieued such kind of tempting in simplicitie of heart neither is ill nor displeaseth
but the pharisees proceeded from ignorantia prauae dispositionis notwithstanding christ had done so many things miraculously and spoken so many words most wisely yet are they not moued either with his words or workes but passing by that which should reclaime them they seeke matter of aduantage whereby they may oppresse christ
there is no kind of people so mischieuous as those which are learned and want a good conscience for their learning is nothing but armata nequitia it serueth both for defensiue and offensiue weapons of sinne
a learned wicked man is two wayes worse then he that is vnlearned though hee be wicked worse passiucly for hee can most hardly bee wrought by or brought vnto the truth worse actiuely for he can find out most trickes and take most aduantages of doing ill
wherefore we must take heed to our knowledge and pray god that hee would giue vs such as may bee accompanied with a good conscience least otherwise wee become brethren of the pharisee and our questions moued to christ proue no better then his temptation
you see that he came with a sword in his heart and that hee had a mischieuous purpose see now what oyle streameth from his lips

he saluteth our sauiour with a smoth tongue master saint hierome doth not vnfitly compare flatterers vnto bees which haue honie as well as stings flatterie is the best art of insinuation
the title is honourable which this questionist giueth vnto christ for it was the title of the rabbins of all those that tooke vpon them to teach the people
it was much affected both by the scribes and pharisees as you may reade in the gospell and why they held it an honourable acknowledgement of their learning
but though they did affect it yet was it due to christ by reason that he was the great prophet that should come into the world

he was the wisedome and the word of god

you call me saith christ to his disciples lord and master and so am
but as for this scribe he had no intent to expresse so good a conceite of christ or such purpose as to bee christs disciple you may learne it out of iohn where with scornfull indignation they bid the blind man be christs disciple as for themselues they were moses disciples
origen hath a wittie obseruation vpon the nature of correlatiues as none is a father except he haue a child so none except he be his child can truly call another father
the same correspondencie should there be between master schollar we do but abusiuely cal him master to whose instruction we purpose not to commit our selues as doth beseeme a schollar but as iudas cried haile master when he was playing the traytor so doth this man vse the word master when he is playing the tempter and enerie one that cals christ master or sauiour and is not a true correlatine in disposition est frater pharisei and many such brethren haue the pharisees in the world
couple that which you haue heard of these persons what they were indeed and what they were in shew and you shall perceiue that the questionist is an angell of darknesse though he make shew of an angell of light
the diuell neuer appeareth

in his owne hue and they must not want a faire pretence that plot mischiefe against others
haue discouered the questionist sufficiently vnto you it remaineth that we briefly consider of his question

and here we shall find first that the question is indeed good for it is about gods law and men cannot better employ their thoughts then there about king dauid doth often recommend this study
but there are two soule abuses wherewith this scribe this lawyer doth corrupt his question the one is vaine glory the other is impietie
he heard christ taxe the sadduces for their ignorance in the scripture he thought it was now time for him to get himselfe credit and no better meanes then the mouing of such a question
the vaine glorie is a foule fault but the impietie is much worse for hee maketh gods word serue for a weapon in the diuels quarrell
he learned this of the father of temptations who vsed such weapons against christ and he is folowed therin by most hereticks whose practise is to oppose the truth by the truth god by himselfe
as if the malice of man could deprehend any such aduantage of ouersight in god whereby any might be induced to sinne against him but abuse they may they can neuer vse aright such weapons and if they doe abuse them well may they sometimes nay they doe too often succeed in their aduenture against men but it is senselesse that they should hope to speed against god or christ

the question is not onely good but it is waightie also for it is about the great commandement in the law great for greatest for the hebrewes haue not superlatiues marke calleth it primum omnium the chiefest of the commandements another scribe luke
seemeth to expound the word great by those words what shall doe to inherit euerlasting life so that the great commandement seemeth to be that the keeping whereof doth best please god and giueth vs the neerest communion with him
wherfore though it skils not which is the greatest so we set our selues to keepe all as we ought yet is the resolution desired to make a man know how farre hee is gon from god
it should seeme that there was a question here abouts betweene the iewes some holding for the ceremoniall

some for the morall as we may gather from this scribes answere made elsewhere
and this scribe as marke cals him or law yer as here would shew himselfe to bee no ordinarie man by his question
it is true that though all the commandements of god bee equall in regard of the author and nothing may be accounted small that commeth from god yet in regard of those that must obserue the law all are not equall and christ himselfe telleth vs that there are mandata minima

wherefore the doubt had a good ground but the scribe knowing that the law had three maine heads the morall the politique the ceremoniall and that from euery of the heads sprang manifold branches moreouer supposing that christ was illetterd

and not seene in these studies thought that it was the onely way by such a question either to disgrace his knowledge if he could not suddainely lay together the varietie of commandements and out of an aduised comparison passe a true iudgement and so they should lessen his reputation with the people
or if he did answere to the

question and clearely expresse himselfe then hee should set those that held the contrarie tenant against him and so at least wise they should doe him some mischiefe which was the of a tempter
and to that hee doth not onely socratically mooue this question hoping for an ironicall conclusion and to put a scorne vpon christ but politickly also hoping to distract his auditors and raise him vp many aduersaries
but foolish man that he was he looked onely vpon christs of his inside hee knew nothing
had he knowne who christ was he would neuer haue made such an aduenture
hee that gaue the law vnderstood the law to the full and hee knew the degrees of obseruance which prescribed them vnto men the euent proued it and the tempters successe was farre other then hee exspected as hereafter you shall heare

there is one note more de magno mandato quaerit saith chrysostome qui minimum non impleuit

the scribes and pharisees did vse to bind heauie burdens and lay them upon other mens shoulders which they would not lift at with the least of their fingers ambitious of profound knowledge but carelesse of any degree of true pietie
wee haue many such that busie their wits in the most learned inquiries of gods predestination of the day of iudgement of the mysteries in the reuelation of chronologie genealogie sacred antiquities and in the meane time soaring in these contemplations aloft take no heede vnto their steps but are spectacles to the world of no small morall infirmities
wherefore chrysostome aduiseth well quaerat de maiore iustitia qui impleuit minorem let vs practise our lessons as wee learne them and not paine our wits in studying a greater vntill wee haue brought our hearts to obey a lesser commandement otherwise we shall bee but like the alchimists that all their life are making of gold and goe to their graues starke beggers

you haue heard both of the questionist and the question and how well the question fitteth the questionist the temptation representeth the tempter
examples are not vnfitly compared vnto looking glasses wherin we may behold as well what to eschue as what to follow in this we haue found little to be followed much to be eschewed
god graunt we may make the right vse of it and that we doe not in our liues shew our selues to be either scribes or pharisees either counterseitly holy orignorantly learned
but let our inside be no worse then our and let vs presume of no more then we are sure is good either in our life or learning
finally let vs in simplicitie of heart become the disciples of christ and let our ghostly edification be the end of our enquires
so shall we be free from the iust censure that was deserued by this questionist and that for this question a question otherwise good but tainted by the ill meaning of so bad a questionist

the second sermon
epigraph

matt
verse

iesus said vnto him thou shalt loue

the&se words containe an answere to a question the question was mooued by a lawyer the answere thereunto is shaped by our sauiour christ
hauing heretofore vnfolded the question it followeth that now come on and vnfold the answere vnto you wherein first wee must obserue that christ doth vouchsafe an answere vnto a tempter iesus said vnto him to him who before is said to haue come to tempt christ
secondly we must see what the answere is which christ doth vouchsafe it is such as doth fully yea abundantly resolue the question and which withall doth discreetly and powerfully defeate the malice of the questionist this later point is implied but the former is expressed in the text
at this time will meddle onely with the answere to the question will shew you the particulars contained therein and handle as many as the time will permit
in the text we doe find that christ doth fully yea abundantly resolue the doubt for he not onely affirmeth which is the great commandement in these words thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy heart but hee confirmeth it also in these words on these two commandements depend the law and the prophets
to resolue the question fully doth not content he doth resolue it abundantly also hee teacheth the pharisee more then he did aske he asked but after one commandement christ teacheth him two as well that which enioyneth the loue of our neighbour as that which enioyneth the loue of god hee giueth an answere with a vantage but this vantage proueth in the end a disaduantage to the pharisee as hereafter you shall heare
but more distinctly to breake vp that which christ affirmeth to be the great commandement we find that therein god inioyneth loue thou shalt loue
as he doth enioyne it so he teacheth where it must bee seated and on whom we must bestow it
it must bee seated in the inwardman the heart the soule the mind
and it must be bestowed vpon the lord our god and our neighbour
neither is it enough to bestow it on them except in bestowing it we obserue an order and a measure
an order for we must first loue god and then our neighbour
therefore in my text is that called the first and this the second commandement
a measure for we must loue god more then our neighbour god with all our heart soule and mind this first saith the text is the great commandement

but we must loue our neighbour only as our selues therfore doth the text tell vs that this
is not equall it is only like to the first co~mandement

let vs come to the particulars whereof the first was this christ doth vouchsafe an answere and that to him whom he knew to be a tempter
though the person deserue to be reproued to bee reiected yet christ beareth with him and doth not refuse to satisfie his demand
wonder not at it long before he dealt no worse with the in the
of mathew you shal find that he replied vnto him euen a third time
and in so doing taught vs that wee must not bee ashamed to auouch gods truth though it be to the diuell himselfe nay we haue a more comfortable note included herein
for if christ dealt so graciously with those that came dissemblingly to learne of him what confidence may wee haue that hee will answere vs if in singlenesse of heart and humility of spirit wee open vnto him the scruples of our conscience and desire his resolution no doubt but hee that biddeth vs to seeke

will helpe vs to sinde and we shall receiue of him that biddeth vs aske and hee that biddeth vs knocke will open vnto vs

but this poynt of answering questions in diuinity deserues to bee stood vpon a little longer and our iudgement set right that it erre not herein
wee must then learne of the preacher that there is a time to speake and a time for a man to hold his peace

this distinction in the prouerbs is fitted vnto answeres answere not a foole according to his foolishnesse lest thou be like vnto him answere a foole according to his foolishnesse

lest hee bee wise in his owne conceipt
so that there is a time when a mau may answere a question and a time wheu a man may not answere it and how shall wee bee able to distinguish these times surely the time when wee may not answere is knowne either by the question or by the questionist
if the question be either friuolous or curious it must haue no answere for wee must not feed mens either idlenesse or saucinesse

touching friuolous questions wee haue pauls rule foolish questions auoid and for curious questions we haue our sauiours example

christ bad peter follow him peter asked christ what shall iohn doe christ taketh him short what is that to thee follow thou mee
if wee looke into the schoolemen and the casuists wee shall find that their wits haue beene idly busie yea and often wickedly too in answering such questions as were very vnfit to bee demanded yea the resolutions vpon cur and quomodo why and how in debating articles of faith beyond the bounds which are set downe in the scripture haue bred the greatest distraction in christendome while each side with words and with bloud shed maintaineth his determination of that poynt which if it had neuer beene heard of the christian faith had beene neuer a whit the lesse sound and the communion of saints had beene preserued

take this then for your first rule that if a question bee either not behoouefull or aboue our reach it must receiue no answere nay ordinarily we must not giue answere to them that study questions which nothing concerne their calling especially if neglecting theirowne dutie they are too inquisitiue after that which concerneth other men
the world is much sicke of this disease

and you shall heare oftner of idle and curious questions then of those that concerne the health of mens soules and the ordering of their calling christians are herein as ill imployed as were the iewes

though there bee no defect in the question yet there may bee in the questonist in regard of his ill disposition bee it obstinacie or impietie though his question bee good hee deserueth no answere
an hereticke saith saint paul after one or two admonitions auoid

knowing that such a man is undefined span alphabet he carrieth his doome in his owne bosome and doth wilfully withstand the truth he must not bee answered because of his obstinacie

touching impietie wee haue christs rule giue not holy things vnto dogs and cast not your pearle among swine lest they trample them vnder their feeet and turne againe rent you yea prophane atheists moue questions touching god or sacred things which they disbelieue that they may therewith make themselues wickedly merry our silence must take from them all occasion to blaspheme and such questionists must receiue no answere
truth is neuer mute for want arguments of defence but sometimes silent out of holy wisedome whereas falshood hath nothing in reason to reply but yet it will be euer prating
to our purpose then the premises conclude that it will be time to speak and that wee may answere though it bee a foole so the question bee profitable and the questionist be not prophane

but chrysostome setteth downe the two vsefull ends of our answere

when we answere a foole it must be either for the publique confusion of proud folly and to make pharisaicall spirits see they know not what they thinke they know or for the edification of the standers by those which with meeknesse will receiue the truth we may not suffer such to continue perplext through ignorance
at these ends did christ ayme in his answere
and so haue sufficiently shewed you why christ doth vouchsafe an answere though he that moued the question came as a tempter

let vs now come on to the answere that christ vouchsafeth whereof the first branch is thou shalt loue
wherin will open two points
what is enioyned and to whom
that which is enioyned is loue and he that must loue is noted in this word thou

in deuteronomie you shall find that this thou is israel

loue is in the number of those things quae melius sentiuntur quam verbis exprimuntur man may better feele then say what it is yet this is out of all question that it is an affection and whereas our affections are either sensuall or rationall loue is found in either of them
there is a sensuall loue wee see it in beasts they loue their mates their their benefactors
but wee haue not to doe with this loue farther then to note that this in man though it bee not the rationall loue yet should it be guided by the rationall
and were it so as commonly it is not as appeareth by the enormous wantonnesse and monstrous lusts that haue beene that are in the world men would not proue themselues to bee worse then beasts as euery where they doe codies tragedies other poems haue too much of this stuffe and it is the argument of two many

true histories
this loue if regulate though it bee not illicitus amor yet doth it not rise to the pitch of that loue which is commanded here
the loue here meant is that which is in vs as we are reasonable creatures or rather religious as appeares after in thou
the diuines commonly call it charitie and so will for distinction sake
though hold that the exception of the rhemists taken to the word loue in our translations is but a meere cauill and could easily proue it such

to vnderstand what this rationall loue or charitie is we must remember what god said when he had made adam it is not good for man to be alone let vs make him a helpe like himselfe
for though that be spoken of yet doth it containe the ground of all other
for euen by the law of creation euery man is subiect to some want the supply wher of is to be found in another

therfore the mythologists haue wittily conceited that undefined span alphabet that is plentie penury were the parents of loue because these two mutually affect the one the other and loue is nothing else but that strong attracting and full contenting power which bringeth them and holdeth them together
the hebrew ahabh and habha and the greeke undefined span alphabet import as much if you will giue credit to the etymologists
but to open the nature of it a little better charitie hath in it the power of vnion and communion vnion of persons communion of their abilities
vnion of persons mutuall

for amicitia non est si vel vnus tantum sit vel vnus tantum amat
now vnion requires undefined span alphabet ratione intellectus undefined span alphabet ratione voluntatis

therefore vnion is only betweene those that are good for onely good men are undefined span alphabet they can tune well together so cannot the wicked they are like discords in musicke though they ioyne their tunes there will bee but a iarre in the sound
if you put gold to gold they will agree well and hold fast together but mingle iron and clay you may read in daniels image they will presently fail asunder
and indeede how should wicked men euer entertaine vnion with others they hold not long like themselues but change like the moone and therefore they are vnfit for vnion
vnion requireth undefined span alphabet a correspondencie in disposition and undefined span alphabet a familiaritie in conuersation
but this is to be found onely in vertue vertues are all agreeing betweene themselues so are not vices and therefore vertuous men of all sorts can consort together not so the wicked they cannot long continue societie
a momentanie conspiracie there may be but a louing vnion there can neuer be such a vnion as should make seuer all persons to become as one and transforme the louing into the beloned person and so the soule of one to the other that it seemeth not to be vbi animat sed vbi amat it liueth as it were it enioyeth it selfe not in the body wherein it breathes but in that person whom it loues according to the definition of loue est passio animi qua erga aliquem ita afficimur· vt nostri obliti toti in eum eius{que obsequium feramur

vpon this first act of charitie which called vnion followeth a second act which is called communion what the persons haue that they communicate each communicateth with the other all that it hath
there are three kinds of good as the philosophers call them first honeslum

secondly vtile thirdly iucundum and they teach vs tot genera amorum as they doe bonorum
but christians are to know that their charity must be full it must containe a communion in all kinds of good and obserue in them a due order

first the communion must be in bono honesto in vertue and vertuous actions for therein is the sure foundation of charity and without that there can bee none non est bonitas vnioms nisi sit vnio bonitatis
vpon this first communion followeth a second and that is in bono iucundo for each person taketh content in the other and they striue mutually to make each the others life sweet and comfortable
vpon these two followeth a third communion and that is in bono vtili each doth communicate in the wealth of the other and each supplyeth the others wants
you haue an excellent patterne of this charity in the acts of the apostles both in regard of the vnion and communion read it chap
from the
verse vnto the end thereof
and obserue the threefold communion betweene those christians that were first vnited into the body of the church
but worldlings communicate some onely for thrift as tradesmen some onely for pleasure as good fellowes and these communions attend not any communion in honestie and therefore come not within the compasse of our communion neither will they hold long because of naturall hatred take away the necessary outward tye and it will appeare

but to open the communion a little farther wee may resolue it as philosophie doth in beneuolentiam beneficentiam and
the persons doe repay each the other hearty affections
whereupon followeth a sympathie a fellow feeling that each hath of the others state

which paul doth excellently amplifie the effect of it is in the
verse whether one member suffer all the rest of the members suffer with it or if one member bee honoured all the other members reioyce with it
men that are in charitie beare one anothers burdens and partake each of the others comforts and that as feelingly as if anothers were their owne case
and this is the beneuolence of the communion
secondly there is in the communion beneficence or each doth not seeke his owne

but anothers good and where there is charitie meum tuum are verba frigtda as saint chrysostome they melt at the heat thereof
men haue all things in common and no man thinketh ought to bee his owne his owne quoad undefined span alphabet in regard of the vse though it continue his quoad undefined span alphabet in regard of the propertie
for it is an anabaptisticall dreame to make a perpetuall rule of that which was but temporarie for some part of the apostles dayes and to turne an extraordinary case into an ordinary
but good will is cherished by mutuall good offices in society
and the good offices doe consist in
things principally in donando condonando giuing and forgiuing
in giuing louing christians striue euer beyond their ability as saint paul speaketh of the macedonians and the reason is plaine

nonest vectigalis amicitia they do not merchandize their good deeds but prouoke each the other to emulation
and as for forgiuing salomons rule is true charitie couereth a multitude of sinnes

and will forgiue not onely seauen times but seauenty times

seauen
in other things a meane is commended but in regard of charitie hee is most commended that doth least keepe a meane a meane in good will or a meane in good deeds the more of either the more perfect is the charitie for the haruest of charitie holds all the yeare long and it is a treasure that can neuer bee exhausted cum soluitur non amittitur sed multiplicatur
will you haue a true description of the properties thereof read
cor
will you haue a true exemplification of it read the song of salomon
of these two vnion and communion the latter is the fuell of the former and by communion the vnion is continued alitur ijs rebus quibus gaudet
whereupon it followeth that there is one thing more which may not omit concerning the nature of charitie and that is the constancie thereof loue is strong as death iealousie is cruell as the graue

the coles thereof are coles of fire which hath a most vehement flame many waters cannot quench loue neither can the flouds drowne it if a man would giue all the substance of his house for loue it would be contemned
abhorret vera charitas omnia distrahentia pereat qui inter nos dissidium volunt
wee must not bee like little children that loue to day and hate to morrow nec ita amare ut aliquando osuri manente bonitate non exigente superiore lege aut patriae aut religionis

haue competently opened vnto you the nature of charitie but you must obserue that whereas there are two things in it the qualitie and the exercise thereof

it is not the qualitie but the exercise that commeth vnder the commandement vbicunque in scriptura dilectio requiritur non tam extgitur dilectio affectus quam charitas operis

the qualitie is the gift of god for hee is undefined span alphabet charitatis efficax it is hee that maketh men to bee of one minde and circumciseth mens hearts that they may loue and charitie is the fruit of the spirit
and the spirit doth worke it in our hearts not only by mouing without qualifying them as peter lumbard erroniously thought hee improueth our charitie too farre but the loue of god is powred abroad into our hearts by the holy spirit

substantialis charitas dat accidentalem as bernard speaketh god which is charitie giueth vnto man the gift of charitie
but when we haue receiued the gift of god wee must employ it wee must not receiue the grace of god in vaine
as in nature so in grace wee haue our abilities for action and the parable will tell vs what will bee our doome if wee hide our talent
but the commandement is affirmatiue and therefore tenet semper but not ad semper wee must neuer be without a louing disposition yet are we not bound to manifest it but as occasion shalbe offered vs yet must we take heed that we neither will nor do ought that is contrary vnto charity

you haue heard what is giuen in charge you must now heare to whom this charge is giuen thou shalt loue and this thou is israel so wee read in moses hearken israel thou shalt loue

it is giuen then to the regenerate for israel is a name of the church of those that were in couenant with god and had in their flesh the seale thereof
without the church is the kingdome of satan and where satan raigneth there satanisme that is hatred is there can bee no true charitie

christ telleth vs it is the badge of his followers by this shall all men know that you are

my disciples

if yee loue one another
in the canticles it is called the banner of the church now you know that the banner keepeth euery souldier to his owne station and so strengtheneth the whole by euery ones good order
and wee neuer breake our ranke in the church militant and hazard the whole by our disorder but wee doe it through want of charitie

what is spoken to the whole church euery member must take it to himselfe and vnderstand himselfe in the word thou
saint paul hath taught vs that hatred and charitie distinguish carnall and spirituall men

by charitie saint iohn telleth vs it is knowne that wee are borne of god

sola charitas diuidit inter filios regniaeterni

silios perditionis saith austin wee haue no assurance that wee shall bee saints in heauen except wee entertaine the communion of saints on earth if in this life wee delight in hatred after this life wee shall bee ranged with those which are hatefull

but whose charge is this who is hee that commands thou shalt loue surely it is gods charge hee layeth this commandement vpon his church
doe you heare it and not wonder at it god is a soueraigne lord hee may giue what lawes please him vnto the creatures which hee hath made yet see how gracious hee is hee will lay no other charge vpon his church then that which may bee performed by loue then which kind of command nihil facilius nihil foelicius none can bee more easie

none can be more happy nothing more easie for what difficultie can there bee in loue if god should come vpon a man as he did vpon iob and presse him to reueale all the secrets of the creation and prouidence much more if hee should bid him open the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen hee might answere alas lord am an ignorant man
if hee should bid him build such a temple as salomons was and furnish it with so many instruments and ornaments of gold and of other precious stuffe hee might say alas lord am a poore man
if hee should bid him goe and roote out all infidels from the face of the earth hee might answere alas lord am a weake man
and so to many like commandements hee might plead some excuse
but when god saith thou shalt loue no man hath any excuse to plead but the malignitie of his owne nature yea no man comes to heauen that did not loue though many poore ignorant weak ones come there
a poore man may loue as well as a rich an ignorant as a wise a weake as a strong especially seeing though charitie consists of beneficentia aswell as beneuolentia good deeds aswell as good will yet there is a dispensation allowed for want of good deeds

if a man haue a good will
for hee is accepted according to that which hee hath not according to that which hee hath not
so that although god hath dispensed his temporall blessings vnequally yet the spirituall he will haue common vnto all
meane those which are the graces of adoption amongst which charitie is a chiefe one and by it though there be otherwise great distance betweene man and man yea the creator and his creature yet may they easily bee brought together

neither is loue onely an easie worke in it selfe but also it doth facilitate other things our doing our suffering both are made easie by charitie
let a man attempt any thing whereunto hee hath no minde and it groweth presently tedious but loue takes away all bitternesse of paine
it was a painfull life that iacob liued vnder laban as he sheweth in genes


yet the seauen yeares that hee serued for rachel seemed to him but a few dayes for the loue that hee had vnto her
the like we may obserue in all sorts of men that are affected with any kind of profit or pleasure how doth the couetous man toyle himselfe out of the loue of money the ambitious out of the loue of honour the faulconer the huntsman out of loue of their sports guesse by them how cheerefully wee would bee doing good if wee were prepossessed with loue for loue sweetens all paines yea guesse by lust what loue can doe that goeth vpon much surer grounds

loue doth not onely facilitate our doing but our suffering also out of loue to their wiues and children what hunger what thirst what wounds doe souldiers endure

but beyond all goe the sufferings of the martyrs of whose wonderfull patience and constancie therein you can giue no other reason but loue they loued not their liues vnto death

because they did loue to keepe gods commandements
begin now to vnderstand paul against loue there is no law for though there were no law yet he that loueth would readily obey hee needs no other obligation

to whom to doe his dutie is a very pleasure
now begin to vnderstand saint iohn the commandements of god are not grieuous for griese and loue cannot stand together it is rather a griefe not to doe that which our soule doth loue
you see then that god could not prouide an easier commandement for vs then thou shalt loue

and could he haue prouided a happier no verily for though amor bee sui praemium it carrieth contentednesse in the very nature of it yet as if that would not satisfie all the requisites vnto felicitie are distinctly ascribed vnto it
whereof the first is freedome of spirit hee in whom charitie is hath exchanged the spirit of bondage for the spirit of adoption then which there cannot bee a more ingenuous a more free spirit
so that whereas no obedience pleaseth god but that which is voluntarie it is charitie that maketh vs such seruants as god requireth
a second requisite vnto felicitie is store or plenty of prouision and what better purueyer can we haue then charitie looke how farre it extendeth so farre it enritcheth for undefined span alphabet looke how many friends so many supplies wee haue of our wants and if all men were true friends

no man could want that which another man hath
the last requisite is securitie and there it no guard to the guard of loue for by charitie it commeth to passe as chrysostome wittily obserueth that one man is as many men as he hath friends whether you respect acquisitionem bonorum or depulsionem malorum so many paire of eyes to watch for him so many paire of hands to defend him so many paire of feete to trauell for him so many heads to aduise tongues to speake hearts to encourage

and what better munition would a man desire god commends charitie when he vouchsafed to heare iob for his friends and in the psalme shewes that nothing is more detestable then treachery in friendship
would time permit me should shew you that there is nothing like vnto charitie that doth proue a man to be a man and turne a man into a god
some guesse that homo hath his name from undefined span alphabet to note that hee is a sociable creature but it is out of question that ratio and oratio were giuen him for this purpose that men might haue communion one with another
take charitie out of his tongue what is it but an vnruly euill as saint iames calleth it full of deadly poyson a world of wickednesse a firebrand of hell that is able to set the world on fire
take charitie out of the reason of a man then that will proue true which god told noah the frame of the thoughts of the heart of man are onely euil and that of ieremie the heart of man is deceitfull aboue all things and desperately wicked
so that you may seeke a man and not find him in a man if charitie be away
but season him with charitie and then shall you see the excellencie of a man his tongue will be a tree of life and the issues of life will come out of his heart as salomon teacheth in his prouerbs

told you that charitie doth also turne a man into a god for god is charitie and hee that dwelleth in charitie dwelleth in god and god in him
therefore christ commending charitie giueth this reason that wee may be like vnto our father in heauen
it is not without cause then that saint iames calleth it the royall law of liberty and saint paul the supereminent way
other gifts saith saint austin are giuen by the spirit but without charitie they become vnprofitable vbi charitas est quid potest obesse vbi non est quid potest prodesse in god it was charitie that set the rest of his attributes on worke when he made when hee redeemed the world and our abilities will all bee idle except they bee set on worke by loue and if loue stirre all will come plentifully from man as they doe from god
finally as charitas is omnium hominum so omnium horarum locorum nunquam nusquam excluditur
which cannot be said of any other affection there is no man that may not loue and that at all times and in all places
wherefore god hath laid this fundamentall law dilige then which there is no more excellent gift and it is the immediate ground of pietie the roote of all morall vertues and theologicall also as hereafter you shall heare and heare that hoc vnum necessarium
let vs now beseech the god of loue so to sweeten our nature with his holy spirit of loue that being rooted and grounded in this fundament all law all our workes may be done in loue
amen

the third sermon
epigraph

matt
verse
with all thy heart and with all thy soule and with all thy mind

ovt of those first words of this verse thou shalt loue you haue beene taught what it is to loue and who it is that is bound to obserue this vertue
we must now come on and see in the next place what is the seate of loue and in my text we find that it is pointed out in three words the heart

the soule the mind moses deuter

and out of him marke and saint luke adde a fourth which is strength

the words may be taken confusedly or distinctly
confusedly and so they will teach vs onely in grosse the seate of loue
distinctly and so they will shew vs that these parts which are the seate of loue are ordinate and subordinate
ordinate ad intra as loue must be within vs and ordinate ad extra as loue must bee employed without vs subordinate for one of the parts is imperatiue or definitiue the other are imperatae definitae
and out of altogether wee shall learne that charitie is a catholike and transcendent vertue
purpose to handle these words both wayes as they are taken confusedly and as they are taken distinctly because though the first vnderstanding of them be true yet the second is more full and my desire is that you should vnderstand that most fully which you are bound chiefely to obserue

some then suppose that as in other places so in this many words are heaped together whereof the meaning is but one they yeeld a double reason
one is because if you compare moses and the other euangelists in whom this text is found with saint matthew you shall find that these words are either not reckoned by the same number or not digested in the same order
another reason is for that the holy ghost calling for the same dutie doth often mention but one or two of these parts as if they did import as much as all the rest
and indeed it is true as the first reason affirmeth that propter emphasin or exegesin to shew the earnestnesse of the speaker or to helpe the vnderstanding of the hearer the holy ghost doth often multiplie words of the same signification
will giue you an example of either of the emphasis hearken daughter and consider incline thine eare

the holy ghost meaneth no more but this he would not haue the lesson passe vnregarded
of the exegesis will incline mine eare vnto a parable will open a darke speech

the holy ghost by these words darke speech doth but helpe the reader to vnderstand what he meaneth by a parable
you may light vpon many such examples in reading the old or the new testament and it may well bee that the holy ghost doth in this place intend by these many

words to make a deeper impression of that which he speaketh in vs and that euerie of these words should giue light vnto the other
as for the second reason wheresoeuer we find fewer of these words exprest the rest are implied which they cannot denie that alleage the reason because they conceiue and conceiue aright that the whole soule is meant

but told you the words may also bee vnderstood distinctly
bernard thinkes that these three words heart soule and mind were intimated in christs question tripled to peter louest thou me louestithou me affectuosè prudenter fortiter but rather thinke they point out those other three remarkable things in the seate of charitie which haue named the first that it is virtus ordinata it taketh vp the parts wherein it is seated in a due order
the second that it is virtus subordinate of the parts wherein it is seated the first is to guide and command the rest
the third that it is virtus transcendens if it must be in all these parts then it takes vp the whole man
first it takes vp the parts wherein it must be seated in due order and this order is two fold there is ordo ad intra and ordo ad extra an order in the spreading of it within vs and an order for the vsing of it without vs touching the order of the spreading of it within vs obserue that here the holy ghost setteth downe first the natiue seate of loue which is the heart and then the deriuatiue seates which are the soule the mind whereunto you must adde the strength will touch briefly at them all
first there is no question but the natiue seate of loue is the heart the very definition sheweth it for idem velle idem nolle vera est amicitia loue is nothing else but a correspondence kept betweene persons in willing and nilling the same thing
so that there cannot be any thing more voluntsrie then loue therefore in the canticles christ speaking to his church insteed of thou hast inflamed me with loue saith thou hast enheartned me so you shall find it in the originall and king dauid doth defire that his heart may bee knit vnto god so that there the fountaine must be opened and charitie must begin there
the reason is because good is the proper obiect of the will and what is charitie but the embracing of good and therefore the will must bee first seasoned therewith and it is the will that is here vnderstood by the heart
but charitie is like vnto a fountaine that ouerfloweth and though it beginneth at the will yet doth it diffuse it selfe into other powers much like the vitall spirits that hauing their originall in the heart are conueied from thence in the arteries throughout the whole body
charitie then hath besides the natiue diuers deriuatiue seates
the first here mentioned is the soule by which is vnderstood the concupiscible facultie by which wee long for that which we loue which when we obtaine wee take our delight in it
this power must receiue a streame of charitie and whether we doe long for or delight in any thing we must doe both in charitie charitie must make these of sensuall to become rationall otherwise the longing and the liking of a man will bee no better then the longing and the liking of a beast
and indeed they are too commonly so this distemper began in eue and hath beene propagated in to all mankind not to be corrected but by a streame from this fountaine

a second deriuatiue seate here mentioned is the minde thither must charitie send forth a streame for our wits are apt to be sorges of vanitie and to yeeld snares to entrap others
that which must correct this ill disposition is charitie it will so qualifie our wits that they shall neuer bee ill employed
the word that the euangelist vseth is worth the marking it is undefined span alphabet or discourse charitie must not onely season our vnderstanding that it may bee capable of the apprehension of good but also that our meditations may bee vpon that which is good
in this life our soule hath no intuitiue knowledge that is reserued for the life to come a discursiue it hath and that must be seasoned with charitie
besides these wee find elsewhere a third deriuatiue seate and that is the strength the hebrew word is meodh by which is noted the irascible facultie or that courage wherewith we vndertake to pursue what wee loue and resist the opposite in doing whereof because we often make vse of our substance or goods the caldee paraphrase rendreth the word by substantia but the enuangelist out of the septuagint renders it undefined span alphabet strength by which that courage is meant which before specified enixe omnia moliaris viriliter
now this courage must not be without charitie there must come a streame thereof euen into this power also men must not be so valiant as to forget to bee in charitie nor without charitie bestow their substance
if wee finde charitie in the streames we may not doubt but it is in the fountaine and wee may conclude well it is not in the fountaine if it bee not in the streames
because it is not with this fountaine spirituall as it is with the corporall for a corporall may bee full and yet not ouerflow
but this spirituall fountaine haue it neuer so little of the water of life euen of that little some will runne ouer and the deriuatiue seates of charitie will keepe some proportion to the primatiue

you see there is an order in these seates of charitie ad intra as charitie spreadeth it selfe within the soule
looke vpon the words againe and you shall see that there is also ordo ad extra a good prouision made in these seates for the exercise of this vertue when it must bee employed without vs
for though it bee properly the will that must loue yet must it loue discreetly and effectually
and see here is not onely the electiue power seasoned with charitie which is the heart but the directiue also which is the minde and the executiue which is the soule and strength
so that god giueth vs thereby to vnderstand that we must not onely loue but loue as wee ought hee will not haue our loue to bee either vndiscrete or idle
ignorance is no good mother of loue of lust it may bee and therfore the poets faine cupid blinde but god will haue vs know what wee loue
and though men doe not alwayes loue so much as they know yet certainly he that knoweth little cannot loue much not loue as beseemeth charitie which told you is a reasonable loue
as loue must not bee ignorant no more must it bee idle god will haue the executiue faculties imployed the soule and the strength must attend the discretion of the mind and choyce of the will and endeauor to obtaine what the one doth direct vnto and the other choose
if this bee done then is our charity as ordinate in the exercise as it is in the spreading

besides the doctrine of the ordinatenesse of charitie in regard of the seate thereof we must looke into the subordinatenesse for of the seates one is imperatiue and definitiue the rest are imperatae definitae
charity is an elicite action of that power which is the natiue seate therof the will it springeth properly from thence
but it is an action of the other powers as they are commanded by the will the will layeth a commande vpon them all and that commande is loue
the vnderstanding must loue the soule must loue the strength must loue all of them by the commandement of a louing will
the will prepossest her sclfe with loue doth not onely deriue her qualitie into them but command them also to employ the same
and here must lead you to obserue another point of the powers of our mind soule and strength their actions are indefinite our vnderstanding may muse vpon what it will and to what end it will if it be left vnto it selfe and if the soule be left vnto it selfe it may long after and delight in what it will and so may our strength pursue or repell
but god is not pleased that they should bee left vnto themselues that they should worke at randome they are all subiected to the power of the will
the will commandeth the mind whereon to think what to studie to employ its discourse vpon that which her selfe doth loue lord saith dauid what loue haue to thy law all the day long is my studie in it
and as for the soule marke how that followeth the will haue loued saith dauid the habitation of thy house

and the place where thine honour dwelleth
hereupon sprung that passion my soule longeth euen fainteth for the courts of the lord

neither is it lesse true of the strength as it appeareth in the same psalme they goe from strength to strength vntill euerie one of them appeareth before god in sion
yea charitie putteth sinne wes into them that loue which make them as strong as death which cannot bee conquered

and like a flame of fire which cannot be quenched
so that though the seate of charitie be manifold yet is one of them a limiting power the other are limited the will receiueth charitte and maketh all the rest of the powers to frame themselues for the aduancement thereof it restraineth their rouing disposition and maketh them bend all their seruice thereunto certainely in sensuall loue it is too plaine carnall men draw their thoughts their desires their endeauours to that which they loue carnally
it should be so with spirituall men also and no doubt hath beene in many seruants of god that haue liued in the world as if they were not of it their will hath shewed a great power in commanding the powers of their soule though they haue found some reluctancie

out of all gather this that charitie is virtus catholica a vertue that ouerspreadeth the whole man
and no maruel for it is the image of god and gods image was not limited to apart no lesse then the whole man was made after his image
seeing then god is charitie man must represent in euerie power a charitie answerable vnto god
in the canticles wherein this vertue is liuely set forth christ and his church are not onely said to be each the beloued of the other but each is called by the name of loue christ in the second the church in the seuenth chapter
as

if the holy ghost did meane wee should neuer leaue extending this vertue vntill we were as it were wholly transformed into it or vntill it did as vniuersally quallifie our soule as our soule doth quicken our body of good qualities which are commended vnto vs there is a double perfection partium and graduum of the parts wherein they must subsist and of the degree whereunto they must arise
of the degree of charitie shall speake hereafter when come to the measure the perfection here required is of the parts the holy ghost calleth here for euery part of man and will haue no part of him voide of charitie
this is agreed vpon by all and therefore told you that it may well be called a catholike vertue
much a doe there is in the christian world whether are the truer catholikes wee or the romanists and each side striueth to make good his claime euen vnto bloud
might this catholike vertue which is out of controuersie preuaile in our liues the quarrell would be sooner determined and we should be better prouided against the common enemie
but the more is the pitie malice maketh a way vnto malice the mutual malice that distracteth christians vnto the deadly malice of the turk that would destroy all

the description that saint paul maketh of an vnregenerate man doth fit too well many of those that goe for regenerate charitie that should of right haue all hath at all no part in them the poyson of aspes is vnder their tongues their throte is an open sepulchre their feete are swift to shed bloud
and their inwards are worse then their outwards whether you looke into the head or into the heart mischiefe and hatred possesse both charitie can find place in neither
what christ foretold hath fallen out in our age

the charitie of most men is growne verie cold which is a shrewd prognostication that spirituall death groweth a pace vpon the world at least vpon this our part thereof

as charitie is virtus catholica so is there a transcendencie thereof
for in that charitie taketh vp all these powers as the seate thereof it taketh vp all the vertues that are incident to these powers
will passe by our affections and our senses ouer which it hath a full command as anger feare hearing seeing
should wearie you if should runne through all these and shew you the soueraigntie of charitie ouer them all will insist onely vpon vertues whereof there are two sorts morall and theologicall

all morall vertues are reduced vnto foure which are called cardinall first prudence secondly iustice thirdly temperance fourthly fortitude
not one of these is exempted from the soueraigntie of charitie because their proper seate is not exempted
the proper seate of iustice is the will the ciuill law doth define it thus iustitia est constans perpetua voluntas ius suum cui{que tribuendi if iustice be in the will and the will as you haue heard be the seate of charitie then must charitie moderate iustice without her sumum ius would be summa iniuria law would be strained beyond equitie
as charitie is at hand to temper iustice in the heart so is it at hand to temper prudence in the head it tempereth the done with the serpent and maketh them that are otherwise as wise as serpents to

be carefull that they be as innocent as doues
we are apt to be prudent for our selues and care not who is the worse for it here charitie is at hand to tell vs that we must not suffer our wits to worke to the wrong of others
that prudence is no prudence which is not charitable without charitie we may be wily we cannot be wise

come to the soule the seate of temperance because of the concupiscible facultie therof charitie hath a hand here also for temperance standeth in the moderating of our sensuall desires and delights and is not charitie most preualent in this moderation which is as you heard heretofore so acco~panied with a fellow feeling of other mens weale woe and is most sensible of our owne also and therefore is the sittest to prescribe our feasting dayes and our fasting dayes and to make vs seasonably either reioyce or mourne
it is the best rule of temperance
and it may not be excluded from fortitude it must teach vs what to dare and what to feare when wee bestow our courage aright when amisse courage not directed thereby is no fortitude many are mightie to hunt as nimrod to drinke as those iewes that are censured in esay and to make their strength the law of vnrighteousnesse as the atheists in the booke of wisedome
but this is not the strength of men but of beasts and so doth the scripture set forth such men
but the rule is id tantum possumus quod iure possumus righteousnesse must bee the law of strength not strength of righteousnesse
and before you haue heard that righteousnesse is guided by charitie and therefore charitie doth giue law vnto fortitude also

you see that charitie is aboue the morall vertues it is transcendent ouer the theologicall also
for though it bee one of them yet is it the chiefe one

learne it of saint paul now abideth faith hope and charitie euen these three but the greatest of these is charitie

take them asunder and see the truth hereof see now transcendent it is aboue faith
but here we must distinguish inter ortum and vsum the originall and the vse of faith
faith is not deriued from charitie but charitie from faith for charitie is faiths first borue
but it obtaineth this power ouer faith

that faith without charitie edifieth not it is loue that maketh our faith intend its obiect
for though charitie haue its light from faith yet faith hath all its heat from charitie and light were it not for heate would not be actiue
and therefore saint paul saith if had all faith so that could moue mountaines if haue not charitie it auaileth nothing
but what needeth any better proofe then this that charitie commandeth the mind and faith is the perfestion of the mind for it captiuateth our wits vnto gods wisedome and maketh vs build vndoubtedly vpon that which god affirmeth
faith then cannot but bee subiect vnto charitie to whom our mind is subiect
and what shall we say of hope that is a patient longing after that which is promised by faith and so it partaketh somewhat of the soule and somewhat of the strength whereof you heard before therefore must it needs follow their condition it must needs be at the command of charitie
and who would long for that which he doth not loue or how could hope be patient if charitie did not keepe it in heart

we haue found that it doth transcend faith and hope you would thinke it could goe no further but it can
for charitie doth transcend charitie it selfe
it hath a double act a direct and a reflected the direct is that whereby it is carryed to embrace other things the reflected is that whereby it doth delight in its owne disposition
and of this that wee continue in louing wee can giue no other reason but this that wee doe loue to loue and so doth charitie become transcendent aboue charitie that which is reflected aboue that which is direct
so that bernards rule is true tanta est virtus charitatis vt si desit frustra habentur caetera si adsit rectè habentur omnia

haue discouered vnto you the seate of charitie haue shewed you a fourefold seate thereof the heart the soule the minde the strength there is not one of these foure but is a power of our soule
but hath christ forgotten our body hath it nothing to doe with charity nor charitie with it god forbid for wee are soctable in regard of our bodies as well as our soules and theresore must the one bee charitable as the other
wee must haue charitable eyes the scripture condemneth an euill eye and in condemning an itching eare it commendeth charitte to our eare and god that doth not endure a slanderous tongue doth teach vs how our tongues must be qualified
so likewise doth he call for charitable hands when by the prophet hee speaketh against bloudy ones
and hath my text forgotten to prouide for these no verily for what is necessarily included may not be thought to be omitted
for what is the body of it selfe it is but a dead instrument and the instrument followeth the motion of the chiefe agent
the philosopher can tell vs that anima est quae videt quae audit it is not thy body that seeth but thy soule by thy body and so doth it heare and speake it performeth all its naturall actions
and so doth it its morall also more heauily in some then in other some by reason of the temper doth the body in morall actions follow the soule but yet it followeth
and this may be a good reason why god here the powers of our soule and not the parts of our body
but there is a better and that is deliuered by paul the law is spirituall christ layeth the ground of that god is a spirit

and hee that worshippeth him must worship him in spirit and in truth
now we are sure that there is no hypocrisie in our charitie if the seate of it bee the powers of our soule there may be if it bee the parts of our body witnesse the pharisee to whom christ not onely directs but fitteth his speech also who made some shew of charitie to the world but his inwards were full of hatred in the sight of god for hee was a tempter
and this doth christ perstringe or strike at in pressing these words of the law and shewes that god doth not esteeme the outward deede without the inward affection
and the lesson whch wee must all draw from the seate of charity is this that our outwarid charitable conuersation must bee rooted in our like inward disposition

should now if time would giue leaue carry euery mans eye into his owne bosome there to take a view whether this vertue bee catholique and transcendent or no and if hee find any part vnpossest or not improued

as farre as it should bee should perswade him to see it presently amended
nay should tell you from that which all the world seeth outwardly that few haue charitie inwardly for if they had how could their eyes bee so full of adulterie their eares so set open to entertaine slanders and vntruths their mouthes so with blasphemie and ribaldrie their hands be so exercised with extortion and cruelty certainely these things could not bee without if charitie were within
and if charitie bee not a catholique and transcendent vertue in vs no hope that it is either ordinate or imperatiue these are perfections whereupon the other are raysed as on a foundation
but cannot stand to take this view and quicken your eare onely remember this that if loue doe not hatred will take vp this full soule

god that hath commanded this extent of charitie giue vs eyes to see our want and grace whereby to supply the same that so this vertue may be excluded out of no power that hath right vnto them all and the parts of our body may bee conformable to the powers of our soule
that so no power nor part may appeare deuoyd of charitie whether in the eyes of god or man
amen

verse

the lord thy god

the scripture that doth commaund charitie doth withall teach where it must be seated and vpon whom it must bee bestowed
where it must be seated you haue already heard you are next to heare vpon whom it must bee bestowed
and here we find two kinds of persons both capable of our charitie because they can returne loue for loue and it is the propertie of loue to be mutuall
of these two persons the names are exprest the first is the lord thy god the second is thy neighbour
but we must farther obserue what is included in these names the cause why they must be beloued and who are excluded by them
they are not capable of the loue due to the lord our god that come not vnder his name neither are they capable of the loue due to our neighbour that are not contained vnder his name
secondly though the persons onely are named yet are there things also comprehended vnder the names euen such things as haue reference to the persons and whatsoeuer things are opposite are excluded thereby
touching the first person onely shall handle these points at this time
first then of his name
he is called the lord our god euerie word hath some remarkable thing in it
that which is here rendred

lord is in moses iehoua but the septuagint partly because the greeke tongue hath no characters wherewith to expresse that word and partly because the signification of it cannot be fully exprest in any language by any one word vse undefined span alphabet as the fittest which they could light vpon the euangelist doth follow them and so doe the vulgar translations
but when you heare this word you must not vnderstand it in a popular but in a mysticall sense
will open the mystery vnto you
it noteth then two things the one is absolute in god the other is relatiue to his creatures
in god it noteth the prerogatiue of his nature which standeth in two things the singularitie and the eternitie thereof

touching the singularity when moses asked god what is thy name

god answered him am that am the scripture calleth him by diuers names sometimes true sometimes iust sometimes holy sometimes mighty wee must no otherwise conceiue of these names then as being his very nature wee call him true and what is his nature but truth and holinesse is his nature whom wee call holy the like must bee obserued in his other attributes they are all his nature and and therefore inseparable from him hee must cease to be before hee can cease to bee that which hee is properly called
and herein hee differeth from his creatures whose vertues are a distinct thing from their nature and therefore they may bee stript of them and yet continue themselues still a man may cease to be holy iust true and yet bee neuerthelesse a man
the reason is plaine hee cannot say as god doth am that am his attributes and his nature are not all one

but this singularitie of gods nature doth appeare specially in two compositions with the attributes whereof none are capable but be
the first of which is undefined span alphabet looke whatsoeuer perfection hee hath hee hath it of himselfe and is not beholding to any other for it hee is his owne originall and therefore his is the perfection it selfe he that is undefined span alphabet good of himselfe is undefined span alphabet goodnesse it selfe the like may you say of the rest of the attributes

the second composition is with undefined span alphabet as undefined span alphabet all the treasures of wisedome are hid in him hee is almighty

the fulnesse of all perfection is in him
in regard of these compositions it is

that the scripture vseth these phrases god onely is wise

there is none good but god god dwelleth in light which no man can attaine vnto
and indeed no creae hath any perfection which is not giuen it from aboue which commeth not downe from the father of lights and that perfection which it hath is but as a beame in comparison of the sunne and but as a drop vnto the ocean
you see what is the singularitie of gods nature pointed out in the word lord as it is vsed to note the hebrew iehoua

besides this singularity it noteth also gods eternitie and indeed where there is such singularitie there cannot choose but bee eternitie the one doth necessarily inferre the other as could shew you if the time would permit
the cabalists find eternitie in the syllables whereof the name iehoua is made they finde a preterperfecttense in the last

syllable a present tense in the middle syllable and a future tense in the first

this might seeme idle subtilty but that iohn in the reuelation goeth before vs in so resoluing the name iehoua telling vs that the lord is undefined span alphabet

which was which is and which is io come
but to to giue you more plaine proofe of this eternitie in malachy god speaketh thus am the lord change not saint paul telleth timothy god only hath immortality saint iames with god that is the father of lights there is no variablenesse nor shadow of change
you see then that there is singularitie and eternity in the nature of god and both are noted by the name iehoua or lord

but as these things are noted when wee looke into the nature of god so is there another thing noted which is gods relation to his creatures
and indeed though the name iehoua seeme not to bee yet is the name lord apparantly a relatiue word so that what god is in himselfe of that he is a fountaine to his creatures all things liue moue and haue their being in him and when he sendeth forth his spirit hee renueth the face of the earth
yea not onely the dependencie of the creature vpon him but also the making good of his word vnto his creature is implyed in this name god himselfe teacheth it exod
where hee telleth moses that hee had before appeared vnto the fathers by the name of shaddai allsufficient but hee would now appeare in his name iehoua as a powerfull efficient hee would performe the promise which hee had made vnto the patriarks
to conclude this point out of that which you haue heard you may gather that the name lord doth note an and ouerflowing fountain of blessednes and perfection
the second word is god in the originall of the law it is elohim it it noteth the trinitie the father the sonne and the holy ghost and such a god doth the church acknowledge and by her acknowledging god for such differeth from those that are without the church
those without the church though they haue not reached home yet haue they gone farre in the knowledge of iehoua in the knowledge of the fountaine of perfection but by strength of reason they could neuer finde out the trinitie some touches we read in trismegist and the platonists but it was traditionary diuinity that brought them to the knowledge thereof and that too very imperfect and corrupt to say nothing that trismegist is by the learned censured for a counterfeit
but the true knowledge of one god in three persons is a peculiar mystery of the church the infidels for want of faith cannot comprehend doe not acknowledge it
but this trinitie may bee considered either ad intra or ad extra as it is in god or as it doth manifest it selfe to man
as it manifesteth it selfe vnto man so each person purteth on another consideration the first of a father to men the second of a redeemer and the third of a sanctifier
although it bee necessary for the truth of our faith to acknowledge the trinitie in the first manner yet the comfort of our faith lieth in the second consideration thereof as will appeare in the third word of my text whereunto now come and that is thy the lord thy god

wherein we must first marke that as there are three persons in god so euerie one of those persons is ours he that is a father is our father he hath adopted vs and hee that is the sonne of god hath redeemed vs to make vs gods sonnes and his owne spouse and he that is the holy ghost hath sanctified vs that we may be his holy temples

secondly we must draw the name lord throughout all these persons he that is our father is the lord and so is he the lord that is the sonne the holy ghost is lord also that is they are all three the ouer flowing fountaine of blessed prefection and what they are they are it to me for they are all three my god and so their good is mine
they are mine by creation was made after the image of god and so are they all three mine they were the sampler according to which was framed for because god could not be like man man was made like god

that likenesse might be a ground of mutuall loue
but much more mine in the redemption for then god was manifest in the flesh the godhead dwelt bodily in my nature god became mine undefined span alphabet my nature hath possession of his person and is admitted into an association in his workes
it is no small prerogatiue then that is intimated in this word thy god vnderstand now what an honour is done to the patriarchs when god saith am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of iacob what honour is done to dauids sonne when god saith will bee his father this appropriation of god is the greatest prerogatiue vouchsafed vnto the church
haue opened the name vnto you out of which you may presently gather who are excluded from our loue the loue that is due to the first person euen omnes fictitij and factitij dij as well corporall as mentall idols all that are not capable of this title iehoua elohim with whom we are not or at least we should not be in couenant
but because hereafter when come to the commandement shall fall vpon this point will now passe it ouer

as such persons are excluded so there is included in the name a reason of our loue and we find therein a double reason exemplum and meritum
good examples are strong perswasions and men fashion themselues to nothing more willingly then to that wherof they haue a pattern in their betters
now the exactest patterne of charitie is in the lord god for there is vnitie and trinitie and trinitie in vnitie

and what is that but the two parts of charitie vnion and communion but this is too high a speculation for a vulgar eare

the second reason is more popular and that is meritum this merit is two fold dignitatis and dignationis
dignitatis the merit of gods owne worth for causa diligendi deum est ipse deus

there is enough in god to make him louely and why undefined span alphabet good and louely are reciprocall that which is louely is good and that which is good is louely whereupon is grounded that maxime in philosophie bonum est quod omnia appetunt reason hath no better marke to guesse at that which is good then the propension of all men for to attaine it
now looke vpon the name the lord god and see whether you doe not find that good in it which doth challenge loue
begin with dominus

ou heard that he was goodnesse it selfe if a man doe loue that which is good how can he but loue goodnesse
nay if wee loue the streames with what loue must we embrace the fountaine if we loue that good which is dependent how much more that which is independent seeing there is a possibilitie for vs to bee defrauded of that which is dependent but of that which is independent we cannot be defrauded
yet see the common folly of men

they forsake the fountaine of liuing waters and digge vnto them cisterns that can hold no water

if undefined span alphabet deserue loue how much more undefined span alphabet you heard before that what god is he is it to the full creatures haue but drops or beames and who would leaue the fountaine to rest contented with a drop and when he might enioy the whole body of the sunne to solace himselfe in a single beame and yet such folly there is in the world and he that thinketh gods gifts louely though they are but single in a creature how little is hee affected with the louelinesse of his creator wee cannot denie that good is the obiect of our loue therefore where there is the greatest good thither wee should bend the greatest of our loue dost thou loue wisedome

all the treasures of wisdedome are hid in him dost thou loue holinesse it is to him that the angels sing holy holy holy

doest thou loue wealth the earth is the lords and all that therein is doest thou loue pleasure in his presence is fulnesse of ioy and at his right hand are pleasures for euermore
finally doest thou loue power and honour he is the lord of hosts he is the king of glorie euen a king of kings and lord of lords
adde hereunto that what he is whether undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet he is it onely he is it eternally both which are strong motiues vnto loue for we vse to loue that which is not common as that which is common by reason of the familiarnesse of it groweth vile in our eyes now such good as is in god is no where else to be found
as we loue those good things which are not common so we loue them the more the more they are lasting because our desire would neuer bee defrauded of that wherein it taketh content this good is more lasting then our desire the good of euerie creature is as mutable as the creature is yea more because it differeth from the nature of the creature but this good being all one with the nature of god it is as lasting as is his nature
it is no maruell then that euerie creature eluding our desire which is carried vnto good doth as it were with a reall voice put vs off when we dote vpon it and by experience say to vs non ego sum bonum tuum it is not that am thy good which is to be sought after and after all our painefull enquirie wee are driuen to saint austins resolution fecisti nos domine propter te irrequietum est cor nostrum dones requiescat in te so great is the capacitie of mans desire that nothing can fill it but onely the lord and his soule must needs remaine empire that doth not make the lord the obiect of his loue

you see that there is much worth in the lord and great cause why hee should be beloued there wanteth not worth also in god in euery of the three persons in trinity
had we eyes to looke vpon them ad intra as they are in the blessed trinitie we might easily perceiue it but there is

no proportion betweene our eyes and that light therefore we will forbeare to behold the dazeling brightnes
only of this we may be sure that euery person is most louely because euery of them loueth the other the scripture speaketh it plainly the father loueth the sonne the sonne loueth the father and the holy ghost is the loue of them both now what they loue is lonely indeed because their iudgement is most vpright and their desire most holy
but wee will not sound that bottomlesse depth let vs looke vpon these persons as they manifest themselues ad extra and see how louely they are
hee that is a father in the trinitie doth manifest himselfe as a father to the sonnes of men the scripture doth often remember his tender bowels he shutteth them not vp no not against them that are prodigals a father and a mother on earth may forsake may forget their children but our father in heauen cannot forget hee will not forsake his
and is not such a father louely god the sonne doth manifest himselfe to the world as a sonne hee vseth all his credit with his father to worke not onely the remission of mans sins which he expiated with his bloud but also the aduancement of their persons whom hee vouchsafeth to bee his spouse by taking man so neere vnto himselfe hee bringeth him neere to god also and maketh them children that were seruants intitles them to heauen that deserue to burne as firebrands in hell
and is not such a sonne louely the holy ghost doth manifest himselfe as the holy ghost quickning man and sanctifying him testifying by these effects that hee is a spirit of life to him euen of such a life as maketh him a sacred person hee maketh him a liuing temple a fit habitation for himselfe that he may bee an oracle of god within him and kindle the fire vpon the altar of his heart wherewith onely hee can offer acceptable sacrifices vnto god
and is not this holy spirit louely

all three persons are most louely if the consideration goe no farther then that which haue exprest
but how great an accesse will bee made vnto their louelines if you draw through euery one of them that ground of louelines which before wee found in the name lord for the father is lord the sonne lord and the holy ghost lord as we are truely taught in athanasius his creed euery one of them is undefined span alphabet good of himselfe and and by this accesse we must in our meditations improue their louelines
but haue dwelt long enough vpon meritum dignitatis the desert of loue that is included in their owne worth told you that in the text wee sound another merit and that is meritum dignationis the interest therein vouchsafed vs

were there none but meritum dignitatis there were ground enough of our loue but this meritum dignationis the interest that we haue doth quicken vs to take notice of the worth that is in the thing
euery man naturally loueth that which is his owne and if the thing bee good it doth him the more good to looke vpon it let a man walke in a faire meadow it pleaseth him but it will please him much more if it bee his owne his eye will be more curious in prying into euery part and euery

thing will please him the better so it is in a corne field in an orchard in a house if they bee good the more they are ours the more contentedly doe they affect vs for this word meum is suauissima amor is illecebra it is as good as an amatorie potion
then marke put tuus to dominus and if so bee the lord be louely how much more louely should hee bee in our eyes if hee bee our lord and doth appropriate that infinite good that hee hath vnto vs hee holdeth of none but of himselfe and who would not ioy to bee owner of that good which is independent hee is whatsoeuer heart can desire and who can but reioyce in hauing him in hauing of whom wee can want nothing

put tuus to deus and see how it doth improue the motiue of loue there also
had wee nothing to doe with so tender hearted a father so sweet natured a sonne so gracious a comforter as is the holy spirit we could not but loue them if we did know them but when wee doe heare that these bowels of the father doe yearne vpon vs that wee are the spouse whom the sonne of god doth wooe and that the holy ghost vouchsafeth to make his temple of vs how can wee bee but how can our hearts choose but melt and our affections gaspe and bray like the hart after those persons which haue in them so strong so manifold persuasions to loue

but alas wee that in regard of our carnall loue are easily transported by any seeming good are altogether senslesse when wee are sollicited by our spirituall good so senslesse that god is passionate in his prophets when hee doth taxe our more then bruitishnesse herein

hearken heauen heare earth for the lord hath spoken haue nourished and brought vp children and they haue rebelled against mee the oxe knoweth his owner and the asse his masters crib but israel doth not know my people doth not consider

can a mayd forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet hath my people forgotten me dayes without number
wee doe loue our corporall benefactors at least while they are doing vs good but our spirituall benefactor wee forget euen while hee is doing vs good for when is hee not doing it wee cannot looke vpon our soules our bodies our state but wee see the perpetuall influence of his goodnesse and yet tuus worketh little here and though god vouchsafe vs a great interest yet are wee little moued therewith
wee can loue a man in whom there are so many defects to allay the regard of his goodnesse and from whom we may receiue as much wrong as fauour how much more should we loue god in whom there is no defect and from whom thou canst receiue nothing but good

haue shewed you the reason of loue which is included in the name it followeth that now come on to the dutie that is required and that is loue

wherein we are first to obserue that god speaketh not vnto vs as vnto seruants but as vnto friends hee would not haue vs in his seruice expresse a spirit of seruitude in feare but of adoption in loue hee would not bee feared as a lord but loued as a father derint dum metuant is a tyrants voyce god will haue all his seruants ingenuous hee will haue

our seruice as naturall as is our allegiance
wherein the king of heauen giueth a good patterne to all kings and gouernours in earth

though god hath qualified vs many wayes to doe him seruice yet doth hee in this word diliges loue shew what hee doth principally respect and his eyes are vpon nothing so much as our loue not on our wit our wealth our honour yea all other things are valued according to our loue and without loue they are nothing worth and why loue is that which setteth all a worke for he that loueth will keepe gods commandements hee will doe no euill
but wee may not forget that seeing this loue hath for its obiect him that is so farre aboue vs wee must not seuer it from reuerence which must qualisie the loue which we owe to our superiors in expressing our affection wee must not forget our distance yea and our feare in regard of our flesh may bee seruile to awe it and keepe it downe though it must bee also filiall in regard of the spirit to keepe it in heart

should now if the time would giue leaue shew you how those things that are required in loue must be applyed vnto this obiect
the first propertie of loue is vnion and we should endeauor to become one with the lord to bee transformed into him and as neere as a creature can partake of his creator partake of the diuine nature
wee should desire vnion also with god with god the father by adoption with god the sonne by a spirituall wedlocke with god the holy ghost by entertaining him as his temple wee should so grow one with all three persons
from this vnion our loue should come on to a communion communion in that infinite good which you heard is in the lord for though vnion bee a great aduancement of our nature yet doth our comfort stand in the communion neither did god euer intend the vnion but for the communion
as wee must haue communion with the lord so with god also as children wee must communicate in the inheritance of our father as a spouse in the honour and state of a as the temple in the ornaments and endowments thereof
yea in this communion there must appeare beneuolentia benesicentia there must appeare an intercourse of good will and good deeds betweene the lord god and vs otherwise wee doe not loue as wee should
this is not all the seate of loue must be exercised also the heart for the loue of god must bee free god doth not respect forced loue
the minde god will bee knowne before hee is loued and hee will haue them that loue him to meditate vpon him hee will not regard an vndiscreete loue
thy soule must bee exercised if thou dost not long after him earnestly and take sweet content in him thou dost not loue
finally thy courage must bee employed thou must bee as resolute to compasse this spirituall vnion and communion as carnall wooers are in pursuit of their loue

it is saint basils similie
and why not seeing for the most part they are the worse for their louing and wee are sure for ours to bee the better
but must leaue the enlarging of these things to your owne priuate meditations

you may remember told you that though the person onely is here exprest yet things are also included so farre as they haue reference to this person we must respect euerie creature as it is gods and grieue at the abuse of the meanest of them
but our speciall regard must be vnto those things that worke or witnesse this spirituall loue
worke it as gods word and his sacraments these things wee must haue in a singular regard by reason of the heauenly power which they haue to worke loue the more we vse them the more it will appeare wee desire to loue
as these things worke loue so there are other things that testifie it our praysing of god our praying vnto god our readinesse to please god though we suffer for it the more wee are exercised in these things the more it will appeare we are in loue

but though god kindle loue in vs by his creatures yet must we not loue him for them for that were amor concupiscentiae but wee must by them be led to loue him and that is amor amicitiae
mea tibi oblata non prosunt saith saint bernard sine me nec tua mihi sine te though we come to know god by his creatures yet must our loue immediately fixe on him
as those things which haue reference are included so are those things excluded which haue no reference and whatsoeuer things which doe not lead to him draw from him of all which this must bee kept as a a rule pereant qui quae inter deum nos dissidium volunt wee must haue nothing to do with whatsoeuer will separate betweene god and vs

you haue heard what the person is

and what it is to loue him
when saint austin put these two together hee fell into that humble admiration lord who am that thou shouldest command me to loue thee
and verily a man may well wonder hath not god angels archangels cherubins seraphins to loue him and what grace is it then for him to stoope so low as man yea and whereas the best abilitie of man is too base to bee employed in his seruice hee doth this honour as to stoope to the meanest of our abilities hee commands our dust and ashes this wormes meate our vilde selues to loue him that is to be as it were consorts with him for amor nescit inaequalitatem therefore god doth as it were deifie that which hee doth so farre honour

when dauid looked vpon the interest which god hath giuen vs in his creatures when he put all things in subiection vnder our feete the beasts of the field the fishes of the sea he breaketh out into quid est homo lord what is man that thou art mindfull of him or the sonne of man that thou so regardest him what an admiration then should arise in vs when we see what an interest god hath giuen vs in himselfe especially seeing he hath no neede of vs and all the gaine is ours can wee forbeare with amazednesse and wonderment to vtter the same words lord what is man nay out of the sense of euerie mans owne interest to say lord what a man am that thou shouldest be so mindfull of mee and what a sonne of man am that thou shouldest so regard me

dauid when he describeth the temporall blessednesse which he wisheth to israel

concludeth happie is that people that is in such a case but

he addeth to our purpose yea happie are the people whose god is the lord the prerogatiue that man hath aboue other creatures yea that the christian hath aboue all other nations should make vs set it at a higher rate then commonly we doe

a word of the day and so end
this is all saints day and it is loue that doth characterize a saint for undefined span alphabet

yea undefined span alphabet we haue in earth a communion of saints in faith hope and charitie but in heauen there is no communion but only in charitie faith and hope are done away
nay in earth our communion with god standeth properly in charitie for there can bee no mutualnesse betweene god and vs but only in that and to bee mutuall is a propertie of charitie as told you at the entrance of this sermon

wee beleeue in god but god doth not beleeue in vs wee hope in god god doth not hope in vs but if man loue god god loueth him againe and therefore loue is the proper vertue of saints it is that which both in earth and heauen doth knit vs vnto god

what shall we say then to these thing seeing charitie beginneth a saint on earth and consummateth him in heauen will vow with king dauid will loue thee my lord my strength
and that may performe this vow will pray with saint austin lord so inspire my heart that may seeke thee seeking may find thee and finding may loue thee

and grant lord thy grace vnto vs all so to exercise our selues in this loue that we may haue the honour to bee thy friends both in earth and heauen
amen

thou shalt loue thy neighbour

there are two persons exprest in my text on whom wee must bestow our loue
first the lord our god and secondly our neighbour
spake last of the former of these persons it followeth that now speake of the later so farre as am occasioned by these words thou shalt loue thy neighbour
wherein it will appeare that loue is not only due to god but also to his seruants as many as can returne loue for loue that is all rationall creatures so farre as god hath conioyned vs we must not seuer our selues for euerie creature loues his like amitie is inseperable from societie at least it should be

for my fuller vnfolding and your better vnderstanding of these

wordes will therein distinctly consider first whom then what is due
the person is called a neighbour that which is due to him is loue
but farther in the person we must see first that in him there is found the ground of that loue will discouer it when haue opened the name
secondly that euery man hath his interest in this ground the text pointeth out this when in a reference to euery man it calleth the person thy neighbour
as this must be obserued in the person so in the dutie we must obserue that we that haue the interest must performe the dutie this interest belongeth to euery man and so doth the dutie also if thy neighbour then thou must loue
but though all doe not so yet he to whom god speaketh in this law must and that is israel the members of the church must not faile in this dutie thou must loue thy neighbour
these particulars hold worthy of obseruation in this text will therefore enlarge them
pray god it may be done to our edification
first then of the person

he is called our neighbour the word signifieth one that dwelleth by vs or is ioyned with vs but there is more in the word then is vulgarly conceiued will distinctly shew you the extent thereof
there is a double neighbourhood first an humane secondly a diuine the humane is that which we apprehend by the light of reason the diuine is that which we know not but by the inspiration of the holy ghost
such neighbourhood there must bee because god hath ioyned vs in nature as we depend vpon iehoua and in grace as wee are in couenant with the lord our god
of the humane the first degree for it hath more degrees then one is that which first offereth it selfe to the common vnderstanding and that is neighbourhood in place whether that place be the same towne or parish or countrey or allegiance all these haue a neighbourhood betweene themselues and haue some bonds by which they are knit together because men are naturally sociable creatures and as the word reang imports like sheepe of the same pasture
adde hereunto that societie is inforced quia non omnis fert omnia tellus this linketh ilanders with the continent by leagues and commerce

the second degree is neerenesse in bloud this neighbourhood is betweene those that are of the same kindred
and indeed this was the first neighbourhood that euer was in the world for seuerall families dwelt by themselues you may gather it out of genesis the tenth where the roots of all nations are set downe as likewise in other historicall bookes
for what is an ismaelite but one of the ofspring of ismael an edomite but one of the posteritie of edom that is esau and an israelite one that commeth from israel that is iacob yea affinitie in the first age was not ordinarily contracted but betweene those of the same bloud when by remotenesse from the stocke it grew cold they warmed it againe by the helpe of wedlocke
but after that nimrods arose those mightie hunters that contented not themselues with their owne dominions such as were the gouernours of those foure famous monarchies they subdued other nations to themselues as

likewise did they intermingle with other nations whose multitudes could not be contained within their owne territories here hence arose that mixt neighbourhood which we see in all the world a neighbourhood that seemeth rather of place then in bloud
but howsoeuer they of the same bloud are distracted in place yet is there a naturall neighbourhood betweene them still
the lawes of men haue set bounds vnto consanguinitie and beyond the tenth degree they acknowledge none except it be in the succession of monarchie or absolute principalities wherein some lawyers hold there is no limitation of degrees
but howsoeuer policie alloweth limitation of consanguinitie the scripture doth not for acts
saint paul teacheth the athenians that of one bloud god made all mankind so that all men are the sonnes of adam and they are all kinne
the apostle goeth a step farther in that place and out of a heathen poet proueth that wee are all the ofspring of god and indeed in adam wee were all made after gods image and so must needs haue alliance betweene vs
it is true that when we looke vpon the seuerall generations in the world and the petie dominions whole nations seeme to be strangers one to another the northerne to the southerne the easterne to the westerne they of europe to those of asia both vnto them of africa all three to them of the new world but if we acknowledge the root from whence we all spring adam and god which is the lord of all we must needs confesse that no man can be a stranger to vs because euery man is our bloud and communicateth with vs in the image of god
and if wee conceiue any man vnworthy to be accounted of our cognation let vs know that rex coeli honoratur vel contemnitur in imagine sua not the dead images of the church of rome but this liuing image of the nature of man
the world is but like a great house wherein the family though but one must lodge disperst because so great or if you will a large signiorie vnder which there are many tenants but all of the same homage and holding of the same lord so that man can no more be a stranger vnto man then one tenant of the same lordship can bee vnto another or one person may bee vnto another in the same family
thus farre our neighbourhood reacheth by the light of reason for you may perceiue by the very text which alleaged out of the acts that for this third degree of neighbourhood there is an euidence in reason which another poet also confirmeth

undefined span alphabet
all both strangers and poore are belonging vnto god
were there no other light but this of reason we see that neighbourhood reacheth very farre
but the holy ghost that by the scripture hath inspired into vs a clerer light hath taught vs another kind of neighbourhood which called diuine and this is the neighbourhood of the church and is betweene all them that belong thereunto
for these persons haue all one father in heauen one sauiour that died for them all one comforter that dwelleth in them all they partake of the same sacraments they are taught the same gospel they are called to the same kingdome there is not the least of these prerogatiues but

communion therein is enough to make a neighbourhood

and this neighbourhood also hath seuerall degrees the first is that which is betweene men on earth whereof some are all alreadie of the mysticall bodie they are incorporated into the church are made members of christ are quickened by the spirit are profest children of the kingdome of heauen these wheresoeuer they liue they must needs be neighbours because they can liue no where out of the bodie the bodie say of the catholique church
whose extent may bee ouer the face of the whole earth but wheresoeuer it is it is but one as wee professe in the creed one holy catholique church
though of men there be very many which are not in this church and therefore may seeme not partakers of this diuine neighbourhood yet indeed they must not be excluded from it for what they are not they may be the commission of the gospel sendeth the ministers vnto all goe teach all nations and god would haue all men saued neither is there any respect of persons with god iewes gentiles males females bond free all are capable of the gospel
whereupon saint austin groundeth that saying of his multi intra lupi extra oues many are within the church that are indeed wolues though they be in sheepes clothing and many are without the church that are indeed sheepe though they appeare in wolues clothing
hee meaneth it of gods purpose which is to permit many christians to turne apostataes and to reclaime many infidels and make them christians you see that iudas of an apostle became a traytor and saint paul of a persecutor became an apostle
here commeth in a strange enlargement of our neighbourhood for it comprehendeth euen enemies also the same person whose malice maketh him carrie himselfe towards thee as an enemie must in regard of his possibilitie of comming to the state of grace be reputed by thee to be a neighbour
were not we enemies not only strangers when christ came to seeke vs and holy men conuerted vs all enmitie must giue place where god sheweth mercie
and if malice of an infidell doe not exclude him from being thy neighbour much lesse doth a faithfull man cease to bee a neighbour vnto thee if happily hee grow to be malitious against thee for thou that persecutes christ in him
thus you haue heard the first degree of diuine neighbourhood

the second is betweene men and angels for they are our neighbours they are inhabitants of sion whether we are brought when we are made christians

they are of the same nature with vs though not in regard of our bodies yet in regard of our soules and they partake of the same holy spirit

yea they are ministring spirits for all their sakes that shall be heires of saluation they pitch their tents about vs they carrie vs in their hands christ in the gospel cals them our angels all which are markes of neighbourhood
touching the saints departed there can bee no question for though they are aduanced to greater perfection yet the condition of neighbourhood is not altered they can no more cease to be our neighbour then they can cease to

bee members of christ or children of god or liuing stones in the temple whereof wee are a part

there is a third degree of diuine and that is betweene vs and christ the fathers greeke and latine meditating vpon the parable of the samaritane which is in the tenth of luke acknowledge christ to be our neighbour
and verily whatsoeuer other sense may bee fastned vpon that parable

it is certaine that our sauiour christ came so neere vs in his manhood that he may well goe for our neighbour hee pitcht his tents amongst vs he became immanuel god with vs he became bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh
yea there is no kind of relation requisite vnto that is not found in christ hee is the lord of his church the husband the father the brother

the friend
no doubt then but if any hee must needs bee our neighbour
and in him our neighbourhood is brought vnto her highest pitch for higher it cannot goe and not exceed the pitch of a creature whereas it is onely the reasonable creature that commeth vnder this name of neighbour

it may now bee questioned whether any bee excluded from our neighbourhood seeing wee haue taken vp all the inhabitants both of heauen and earth whereto answere that no reasonable creatures may be excluded by vs but those onely that are either in hell or of hell in hell as diues and the rest that burne there of hell as the prince of darknes that ruleth in the ayre and his angels not one of these are capable of diuine
not those in hell as abraham telleth diues there is a great gulfe betweene

no intercourse betweene them and the saints
and for the other though there bee two much neerenesse in place betweene them and men on earth yet there should bee no commerce because they are vnder a definitiue doome and so all hope of cut off betweene them and vs
there is a third sort of persons that are excluded from diuine though not from humane those whom the scripture calleth sinners against the holy ghost men that sinne vnto death as saint iohn speaketh
but because these are hardly discerned except they turne plaine apostata's wee must not bee hastie to put any in that ranke
our zealous spirits in this age haue beene too forward in such separations it were much better for vs to acknowledge many that are not to be our spirituall neighbours then to denie any that are
and so haue set you out the bounds of both humane and diuine

the second point that obserued in the person is the ground of the dutie the dutie is loue and there is a ground of loue in the person take the neighbourhood which way you will
looke first vpon the humane the first degree of it is in place the first motiue that drew men together was auxilium solatium that they might mutually helpe one another and each sweeten the trouble of anothers life hereupon arose the prouerbe better is a neighbour at hand then a brother a farre off so that here we find a faire a ground of loue
but in the degree of consanguinitie wee finde that which is fairer for it hath in

it undefined span alphabet naturall affection which moueth of it selfe when there is nothing else to moue it yea many things that are apt to worke the contrary disposition cannot remoue this as you may obserue in parents and children and kinsmen whose nature hath not degenerated they cannot choose but loue euen when there are many prouocations to hate
take one example for all dauids compassion towards his rebellious sonne absalon

yea extend wee consanguinitie as farre as the scriptures haue taught vs to extend it wee shall finde ground for the like extent of our loue
strangers to our knowledge must not bee strangers to our loue because they beare in that bloud of adam which is common to them with vs the image of god which is the greatest thing that wee are to glory of as wee are men
and seeing we all hold it of the same lord our common reference vnto him doth require our mutuall respect no lesse then doth that common endowment which wee receiue from him
am sure by this time you doe not doubt but there is a faire ground of loue in humane you shall finde yet fairer in that which is diuine follow it by the degrees
the first degree told you was that which is betweene men in the church militant there is no part of our catechisme that doth not teach vs a ground of loue in this
you cannot say your creed but therein you professe the communion of saints and therein many grounds of loue
you begin the lords prayer with our father and so professe that euery member of the church and you are children of one heauenly father wherein you acknowledge in euery member a ground of loue
throughout the second table of the commandements our neighbour is enioyned to loue vs which iniunction to performe hee hauing taken vpon him in his baptisme we cannot looke on him but wee see ground why wee should loue him for then wee looke on the man that hath vowed vnto god that hee will loue vs
and if wee looke on him as he partakes in the sacrament of the eucharist then wee see another ground why wee should loue him for then we behold him as professing that hee doth loue vs in testimony whereof the saints were wont to begin this sacrament with a mutuall holy kisse in lue whereof the supersticious kissing of the pax succeeded in the romish church
you see then that if so bee the sociablenesse which is naturall requireth loue that of grace requireth it much more

what shall wee say to them that are without the church that persecute the church is there any ground of loue in them yea the wickednesse of man cannot euacuate the right of nature much lesse of grace they are our neighbours whether they will or no by nature because they are men and so are they also by grace because they may bee christian men so that wee cannot say to them in neither respect what haue wee to doe with you therefore in the same person wee must distinguish betweene his ill affection towards vs and his which god vouchsafeth him and not let the malice of the one intercept the sight of the louelinesse that is in the other
and if so bee wee may

not forget that spirituall louelines which is only in hope as it is in infidels much lesse may we forget that louelinesse which is indeed in those which are christians these haue in them most vndoubted grounds of loue

the next degree of diuine neighbourhood is betweene vs and the church triumphant angels and saints wee cannot doubt of their louelinesse if wee know wherein their neighbourhood consisteth shewed it you before and further they really testifie their loue toward vs the saints in praying for the church in generall the angels in being ministring spirits for the good of the church

but here wee must take heed that wee inlarge not this bounderie too farre for men that haue made little account of saints on earth haue made too much of them when they haue beene departed this life and to angels they haue attributed more then euer god bestowed vpon them
wee for the auoyding of their errours must confine our thoughts within the iust bounds of their louelinesse

the third degree of neighbourhood is that which is betweene the church and our sauiour christ and here wee find the fullest ground of that euer was or will be created the church saith truly in the canticles totus est desiderabilis view him from top to toe

you shall find nothing in him that doth not shew him to bee a most louely neighbour peruse all his fore specified references towards his church there is not the least of them that doth not challenge the loue thereof

and now that wee haue gone ouer all you see a good reason why the word that is vsed by moses reang signifieth not only a neighbour but also a friend for euery one that is a neighbour is by the vertue of his neighbourhood to be accounted as our friend
secondly that all persons must bee considered as they are in god and christ and not as in themselues otherwise wee shall misdeeme them for any communion which a man hath with god and christ cannot but seeme vnto vs an apparant right that he hath to be accounted our neighbour and our friend
but he that appeareth vnto vs as deuoid of both these communions hee cannot seeme vnto vs to bee our neighbour and therefore not our friend

a third thing that noted in the person whom we must loue is euery mans interest in him for the law speaking to euery man saith he is thy neighbour therefore thou must not looke vpon him only with thy direct sight but with a reflected also
let vs runne ouer the degrees of neighbourhood againe and see how euery of them doth concerne euery one of vs
the first degree of humane neighbourhood is neighbourhood in place that was instituted as told you propter auxilium solatium and god knoweth there is no man that doth not stand in need of both and it is not gods will that any should bee excluded from either but euery man hath an interest of helpe and prosit from him that is his neighbour in place therefore we must euery man take care to yeild and expect to receiue whatsoeuer helpe or comfort he hath in himselfe or is in any other these gifts must bee

mutuall they must bee interchangeable a neighbour must doe for thee as well as be a receiuer from thee therefore doth god call the neighbour thine

the next degree of humane neighbourhood is that of bloud wherein men are brought neerer one vnto another then they can bee by any politique lawes because of a neerer interest which doth combine them the interest of nature
for euery man hath his nature and being in or from those of his bloud the father hath his being in his sonne the sonne hath his being from his father a brother hath his being in a brother an vncle in a nephew
and so betweene all other degrees there is an interest of being which one hath in anoher more or lesse as the degrees are more or lesse remote
whence it is that politique neighbourhood respecteth no man but out of deliberate reason it is quickened by hope of receiuing like kindnesse when time shall serue but neighbours in bloud respect each other out of an inborne affection for it is naturall to euery man to affect himselfe and his owne being without any farther consideration and consequently he cannot but affect another in whom he beholds his being to be preserued as well as in himselfe or from whom he conceiues his being to haue proceeded
hence it is that parents loue their children and children their parents and a brother loues a brother and an vncle his nephew euen where they looke for no retribution
come wee on to the third degree of neighbourhood which superaddeth another ground of loue and by consequent increase of interest
this third degree goeth beyond that of bloud as the lawes of men doe limit consanguinitie but yet in true iudgement consanguinitie hath no stricter limits then the nature of man because all men are made of one blood and so in true iudgement euery man must thinke that hee hath in euery man an interest of his naturall being and vpon this ground a man in whom nature is not degenerate will loue another man and doe for him be he neuer so strange vnto him and though there be no hope to bee recompenced by him vpon this ground a christian will loue and relieue a poore turke

but setting aside this iust extension of consanguinitie that wee are all made of one bloud we are all neighbours also in that wee are all made by one god and after one image of that god whence ariseth another ground of loue similitude in our nature we all resemble god and in our originall we all come from god and hence comes increase of that interest which wee haue one in another the father thinkes the bond of his naturall affection towards his childe to bee strengthened if his childe be like vnto him especially if he be like in that which is the greatest honour of the father so doth a brother thinke of a brother that is like him and generally similitude is conceiued to giue vnto those men betwixt whom it is an interest each in the other therefore men cannot in reason acknowledge that reference vnto god wherein they all meet they cannot conceiue how they all partake of the same image of god which is their greatest honour as they are men but withall they

must confesse a mutuall interest which hereby they haue one in another

let vs passe on from the humane to the diuine neighbourhood see what interest we find there
the more grounds of loue the more interest now here is grace added to nature children we are all of the same father in heauen and not by many descents as in humane consanguinitie we fetch our pedigree from adam but immediatly for we are all made children by the same baptisme so is our consanguinitie collaterall in the first degree
and can we then denie a mutuall interest that are fratres germani let vs looke vpon one another as wee are in christ our sauiour wee are incorporated into him and so members one of another and therefore we cannot haue lesse interest one in another then the eye hath in the eare or the eare in the hand or the hand in the foot each hath need of the other and they may claime right each in the others abilitie like interest will arise out of our being temples of the holy ghost the liuing stones that make vp that building doe mutually support themselues et fortitudo omnium tota esb singulorum they are made mutually necessary by the manner of their compacting
neither haue we a religious interest only in those that are alreadie in the church but also in those that may bee
what interest in re wee haue of them that be within we haue of them that be without in spe they may be christians and so become profitable helpes vnto vs in the mysticall bodie of christ in regard of this hopefull interest may they iustly claime our loue and our paines to worke their conuersion

the second degree of diuine neighbourhood is betweene vs and the saints and angels in the church triumphant who continuing still to be members of the church must needs with all continue vnto vs the interest which we haue had in them
therefore the angels call themselues our fellow seruants
and it goeth inter piè credibilia

that the saints doe pray for vs at least in generall

the last degree is the neighbourhood with christ need not proue vnto you that we haue an interest in him and he in vs wee call him our lord our sauiour our brother and hee as many wayes calleth vs his his bodie his spouse his church these mutuall appropriations necessarily inferre mutuall interest
thus haue wee found the extent of neighbourhood in euery part of this extent we haue found a ground of loue and there is not a parcell of this ground which doth not concerne euery of vs a man would thinke that the case being such our owne propension would produce the dutie and that there needed no such commandement as thou shalt loue

but yet the commandement is no more then necessary for what degree of neighbourhood is there which is not infested with hatred neighbours in place how doe they enuie tradesmen in townes and inhabitants in the countrie if their lands lie neare quarrell euery where and seeke to ruine and destroy not only to vexe and disquiet

each other as if that which was instituted for succour and comfort did yeild the best opportunitie for malice and rage to worke on
as for neighbourhood in bloud

how soone did cain make that vnnaturall reply euen to god himselfe am the keeper of my brother cham discouered his fathers nakednesse
the apostle doth tell vs of infidels that were without naturall affection and euery smatterer in histories can giue examples thereof and iustifie that prouerbe rara est concordia fratrum

come to the more remote consanguinitie which is moreouer graced with the image of god few haue taken notice thereof strangers haue beene thought a sit subiect to prey on and men haue shed their bloud without remorce

and fareth it better with christians doth not christs prophesie proue true the brother shall deliuer vp the brether to death and the father the child and the children shall rise vp against their parents and cause them to be put to death

neede not instance in particular persons for what nation is there round about vs wherein there are not many lamentable spectacles of ciuill warres and vnchristian the world is euery where full of nabals and samaritans
as for infidels rob them and reproch them we doe but who doth labour their conuersion and seeke of enemies to make them friends and of strangers to make them fellowcitizens with the saints but it may bee we respect the church triumphant more no euen here also our vncharitablenesse appeares for we grieue the angels which are witnesses of our carriage and liue cleane contrarie to the good examples which the blessed saints haue left vnto vs finally the world is growne so profane as that men tread vnder their feet the sonne of god they account the bloud of the couenant wherewith they were sanctified an vnholy thing who can make any better construction of those blasphemies which come from foule mouthes when they call the sacred wounds and bloud and bodie of christ to witnesse their impurities seeing then there is so little charitie towards our neighbour take neighbourhood howsoeuer you will you see there is great need of this commandement thou shalt loue thy neighbour

but what is it to loue

might tell you in few words let not eueryman seeke that which is his owne but that which is anothers
might branch it into these two points first a man must bee carefull to doe no hurt and secondly doe all the good he can for his neighbour and in doing good he must be as kind in aduersitie to weepe with them that weepe

as in prosperitie to reioyce with them that reioyce
or might carrie you along through all those branches which were toucht when opened those words thou shalt loue told you then that loue beginneth in vnion of the persons it commeth on to communion first in good will and then in good deeds and this euery one that loueth doth labour to expresse both in soule and bodie for it must be syncere
but because haue exprest diuers kinds and degrees of neighbourhood cannot better teach you what it is to loue your neighbour then to

perswade you to entertaine each kind of neighbourhood and that according to its degree
is any man thy neighbour in place be as occasion serueth his helpe his comforter otherwise god will not account that thou louest him non prodest si nos continet vna domus separat diuersa voluntas plus attendit deus vnitatem animi quam loci any moreouer thy neighbour in bloud let him find how much nature is more potent then law and let consanguinitie double the heat of thy affections to wards him
doest thou apprehend that all mankind is made after the image of god let thy humanitie towards strangers testifie the reuerence which thou bearest to thy maker

let not the stranger lodge in the street but open thy doores vnto trauellers
neighbourhood in place doth but supply neighbourhood in bloud therefore if we respect that which is the sample much more must we respect this which is the sampler
art thou aduanced to an higher degree of neighbourhood in that thou art a member of the church thy good offices must be multiplyed accordingly and thou must promote the communion of saints with much more zeale then the societie of men here thou must shew how farre grace goeth beyond nature
is man thy friend dilige eum in dec loue him because alreadie he stands in good tearmes with god
is he thy enemie dilige eum propter deum loue him for gods sake and after gods example he maketh his sunne to shine and his raine to fall vpon the iust and vniust thankfull vnthankfull therefore if thy enemie hunger

giue him meat if he thirst giue him drinke and so heape coles of fire on his head
if thy enemie be a member of the church remember hee is but like a part of thy bodie out of ioynt though it be painfull yet how tenderly doest thou handle it and neuer leaue vntill thou hast set it in ioynt againe euen so shouldest thou vse thy brother neuer leaue vntill thou hast brought him to yeeld thee as much content as he hath wrought thee woe
is hee without the church that doth afflict thee looke not vpon him but vpon the deuill that prouoketh him poure out thy malice against the deuill for this is a lawfull enmitie

vpon that ancient ground ponam immicitias but pitie the man let him find in thee the comfort of a neighbour thou canst not better ouercome the deuill then by such loue of thine enemies
a man cannot so many wayes afflict thee but thou must be as many wayes charitable vnto him as christ teacheth in the fift of matthew verse
in a word amor nescit inimicum and this euery christian man must shew or else he will betray that he is no liuing member in the mysticall bodie of christ for how doth he liue therein that is either senselesse or satanicall his owne bodie will refute him

as we must loue our neighbours in the church militant so must we loue also our neighbours of the church triumphant we must reuerence the presence of the angels that are about vs and not misdemeane our selues before them nor grieue them in their ministerie wee must thankfully commemorate the liues of the saints departed and bee carefull to resemble them in their vertues
but wee must not with the church of rome

racke our loue towards either angels or saints and honour them farther then we haue warant much lesse derogate from god or christ in our honouring them
as for christ it is not hard to conceiue how wee must loue him his names will guide vs
the church is his spouse shee must loue him with a chast loue the church is his bodie shee must loue him with an obedient loue he is our brother we must loue him with a naturall loue the diuersitie of his titles will teach vs how to diuersifie our loue for hee beareth no title which wee must not entertaine with an answerable loue

in all that you haue heard you may perceiue that there are diuers kind of persons that challeng our loue but christ calleth neuer a one of them by his proper name but comprehendeth them all vnder one name neighbour other names would haue imported some personall respects teaching vs two things first that our loue must bee without respect of persons we may not loue because a man is rich wife or honourable nor for any other worldly respect these bee the motiues that sway with publicans and sinners with carnall men but these are base respects in the eyes of christian men
especially seeing god that hath made men vnequall in these hath made them equall in better things
yea and these which are so vnequally distributed are therefore so distributed that they might giue the fitter opportunitie for the exercise of our loue
looke vpon thy bodie it is made of the foure elements whereof one is cold another is hot one is moyst another is drie doth the hot abhorre the cold or the moyst the drie no rather they impart their qualities to them and out of so louing neighbourhood commeth this goodly fabricke of mans bodie which would soone be dissolued if this louing neighbourhood should faile
the whole frame of the world is preserued by the louing association that is betweene vnequall creatures so the great world the little world both doe teach vs how due our loue is vnto neighbourhood only in regard of neighbourhood
the second thing that wee must obserue is that wee must take the scantling of our loue from the kind and degree of neighbourhood
but of that shall speake more when come to the measure only now obserue that as told you when spake of the loue of the lord our god that loue must not only extend to his person but to those things that belong vnto him so must we conceiue also of the loue of our neighbour
whereupon are grounded those lawes thou shalt not see thy neighbours oxe nor his asse going astray sinking vnder his burden lying in a ditch but thou shalt bring him home ease him lift him out in a word whatsoeuer thing concerneth our neighbour in any kind or degree of neighbourhood wee must testifie the acknowledgment of our reference to him in carefully procuring the welfare of that thing

you haue heard the dutie
but who must performe it surely whosoeuer hath the interest is he thy neighbour why then thou must loue him
but the law speaketh properly to them that are vnder the

law and so thou an israelite and teacheth vs which are the israel of god in this word christ taxeth the pharisees glosse who straightened the extent of neighbourhood

as appeared by the addition they made to the law thou shalt loue thy neighbour and hate thine enemies they confined neighbourhood to their owne sect at least to their owne nation
and wee see at this day the iewes mention not christians without reproch no more then papists doe protestants
but a christian must know that in iesus christ there is neither iew nor gentile

grecian nor barbarian male nor female bond nor free
saint austin hath a conuicting reason

which is that otherwise there would bee some persons with whom we might commit adulterie whose goods wee might steale whose bodies we might murder without any sinne against them which is absurde

the case of the canaanite was extraordinarie

we may not match our affections with gods precepts as if they were alike lawfull
wherefore let vs beare fruit answerable to the seed which god hath sowen in our hearts and though our nature bee prone to satanisme and hatred for this charitie is a straine aboue nature and knowne only to those of the church yet let vs mortifie it and subdue it to the law of god let vs not define whom we must loue other wise then we are taught of god let vs not thinke we loue as many as we should if we exclude any from our loue for our loue must be the fulfilling of the law therefore it is impossible for vs in regard of any man whatsoeuer to performe the law which bindeth vs to him without loue

now therefore the god of loue season all our hearts so with loue that hatred being cleane rooted out we may all be of one minde of one heart and out of the sweet sense and comfort hereof we may all say and sing ecce quam bonum behold how good and ioyfull a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in vnitie

the sixth sermon
epigraph

matt
verse
thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soule and with all thy mind
this is the first and great commandement
and the second is like vnto it thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe

the last point which opened vpon this text taught vs vpon whom we must bestow our charitie we learned that we must bestow it vpon the lord our god and our neighbour vpon these persons and vpon those things that haue reference vnto them must it bee bestowed
therefore though the commandement seeme in nature to bee but one for it is onely loue yet christ breaketh it into two and these two vnequall

as it must be bestowed on them so in bestowing it we must obserue an order and a measure both are plainely prescribed in the text
the order for here is a frist and a second commandement mencioned
the measure for here is mentioned the great commandement and a commandement that is onely like it
we are willed to loue first the lord our god secondly our neighbour this is the order
and we are willed to loue the lord our god with all our heart soule and mind and our neighbour as our selues this is the measure

order then and measue are to be obserued in the bestowing of our charitie
and indeed without order and measure no worke hath either beautie or perpetuitie looke vpon the frame of heauen and earth were not the parts thereof so well ordered had not each of them his limits it could neither be so goodly nor so lasting a creature want of order would blemish the goodlinesse and want of measure would shorten the lastingnesse thereof euen so is it in charitie inuert the order alter the measure required therein by the law wee doe foulely deforme it and all societie grounded thereon bee it heauenly or earthly will quickly bee disolued
this time will not suffice for the opening of both wherefore will now onely handle the order and reserue the measure for some other time
touching then the order that is to be obserued in charitie wee must know that it is twofold there is ordo ad intra and ordo ad extra an order in the generation of it or the working of it into our soules and an order in the employment of it as we expresse it in our liues
of the first order you heard when opened vnto you the seate of charitie and shewed you that it is either primitiue or deriuatiue it must begin at the heart and from thence spread it selfe into the soule the mind the strength
with that order we haue nothing to doe now my text leadeth me to speake of the second order the order of employment the bestowing of it vpon others after we are seasoned with it our selues

to come then to this order to vnderstand it we must take this rule scire quid facere debeamus nescire ordinem faciendt perfecta scientia non est moralitie requireth that we not onely know what we ought to doe but also in what order otherwise the knowledge of our dutie is imperfect therefore imperfect because it will be indiscreete discretion being that which doth distinguish and digest the parts of

and points in our dutie
so that take away order vertue will presently into vice especially if we admit that definition of saint austine short but true est ordo amoris vertue is nothing else but the well ordering of our charitie
wherefore the order of gods precepts must not bee passed ouer vnregarded because therefore doth god keepe an order in commanding to intimate vnto vs what order we must keepe in our liuing
whatsoeuer is good may be beloued well or ill well if you obserue the order and if you neglect it then you loue it ill

but let vs come closer to the text
here we find a first and a second commandement
it is doubted by some whether they are rightly so called

seeing that which concerneth our neighbour was first deliuered leuit

vers
and therefore deliuered on mount sinai leuit


and that which concerneth the lord our god was deliuered afterward deutro

vers
and therefore deliuered in the land of moab deutr

the distance of times wherein they were deliuered was thirtie eight yeeres
but we must not insist vpon these words as referring to the times wherein moses deliuered the commandements but as expounding their sense as they are a summe of the decalogue and point out the principall duties prescribed therein
now because the decalogue was engrauen in two tables and the briefe of the first was our dutie toward god therefore is that called the first commandement and our duetie toward our neighbour being an abridgement of the second table it is therefore called the second commandement

where by the way you may take notice that those iewes erre who breaking the ten commandements into two fiues thinke there were siue grauen vpon either table whereupon it would follow that the first commandement which commandeth our dutie towards our neighbor was ioyned with those commandements which enioyne our duetie toward god which cannot stand with this first and second of my text
hauing found in regard of what scripture these commandements are called first and second let vs now see how well the matter contained in them doth deserue these names
and here we shall find that this order is very naturall for as in their being so in being the obiects of our loue these persons are to goe the one before the other god before our neighbour god hath the first right vnto our loue and then our neighbour

but let vs looke into the commandements a sunder
the loue of god is termed the first commandement and it is two wayes first ordine naturae dignitatis whether you looke to the originall of the louelinesse or to the worthynes that is therein
you cannot denie the lord our god to bee the originall of louelinesse if you remember what obserued vnto you on the name of lord god and our lord god not a branch of these obseruations which doth not strongly proue this primacie of loue but chuse rather to represent it vnto you by two or three familiar similes
the first is of consanguinitie
brethren loue each the other but their loue is not immediate it passeth vnto them by their parents in whome they both meete and there groweth the roote of their loue take away that dependencie which they haue thereon and brotherly affection will presently wither euen so it is betweene vs and our neighbour loue we must and why because we are sonnes of the same father malachi pointeth out this ground haue we not all one father

wherefore doth any man wrong his brother you see here is a faire ground of primacie
there is as faire in our body wherein our members haue a fellow feeling each of the others case and they bestirre themselues for their mutuall comfort but whence commeth this but from the head where is the fountaine of sense and motion the members haue no vertue for which they are not beholding to the head
the church is a body whose head is christ and christ is the fountaine of whereof if he doe not communicate

an influence we shall be absurd if we seeke it in the body yea we shall seeke it in vaine
take a third simily of an house or a temple these buildings hane a foundation whereupon the whole pile is reard the parts support the one the other but it is the foundation the corner stone that knitteth them that holdeth them all together you ruine the house if you loose the foundation
and the temple of god which we are or the communion of saints wherein we liue where shall wee find the sinnewey bands of it but in the spirit of christ wherof we all drinke which foundeth vs all on him might amplifie this point by the title of creator which belongeth vnto god which cannot bee acknowledged but it will enforce his right to the first fruites of our loue from whom our being taketh beginning

in order of nature then it is cleare that our first loue belongs to god
now will make it as cleare that in order of worthinesse it belongeth to him also
loue is an affection of our will our will naturally is carried vnto good where then wee find apparently the preeminencie of good thither must the precedencie of our loue deseruedly bend now the preeminencie of good is out of all question in god he is so good that christ telleth vs there is none good but he

when opened the name of the lord our god fell vpon this point and said enough to cleare it wherefore will now be the more briefe will onely point out three grounds the least of which doth argue god to be worthy of our first loue if that which we loue be good

first god is good ase he hath no other originall of his goodnesse but himselfe and this no other can bee but god
others as they haue their being so haue they their goodnesse from him enerie good and euerie perfect gift commeth from him

which is himselfe the father of lights

as god is good ase so hee is perse good by nature yea goodnesse is his nature
in all creatures nature and goodnesse speake of morall goodnesse are two distinct things so that goodnesse may bee separated from the nature and be recouered by it againe angels by creation had and lost it it was adams case but hee recouered it againe both of them were like the moone betweene whose brightnesse and bodie there is no such vnion but that they may admit a separation as appeares in the eclipse but goodnesse and god are as light and the sunne one so essentiall to the other that they cannot bee seuered except they cease to bee
a seeming eclipse there is of the sunne but that seemeth to vs which indeed is not euen so though god neuer cease to bee good yet may flesh and blood conceiue worse of him but it is onely a carnall conceipt

for in gods goodnesse there is no variablenesse nor shadow of change

thirdly god is good propterse he hath no end of his goodnesse without himselfe other things haue their goodnesse giuen them for a farther end their goodnesse is not onely for their perfection but for their vnion to some other to this they tend and are restlesse till they attaine this but gods goodnesse is absolute it is its owne end and beside it selfe it needeth nothing as appeard before the creation while it enioyed it selfe

and it is no necessary but an arbitrary graciousnes out of which god vouchsafeth to entertaine communion with his creatures
if then the most worthy good doe iustly challenge our first loue then certainly our first loue is vndenyable due vnto god whose goodnesse hath this threefold preheminence whereupon it will follow that we are bound first to loue the lord our god and the commandement that enioyneth this is for good reason called the first

but though the first yet not the onely
victor antiochenus hath a good note primum eò magis vocat vt secundum quo{que quod a primo diuelli non debet commodiùs inferri queat
the pharisee moued his question concerning the great commandement christ telleth him there are more great commandements then one and therefore beginneth with the first that hee might the more fitly teach him the second a second inseparable from the first
this second it did concerne the pharisee to know for whatsoeuer his loue was to wards god it is plaine hee was without the loue of his neighbour because hee came to tempt christ and therefore christ striketh directly at his fault and sheweth him that there is a second commandement beside the first euen such a one as without which the first cannot consist for there can bee no true loue of god which is not accompanied with the loue of our neighbour

hee that loueth not his neighbour whom hee doth see how can hee loue god whom hee doth not see so that christ doth answere not onely fully but abundantly

the word second doth moreouer teach vs that these commandements are not but the doe not goe hand in hand but one doth attend the other and there is good reason why because the one doth flow from the other
to open this a little more fully
this commandement hath a secondarinesse in nature and a secondarinesse in worthinesse
a secondarinesse in nature for wee cannot loue the fountaine of loue but wee must loue the streames that flow from it the same nature that teacheth children to loue their parents teacheth them to loue one another abraham thought so

when hee perswaded lot not to contend vpon this ground for wee are brethren and moses vpon the same ground would haue reconciled two israelites that were at variance when hee reproued him that was iniurious thus you are brethren
the secondarinesse is as plaine in the resemblance of the body

for the members that are respectiue of the head should not in reason bee ill affected betweene themselues the sense which they deriue from the head maketh them effectually feeling of each others state and christians cannot bee senslesse of any part which is in christs body except they haue lost the sense of their coniunction with christ their head
finally the liuing stones that are in the spirituall temple doe as willingly embrace and hold fast each the other as they doe gladly entertaine the fountaine of their vnion which is the holy ghost whatsoeuer motiue there is that perswadeth vs in the first place to loue the lord our god doth perswade vs in the second place for to loue our neighbour because our neighbour and wee doe pertake thereof so that the loue of our neighbour is a second commandement

to bee obeyed not arbitrarily but necessarily because the same nature teacheth vs in the second place to loue our neighbour which taught vs in the first place to loue god

another secondarinesse there is and that is of worthinesse for though our neighbour deserue to bee beloued yet is his worthinesse but secondarie
and why such is his goodnesse god is good a se his goodnesse springeth from himselfe but our neighbours goodnesse is a deo hee hath it from the gift of god god is good perse goodnesse is his very nature but our neighbour is good only in deo so farre as hee hath communion with god
finally god is good propter se there is no end of his goodnesse but his owne glory but our neighbours goodnesse is ad deum it aymes at something beyond it selfe and that is at god and vnion with him
so that this must passe for an vndoubted and grounded truth that as the reason why wee must loue our neighbour must bee goodnesse so that goodnesse must bee conceiued to bee but in a secondary degree and as the effect doth respect his efficient so must the loue of our neighbour respect the loue of god because no man can loue his neighbour orderly that doth not first loue god
yea as hee concludeth soundly that hath the principles whence his conclusion must issue euer in his eye and obserueth their direct influence into the conclusion euen so a man can neuer erre in the loue of his neighbour that guideth himselfe by his loue of god for quod primum est in vnoquoque genere est mensura reliquorum

in a word wee must neuer loue our neighbour but in a double intention a primarie which looketh vpon god a secundarie which looketh vpon our neighbour and beholdeth god in him
this rule is of speciall vse to make our loue regular whereof wee haue an excellent example in the macedonians to whom saint paul beareth witnesse that they gaue themselues first to the lord

and then to the apostles according to the will of god wee must not bee content to know this will doe our neighbour good but see that it agree with the first table which doth qualifie the second

it is true that as in naturall knowledge so also in the affection of loue wee begin a prioribus sensui wee first apprehend the lineaments of a liuing body and then discerne therein the effects of a soule and last of all come to know the soule it selfe euen so in the course of nature wee first take notice of our neighbour and the inducements to loue him then we apprehend some higher cause that worketh these inducements and last of all wee acknowledge that that cause is most louely whereupon saint austin

diligendo proximum purgas oculum ad diligendum deum
but yet as in naturall knowledge when by going backward wee are come to that which is first in nature wee make that our guide to vnderstand distinctly what before we knew but confusedly euen so though the imperfect loue of our neighbour doth draw vs to a knowledge of our loue of god yet when wee haue attained that wee must take the true taste of our affections from thence and that must correct the corrupt relish which otherwise would be in our loue for it fareth with our spirituall

taste as it doth with our corporall if either bee possest with any quality whatsoeuer it receiueth will seeme answerable according to the maxime in philosophie intus apparens excludit alienum

againe this order of first and second doth teach vs that wee must first giue to god and our neighbour our loue before any other gift for all other will easily follow if this goe before and they are all of no value if they flow not from this it is not possible we should doe any other seruice if wee yeeld not this and if it were possible yet wee should doe it in vaine therefore wee must repute this first and second commandement the foundations of pietie before wee set our selues to doe our dutie wee must loue god if we will serue him and if we will serue our neghbour we must first loue him

to conclude this point out of all which you haue heard you may learne the truth of that which saint austin hath

ipse amor ordinatè amandus est loue it selfe must be loued orderly and if order bee requisite in the exercise of euery vertue much more in charitie which is the root of vertues in somuch that where there is no order there can bee no charitie

because this order is nothing else but that quo benè amatur quod amandum est vt sit in nobis virtus qua bene viuitur so that hee liueth iustly and holily which passeth a true iudgement vpon the obiects of loue and such a one is hee onely that hath his charitie well ordered for hee nec vtitur fruendis nec fruitur vtendis hee doth not his loue

but where is he

nunc confusam in pleris{que inordinatam licet videre charitatem it is gregorie nyssens complaint and this inordinatenesse began very early saint iude telleth vs of the angels that they kept not undefined span alphabet their originall which is in effect they did not obserue the subordination of these commandements they would haue no dependencie vpon god and so shut him out of their loue adam did no better who being made after the image of god affected another likenesse and so cast off the first of these two commandements
the children of god that coupled themselues with the daughters of men were most infamous for this disorder of their charitie and who is not guiltie of it where bee the parents that begin not their loue at their children and care for no more of the loue of god then may stand with their thriuing for them saint paul insinuates as much concerning man and wife when hee telleth vs that the vnmarried care for those things which belong vnto the lord but the marryed take care for those things wherein they may please each the other as if that were ordinarily their principall care
and how seruants forget their loue of god while they seeke to please their masters you may perceiue in euery shop where apprentises are inured to lying deceiuing and all to aduance their masters commodity
it were infinite to runne ouer all degrees of persons but if you list to doe it you shall finde that all their charitie is out of order for want of this order and that they place the precedencie of their loue amisse

and it were well if men went no farther then to preferre man before god there is as much disorder in our loue of things yea the disorder

in the loue of persons groweth from the disorderly loue of things

ciues ciues quaerenda pecuniaprimum est virtus post

prophane men thinke that gaine is the best godlinesse and couetous men will sell euen their soules for a morsell of bread esau sold his for a messe of pottage yea iudas sold our sauiour christ for thirtie pieces of siluer

saint austin distinguishing things telleth vs that some are supra aboue vs as god some intra within vs as our owne soules and selues some iuxta euen with vs as our neighbours some infra below vs as the world and worldly things wee may adde some contra our deadly enemies as are the diuell and the powers of darknesse
of these loue is due to god aboue vs to our selues to our neighbours wee finde them all three in the commandement of loue but we finde not there those things which are below vs much lesse those things which are opposite to vs
and yet when we come to consider what order the world keepeth in loue we shall finde that these two which god neuer thought worthy of our loue haue the greatest share therein and wee haue no leasure to loue the other so great is our loue to these at least our forwardnesse in the loue of these maketh vs backward in the loue of the other our meate our money our pleasure our profit that were by the creation subiected vnto vs are become masters of our affections yea the cursed serpent can so charme them that wee will denie him nothing and men like a generation of vipers doe his will as if the diuell were their father so farreis charitie disordered

the more reason haue we to listen to this method of lone which is here taught by our sauiour christ and thinke that there is more in these two words first and second then wee did happly apprehend
certainly the knowledge of them is of great consequence for it is the true rule of vertue and the obseruance of them is of great difficultie for our corrupt nature can hardly be brought vnto it wherfore we must imprint deeply in our mindes that which wee haue heard and pray god that wee may haue grace to doe what we are taught
lord wee confesse that our loue hither to hath beene peruerse and that nothing can rectifie it but thy spirit wee beseech thee that hee may so informe our iudgement and reforme our affections that we consecrate the first fruits of our charitie vnto thee and that thou mayest haue the precedencie therein but let not our charitie rest there but descending from thee let it light on those to whom thou directest it yet so that but for thee and in thee we may loue nothing beside thee so shall wee bee thy beloued if wee bee such louers and bee admitted into the blessed societie of those whom thou hast honoured with the name of thy friends in the kingdome of heauen

the seuenth sermon
epigraph

matt
verse

thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soule and with all thy strength
this is the first and great commandement

in bestowing our charitie wee must obserue an order and a measure an order because concerning it we find in this text a first and second commandement a measure because of the two commandements the one is great the other is but like vnto it
hauing the last lords day opened the order it followeth that this day the measure be opened vnto you
for entrance hereunto wee must take these two rules first though charitie bee a common due to god and our neighbour yet must they not both bee serued by the same measure and why the persons are vnequall god is infinite our neighbour is finite and wee may not dispense equall portions to vnequall persons
the second rule is that the order layeth the foundation of the measure and therefore is the order correspondent vnto the measure hee that hath the praecedencie in must haue the praeheminence of our charity and whom wee must loue last wee must loue least
god is first in order therefore must hee haue the greatest measure thou must loue him with all thy heart all thy minde thy neighbour is but second therefore hee must haue a lesser measure thou must loue him as thy selfe
the time will not suffice me so farre as is meete to handle both these measures wherefore will confine my paines to the former and that is exprest in these words all thy heart minde soule
if wee must loue the lord our god with all these then wee must loue him perfectly but that perfection is no other then the perfection of a man for thou must loue him with heart mind and soule so that we haue two points to handle first the perfection of that loue wherewith wee must loue the lord our god secondly the degree of that perfection wherhence will arise a third point and that is the iust reason why this first commandement is called great
begin with the perfection
in the question of vertue diuines require a double perfection one partium the other graduum there is a perfection of the parts in man which must bee seasoned with the virtue and the vertue in those parts must arise vnto it's full pitch
this text requireth both these perfections in charitie the perfection of the parts of man are intimated in the enumeration of the heart minde soule strength vnto these all our inward and outward abilities may bee reduced so that there is no power nor part of man that must not bee qualified with the loue of god

but of this perfection haue spoken when shewed you the seat of loue made it plaine vnto you that there was to be in our charitie a perfection of parts that with which wee haue now to doe is the perfection of degrees the text will tell vs that it is not enough for euery of those parts to haue the loue of god in them they must also be wholy taken vp therewith and this perfection is noted by the word all which is added to heart minde soule strength
let vs come then to it

a commandement is the sooner admitted if the reasonablenesse of the ground thereof be first discouered will therefore first discouer the ground vpon the reasonablesse whereof this great measure is required
the ground is twofold there is one in god and another in vs
the ground that is found in god is taken from the preface of this text as moses hath deliuered it and saint marke hath repeated it the preface is hearken israel the lord thy god is but one but one therefore the intire obiect of our loue he will not giue this his glorie vnto any other neither will he indure any corriuall herein the beginning the middle and the end of this obiect is only he that is alpha and omega first and last
had we many then might wee haue many obiects of our loue the obiect can no more bee multipliced then he can
take all the parts of his title asunder and you shall sind onenes and intirenes therein
he is first called lord which importeth the fountaine of being and goodnesse which doth accompanie the same
now there is no other fountaine but he for as he is that which he is so are are all things of him yea and in him also no one shareth with him herein

as he is the only fountaine of being of all being so is he of goodnesse

of whatsoeuer thing is good
our sauiour telleth vs there is none good but he and moses that all which he made and he made all was exceeding good

euery good and perfect gift commeth from him and if from him then it is in him be it honestum iucundum or vtile so that we can seeke nothing without him

which wee may not find in him and find it much more eminently

neither can we forsake any thing for him but in hauing him wee shall haue more then an abundant amends for as he is one so he is all

all good is contained in this one lord bonorum totum totaliter diligendum wee can doe no lesse then bee wholy his that doth vouchsafe to be wholy ours

as for the name god which told you importeth the three persons what euery one is called that he is only and graciously
call no man father on earth saith christ for you haue but one father euen your father which is in heauen

and he is a most louing father no such tender bowels to bee found no not in most naturall and indulgent parents

as for the second person which is god the sonne he is vnicus vnicè dilectus an only sonne only begotten most dearely beloued we can find no meanes of our being adopted being accepted but in him and by him
iesus is not diuided how often doth hee proclaime it in isay beside mee there is no sauiour

neither is christ diuided he is the only

prophet that can acquaint vs with the counsels of god the only priest whose sacrifice can pacifie god finally the only king that can subdue all the enemies of the church and make it partaker of his kingdome

neither is the third person lesse vnus omnia the apostle telleth vs that there is but one spirit and he deriueth all graces from him

be they graces of adoption or graces of edification hee worketh all and hee workes in all he is our leader our comforter our sanctifier our supporter

ours say for which is the last note in the name whether it bee lord or god that is one they are that which they are vnto vs vnto vs haue they appropriated their onenesse for they are to no other what they are to the church and the church as heretofore haue told you is meant by thou and to the church they communicate their all all the treasures of their common and seuerall good so farre as the church is capable thereof
suppose that if you haue well heeded what haue said you will acknowledge that there is a faire ground in the lord our god why hee should challenge all our loue
let vs come now and looke vpon our selues and see what ground thereof we can find there
when the question was moued vnto christ whether the iewes ought to pay tribute vnto caesar or not hee called for the coine and asked whose image and superscription it bare and when they answered him caesars he replyed giue vnto caesar those things which are caesars but he addeth to our purpose that vpon the same ground they must giue vnto god those things which are gods if the image and superscription were a iust ground why coine should be paid vnto caesar where gods image is found there is as good a reason that that should be rendred vnto him
now gods image is found in vs by nature for we were made according to his image so that all which we receiue from him we owe vnto him by the law of creation
a second way is gods image in vs by grace for our regeneration is but a second creation wherein we are reformed vnto that image according to which god at first created vs
all then is due vnto god a second time by the law of our redemption so that whether we looke vpon our heart our minde our soule or strength it may well be demanded of vs quid habes quod non accepisti what hast thou which thou hast not receiued and if we haue receiued it all the exaction is but reasonable si totum exigit te qui totum fecit refecit te surely saint paul thought so when he willeth the corinthians to glorifie god with their bodies and with their soules hee addeth this reason for they are gods
well then wee haue found faire grounds of this measure for if god be such and such to vs as you haue heard the only louely thing and all that can be beloued and we are all his and all that we haue is due vnto him both by nature and by grace then ought wee with all to expresse our loue towards him

but what is it to loue him with all surely it is to loue him sine

diuisione sine remissione none of our abilities must bee diuided none of them must be slacke in doing of this worke
first of the diuision

we must not diuide our heart that is as the scripture speaketh haue a heart and a heart a heart for god and a heart for the world will that which god willeth and fulfill the will of his enemies also as if we would keepe good correspondencie with both we must alwayes will the same thing and our will must conforme it selfe only vnto gods if it doe not we doe not loue god with all our heart because our heart is diuided
as our heart must not bee diuided no more must our minde wee must not bee undefined span alphabet double minded vnstable in our resolution wee must not be undefined span alphabet like meteors hanging in the ayre betweene heauen and earth or as elias told the israelites halt betweene two betweene god and baal make all religions indifferent and thinke that we may aswell partake of the table of deuils as of the table of the lord and like waues of the sea be tossed vp and downe with euery blast of vaine doctrine but wee must captiuate our wits wholy vnto gods wisdome and bee so resolute in abiding by his truth that if an angell from heauen should bring vs any other doctrine then that which we haue receiued from god that angell must bee accursed
if our faith in god bee not so fixt our minde is diuided wee doe not loue god with all our minde
as we must take care that these reasonable faculties be not diuided so must we take care also of the vnreasonable of our soule that is the concupiscible facultie
told you that hath two works the one to long after that which we would haue the other to delight in it when we haue it neither of these should bee diuided and why they must both attend the will we may not long for that which we may not will neither may we delight in that for which we may not long
if wee long for more things then we doe will non benè currimus we take not the right way to blisse we fall into and if we delight in more then wee should long for non benè quiescimus wee take vp our rest where we shall find no rest we haue a diuided soule wee doe not loue god with all our soule as we should

the other vnreasonable facultie is noted by our strength they call it the irascible facultie and it is that courage wherewith we encounter those difficulties which either crosse our longings or interrupt our delighting this must not be diuided for this must attend the soule the longing the delighting thereof it must bend all its force to further that that so it may be both constant in longing and perseuerant in delighting
it must not be like metius suffetius that wicked neutrall looke on and be readie to fauour the strongest side much lesse must it take part with the aduerse if our courage be thus diuided wee doe not loue god with all our strength for we should imitate king dauid to whom the scripture beareth witnesse that when hee offered he offered to god with all his strength

and so did he with all his strength

daunce before the arke whatsoeuer abilitie we haue we should imploy it to the best aduancement of the loue of god

you haue heard the first impediment of louing god with all our heart
told you of another which is remisnesse or slacknesse and this followeth necessarily vpon the other for as a riuer that runneth strong in one channell will haue a more weake current if it bee diuided vpon that principle vis vnita fortior so fareth it with our abilitie pluribus intentus minor est ad singula sensus a man cannot diuide and intend either his heart or his mind or his soule or his strength as he ought
touching this remisnesse in the seruice and loue of god take a similitude from musicke he that playeth vpon an instrument may strike euerie string doe it negligently or weakely

and so impaire much of the sweetnesse of the musicke therefore in the psalmes those leuites that were the musitians are called vpon not onely to sing and to play but to sing lustily and with a good courage and to praise god vpon the loud cymbals and vpon the high sounding cymbals
hath god care of instruments speaketh he not it rather for our soules to intimate their deuotion to god

surely king dauid thought so when he said awake harpe and lute my selfe will awake right early and doth not more often call vpon his instrument then vpon himselfe to praise and serue god praise the lord my soule and all that is within me praise his holy name so that it is not enough to giue euerie part vnto god except euerie part do its best to loue

might carie you through all the parts and shew you what is the remisnesse of them of the heart which is a or a of the mind which is a wauing doubtfulnesse of the soule if the longing be faint and the delighting haue in it acediam or a loathing of the strength if it sinke or shrinke
if any of our abilities bee thus impaired then is there a remisnesse in them which hindreth our louing god with all our heart
but chuse rather to point it out in a generalitie by two markes one of which the scripture setteth vpon the thing beloued the other vpon true louers
the thing beloued is said to be sweeter then honie and the more to be desired then gold then much sine gold more precious then pearles and most costly stones finally nothing desireable is comparable to it if wee doe not conceiue so of the obiect of loue the lord our god there is apparent remisnesse in our loue

the marke set vpon the true louers is

they compare themselues to parcht ground which gapeth after the raine to a chased hart that brayeth after the water brookes to those which are if we find not such a passion in our selues then is there likewise a remisnesse in our loue

that which was the commendation of the macedonians must be affected by all christians in the loue of god the abundance of their ioy and their deepe pouertie abounded to the riches of their liberalitie for to their power beare them record saith saint paul and beyond their power were they willing of themselues such must be our disposition

the rather because all diuision of our abilities is a plaine abandoning of the loue of god for no man can serue two masters as christ telleth vs

if he loue the one he will hate the other two loues if one be good and the other bad

cannot stand together
take an example or two
the sonnes of god that is those that did loue god fell in loue with the daughters of men what issue had they giants undefined span alphabet such as fought against god
the samaritans worshipped both the god of israel and the assyrians idols and they were the most deadly enemies of ierusalem neuer haue you seene an hereticke that is a person that professeth partly the truth and partly errour but he turneth a bloudy persecutor of the truth and he that loueth god and the world out of his loue to the world will doe the greatest dishonour hee can to god
this is the reason why god will haue all or none ananias and saphira were stricken with suddaine death for a part of that whole substance which they freely vowed to god and which had it not beene for their vow they might haue disposed at their pleasure and if the embeseling of so small a matter due vpon no other ground then vpon a free vow receiued so a doome of how much sorer punishment shal we be worthy if we our better things which vpon a more necessarie vow are due vnto god

as for the remisnesse that also is followed with a curse for cursed is he that doth the worke of the lord negligently

and christ will spue out of his mouth all those that are but luke warme that are neither hot nor cold god loueth none but zealously cheerefull louers and lesse then an entire dedication of all our faculties will not please him

but mistake not all other things besides god are not excluded from our loue if they were how should we loue our neighbour whom notwithstanding in this text wee are commanded to loue
wherefore for the farther vnderstanding of this intirenesse of our loue of god wee must not take other things oppositè but compositè we must exclude nothing from our loue that doth not enter into competition with god and oppose it selfe against the loue of god
secondly if there bee any thing that may be beloued ioyntly with god it must not be taken as coordinatum but subordinatum it must not share equally with god but keepe its distance and receiue our loue by a reflexion from god
excellent is that which saint austine hath to this purpose totum quicquid aliud diligendum venerit in mentem illuc rapiatur quo totius dilectionis impetus currit and minus te amat domine qui tecum aliquid amat quod propter te non amat
thirdly vpon this inequalitie must our loue ground an vnequall estimate of things and we must loue god aboue all appretiatiuè we must account all in comparison of god to be but as dung to be verie losse

finally according to the estimate must the heat of our affection bee wee must loue god aboue all intensiuè also wee must loue other things as fit to be vsed not fit to be enioyed yea we must vse all the world as if we vsed it not but we must loue god as him whome wee would not onely vse but enioy also yea so enioy that we may bee able to say with king dauid

whom haue in heauen but thee and there is none on earth that desire with thee
my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength

of my heart and my portion for euer when wee attaine hereunto though wee loue other things beside god yet wee loue god as wee ought for we will as salomon biddeth vs thinke vpon him in all our wayes

but may not forget that though seeme to haue said much of our loue of god yet there is a limitation exprest in the text though all bee required yet no other all then that which can bee performed by man for it is all thy heart thy minde thy strength wee may not expect that wee should bee able to loue god according to his owne worth but wee must loue him to the vttermost of our power onely god can loue god as hee is worthie so the father loueth the sonne the sonne the father and the holy ghost both but a finite creature can haue but a finite vertue which can beare no proportion vnto god who is infinite as also is his goodnesse which is all one with himselfe
this serueth to checke all pride which thinketh that by louing it can demerit god well may hee vouchsafe to accept our poore endeauors but the best come short of deseruing ought at gods hands especially when the heart minde though they bee called ours yet are they nothing but his gifts as before you haue heard and so are all their endowments namely this of loue
and if wee cannot merit by loue much lesse can wee supererogate in louing for who can giue god more then is due that learneth by this text that all is due vnto god praetererogate haply we may in some indifferent thing which god leaueth to our choyce although that choyce also must bee guided by the generall end whereat all our actions must ayme and the abilitie which wee haue receiued of god whereof if we imploy not the one to the other well may god bee indulgent to our weaknesse in choosing certainly it deserueth no commendation
but as for the act of louing so farre is it off that wee can supererogate any thing that wee cannot so much as praetererogate a iot therein
haue opened the measure wherewith wee must loue the lord our god the perfection the degree thereof but doubt haue not done it so popularly and plainly as that euery one doth conceiue mee and can try his owne loue by that which hee hath heard and discerne when it is come to this straine will therefore propose from the mouth of our sauiour christ certaine plaine rules which are for the capacitie of the meanest hearer which if he apply vnto himselfe he may thereby guesse at the pitch of his loue

the first is he that loueth father mother wife children

more then me is not worthy of me
the second hee that forsaketh not father mother wife children
the third hee that hateth not father mother wife children hee cannot be my disciple
there bee many things and persons as you heard before which we are allowed to loue but we must loue them onely vntill they come vnto the comparison if then the question be whether of the two wee loue more to whether of them wee will sticke in a case where both cannot bee held or vpon which of them wee will fall foule when it is not possible for vs to keepe in with both if then wee can with moses esteeme the reproach of christ greater riches then the treasures

of egypt wee conforme our selues to christs first rule

if when god calleth

wee can with abraham forsake our countrey and our fathers house though it bee to goe to a countrey which wee know not wee conforme our selues vnto his second rule
and if we can bee as resolute as leui was

who said vnto his father and his mother haue not seene them neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor know his owne children that he might keepe the word and obserue the commandement of god euen that commandement which is deliuered

if thy brother the sonne of thy mother or thy sonne or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosome or thy friend which is as thine owne soule entice thee to idolatry thy eye must not pitty him thou must not conceale him thou shalt surely kill him and let thine owne hands be first vpon him if thou canst say bee so resolute then doest thou conforme thy selfe vnto christs third rule

the examples which hitherto haue alleaged shew onely what must be a christian mans obseruance of christs rules quoad sua suos so farre as concernes a mans goods or his friends but christs rules goe a step farther

for they mention a mans owne life also and tell vs how little wee must set by that in comparison of our loue of god
christ knew well that satan hath a shrewd temptation to stumble thee when thou hast profited so farre as tua and tuos and that is to trie thee how well thou dost loue god quoad te

in comparison of thine owne person skin for skin and all that euer a man hath will he giue for his life affinitie consanguinitie amitie farewell all so our life may bee preserued but our loue of god must ouercome this temptation also and wee must take in this case saint paul for an example who being disswaded from going to hierusalem because bonds and imprisonment did expect him there made this answere what doe you weeping and breaking my heart

am contented not onely to be bound but also to die for the name of the lord iesus

a great resolution and yet not so great as our loue of god requireth of vs
for though dying seeme to be a bitter work yet to die for the name of christ addeth much sweetnes vnto it and why it maketh a plain martyrdome and of that paul hath giuen this definition that it is nothing else but dissolut esse cum christo to be dissolued doth litle content nature but what would a man rather desire then to be with christ for to be with him is to be as he is that is most happy so that hitherto loue is not come to its height for a man may so far loue god and loue god for himselfe because his own good goeth pari passu with the loue of god moses went farther blot me out of the book of life rather then thou shouldst not make good thy word to israel a strange wish and that of a thing impossible for it is impossible that any child of god should be excluded from eternal life so that he may seeme to haue wished rashly and vainly but this co~mandement wil excuse him as it will pauls like wish when come to speak of the loue of our neighbour this commandement containeth the best commentary on his words for they import no more but his absolute loue of god so absolute that were there no heauen where with his loue should be rewarded yea though hell were the place wherein notwithstanding his loue of god he should be eternally tormented yet would he not withhold gods due he would loue god with all his heart

and indeed so high must wee ascend in loue if wee will ascend to that pitch which is contained in this commandement though our loue shall haue a reward a most plentifull reward and wee may after the example of christ and the saints looke vpon it and encourage our selues with the hope of it yet that must not be the first motiue of our dutie god may challenge it without a reward and wee must acknowledge it to be a iust debt
thus if we loue god we loue him as we ought that is we loue him aboue all things and wee loue him for himselfe for that must needs follow when wee loue him for no other thing no not for our owne sakes but are willing to hazard all euen our selues and all for the loue of him
from this measure when wee depart wee doe offend against our loue of god how much more if wee loue those things which are contrarie to him and can bee contented that others offend him or are so gracelesse as to offend him our selues

but must draw toward an end
the last point which obserued in my text was the reason why this is called the great commandement
need giue you no other reason then the doctrine which you haue heard concerning our loue of god for you haue heard enough to perswade you that the commandement is very great yet will point at some few reasons

the commandement then is great first in regard of the obiect for what can be greater then the lord our god secondly in regard of the act for it maketh our neerest approach vnto god both in vnion and communion with him
thirdly in regard of the qualitie it is the sweetest commander of all our abilities
fourthly in regard of the soueraigntie it giueth law to the whole man
fiftly in regard of the efficacie it worketh the greatest effects
sixtly in regard of the commoditie it hath the most precious promises
finally in regard of the continuance it all other graces for charitie neuer faileth

other graces doe not this mortall life no wonder then if call it a supereminent way and in a comparison preferreth it before all gifts not only of edification but of adoption also

and what is the vse of all this but to make vs see how little wee performe of this commandement and how little cause wee haue to boast of the best that we doe therein
who is he that can denie that his are diuided and that he loueth more things then god yea most things more then god and those not only idle but euill things also

and if wee cannot excuse our diuision much lesse our remissenesse the dayes are come which christ foretold and the charitie euen of the church is growne yea euery one is come to that lithernesse which god taxeth in malachi yee say behold what a wearinesse it is

whether our loue bee put to doe or to suffer it is quickly tired it quickly giueth ouer and how should he euer yeeld all that doth repine if but a part of his heart minde soule or strength be imployed

in the loue of god report mee for the truth hereof to euery mans conscience and because the time biddeth me end desire euerie man to keepe a scrutinie hereof in his owne bosome

domine imperfectum nostrum vident oculi tui vtinam nos videamus lord thou that searehest and triest vs knowest how little loue of thee there is in the best of vs kindle this heauenly fire in all our hearts and let the flame thereof take all the powers of our soules and parts of our bodies
and seeing it is not prayse worthy barely to loue thee cast vs into a spirituall trance that being strangers vnto all things of this life wee may with indefatigable constancie aspire vnto thee

be restlesse till wee are fully by loue ioyned vnto thee
yea let vs put off our selues and with a happie alteration bee wholly transformed into the loue of thee or if wee cannot but loue other things besides thee let the loue of them attend our loue of thee the more we loue thee let vs desire to loue thee the more till all on fire like the seraphins who in this loue are said to come neerest vnto thee we may as wee are here enioyned loue thee the great all of holinesse and happinesse with this manifold but meane all of ours all our heart all our minde all our soule and all our strength

the eighth sermon
epigraph

matt
verse
and the second is like vnto it thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe

in bestowing our charitie wee must vse a measure and this measure varies as doe the persons vpon whom we must bestow it they are vnequall therefore they must not bee equally beloued
the text therefore doth assigne vnto each his proportion to god his and his vnto our neighbour
of gods spake last
it followeth that now speake of our neighbours it is exprest in these words that now haue read vnto you
yet doth it not take vp all the verse for that we must loue our neighbour and that the loue of him is the argument of a second commandement haue heretofore shewed you
but there remaine two points vntoucht of which the first is the limitation and the second the comparison of this loue
the limitation is in these words as thy selfe the comparison in these the second commandement is like the first

but to breake it vp somewhat more distinctly will obserue in the limitation that there is one thing implied we must loue our selues and there is another thing exprest the loue of our selues must guide vs in the loue of our neighbour
so likewise in the comparison will shew you first that there is no equalitie because the commandements are but like and yet notwithstanding because they are like they haue a good correspondencie the second to the first

these bee the particulars which meane god willing to open vnto you briefely and in their order pray god may doe it so effectually that we may all learne to keepe our neighbourly charitie within the prescribed bounds and so loue one another that our mutuall loue may testifie to the world that we all haue the loue of god
come now to the limitation
whereof before open the particulars cannot omit to touch at a good obseruation of saint basils hee tels vs that the loue of god is not undefined span alphabet exclusiue of all others but it admits the loue of others as undefined span alphabet as helping to fill vp the the measure thereof so that it haue dependencie thereon
before you heard that we must loue god with all our heart mind soule and strength you would thinke that because god challengeth all no other may partake of our loue but it appeares to be otherwise for that we are here willed to loue our neighbour and our selues
the reconciliation is this all must be deuoted to god but it must be employed as pleaseth him and it pleaseth him that wee bestow it there wheresoeuer hee vouchsafeth to impart himselfe
will shew it you in a plaine similitude
light is the onely obiect of our eye for our eye was made to see the light but light is not onely in the body of the sunne or moone or starres but by beames it doth insinuate it selfe into all these lower creatures and presents it selfe in that great varietie of colours wherewith this lower world is beautified in seeing them wee see the light and delighting in them we take pleasure in the light from whom they haue their gracefulnesse euen so god is the proper obiect of our loue and his goodnesse must draw our abilities vnto it and it is able to satisfie them to the fall though they to the full can neuer possibly comprehend it so that out of the nature of god wee need not seeke for any other obiect of our loue
but because god is pleased to communicate himselfe vnto his creatures and frame the reasonable of them according to his image he would haue our loue to attend this communicating of himselfe and be bestowed on them whom he doth so grace
and this our so louing of others detracts nothing from that all which is due vnto god because we doe it by his direction and our loue doth still reflect vpon him and in louing them we loue him as you shall heare an on more at large

but let vs come to the particulars whereof the first is that which is implyed in the limitation and that is the loue of our selues for if we must loue our neighbour as our selues then vndoubtedly wee must loue our selues
it might haue beene thought that christ in setting downe the obiect of our loue had left vs cleane out as if wee were not to loue our selues but that we may yea must loue our selues it is cleare because

the loue of our selues is made the measure of that loue which wee must yeeld to our neighbours

though this be cleare yet is there a great difficultie in the commandement meane not of practise though that will appeare hard to flesh and bloud when it is expounded but of vnderstanding it for how doth christ command vs to loue our neighbour as our selfe whereas how we must loue our selues he seemeth not to teach at all

he seemeth not and indeed some thinke that he doth not
and why a man is taught by nature wherein and how to loue himselfe nature hath taught vs to wish and procure our selues all good at least whatsoeuer we thinke to bee good and whatsoeuer we thinke to be euill euill vnto vs

that we abhorre and resist there is no indulgence that may pittie our infirmities no beneficencie that may supplie our wants which out of loue of our selues we doe not naturally desire as also condoling and congratulating of our woe and weale
yea naturall reason if it haue not lost reason hath taught men to distinguish bona animi bona corporis and bona fortunae and giue them their due precedencies and answerable estimates in our desires our soule is more precious vnto reason then our body and our body then our goods and we are in reason affected with the or of euery of these according to its price

neither doth nature teach vs onely to loue things which concerne vs it teacheth vs also the manner of our loue

for it teacheth vs to loue our selues in regard of these things
first sincerely there is no hypocrisie in natural loue

this loue is without dissimulation
secondly really we loue not our selues only in words but in deeds also
thirdly tenderly we are verie feeling of our owne weale and woe
fourthly constantly no difficulties or crosses can make vs weary of louing our selues
this being our inborne loue some thinke that it is supposed by christ and according to this supposition made the measure of that loue which wee owe to our neighbour so that the commentarie vpon these words as thy selfe is made by christ in another place

that which you would that men should doe vnto you doe you vnto them

wherunto you may adde tobies negatiue
doe not my sonne to another that which thou wouldest not indure by another should be done vnto thee
christs meaning is that before we resolue how to carie our selues towards our neighbour we must suppose him to be in our case and our selues in his and then thinke with what measure we would haue him to measure to vs and mete the same to him

if the iudge that sitteth vpon the ench the that deales with his tenant the tradesman that venteth his commodities finally euerie man that dealeth with another did square his carriage by this rule there would be much lesse wrong in societie and much more comfort in mens consciences for pulcher liber cor tuum euerie man beareth in his owne bosome a faire table engrauen legibly by the finger of nature wherein if he would read hee might learne without any other helpe what vsage is fit for his neighbour
and if men were as prompt schollers in learning actiue charitie that is the charitie which they must shew to others as they are acute doctors and teachers of the passiue of that

charitie which they expect from others the moralists and casuists might saue much of their paines in discoursing and determining of our mutuall duties

but undefined span alphabet or the corrupt loue of our selues which spends our affection inordinately and maketh it vnworthy to be accounted the naturall loue of a mans selfe because it is more brutish then reasonable doth make vs oftentimes to loue indeed our neighbour as our selues but such a loue of our selues is too base to be the measure wherewith we ought to loue our neighbour
yet is there too much of such mutuall loue in the world such is the loue of all those that fall in their desires and delights below the condition of men yea some so low that they may be consorts for the deuill
if philautie or corrupt loue grow not so base yet may it grow insolent and men may appropriate themselues to themselues as if none were worthy of their loue and therefore they are all for themselues and not caring if all the world mourne so they reioyce or be in want so they haue their fill forgetting that naturall principle that homo is animal politicum a sociable creature and though undefined span alphabet in proprietie we are our owne and so are our goods yet undefined span alphabet in regard of the vse of our selues and our goods both are ours for the comfort of others and they should be as deare to vs as we would haue our selues deare vnto them were they in our case
but this taketh not away the distinction that is betweene them
before you heard how many wayes a man might be a neighbour a neighbour only in place or in bloud or in the common nature whereof we all partake or in societie either priuate of friendship wherein likenesse of disposition doth linke vs or publique either ciuill or ecclesiasticall
we must clothe euery one of these with his due circumstances and as occasion offers vs to haue to doe with any of these we must personate them vnto our selues and looke what we may iustly challenge if we were in their case by the rules of moralitie that must we offer to euery one of them be he only a man or also a kinsman an inward friend or fellow member of the church or common weale finally bee hee a superiour or inferiour vnto vs
and this is indeed to loue our neighbour as our selues and for want of making this supposition the rule of our resolution what we would not willingly endure we offer with great eagernesse to others and withhold from them what we thinke cannot without iniurie be denied vnto vs which is the more blameable in christians because that rule whatsoeuer you would that men should doe vnto you doe the same vnto them not only preached but practised made christianitie venerable in the eyes of alexander seuerus an heathen emperour who acknowledged this apothegme quod tibi fieri non vis altori ne feceris learned from christians and squared his iudgement by it

this sense of the limitation of the loue of our neighbours is a good sense and it were to bee wisht that at least so much were entertained by

the world it would set much right that is awry
but hold there is much more meant in the text then so for that supposition riseth no higher then the state of nature
my text belongeth also to them that are in the state of grace

wherefore obserue that though christ seeme not to teach how we ought to loue our selues yet indeed he doth for the loue of our selues is inwrapt in our loue of god though god call for the dutie as respecting himselfe yet in doing what we are bid we benefit our selues it is the true loue of our selues
for what loue doth a man owe vnto himselfe but the loue of his perfection and what is his perfection but the loue of god

goe ouer the parts god will haue imployed in this worke
the first is our minde or our vnderstanding what greater perfection can that haue then the knowledge of our soueraigne good this is life euerlasting saith christ to know thee the only true god

and whom thou hast sent iesus christ

the second is our heart and what greater perfection can that haue then to entertaine god

if any man loue me saith christ my father will loue him and we will come vnto him and make our abode with him and where gods and christs abode is there is the kingdome of heauen euen righteousnesse peace and ioy of the holy ghost

the third is the soule and whether doth the desire thereof runne but vnto god

and where will it rest but only in him my soule longeth euen fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crieth out for the liuing god blessed are they that dwell in thy house
the sensitiue soule that is on attendant vpon the will what greater happinesse can it haue then to feed vpon the crummes that fall from that table where god suppeth in the reasonable soule of man whereat nothing is serued but the bread the water the fruit the foode of life

the last abilitie is our strength

and blessed is the man whose strength is in thee lord they goe from strength to strength but whither

that euery one may appeare before god in sion
dauid therefore had rather be a doore keeper in gods house then to dwell in the tents of vngodlinesse and he giueth the reason for god giueth good wages to his seruants

the lord is a sunne and a shield hee will giue grace and glorie and no good thing will he withhold from them that walke vprightly
yea whereas in the seruice of others we cannot vse our strength but we weare it out
it is not so in the seruice of god hee satisfieth thy mouth with good things

so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles euen the youthes shall faint and be wearie and the young men shall vtterly fall but they that wait vpon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount vp their wings as eagles they shall runne and not be wearie and they shall walke and not faint
isay
the longer a man serueth god the more able he will be to serue him

so then that a man may loue himselfe he must loue god and hee

that doth not loue god cannot loue himselfe because by loue he hath communion with god wherein standeth his happinesse and of this happinesse he doth defraud himselfe so farre as he commeth short in his loue of god

and indeed this is no small difference betweene god and the diuell
the diuell in shew biddeth vs loue our selues doe all for our selues and wee are so simple as to beleeue him and thinke that we doe so whereas the euent proues we doe all for him and to our owne ruine for he is the plaine image of vsurers who liue by the sweate of other mens browes and cunningly grow rich by vndoing others with a seeming reliefe
but as for god his precepts bid vs renounce our selues giue our selues wholly vnto him but in the conclusion hee hath nothing we haue all
according to the answere which the father of the prodigall made to his murmuring eldest sonne who expostulated thus with him loc these many yeeres doe serue thee neither transgressed at any time thy commandements and yet thou neuer gauest me a kid that might make merrie with my friends sonne said the father thou art euer with me and all that haue is thine
much more is this true of our heauenly father who doth not desire to keepe vs busily and well employed for his owne thrift but for ours it is for our comfort and not for his owne
be not sad therefore christian soule if he that made thee wholy will so wholy be beloued of thee as if he had left thee nothing wherewith to sollace by selfe for thou dost neuer loue thy selfe better neither euer shalt thou take greater content in thy selfe then when thou louest god with all thy heart with all thy soule with all thy mind and with all thy strength
thus at length we haue found out the second measure the measure of that loue of our neighbour which is prescribed by grace a man is here bid by louing god to loue himselfe that so louing himselfe he may know how to loue his neighbour
because he that doth not loue god cannot loue himselfe and so by consequent cannot loue his neighbour loue being so sanctified it is true which the schooles haue regula est prius regulato se prius quis diligere debet quam proximum

seeing then such is the measure wherewith wee must loue our selues we must keepe the loue of our neighbour within the bounds of the loue of god
we must loue in him the loue of god if he haue it

mine eyes saith dauid are vpon such as are faithfull in the land my delight is in thy saints and such as excell in vertue and describing a man that shall dwell in gods tabernacle and ascend into his holy hill he saith

that it is he in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but hee honoureth them that feare the lord
when one told christ that his mother and brethren stood without desiring to speake with him he answered and said to him that told it who is my mother and who are my brethren and stretch out his hand towards his disciples saying behold my mother and my brethren for whosoeuer shall doe the will of my father which is in heauen he is my brother my sister and my mother

if wee cannot loue our neighbour for that he is not yet seasoned with the loue of god wee must loue him that hee may be so seasoned for so

did christ loue man not for that hee was but for that hee might bee the son of god

and heyre of heauen as himselfe was
and saint paul when vpon a sermon agrippa told him thou hast almost perswaded me to bee a christian would saith hee that not onely thou but also all that heare me this day

were both almost and altogether such as am excepting these bonds
and saint iohn that which wee haue seene and heard declare wee vnto you that ye also may haue fellowship with vs and our fellowship may be with the father and with his sonne iesus christ
for this cause would not saint paul haue the beleiuing wife forsake the belieuing husband
cor
and christ so loues his spouse because all faire in the canticles

you see then that if we loue our neighbour wee must loue him propter deum in regard of the loue of god
and why because you must not loue your selues otherwise

whereupon saint austin giueth this good note siteipsum non propter teipsum diligere debes sed propter deum non succenseat homo sieum diligas propter deum if make the loue of god the onely reason why loue my neighbour my neighbour hath no cause to bee offended with me because must make it the onely reason why must loue my selfe

and this will lead vs to another note christ saith that wee must loue our neighbour as our selfe but not for our selfe that were amor concupiscentiae but ours must bee amor amicitiae hee that loueth for himselfe ceaseth to loue

if he cannot and when he doth not speed of his owne benefit but hee that can say with saint paul quaero vos non vestra will say with him

will loue you though the more loue the lesse am beloued
such loue is a stable loue like that of booz towards ruth whereof naomi said the man will not be at rest vntill he hath finished the matter

but yet obserue that though a man must loue his neighbour rather for his neighbours sake then for his owne that loueth him yet must hee not doe it so much for his neighbours sake as for gods towards whom hee must bend all his neighbours loue as being the vpshot of humane felicitie
this which haue obserued in thesi or in generall concerning our neighbour must bee applyed in hypothesi and fitted to euery degree of neighbours
though they be knit together by naturall or ciuill obligations which yeeld reason of lower degrees of loue yet must not christians rest there they must improue their loue vntil they haue brought it as high as this measure of grace parents loue their children gouernours those that are commited to their charge citizens friends loue each the other but whatsoeuer else causeth this loue wee loue them not as our selues except first hauing qualified our selues with the loue of god we qualifie them therewith also

it is a question whether as bee a note of similitude or equality so that it is enough to loue our neighbour with such a loue as wee loue our selues though not with so great
a needlesse question if christs words bee vnderstood as haue opened them
if you take them in the first sense as the measure of our mutuall loue is dictated by the light of nature there can be no doubt but the measure must be equall for how can suppose

my selfe in another mans state and him in mine and in reason deale any iot worse with him then would haue him leale with me if the case were altered to scant the measure if it were but in the least graine is plaine philautie or corrupt loue of a mans selfe

take the measure in that sense which is dictated by grace and that will admit no inequalitie of loue for should loue the loue of god in any man lesse then doe in my selfe that would sauour of enuy at the least if not implerie for should haue an euill eye when god is good yea should not as ought take comfort in the highest aduancement of the honour of god
the scripture teacheth vs to doe farre otherwise a new commandement giue vnto you saith christ that you loue one another as haue loued you that you also loue one another

now you know how christ loued vs and gaue himselfe for vs forgetting as it were all the content that hee tooke in his owne holines and happines that he might promote ours
saint iohn applies it to vs

hereby perceiue we the loue of god because hee laid downe his life for vs and we ought to lay downe our liues for the brethren
take an instance in saint paul

if be offered vpon the sacrifice and seruice of your faith that is in working and increasing it ioy and reioyce with you all for the same cause also doe you ioy and reioyce with mee
or if this instance doe not satisfie because that saint pauls death which hee wished was a martyrdome and though hee preferred the loue of the brethren before his corporall life yet therein he manifested the greater loue to god for higher in his loue to god during this life a man cannot ascend then willingly to bee a martyr to to seale gods truth with his bloud and confirme the faith of the church

paul hath another of a higher straine concerning the loue of our neighbour which be vtterth with a sad preface testifying that hee is earnest and well aduised
say the truth in christ lie not my conscience also bearing me witnesse in the holy ghost that haue great heauines and continuall sorrow in my heart for could wish that my selfe were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh diuine brotherly loue how dost thou transport the apostle to whom hell is not terrible nor the losse of heauen grieuous so the israelites might escape the one and obtaine the other
and did hee not then loue them more then himselfe

but might hee doe it and may wee imitate him herein surely hee might without any offence to god testifie his wish because hee doth not contradict gods decree which will not haue holinesse vnhappie but supposing there were a posibility that a man hauing no sinne might bee subiected to those torments hee meanes that he could be contented to vndergoe euen the torments of hell so the israelites might haue the grace to belieue in christ and to haue such a minde is no sinne but it bringeth charitie to the highest pitch to which it can possibly be raised in a creature
neither is there any reason why we may not imitate him herein seeing what was vertuous in him cannot be vicious in another man

but indeed it is not to bee expected that our charitie will euer fall into so heauenly an ecstasis it is well if we come so farre as to loue our neighbour

as our selfe although it is not improbably obserud by some vpon those passages which before cited out of saint iohn that the law which biddeth vs loue our neighbour as our selfe could not teach perfect charity because the iewes being vnder age were not capable of so profound a doctrine and therefore christ vnder the new testament goeth farther with the church being of ripe age and would haue christians loue their neighbours more then themselves this is a new or euangelicall sicut

which being true aquinas his conceipt followed by many romanists must needs be false who teacheth that it is against nature moralitie and charitie for a man to loue his neighbour more then himselfe except happily wee will distinguish betweene the inward affection and the outward action of charitie the inward affection must be equall to all at least as great as to our selues but in outward action because it is impossible for vs to doe this good vnto all we must dispense it as farre as our abilitie will reach proportioning our indeauour according to the number and strictnesse of obligations whereby wee stand bound to persons for so is pauls rule

while we haue time let vs doe good to all men especially to those that are of the houshold of faith and in this respect wee may loue our selues more then others

but to shut vp this point with some few obseruations
the first is that seeing our loue towards our neighbour must bee such as you haue heard you see how little brotherly and neighbourly charitie there is in the world there bee few that obserue the measure prescribed by nature scarse any dreame of that which is prescribed by grace
secondly you see that the loue of our neighbour must not bee mercinarie as for the most part the worlds is for who is hired to loue himselfe or who seeketh for any other reward of that affection but only the loue of himselfe the loue of our neighbour should be as free yea it should be cloathed with all the properties which before specified first sinceritie secondly realitie thirdly tendernesse and fourthly constancie
thirdly you see that we must not loue our neighbour either in peccato or ad peccatum we must neither cherish any man in sinne neither may we tempt him to commit it
and why we must not so loue our selues qui amat iniquitatem odit animam suam such an affection is not loue but hatred deadly hatred which leadeth vnto eternall death

fourthly and lastly you see that as we must bridle our selues and our lusts least we sinne and afflict our soules if we haue sinned so must wee deale with our neighbor also hold in as many as we can though against their wils to preuent their sinning
and if they haue fallen we may not suffer their wounds to fester though we put them to smart and paine yet must we endeauour their reformation

austins rule is worth our obseruing potest odium blandire charitas saeuire radicem inspice attende verba illa blanditur vt decipiat

haec saeuit vt corrigat let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindnes let him reproue me it shall be a excellent oyle which shall not breake my head christ doth so chastise his church and god those whom he reputes children and not bastards

but enough of the limitation
a word or two of the comparison and so end

told you it is not a comparison of equalitie because this second commandement

is but like the first
and indeed how should there bee equalitie in the loues when there is so much inequalitie in the persons but christ putteth it out of all doubt in the gospell when he telleth vs that we must forsake yea hate father mother brother sister yea euen our owne selues and liues if they come in competition with our loue of christ and the gospell which is all one with the loue of god

though there be no equalitie betweene the loues yet there is a good correspondencie for the second commandement is like the first it floweth from it and beareth the very image of it so like that saint iohn concludeth that he that doth not loue his brother whom hee hath seene

neuer loued god whom he hath not seene
it is the best way to know whether a man be a counterfeit in his obseruance of the first commandement by trying how he keepeth the second

but take notice of three or foure points wherein the likenesse standeth
first in obiecto for a man in his neighbour must loue nothing but god
secondly in subiecto for this loue must take vp all the powers of man as the loue of god did though with a subordination
and it makes the straitest knot straiter then either consanguinitie or affinitie or any other kind of societie

thirdly in fructu a double fruit for it bringeth forth all the duties of the second table as the loue of god did the duties of the first
it bringeth them forth most readily most cheerefully for what will hee sticke at that loues

and it reapeth the very same fruit which the former did which is eternall life
when was an hungred yee fed me saith our sauiour come yee blessed possesse the kingdome

fourthly in duratione it lasteth as long as the other doth that is it is euerlasting for charitie neuer fals away no more then doth the communion of saints

omit other resemblances onely this note concerning both charities that they must be begun in this life

otherwise wee shall neuer haue them in the life to come for it is a fruit of the spirit after this life god giueth not his spirit therefore he giueth not charitie from hence men carrie the spirit and with it charitie in hell there can be no charitie because none carrie the spirit thither

conclude the ecclesiasticall storie reporteth that iohn the euangelist the beloued disciple and chiefe doctor of loue as appeares by his epistles when he grew so old that hee was caried to church and could preach no longer vsed to say nothing at all church meetings to them that came to him but onely filioli diligite inuicem children loue one another children loue one another and being asked why he reiterated it he said quia preceptum domini est sisolum fiat sufficit

there needed no other lesson to keepe all things well
sure am there is no lesson more needfull in these bloudy in these malitious dayes and therefore insteed of a longer conclusion will vse to you and pray god vse it not in vaine a tautalogie or sacred ingemination not much vnlike vnto that of iohn loue your neighbors as your selues loue your neighbors as your selues loue your neighbors as your selues
this grace god graunt vs all for the publike good of christendome and the priuate of euerie societie through iesus christ

the ninth sermon
epigraph

matt
verse
vpon these two depend all the law and the prophets

in our inquiries wee desire to know not only what is true but also vpon what ground we may acknowledge it to be so neither are our doubts fully satisfied except we be informed of both
therefore our sauiour christ that vouchsafed an answere to the pharisees question so answereth that he leaues no place for farther dispute for what he affirmed that hee confirmes he proues soundly that the loue of god and our neighbour so described as you haue heard deserue to bee accounted the great commandement and the proofe is contained in these words that now haue read vnto you
the summe of it is this that which is the briefe of the bible may well goe for the great comandement but the loue of god and our neighbour are such a briefe therefore there is no question but they may iustly challenge that title of preheminence and we must acknowledge what christ saith in saint marke that there are none greater then these
but to open the text a little more fully wee will consider therein first seuerally the parts of the bible which are the law and the prophets and the contents of those parts which are the two commandements of loue
then ioyntly we will see how these contents can be so fully inlarged as to take vp those parts the two commandements all the law and the prophets and those two parts so contracted as not to exceed these contents all the law and the prophets not to exceed the two commandements for the text saith they doe all hang vpon the commandements
these be the particulars which shall now god willing inlarge and apply briefly and in their order

the first is the parts of the bible
when speake of the bible meane the old testament there was no more extant when christ conuersed here on earth the rest was added after his ascension
now you shall find all the bookes of the old testament concluded sometimes vnder one name that is either the law or the law of moses or the prophets and as saint peter speaketh the sure word of the prophets
sometimes the bookes are diuided christ diuideth them two wayes once into three parts the law the prophets the psalmes often into two

in the parable of diues and lazarus luke
they haue moses and the prophets and in his commendations of saint iohn the baptist the law and the prophets prophesied vntill iohn which is also found luke
where it is said that christ taught the two disciples that

were going to emmaus out of the law and the prophets and this diuision so familiar to christ is vsed in this place

am not ignorant that there are many other diuisions collected by the learned out of iewish and christian writers but will not trouble you with them haue shewed you those that are in the new testament and of them will open this vnto you
the first branch is the law
by a law is vnderstood that obligation vnto dutie which is laid by those that haue autoritie vpon reasonable creatures
of lawes there are two sorts that which is called the law of nature and that which is called positiue law
the law of nature was concreated with a reasonable soule and was to be in her the nursery of all kind of vertues or honestie of life it is that which is commonly knowne by the name of the morall law
and the things that are prescribed therein are praecepta quia bona they are commanded because they are good good in their owne nature they are properly called vertues
therefore is this law immutable vndispensable it binds all nations and in all ages

it is true that sinne hath much impaired our knowledge of and obedience to it yet there remayneth enough in the ruines of our nature to make euen infidels vnexcusable at the day of iudgement as saint paul teacheth

the second kind of law is called positiue this is made vpon such things as are in their owne nature indifferent the vse whereof notwithstanding is fit to be ordered by the wisdome of the as is most expedient for the state
now a state doth vndergoe a double consideration of a church and of a common weale therefore the lawes are of two sorts those that concerne the church are called ecclesiasticall and those are called ciuill which concerne the common weale
these lawes containe bona quia praecepta being in their owne nature indifferent they are made vnto those that are subiect to the iurisdiction not indifferent in their vse by reason that that is limited by a law so that although if there were no law a thing indifferent might be done or left vndone might be done this way or that way yet the libertie is taken away when a restraint is laid vpon vs by those that haue authoritie
notwithstanding this kind of law whether ecclesiasticall or ciuill is mutable is dispensable yet so that none can change it none can dispense with it but hee that maketh it according to the rule of the law eius est destruere cuius est construere none can abrogate but he that doth enact except he haue some lawfull superiour
what you haue heard of law is most true of moses law with which we haue now to doe for that is the most exact sampler of all lawes meane lawes of publike gouernments of states for wee haue nothing to doe now with the lawes of arts sciences and of tradesmens corporations

in moses law then you shall find first the law of nature that is in the decalogue or the ten commandements the exactest morall law that euer was penned for neuer did any so strictly as that doth search into man and commend the perfection of vertue vnto him yea command his conformitie vnto it

as for positiue lawes moses hath deliuered both sorts the ecclesiasticall or those that frame the israelites to an outward deuotion beseeming that church in the religious worship of god commonly called the ceremoniall law
besides which he hath also deliuered ciuill lawes such as were fit to order the common weale of the israelites commonly called his politique lawes
though we may not denie that there bee in him some ceremoniall lawes that haue reference to the ciuill policie or the second table of the decalogue and some politique lawes that haue reference to the first table and worship of god
neither may we forget touching positiue lawes that they are all attendant vpon the law of nature the ecclesiasticall or ceremoniall vpon the first table the politique or ciuill attend vpon the second
and let this suffice concerning the first branch the law
the second branch is the prophets

the originall of a prophet amongst the israelites you shall find in moses to haue beene this

when god had deliuered the law by his owne mouth the people were so affrighted with the maiestie of his presence that they desired they might not heare god speake any more thereupon god promised that he would rayse vnto them a prophet of their brethren whom they should heare his office was to supply the defects and defaults of the priest for the priests lips were to preserue knowledge and the people were to aske the law at his mouth moreouer in the difficulties and distresses of the church they were to consult god by the vrim and thummin and deliuer his oracles
but the priests did quickly degenerate they intended principally the beneficiall part of their seruice which were sacrifices as for the doctrinall they cared not much for that
wherefore god raysed vp prophets and by them refresht the peoples memories concerning his lawes and though they had some thing answerable to the vrim and thummin that is they did deliuer diuine oracles yet if you marke them well those oracles doe containe little besides the gracious promises that are made vnto them that obserue the law and serue to encourage them to doe well or the iudgements that are threatned to the transgressors of the law and serue to deterre them from doing euill
although wee may not denie that the corporall blessings and curses were shadowes of spirituall and the temporall of eternall

so then you see that the second part of the bible is but a practicke commentarie vpon the first the prophets vpon the law the prophets apply the law to the peoples liues and pronounce them accordingly

and thus much of the parts of the bible what they are and what

they meane come now to the contents and the contents are the two commandements of loue

but these two commandements may be considered as speciall or as generall commandements
as speciall so they require only the act of loue
as generall so they signifie the habit thereof as it is the nurserie of many other vertuous acts
to make you vnderstand this wee must obserue that a morall vertue hath two acts the one is called actus elicitus or its proper worke the other actus imperatus the worke which is at its command
will shew it you by a familiar similitude
the sunne hath a proper worke which is to shine or giue light vnto the world and it hath a worke of command also for it maketh the earth to bring forth fruit which is done by vertue of an influence of the sunne into the earth euen so loue hath a proper worke which is to bee kindly affected to the person beloued but besides this it hath a worke of command it layeth a charge vpon all the powers and abilities that wee haue to bee seruiceable to him whom wee loue
for example if loue god my loue will command my feet to goe to his house my knees to bow in his presence my mouth to speake of his prayses and to pray vnto him finally whatsoeuer is within me without me belonging to me shall bee deuoted to him and doe nothing that displeaseth him
take a taste of this also in the loue of our neighbour
doe loue him then surely if see him naked will command my wardrobe to clothe him doe see him hungrie and thirstie will command my victuals to feed him and will command my selfe to visit him if hee be sicke or in prison by the command of loue my counsell my countenance my house my purse all shall bee at the command of my neighbour
finally these workes reach vnto not only all vertuous acts but also to the acts of our vocation for they must be seasoned with charitie as appeares in the positiue lawes
when then say that these two commandements are the contents of the bible you must comprehend more vnder them then the proper worke of loue christ meaneth also the other worke the worke of command if both these workes be ioyned together they will make vp the contents of the bible
haue opened vnto you the two maine branches of my text as they are considered seuerally
told you wee must consider them ioyntly also
and here first we are to see how these two commandements can so be inlarged as to bee the contents of the whole bible wee will see it first in regard of the law
the law told you is either naturall or positiue these commandements are the contents of either of them though in a different manner
the truth of this appeares in three points
will shew them in both kinds of law
first in the law of nature

first charitie is the seed of all that kind of law it springeth as naturally

from it as a spreading tree doth from his root witnesse the ten commandements which told you are the exactest draught that euer was made of the law of nature there is neuer a branch of the first table that doth not arise from the loue of god we will haue no other gods because we loue god intirely wee will make no images because we loue god holily we will not take gods name in vaine because we loue god reuerently
finally wee will keepe the sabbath because wee loue god sociably in the communion of saints and celestially as hauing here no dwelling place but looking for one to come
as for the second table

saint paul hath made the obseruation to our hand where hauing particularized many he summeth vp all in this generall rule if there be any other commandement it is comprehended in this

thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe
concerning both tables christs rule is short if you loue me keepe my commandements and what a company of duties doth saint paul deriue out of loue
cor
whence you may learne also that not only so much as is in the letter but whatsoeuer else is in the sense of the ten commandements springeth from loue of which sort saint paul there specifieth sundrie particulars

secondly as all morall duties spring from charitie so must the marke whereat we principally aime in doing them be charitie we see that all plants which haue their influence from heauen looke vp to heauen againe as hee that loueth god will haue no other gods besides him so a man must haue no other gods besides him only for this end that he may loue him
if he be moued by any other end profit pleasure or whatsoeuer else hee doth not keepe the first commandement no more doth he keepe the second that maketh no idoll nor the third that taketh not gods name in vaine nor the fourth that keepeth the sabbath except they doe these things in reference to their loue of god
the second table requireth the same rule
he that honoureth his father or his mother that doth no murder that doth not commit adulterie that doth not steale shall not passe for not guiltie at the barre of god except his purpose were to testifie in his obedience the loue that he beareth to his neighbour

a third reason why loue is said to bee the contents of the moral law or the morall law is said to hang vpon it is because without loue that law can neuer bee vnderstood loue giues a cleere sight as it were to the vnderstanding

applying it selfe to any particular commandement concerning our dutie to god or our neighbour because it must haue no straiter nor wider bonds then loue setteth vnto it
yea if a man bee once inflamed with loue the spirit of grace will be aiding vnto him and helpe him to vnderstand the law aright
whereas they which are without loue and the spirit that doth accompany it haue many carnall scruples and suspitions which perplex their iudgement and straighten the measure of their obedience

the second law is positiue and loue is the contents of that also though as told you somewhat in a different manner
for positiue lawes be they ceremoniall or politique which are grounded vpon things

indifferent spring indeed from charitie but not immediatly as doth the law of nature the wisdome of the lawgiuer commeth betweene and considers how farre they may be remembrances of and furtherances to charitie the ceremoniall to the loue wee beare god the politique to the loue we beare to our neighbour
but though wisdome come betweene yet must not that wisdome certainly gods did not resolue vpon any law which charitie did not approue and so euen those lawes also may be said to spring from charitie

and as they spring from it so must our obedience to them ayme at it it must not suffice vs to keepe the law of the church and of the but wee must keepe them to testifie how much wee tender the glorie of god and the good of our neighbour which the wisdome of the magistrate teacheth vs may bee aduanced this way
yea those that are disposed as they should bee in loue will not bee so friuously curious in scanning of or cauelling with the lawes of men ecclesiasticall or ciuill considering that loue bindeth them in things indifferent to captiuate their wits to the wisdome of the magistrate
and which is more they will obey more conscionably and more fully and thinke there is more then a penaltie due to the transgression thereof and more then the auoyding of scandall required in the obedience these are but accessories loue teacheth the true end of the law the loue that inditeth it sheweth the true end in obeying it and pointeth out the glorie of god

and the common good
the obseruance of these lawes is not in moralitie thankes worthy except charitie be the life of our obedience

finally this loue must cleere the eyes of the iudge or interpreter of the law and teach him how farre it must be prest
yea and teach the lawgiuer also when hee may dispence and what hee must alter in these dispensable and changeable lawes his wisdome in both must bee guided by charitie the charitie that is contained in both these commandements

in both so saith the text on these two commandements hang the law and the prophets

alterum sine altero nullum ad salutem affert profectum both must goe together
it is true that sometimes the scripture ascribes vnto one of the loues as much as here christ doth vnto both matth
but then there is a synecdoche in the speech so that in one expressed both are vnderstood and well it may be so because a man cannot loue god but hee will loue his neighbour because hee must loue his neighbour for gods sake and hee cannot loue his neighbour but hee must loue god for this is the streame that floweth from that fountaine and you know if there bee no fountaine there can bee no streame distinguish wee may seuer wee cannot these two loues though they shew themselues in two acts yet they proceed from one habit
as it is but one vertue of my sight that seeth heauen aboue mee and earth below mee so it is but one vertue of loue that vnites vs to god aboue and our neighbour here below
wherefore what god hath conioyned let not

men seuer let them not seuer these two loues in their studie of the lawes both loues doe make vp the full contents of either law
and if these lawes depend on charitie then simply all because there bee no other kinds then these and so wee must conclude that whatsoeuer law is not squared by charitie deserues not the name of a law

you happily may expect that should shew you that these two loues are the contents also of the prophets but what need seeing haue told you that the prophets are in effect nothing but the law or the law looking vpon the liues of the israelites
whereupon it will follow necessarily that if so be the two commandements be the contents of the law they must needs also be the contens of the prophets and that more euidently by so much as examples are more euident then rules
wherefore we will passe ouer that and come to a point of speciall regard

some captious persons may demand if the loue of god and our neighbour bee the contents of all the law and the prophets why do they print so many books

why do you preach so many sermons so may the lazinesse of wretched men argue for it selfe but it may receiue an answere out of that which haue alreadie said or rather out of that which christ saith in my text for though by moses god had deliuered these two rules of loue yet in his wisdome did he thinke it fit vpon them to make a first commentarie by moses and a second by the prophets and who are wee that wee should thinke our selues wiser then god that made the commentaries or better then the israelites that receiued them wherefore we must obserue that though loue be the ground of the law yet it is but as a seed and though a seed graine be potentially or in possibilitie an eare yea many eares of corne yet must the ground be first plowed and the seed sowne the raine must fall vpon the ground the sunne shine vpon it before it come to bee an eare and be carried into your barne for your sustenance euen so the word of god requireth the plowing vp the fallow grounds of your hearts there must bee a sowing and a watering of it before it will fructifie and your liues be the better for it
men looke immediatly vpon particulars and not vpon the generall rule by which they should frame their liues
adde hereunto that we must remember that not only good is commanded but also euill is forbidden and though we keepe the affirmatiue yet we need negatiues
there are first principles in all arts and sciences which are vertually the whole body of the art or science but it is not for euery one to draw out the conclusioons whereof the whole bodie must bee made
and it is much more hard to draw out practicke conclusions then speculatiue because they are clothed with many circumstances
and though it be hard to draw out all the commandements of the law of nature out of loue yet you will find it much harder to draw the positiue lawes
after all the ease that god hath done vs in the bible yet if magistrates and ministers doe not make commentaries vpon those commentaries the

church and would be full of ignorance and men would not know how to apply or resolue the generall rule
to say nothing that what we doe know it is as if wee did not know it because had we not those powerfull remembrancers the minister in the church the magistrate in the state wee would take no heed to doe what wee know

come to the last point of my text you see how these commandements may be inlarged to take vp both parts of the bible
but can those parts of the bible be so contracted as not to exceed these contents for the bible doth containe aswell undefined span alphabet what god offereth vs as undefined span alphabet what he requireth of vs
answere some inlarge the words so farre as to make them comprehend both yea the very gospell for that christs redemption tendred vs therein is nothing else but the gladtydings that what these two commandements enioyned vs is by christ fulfilled for vs saint pauls wordes sound that way

that which was impossible for the law by reason of the weaknesse of our flesh god sending his sonne in the similitude of sinfull flesh and for sin condemed sin in the flesh

that the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in vs and christ saith came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it and he is the end of the law and the law a pedagogue to christ

but hilarie hath a good rule
sensus dictorum sumendus est ex causis dicendorum christs words are an answere and therefore must bee vnderstood sutably to the question
now the question was touching that which was enioyned vs therefore the answere is not to bee thought to extend farther
and doubtlesse the questionist thought nothing of the gospell for how should hee thinke vpon that whereof he had no knowledge wherefore in contracting of those parts wee must include no more then that dutie which is enioyned vs by the law as it is contradistinct to the gospell and all that is contained herein
yea saint austin was conceited that not only god did worke the law and the prophets out of this ground but that the very heathen also wrought all their allowable moralitie and policie out of it neither is there any point of this kinde in christian religion which may not bee fetched out of heathen writers not that any one of them hath all the rules but that there is no rule which may not bee found in some one of them
except alwayes the rules of the gospell
whereupon it followeth that reason it selfe acknowledgeth the truth of all those rules
will not be so confident as to affirme that the heathens did euer acknowledge all that haue opened on these two commandements a glimpse they had of most of it the writings of plato seneca others doe testifie as much the fragments of the twelue tables which are the foundation of the ciuill law and the bodie thereof testifie how farre reason hath gone
but hasten to an end

you haue heard a lesson which is recommended vnto vs in christs answere told you it is a briefe of the bible the whole is no more in effect then loue god aboue all things and thy neighbour as thy selfe a short lesson you would thinke but it is a very hard one whether you respect the proper worke of loue or the workes which it commands

the reason is partly in our ignorance which doth not easily learne our dutie and partly in our concupiscence which hinders vs from doing that which we know from these two impediments no meere man euer was free

since the fall of adam neither is it likely any man shall bee vntill the end of the world
wherefore saint austin is of opinion that our intire obedience is reserued for our state in heauen when that which is perfect is come then shall that which is imperfect be done away saint paul speaketh it of charitie which shall not be abolished in heauen but consummated where wee shall loue god though not quantum diligibilis in se yet quantum ab homine and our neighbour as our selfe

but saint austin giueth a good rule why these commandements were giuen
am ante praecipitur quia non recte curritur si quo currendum nescitur quomodo autem sciretur si nullis praeceptis ostenderetur therefore wee must vnderstand the commandements aright wee are wayfaring men and these lawes trace out the way which we must goe to heauen
wee meane as many as are faithfull
for to vs is the law giuen and some steps must we make herein euery day that wee may bee the forwarder to our iournies end
so all our worke should proceed from it and the loue of god should order our life especially with that we should be principally affected and coldly with other things in comparison of that

vse the world as if we vsed it not

if a man bee perplext in his deliberation how hee should carrie himselfe because the profound disputes of moralitie exceed his capacitie let him hearken to the good counsell of an ancient father noli per multa tre nec discendi terreat te ramorum diffusio radicem tene de magnitudine arboris noli cogitare a man may rid himselfe of much trouble in resoluing his conscience what to doe if hee season his heart well with the loue of god and of his neighbour
meane not that he should refuse other helpes if hee may haue them but the more hee hath of this the lesse he will need other
undefined span alphabet that makes vs obey out of feare this out of goodnesse
the papists abuse this text for they say this is one of the directories of the church whereby shee may supply her traditions but it warrants no supply of the morall law much lesse of articles of faith though if it be reasonably vsed it may extend to positiue lawes
lastly seeing all hang on these two commandements none can crie nesciebam knew not what to doe

but draw to an end
in the hebrew bibles the first characters of these two commandements are extraordinary great whether by

the appointment of esdras when he digested the bible or by the authours of the mazoreth when they set downe the various lections will not dispute of this wee may bee sure that whosoeuer was the authour hee meant we should take notice of these as most remarkable commandements
not such notice as the iewes take who write them in schedules and weare and reade them as amulets to keepe from them all euill which superstition diuers christians did imitate in saint hieromes dayes hanging about their neckes little gospels

but that father saith well that caskets and closets may hold our bibles and be neuer the better for them they are the better for scripture who lay it vp in their hearts and this god meant the iewes should when he bade them bind his lawes as frontlets about their heads

and bracelets about their armes hee would haue them in all their wayes thinke vpon them and be euer exercising themselues in them and not to vse the ceremonie only forgetting the substance
and pray god these commandements may be such frontlets on our eyes as god meant and not such as the iewes vsed

charitie is the end of the law the fulfilling of the law

as saint paul speakes in imitation of christ the bond of perfection the way of life yea the superexcellent way all these commendations the scripture giueth it
but beyond all commendations goeth that which christ giueth it in my text vpon it hang all the law and the prophets

wherefore owe nothing to any but this that you loue

which is a debt that semper soluitur nunquam persoluitur
aboue all things let vs seeke after charitte and let all our things be done in loue
yea let vs fall in loue with loue that so wee may grow therein vntill wee come where it shall be so consummate as that all our life shall be spent in loue in louing god with all our heart with all our minde with all our soule with all our strength and louing our neighbour as our selfe

the conclvsion of the former argvment delivered in a sermon on the twelfth of saint marke verses
epigraph

and the scribe said vnto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but hee
and to loue him with all the heart and withall the vnderstanding and with all the soule and with all the strengh and to loue his neighbour as himselfe is more then all whole burns offerings and sacrifices
and when iesus saw that hee answered discreetly hee said vnto him thou art not farre from the kingdome of god
and no man after that durst aske him any question

ovr sauiour christ in the conference which hee had with the pharisee about the great commandement matthew
had to doe with a question and a questionist the question was good the questionist was a tempter therefore he fully yea abundantly resolued the question but he put the questionist cleane besides his purpose and marred the of the pharisees for they thought either to disgrace or endanger him disgrace him if he were silent or if he did answere to endanger him to those that were of a contrarie opinion
but christ handles the matter so that they sped of neither of these ends for he answeres that they might not disgrace him for ignorance but answers so that he cleane defeats their malice
this being but insinuated in saint matthew is fully opened by saint marke therefore at length to put an end to the doctrine of the great commandement whereupon haue dwelt long haue chosen these words as the fittest close of that argument purpose god willing briefly and plainly to vnfold them vnto you
therein then wee are to obserue christs discretion in answering and the confusion of his aduersaries by his answere
the first point is gathered out of the whole bodie of christs speech the second out of the euent thereof

more distinctly
the discretion appeares in that christ answeres not only secundum veritatem truly but also ad hominem hee fitteth his

answere to the questionist
answeres out of his owne principles so that he cannot denie it and discouers his sinne that he may be stung with it

touching the confusion of the aduersaries that is double as they were of two sorts
for one moued the question the rest plotted it both are confounded but not both alike
the confusion of the questionist is comfortable two wayes comfortable
first in regard of his ingenuitie for hee doth acknowledge openly what christ answeres yea and iustifieth it soundly though with the disgrace of his companions
secondly in regard of the clemencie with which our sauiour entertaines it
first he tooke notice of it he saw that hee answered discreetly
secondly hee encouraged it for hee told the questionist that hee was not farre from the kingdome of god
thus was the questionist confounded
his complices also were confounded but their confusion was damnable for they had no more to say they asked him no more questions not because they were euer a whit the better for our sauiours answere but because they durst not
their malice was they durst not play the serpents any longer and set vpon christ with craft and temptation but from this day forward they turned lions and put him to a cruell death
this is the summe of this scripture the particulars whereof will runne ouer againe pray god it may proue for our instruction and edification

first then of christs discretion it is gathered out of the bodie of his answere which containes not only a truth but truth fitted to the questionist fitted two wayes
first because it workes vpon his owne principles for christ keepeth himselfe to the words of the law and maketh moses giue the scribe an answere
now the scribe was a doctor of the law and moses authoritie was sacred with him
adde hereunto christs answere was the scribes owne tenent as appeares luke the tenth
where christ mouing the question another scribe answereth the very same words of the law
so that he could not denie christs answere except hee would contradict himselfe
the like discretion in working vpon the aduersaries principles doth christ vse in his dispute with the sadducees about the resurrection
they are said to haue receiued only the siue bookes of moses and out of those bookes doth christ make good that article of faith
saint paul imitates christ arguing against both iew and gentile
against the iewes in the epistle to the hebrewes where you may perceiue that he taketh most of his grounds out of the law
against the gentiles in the acts

where he seeketh no farther then the creation and the prouidence to conuict them of idolatrie
the fathers in the primitiue church tooke the verie same course as appeares by iustin martyrs apologies to the roman emperours and his dialogue with trypho the iew
the like might be shewed out of origen irenie tertullian eusebius and others

whether they deale with infidels or heretickes they presse them still with their owne principles
and so must wee for so shall we conclude most euidently against them and if any way this is most likely to preuaile with them

a second branch of christs discretion is this that his answere stings the conscience of the questionist it layeth his sinne open before his eyes
for he was a tempter and to tempt is a worke of satan which hath his name from hatred
so that christs answere doth vnmaske the questionist and shew that although the title of a pharisee and a scribe the one for holinesse the other for knowledge seeme to make neere approches vnto god yet in that he is a tempter he will be found farre from him if he be measured by the great commandement the tenour whereof is nothing but loue
and such a manner of teaching which closely conueys a good admonition to the heart when it seemes onely to informe the head is verie discreet and hath many worthy precedents
but enough of christ discretion let vs come now to the confusion of his aduersaries and first to the comfortable confusion of the scribe which moued the question wherein wee are first to see his ingenuitie double ingenuitie
for first he acknowledgeth that christ had answered right well master thou hast said the truth
he acknowledgeth it say which is not onely to know but to confesse openly what a man doth know
yea he confesseth it before his fellowes at whose hands he knew he should haue no thankes for his labour
so to confesse must needes be an ingenuous confession
and indeed such an ingenuous confession doth well beseeme all in debates of religion
for it fals not out in them as it doth in the games of actiuitie wherein onely he that conquereth is crowned the conquered also shall haue his crowne in this case if being conuicted hee acknowledge and submit himselfe vnto the truth
it were to bee wished that the world would imitate this ingenuitie that god might forgiue vs our infirmities and giue vs grace to profit in the way of eternall life
but the world is possest with a spirit of obstinacie so that men will not be perswaded though they bee perswaded nor conuicted when they are conuicted bee it in head or heart
when wee deale with papists or anabaptists we haue too lamentable proofe hereof they carrie themselues like deafe adders they stop their eares and will not heare the voyce of the charmer charme he neuer so wisely

but to leaue the absent and direct my speech to our selues that are present
are our hearts better disposed then their heads would they were but experience teacheth that though our sinnes bee laid neuer so clearely before vs and gods law that condemnes them often applied close to our conscience yet few there are that become sensible as dauid was vpon nathans reproofe or as the niniuites were at the preaching of ionas
the want of this ingenuitie is the cause why drunkards sweareas adulterers all wicked liuers notwithstanding all our instruction continue still like vnto themselues
but let them take heed their obstinacie will one day cost them deare they will be put vnto a worse shame for

perseuering in sinne

then euer their repentance coulde bring vpon them

you haue heard one branch of the scribes ingenuitie manifested in his acknowledgment of the truth when he heard it
but hee doth not onely acknowledge but he doth iustifie it also hee sheweth that he is able soundly to confirme it
and indeed this is compleate ingenuitie when a man doth not onely yeeld when he hath nothing to say against the truth but also goeth farther and becomes an aduocate thereof shewing the reason that moues him and may moue others to subscribe vnto it

see how this scribe doth it to loue god with all our heart saith he and our neighbour as our selfe is better then all burnt offering and sacrifice
nothing could come in competition with morall law but the ceremoniall giuing it then preeminence aboue the ceremoniall he giues it absolute preeminence and so prooues loue to be the great commandement following herein the direction of god himselfe in esay osea amos

and ieremie
haue handled this point vpon the fiftie one psalme and therefore intend to passe by it at this time onely giuing you this rule whereby you may the better iudge of his proofe charitie pleaseth god immediately of it selfe sacrifices please not but in vertue of charitie

but marke how with this his reason hee doth perstring his fellowes
you know the pharisees were for their corban

and taught children to disobey and destitute their parents rather then not to performe their sacrifice which doctrine of theirs this scribe acknowledgeth to be most peruerse a fruit of couetousnesse
of whom we may learne this good lesson that we must not perfunctorily read the scriptures but learne by them how to argue for them by knowing what is contained in them and weying what will follow vpon them

secondly marke that whereas this questionist came as a tempter he so profited by christs answere that hee went away a commender of christ which ingenuitie of his makes it probable that of himselfe hee was well disposed but carried away with ill companie of which sort no doubt but there are many in the church of rome many that rather follow the streame then their owne iudgement whose vnhappinesse it is to be so vnhappily yoked which must teach vs to take heed how we sort our selues with malicious aduersaries of the truth least wee become like vnto them at least be made instruments of theirs

finally obserue that christ hath a greater conquest ouer the pharisees then he had ouer either the herodian or the sadducee for he onely put them to silence so that it was left wholy to the auditorie to iudge whether they were fully answered or no but the scribe that thought to speed better is driuen to a harder straight hee is driuen to confesse and that before the people that christ had answered the truth hee that thought to procure his disgrace is made the trumpet of his prayse and glorie so strangely doth god worke in the hearts and consciences of men according to that in the psalme he receiued gifts for men euen for his enemies that the lord god might dwell amongst them and to this purpose

are his arrowes said to be verie sharpe and to pierce the hearts of the kings enemies

the preparation of the heart is of man but the answere of the tongue is of the lord baalam went to curse the israelites god made him blesse them saul went to take dauid god made him prophesie of his succession the messengers went to take christ but they returned with this commendations of him neuer man spake as he speaketh saul went to persecute the christians of damascus but on the way hee was so changed that when he came thither he preached the gospell
so doth the rage of man turne to gods praise and the fiercenesse of their spirits doth he refraine hee turneth lyons into lambes
and thus much shall suffice to be spoken of the scribes ingenuitie

come now to christs clemencie the clemencie wherewith he entertained that ingenuitie the text saith first that he tooke notice of it he saw that he answered discreetly undefined span alphabet the word is significant as one hauing a reasonable soule
the proper obiect of our vnderstanding is truth it is naturally carried thereunto and so is the will to good the the naturall obiect thereof
but these reasonable abilities are diuerted and peruerted by our sense and sensuall appetite which beset vs and which we are desirous to please whereupon it followes that though men be reasonable creatures yet are their resolutions for the most part carnall so that it is no small commendation for a man to bee able to sequester in his consultations the better part from the worse and notwithstanding the solicitations of the worse to follow the direction and inclination of the better as did this scribe
and what he did christ saw his piercing eye discerned not onely the words which he spake but the fountaine also from whence they sprang otherwise he would not haue spared after his custome to haue told him plainely that hee was an hypocrite
but christ is so farre from blaming him that hee seemeth rather to encourage him
for which is a second branch of his clemencie he tels him that he is not farre from the kingdome of god
there are two things in the law first the depth and secondly the end of it both which the pharisees misunderstood
the depth as it appeares matth

where christ shewes how shallowly they did vnderstand it
the end for that they so rested in the perfection of the law that they litle thought of the reliefe which mans inability to perform the same was to receiue from the gospell and therefore they stumbled at the doctrine of christ who neuer meant to derogate ought from the law considered in it selfe but to discouer mans weaknesse the conscience wherof should make him flie vnto the gospell
this scribe seemes to haue had a reasonable vnderstanding of the depth of the law but hee was not come so farre as to haue an vnderstanding of the end thereof
notwithstanding because the knowledge of the depth is a good step to the knowledge of the end therefore our sauiour christ tels him he is not farre from the kingdome of god

by the kingdome of god or of heauen the scripture vsually vnderstands the gospell that is the way vnto eternall blisse
now seeing

christ is the end of the law and the law is a schoolemaster to bring vs vnto christ he that doth well vnderstand the law how the morall exceeds the ceremoniall and how much the morall requireth at the hands of men as this scribe did if he do but trie himselfe thereby he will see what need he hath of the gospell and may be perswaded to embrace it
therefore doth christ tell him that hee is not farre from the kingdome of god

non abest procul abest tamen
a man that is almost at the top of the water may aswell bee drowned as hee that lieth in the bottome therefore a man must not content himselfe to bee almost a christian as agrippa did he must be altogether if he meane to be saued
therefore christ in these words wils the scribe to build forward and to supply that which he wanted of the meanes to life

obserue here how christ would not breake a bruised reed nor quench a smoking flaxe because of his ingenuitie hee handled him gently
teaching vs how odious vnto him a romish butcherie is and that we in dealing with aduersaries of the truth must follow the apostles rule in meeknesse instructing them that are contrarie minded

if god at any time will giue them repentance vnto the knowledge of his truth
especially if we see them preferre the truth before their owne priuate affections and not resist the holy ghost

what became of this scribe the scripture doth not teach vs it is not vnlikely but that afterward he beleeued in christ and that his ingenuitie made good vse of christs clemencie
haue opened vnto you the comfortable confusion of him that moued the question they that set him a worke also were confounded but their confusion was damnable

for though their mouthes were stopped yet their heart was not stopped their heart was not changed they continued malicious still
they asked him no more questions no more serpentine questions otherwise questions they did aske him but hauing by their perplexing temptations laboured in vaine for that still they had the worst yea and which vexed them more christ by answering them got honour amongst the people who wondred at his readinesse and wisdome

they therefore gaue ouer playing the serpents and turned lions
the next newes wee heare of them is that they contriue and compasse the death of christ

and this is the right method of the world when disputations and bookes will not make good a bad cause nor beare out errour and falsehood then the sword is set a worke to doe what the tongue or pen cannot and the bloud of gods seruants is spilt to satiat cruell minds
this age hath too lamentable proofe thereof all our neighbour countries be turned into shambles of the church
but wonder not at it for venena inuidiae possunt superari sed difficulter quiescere malice may be ouerawed but it will neuer bee idle if it may worke with opportunitie
therefore told you that their confusion was damnable damnable seeing their reason was conuicted and yet they persecuted christ

will dwell no longer vpon this point because toucht it in part before in this and also in the first sermon
onely obserue that which saint paul hath god maketh the wisedome of this world foolishnesse and taketh the craftie in their wilinesse so that we may say with him where is the scribe god puts into the mouthes of christs aduersaries such an answere as that they confirme his doctrine and testimonium ab aduersario validissimum
moreouer their answere cleares the innocencie of christ when they were still confounded that sought to haue iust cause against him
and no wonder for he that foyled the father of temptations could not be foyled by any of his children

one point more and so end
it is a note of saint chrysostomes tentando iudaei sibi acquisiuerunt confusionem nobis prouiderunt salutem the temptations wherewith christ was exercised by the iewes occasioned him to deliuer many excellent lessons for the instruction of his church
so did god bring light out of darknesse and how many excellent tracts haue the fathers written which had neuer come from them if their industrie had not beene whetted by the enemies of the truth
and the same prouidence at this day sets the orthodoxe a worke to looke more and more into the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen enabling them to stop the mouthes of gaine sayers and to bring their charge forward to the measure of the age of a perfect man in christ
conclude you haue heard of exemplarie discretion and confusion discretion of christ confusion of christs aduersaries
you shall doe well to imitate christs discretion learne of him to be not onely innocent as doues but wise as serpents
if our words be poudred with such salt they are most likely to yeeld grace vnto the hearers
as for the confusion of christs aduersaries let vs take heed of the damnable confusion that doth but helpe men forward to fill vp the measure of their sinnes in this world that they may haue the greater measure of plagues in the world to come
but let vs set before vs the comfortable confusion let vs be euer ready to shew our ingenuitie that we may haue experience of christ clemencie
onely let vs take care not onely to begin well but also to goe on not onely to come neere vnto but also to enter into the kingdome of god that christ which is as ready to encourage as to discerne our good disposition may establish vs in grace and crowne vs with glorie who onely can so worke vs readily to obey that he may blesse our endeauours and receiue vs in the end with those comfortable words well done seruant faithfull and true enter into thy masters ioy

vers
in the third moneth when the children of israel were gone out of egypt the same day came they into the wildernesse of sinai
for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desert of sinai and had pitched in the wildernesse and there israel camped before the mount

you may remember that opening vnto you those words of our sauiour christ in the gospell of saint matthew

thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy minde with all thy soule and with all thy strength and thy neighbour as thy selfe told you they were the generall contents of the decalogue whereof then promised you a speciall and distinct explication
haue not forgotten that promise although haue beene interrupted by interuenient texts occasioned by the times· wherefore my purpose is this day to begin my performance of that promise

and could not doe it on a fitter day for this is ascension day and it was an ascension day that is mentioned in my text
moses being a type of that whereof christ was the truth began vpon the day here

mentioned to ascend into the mount thence to bring the law as our sauiour christ vpon this day which wee solemnize ascended into heauen thence to send the holy ghost which as the apostle telleth vs giueth life to the law
adde hereunto that as christ ascended into his glorie so moses in his ascension had a kind of transfiguration for comming neere vnto god his face so shined that he was faine to put a vaile vpon it because the children of israel could not endure to behold it

there is then a good correspondencie betweene this feast and my text
neither doe only thinke so but our church also which commandeth the tenth of deuteronomie to be read this morning wherein is a report of this ascension of moses
so that the time which haue chosen is fit and meane god willing not to bee scant in my performance
will pay you the principall with interest for meane to vnfold not only the twentieth chapter but also the nineteenth of this booke though that more fully yet this competently
and there is good reason why for the nineteenth containeth a remarkable preparation to the twentieth neither will the twentieth bee so well vnderstood or regarded so well if the nineteenth doe not make vs more docill and attentiue then vulgarly men vse to bee
wherefore what god thought fit at the giuing of the law will not amisse be remembred at the expounding thereof it will bee behoofefull for you that quicken your capacitie and raise your attention with these powerfull obseruations wherewith the holy ghost doth preface the promulgation of the law
you must then take notice of the forerunning circumstances and solemnitie which are recorded in this chapter
the circumstances whereof only shall speake now are two
first the time secondly the place of both which we haue here the two termes a quo and in quo whence they take there beginning and where they haue their ending
of the time the reckoning beginneth after the children of israels going forth out of egypt and it endeth on the third moneth the verie same day that is the verie same day that the third moneth began
as for the place the text teaceheth vs first whence they came immedately from rephidim
secondly where they tooke vp their rest in the wildernesse of sinai thereon the cloud pitched and they encamped before it
these be the particulars which meane to obserue in these circumstances
that you may the better vnderstand them will resume them againe
god grant that as open them more largely so you may heare them more profitably

the first terme then of the time sheweth vs whence the reckoning doth begin it beginneth at the children of israels comming out of egypt which words doe not only note a motion from a place but also an alteration of their state for they did not only come out of the land but also out of bondage wherewith they were oppressed in that land
and such a going out giueth the name vnto this booke this booke is called

exodus and undefined span alphabet is nothing but a going out a going out of bondage into libertie

there is a great mysterie in the word which concerneth christ and his church wee learne it in the transfiguration of christ therein moses and elias appeared vnto him undefined span alphabet

and spake of the exodus or departure which he should performe at hierusalem
the apostle maketh it plaine heb
by death which is an exodus

for wee vsually say that a man is departed when wee meane hee is dead he ouercame him that had the power of death that is the deuill that hee might set them free or giue them an exodus which all their life time werein feare of bondage
and who are they but the church let this be the first note

a second is that god did not giue his law to israel when they were in egypt but when they were come thence when they were a societie by themselues then he gaue them a policie whereby they might be distinguished and ordered
distinguished first from themselues for though before they were a church yet was it but domesticall each family at least each tribe was left vnto it selfe but now they were to become a nationall church to bee knit into one bodie which could not bee but by one forme of gouernment
and this forme being of gods ordinance must needs distinguish them
secondly from others also whose policie was but of humane institution
moses telleth them that the very heathen should acknowledge the difference especially if as god did them the honour to distinguish them by the law so they should answere the distinction in the good order of their liues whereat the law did principally aime

there is a mysterie in this point also which saint paul doth obserue out of the prophets esay and ieremie come out from amongst them

and separate your selues saith the lord and touch no vncleane thing and will receiue you will bee your father and yee shall bee my sonnes and daughters saith the lord almightie so long as we are mingled with the heathen and learne their workes god will not vouchsafe vs his oracles nor incorporate vs for his people the branch must be broken off from the wilde oliue tree before that by grafting it can bee made partaker of the fatnesse of the true oliue
therefore our baptisme beginneth with abrenuntio renounce the deuill and all his workes then come wee to the confession of our faith and profession of our obedience
and this separation if not in place yet at least in disposition we must hold to our liues end if we meane to haue any communion with god

this is a true rule but not to bee rackt as it was by nouatians and donatists of old and is by the anabaptists and brownists at this day
for they fancie egypt in canaan and thinke that the oracles of god are reuealed only to them in their schisme
silly soules that they are feeding only vpon the wind and running mad with their owne deuices

the romanists are little better they please themselues with the vsurped

name of catholiques and conclude the holy ghost within the diocesse of rome and affirme that none can go out of the popes sheepfold and bee saued

but wee that haue tried them and found them to be the spirituall egypt mentioned in the reuelation haue vpon iust grounds come out from the and without any preiudice to our communion with the catholique church haue forsaken their corruptions since which time the oracles of god sound more cleerely to vs and are enioyed by vs more comfortably

you haue heard whence the reckoning of the time beginneth let vs now see where it endeth
the word in the originall signifieth either a new moone or a whole moneth and therefore a whole moneth because a new moone
for it is an vsuall thing in the scripture to denominate the whole time from a principall part thereof gen
the euening and the morning were made the first day

ieiuno bis in sabbato saith the pharisee in the gospell the sense is well exprest in our english fast twise in the weeke the weeke is there denominated from the sabbath which was the seuenth day thereof and the whole yeere is in hebrew called shanah from the tropicke point to which when the sunne is come it turneth from vs or to vs in like manner is the whole moneth denominated from the beginning thereof
our language beareth some markes of this obseruation for what is a moneth but a mooneth that is the time of the moones period or circle

the word then being doubtfull there are here other words added to expound it which are on the same day that is the very day of the new moone
for as for their opinion that thinke it was the third day that so the number of dayes might answere the number of moneths it is not so agreeing to the signification of the word therefore the most iudicious chronologers iustly reiect it

but you must moreouer obserue that because the moone was made to rule the night

and as the psalmist speaketh for certaine seasons and to distinguish times therefore in the first ages of the world and at this day in some countries the ciuill moneths were not solarie but lunarie that is euery moneth began with the new moone and ended at the change

when therefore you reade in the scripture that amongst the feasts of the iewes one was the feast of the new moone enioyned by the law and practised by the iewes you must vnderstand that of the first day of euery moneth

so then my text in the third moneth in the same day is as much as the first day of their third moneth
theirs say for we cannot parallel ours with theirs ours being solarie and theirs lunarie moneths
euerie one of ours partaketh two of theirs and euery one of theirs partaketh two of ours
therefore when chronologers say this was the moneth of iune because the first moneth was april they must be vnderstood warily
only this is agreed vpon by the iewes and christians greeke and latine fathers that this day was the seuen and fortieth after the israelites departed out of egypt

whereupon will follow another note more for the capacitie of

of the people that god did not deferre long the giuing of his law for he suffered not much more then a moneth and halfe to passe before he gaue it
so great a bodie would not haue held out without confusion except it had beene speedily prouided of a law

iethro taught moses as appeareth in the chapter which goeth before that the gouernment of so huge a multitude was a burden too heauie for one to beare wherefore following his aduice moses made many officers
but god was not pleased to bee so familiar with them as hee was with moses whom he knew by name and spake with all face to face that they should come immediatly to him for resolution of their doubts
therefore a generall law was expedient and it was timely giuen them
the king of heauen in this branch of his prouidence being a good patterne to kings on earth teaching them that they must not leaue their subiects cases to the discretion of their vnder officers but command them to bee ordered by an indifferent law
put both the termes together that wherein the reckoning beginneth and that wherein it endeth and there will arise another very profitable note
for how commeth this moneth to bee called the third the ancient yeare of the iewes began at autumne when they gathered in their fruit as it appeareth exodus
and from that this was the ninth moneth
it is true but god in exodus
tooke order for another epoche hee commanded from that time forward their yeere should begin at the spring this moneth shall bee vnto you the beginning of moneths the beginning of the sacred yeare as some distinguish calling the other politike
yet the sabaticall and iubile began at the other it may bee because of the rest of the land the feasts began here

will not dispute whether this were a new or a renued beginning whether it now were first instituted of god or whether it had his beginning when the world was first framed
let chronologers perplexe themselues with that doubt who are still seeking but cannot agree at what time of the yeere the world began the resolution thereof is not to our purpose if it might be had but hardly can it bee had for the world being an exact globe there were in the first moment of creation all seasons of the yeere though in seuerall places and the season from whence they will begin the world must be vnderstood but undefined span alphabet according to the place first inhabited paradise whose situation is not yet resolued
this we must obserue that though the common reckoning of time bee from the beginning of the world yet haue all nations specially epoches of their owne occasioned by memorable euents which haue befallen their states which being not well either knowne or heeded cause those great perplexities and errours in chronologie
will not trouble you with enumeration of them they that are learned may find them in the chronologies the ignorant may find enough in the common almanackes

that which will obserue vnto you is that our mercifull god hath so done his wonderfull workes that they ought to be had in remembrance and

amongst other helpes of memorie god vseth this of chronologie
we should not thinke of these dates of times but we should refresh our memorie of that which was done at the beginning of that date
god was pleased that the israelites should so bee remembred of their deliuerance out of egypt
and the church by whose ordinance the yeere of the lord is so familiar in our tongues and in our pens would haue vs still thinke how much we are bound to god for the incarnation of our sauiour iesus christ

descend to smaller matters but yet of good regard when you find in your almanacke the generall earthquake the yeere eightie eight the treason consider with your selues that neither gods iudgements nor his mercies ought to bee forgotten by vs yea this chronologie must put vs in mind that neither our being nor our being that which we are be it good or bad was alwayes the same
there was a time when it was otherwise with vs and the memorie thereof must not be buried in obliuion least we proue vnthankfull as certainely we will if we make not so good vse of the chronologie
and let this suffice concerning the first circumstance the circumstance of time the beginning and ending thereof

let vs now come to the second circumstance of place
and here wee must first see whence the israelites came immediatly they departed from rephidim a place of pressure and the last place where they conflicted with difficulties before they receiued the law

there was no no water and there amaleke set vpon them
but god relieued them supplying them with water and giuing them victorie ouer their enemies

god did not giue them a law before hee had giuen them good proofe of his gracious power hee made them fee the extraordinary reliefe of his hand before hee spake vnto them with his voice thus dealt hee in deliuering of the old testament
and thus dealt christ in deliuering of the new hee wrought miracles before hee preached sermons
and indeed this is a very likely way to preuaile with men to haue their reason first subdued before their faith bee informed
when reason is first brought to confesse that which is done cannot be done but by a diuine power then will faith easily beleeue that what is spoken

is a diuine word learne this of nicodemus master wee know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man could doe that which thou doest except god were with him

so were the men of lystra the jaylour and others brought to beleeue

another note is that there is great difference betweene gods dealing with them before they came to rephidim and when they came there
for before they came there their deliuerance from their enemies was wrought by god without any concurrencie of theirs

feare you not saith moses stand still and see the saluation of the lord which hee will shew you to day
but afterward when amalek came and fought with israel

then moses said vnto ioshua chuse vs out men and goe out fight with amaleke
will pray
though god was pleased to deliuer

them from their enemies yet not without their owne labour of body yea and deuotion of mind too after he had once set them free
therefore it was fit they should now haue a law to guide them in their actions and in their deuotions and god giueth them one
and vs whom preuenting grace doth first make christians without any cooperation of ours afterward will god haue to be instruments to cooperate with him and that in this cooperation we follow his direction for hee loueth not and therefore that wee may doe what pleaseth him in the seruice wherein hee vseth vs hee giueth vs for our guide his sacred law

thirdly whereas god first gaue them victorie and water at rephidim and when they were free from bodily danger and prouided of food then god gaue them the law
we may here obserue

that homo supponitur in christiano and our animall life must be prouided for that we may intend our spirituall

come we at length to the last terme of this second circumstance and that is the place whether they came and where they setled
this place was the wildernesse of sinai they pitcht before that mount

first the place was a wildernesse
philo iudaeus inquires the reason

why god would giue his law not in some citie but in a vast desert and though hee resolue modestly what is the true reason god onely knoweth yet doth he yeeld some likely reasons

one is this because the worldly imployments of citizens wherein their thoughts and desires are for the most part taken vp make all sinnes abound there both against the first and second table and men so prepossest are not capable of good lawes
retirednesse from such imployments and solitarinesse which silence those clamorous and disturbing thoughts and affections open mens eares and hearts better to listen to god
when wee are weaned from the world we are fitter to bee
gods disciples to learne what he teacheth therefore god saith

ducam vos in solitudinem loquar ad cor
this made many in the primitiue church to forsake cities and the frequencies of people and in solitarie places to to giue themselues to spirituall contemplation
which custome degenerated long since into superstition whereof the church of rome hath too many spectacles in there anchorites and ermites which abuse the credulitie of the simple with their seeming holinesse

a second reason which he giueth is that as nauigators before they set to sea are prouided of tackling and other necessaries which they must vse at sea so god was pleased to furnish the israelites in their way with those lawes which they were to make vse of when they came into the
you may if you please improue this reason mystically
canaan was a type of heauen the wildernesse a type of the world which we must passe through the grace whereby we must liue in the world to come we must be furnisht with in this present world

to leaue philo iudaeus take another from cyrillus alexandrinus
desertum typus ecclesiae militantis a desert is a type of the militant church

certainely this desert was it did most liuely represent to the israelites what they were by nature and what they became by grace
this wildernesse was of it selfe a disconsolate place it had neither meate nor drinke for reasonable creatures yet did the israelites abound both with meate and drinke there that wildernesse was to them as commodious as a paradise they had showres of bread from heauen and streames of water from the rocke
god that prouided so for their bodies in so desolate a place prouided no worse for their soules whose condition was by nature as barren as the wildernesse
they were to conceiue that his law was to bee vnto them a spirituall manna and a spirituall drinke that streamed from the rocke christ they were to repute it the bread and water of life
learne the allegorie out of esay the wildernesse and the solitarie place shall be glad for them

the desert shall reioyce and blossome as the rose it shall blossome abundantly and reioyce euen with ioy and singing the glorie of lebanon shall be giuen vnto it the excellencie of carmell and sharon

they shall see the glorie of the lord and the excellencie of our god
and againe more plainely will powre out water vpon him that is thirstie and flouds vpon the drie ground will powre my spirit vpon thy seed and my blessing vpon thine

will adde one reason more

the church is oftentimes by tyrants driuen to flee into the wildernesse gods children are made to wander in deserts and in dennes and caues of the earth but god giuing his law in the wildernesse biddeth vs bee of good courage for there is no place so desolate in worldly respects but god will not onely be there with his but will there also open vnto them the treasures of his wisedome and receiue their deuotions
wherefore though walke in the middest of the valley of the shadow of death will feare no euill thou lord wilt be with me thy rod and thy staffe shall comfort me

it was not onely a wildernesse wherein god gaue his law but the wildernesse of sinai there were more wildernesses then one through which they passed all the countrie from the to the is wildernesse therefore in their trauels wee read of the wildernesse of sur of sin of pharan and here of sinai which was in madian for there moses dwelt and fed his father sheepe when god first appeared vnto him

but more distinctly we learne of saint paul that sinai is a mountaine in arabia
and whereas there are three arabia's felix deserta and petraea this was the last of the three and it was through that their way lay into canaan that compasseth the south and part of the
sinai a mountaine in this arabia did denominate the wildernesse that lay about it
but whence was it denominated it selfe surely the word in the originall signifieth a bramble bush
some histories report that there are such brambles there that a bird cannot light on them but hee will loose all his feathers
leaue the truth of that to the reporter
of this we are sure that there was a bush there wherein god appeared to moses in a flame of fire and from that bush it is most likely that this hill was named as all the rest of their stations beare hebrew names
for from whom should they learne how to

call them that had no body there besides themselues but god was pleased that that hill should keepe a perpetuall remembrance of his apparition in the bush because the bush was such an excellent embleme of his church
a double embleme first noting that though we by nature are as fruitlesse and hurtfull as brambles

and god is a consuming fire yet that consuming fire can bee so gracious as to abide in this vnworthy plant of the wildernesse and not to consume it
secondly what himselfe will not consume abiding in it that no fierie triall shall consume be the wicke neuer so much enraged against it

will not trouble you with the tradition that you shall read in some that there are stones to be found about this hill which if you breake in memorie of this bush you shall find in them the print of a bush
of this we are sure

that in honour of this bush moses calleth the hill though vnder another name horeb which was a part of sinai montem domini in honour say of this bush
although iosephus saith that before god appeared there to moses vulgari rumore creditum numen ibi habitare it was commonly reported that god frequented that place and so was it in sslis propter religionem men durst not ascend into the top of it not onely because it was an exceeding high mountaine so high that men could not see to the top of it but also for the reuerence that men did beare to some diuine power that was thought to abide there
this conceit though it may haue some colour from the third of exodus because it is called the hill of god before the storie is reported of gods appearing in the bush yet we must know that anticipations in giuing names are vsuall in scripture especially where stories are written long after the euents are past and moses seemeth to controule that conceite of iosephus in the blessing which he giueth to the tribe of ioseph

for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come vpon the head of ioseph dwelt he saith not dwelleth teaching vs that it was a transient not a perment abode

and god meaneth no more when he biddeth moses put off his shoes because the ground whereon he ood was holy ground holy when god was present but when god departed the holinesse ceased although the title continued euen in the dayes of elias but that was in a mysterie that god

would in the very same place haue the prophet report the foule breach of his couenant where his couenant was first made with israel

this maketh little for any countenance of pilgrimage to the holyland for god himselfe said that of an holy he would make it a prophane place because the israelites had polluted it with their sinne
but will not trouble you with that point

this may not omit that god gaue his law vpon a hill as hell was shadowed in the valley of hinnom which was a very deepe place so heauen is vsually figured by hils places lifted vp high aboue the earth
and such places were anciently designed for sacred vses whether god reuealed himselfe to men or men performed their deuotions to god
the places are obuious in the old testament and in the new sion gibeon in

the old the mount where christ made his sermon where he was transfigured in the new testament

to speake a little to the day
christ ascended this day in his person and we in good time shall ascend in ours
but there is an ascension which must goe before that ascension an ascension of our conuersation before the ascension of our person

we must seeke those things that are aboue where christ sitteth on the right hand of god
we must haue our conuersation in heauen
of this the hill putteth vs in mind as we are excellently taught by the psalmes proper for this day the

and
read them at your leasure and remember to learne out of them that groueling thoughts beseeme not the children of god

come at length to the last point the israelites encamped before this mountaine

the cloud which was their guide rested on it and where that rested they were to encampe and not to moue except that moued before them
this was their twelfth and their longest station the cloud moued not hence almost in the space of a yeere the tabernacle was built here and so much of the law as is recorded vntill the tenth of numb was deliuered before they departed hence

but that which chiefely note is that the place where they encamped was not onely sacred as you haue heard but also of god
for when god appeared to moses in the bush

he said vnto him this shall be a token that haue sent thee when thou hast brought the people out of egypt

you shall serue god vpon this mount
which flauius iosephus expresseth verie well in hoc loco sacrificium gratiarum actionis ob felicem successum offeretis where first acquainted thee with the glad tydings which thou shouldest carrie to my people there shalt thou and my people offer me the sacrifice of prayse and thanksgiuing when haue made good my word

we haue a laudable custome this weeke to perambulate our parishes and in the fields to sing certaine psalmes or read certaine portions of scripture this some dislike as superstitious it is because themselues are not so religious as they should be
you see gods precept and the practise thereof you haue in the twentie fourth chapter you haue likewise iacobs vow and his performance of that vow by gods owne appointment

though we must serue god in the church and at home that hindreth not but we must serue god also in any other place where he hath done vs good or doth as in our cattle corne or whatsoeuer else belongeth vnto vs

the iewes haue a conceit and others out of them that the israelites pitcht vpon the of the hill that they might worship towards the west
but that agreeth not with the storie because they came out of the south and it hath a false ground that what was commanded them when they were within the tabernacle and the temple whereof neither was at this time built should bee obserued wheresoeuer they were which could not be obserued after they were built for they were euer to pray towards them and that could not alwayes be east
but the truth

is as it appeareth verse
they pitcht about the hill as they might best see the representation of him and he might best be heard of them that was their chiefe generall
there is a mysterie in it worth the marking with which will end
it sheweth that the church is alwayes in gods eye and god must alwayes be in the churches eye
and this is on his part a most gracious on our part a most blessed aspect

let vs beseech god that we may bee euer as the apple of his eye and he may euer be the delight of our eyes in his church militant that so he may lift vp the light of his countenance vpon vs and wee may behold him as he is and that for euer in the church triumphant
amen

the second sermon
epigraph

exodvs

vers
and moses went vp vnto god and the lord called him out of the mountaine saying thus shalt thou say to the house of iacob and tell the children of israel yee haue seene what did to the egyptians and how bare you on eagles wings and brought you to my selfe

when began to vnfold this chapter vnto you told you that the contents thereof were the circumstances and the solemnitie that did the promulgation of the law
the circumstances were two the time the place haue spoken of both
now come on to the solemnitie
in opening whereof we shall see
first that there is a common minister vsed therein then that there are two principall branches thereof
the minister is moses he was common to the parties that did
the parties were first the lord god secondly the house of iacob and the children of israel betweene these moses went hee went vp from the people vnto god and god returned him with a message to the people
god called him out of the mountaine saying thus shalt thou say to the house of iacob
the branches of the solemnitie are two
the first is a mutuall stipulation which past before the parties met the other is a preparation of the parties against their meeting answerable to either of their persons
though the stipulation were mutuall yet god beginneth and hee maketh the first motion then the israelites answere and entertaine his offer

in the motion which god maketh we must consider first whereof hee remembreth them
secondly vpon what termes hee will contract with them

he remembreth them of two of his vndeniable workes
one done for them the other done to them
that which was done for them was a worke of iustice it was vindicta the reuenge of their wrong vpon that which he did to the egyptians
the worke which he did to them was a worke of mercie it was vindicatio their deliuerance
but touching this worke wee are taught more distinctly wherein it stood and whereat it aymeth or rather the manner and the end of it the manner god carried them on eagles wings the end god brought them to himselfe
these were the workes and they were vndeniable vos vidistis
you saw those things with your eyes and you can desire no better proofe
only thus farre purpose god willing to goe at this time and therefore will not encumber your memories with breaking vp the chapter at this time any farther
that then we may orderly pursue our present purpose you may remember that the first particular pointed out was the common minister
and he was moses a remarkable person
flauius iosephus and philo iudaus amongst the iewes eusebius caesariensis and gregorie nyssen amongst the christians to omit others haue set out the life of this worthy at large though some of them haue inserted apocryphall relations
not to trouble you with whatsoeuer might be gathered out of them will only out of the scripture giue you some short notice of the man
in exodus the second he is set out as a spectacle of gods extraordinarie prouidence by the barbarous commandement of a cruell king he was exposed to the mercie of the riuer nilus but he was preserued by that kings daughter and bred as if hee had beene her sonne
there was a mysterie in it god typed out in his person the condition of his people whose deliuerer he was then designed to be
hee was vnexpectedly to set them free when in their owne eyes their case was most desperate

neither was his person only typicall his qualities also were heroicall

first his intellectuall skilfull in all the learning of the egyptians to say nothing of his fortie yeares contemplation in midian of which philo iudaeus there are foure morall vertues which they call cardinall he had them all in a high degree
prudence god gaue him the spirit of policie

as it appeares by the storie of the seuentie elders to whom god gaue part of his spirit when they were made his assistants in the gouernment
iustice the apologie which he maketh vpon the rebellion of korah dathan and abiram witnesseth that haue not taken one asse from them

neither haue hurt one of them the holy ghost giueth him this testimonie

that hee was faithfull in all gods house
temperance how little was hee transported with the loue of profit

or pleasure that thought the rebuke of christ greater riches then the treasures of egypt and chose rather to suffer affliction with the

people of god then to enioy the pleasure of sinne for a season
fortitude no man can doubt of that who considereth that being a single man in shew a meane man hee should aduenture to goe to so mightie a king in so vnpleasing an errand not fearing the kings wrath when hee had exasperated him nor desisting from vrging what hee had in charge though hee were threatned by him certainly god that sent him on that message indued him with an extraordinarie courage
besides these morall he was renowmed for his theologicall vertues his faith and his hope saint paul hath chronicled

and ranged him with the most famous worthies
and in charitie hee did exceed them all hee is not only commended for the meekest man that liued

but so indulgent were his bowels towards his vngracious charge that hee desired rather to be blotted out of gods booke of life

then they should be punisht as they deserued

finally no nationall gouernour of the israelites besides moses did euer communicate as a type in the threefold honour of christ
moses was a prophet

and there neuer liued such a prophet as moses was for his bookes containe the foundation of all prophesie therefore doe the fathers call him oceanum theologiae the great sea of diuinitie
he was a priest yea sacerdos sacerdotum

hee did not only act the function but also consecrated aaron and his sonnes therevnto
finally hee was a king a mightie king not only ruling the twelue tribes but also conquering their enemies the amalekites the midianites the ammonites the bashanites but aboue all the egyptians and also he sacred his successor iosuah giuing him part of his glorie

haue insisted the longer in this delineation of moses perfections to the end that you might perceiue that though god almightie can compasse his will by the weakest of meanes yet he vseth to endow men proportionably to that wherein he meaneth to employ them he doth performe waightie workes by worthy men such a one was abraham the father of faithfull men dauid the father of faithfull kings and our moses called to be the law giuer of israel
this person so eminent a person went betweene the parties to the couenant
the parties are two each called by two names the first is called the lord god lord that is the name of his nature iehouah hee is of none and all things are of him
god that is the name of the persons subsisting in the nature or in whom the nature doth subsist elohim signifieth all three so that we haue here trinitie in vnitie and vnitie in trinitie euen the true god and such a one is he that is the first partie to the couenant
neither is it enough to conceiue of god in grosse wee must so as it were resolue him
we must behold god the father that becommeth our father god the sonne that maketh vs sonnes and god the holy ghost that vouchsafeth vs to be his temple all three persons act their part in the couenant

notwithstanding all three concurre yet must wee take speciall notice of the second person verbum dei as the chalde paraphrase calleth him here

and throughout this chapter the angell of gods presence the angell of the couenant that is christ he was the angell that conuersed with israel in the wildernesse
and indeed it was hee that in this couenant became the bridegroome of the church for the day of the couenant was a wedding day as anon shall shew you more at large

the true knowledge of this first partie maketh much to the dignitie the commoditie the constancie of the couenant
dignitie for with whom can wee contract more honourably then with our lord god the higher he is aboue vs the more honour in the contract is done vnto vs
and this partie maketh the contract as profitable as it is honorable

not only because he can doe vs good that is the lord god but also because he will doe it because his contract maketh vp a marriage knot
finally a couenant made with such a partie is a couenant of salt

an vncorruptible couenant there is no variablenesse nor shadow of change with him and therefore in regard of him we need not feare any diuorce

the second partie is also set forth by two names the house of iacob the children of israel which yeild vs a ciuill and a mysticall obseruation
the ciuill is in the first name therefore are they called the house of iacob because they were his ofspring
reade genesis the tenth and you shall finde that all nations in the beginning of the world did this honour to their first ancestours they were called by their name after this patterne were the edomites moabites ammonites ismaelites distinguished by the stocke from whence euery one sprang
conquests and colonies haue long since altered this fashion neither can wee now tell the true originall of any nation vnder the sunne except that of the vagrant iewes who by gods special prouidence remaine yet vnconfounded with other nations
the mysticall obseruation is in the second name the same people are also called children of israel
israel was a second name giuen to iacob signifying that hee had preuailed with god and his enemies should not preuaile against him
now because that blessing was to be not only personall but nationall his posteritie communicated in his second name and iacob confirmed it vnto them in the benediction which he gaue to the twelue patriarches

in these two names then we are taught that as this people were to be a seed not only according to the flesh but also according to the promise so were they to enter into the couenant as persons clothed with this double relation to their ancestors
we haue a double birth one from ours mothers wombe the other from the churches wombe the latter we claime in right of our parents from whom wee haue the former and we should remember that god expects we should bee as well heires of their faith as of their lands and not looke otherwise to haue any interest in his couenant except we be as well children

of israel as of the house of iacob
well by this time you reasonably vnderstand who the parties are that enter into the couenant

now must shew you that moses whom before described was their common minister
it is plaine in the text that hee went vp from the people vnto god that is to the mountaine of god as the seuentie supply adde to the representation of god that was vpon the mountaine for that is meant by the name of god
and god sent him downe with a message to the people that is plaine in the text god called him out of the mountaine saying thus shalt thou say to the house of iacob
it may be a question whether moses went vp before god called as some thinke he did to relate the successe of his embassage to pharaoh and to receiue instructions what manner of worship god would haue done vnto him in that place in performance of the signe which hee gaue to moses of good successe or to bee farther directed what the people should now doe
these may bee thought reasonable inducements to moses to goe vp vncalled
others thinke that god called before moses went vp
the reason is because hee had before beene checkt for comming too neere when god first appeared there vnto him it is likely therefore say they hee would be more modest and not ascend before he was called therefore they render the text for god had called him
but whatsoeuer is to be thought of this question the whole chapter putteth it out of question that he went betweene them both that he was gods mouth to the people and the peoples mouth to god and so was as the apostle calleth him a mediator gal


but least we mistake we must obserue that there is a principall and a ministeriall mediator
ambrose openeth the difference betweene them

the briefe of it is moses was but a figure whereof christ was the truth or to speake in the apostles words christ was the sonne and moses was but the seruant to signifie that there is such distance betwixt god and man that they cannot come together without some interuenient person
god appointed properly his sonne to be the mediator but in a type of him hee appointed moses
and there is a perpetuall succession of such mediating persons in the clergie which doe administer undefined span alphabet they informe vs of gods mind and present the churches dutie vnto god and though in a much lower degree then moses yet we must repute them mediators ministeriall mediators otherwise the word cannot bee vsurped without arrogancie by any meere creature

haue done with the common minister and come now to the first branch of the solemnitie which is the mutuall stipulation mutuall say this is worth the marking
that god would bee pleased to contract that may command this is a great grace done to man for so though wee owe all our dutie to him yet for our performance of it he becommeth now a debtor vnto vs
not only so but also our good deeds haue a double valuation one of iustice another of mercie

gods iustice when it scanneth them findeth them very meane mercie setteth a higher rate vpon them it esteemeth them not only as a dutie but as a meanes which by gods ordinance may acquire a reward
so is god pleased to grace our dutie for it hath not this estimate ex dignitate operis for any intrinsecall worth but ex dignatione gratiae out of gods gracious acceptance
the fathers meant no more by the merit of workes and wee should not differ from the church of rome about the word merit if they did not racke it farther
it is too much pride to challenge the reward of our workes at gods iustice which are happie if we may expect it from his mercie the rather because the little which god requireth and would accept the best of vs doe not performe as wee should wee need a second that we may haue the benefit of his former grace

though the stipulation be mutuall yet god maketh the first motion and indeed who should begin in such a worke who can thinke himselfe worthy of such a contract if it were not offered of god especially being in the state of sinne
nay when it is offered we haue good reason to thinke our selues most vnworthy of it

abigail when dauids seruants told her that hee would take her to wife bowed her selfe on her face to the earth and said behold let thy handmaid bee a seruant to wash the feet of the seruants of my lord
and how then should wee abase our selues when an offer is made vs of marriage to the sonne of god such hopes could neuer enter into our hearts therefore god must needs preuent vs therein we cannot presume that we shall come so neere him except he vouchsafe thus to fauour vs

but let vs come to the motion and see whereof he doth remember them
from the first time that moses brought them the message that they should bee deliuered out of egypt they had shewed themselues vntoward people murmuring vpon the least occasion and repenting that they had hearkened to gods voice and come out of egypt
god doth not challenge them for this though well he might and the best of vs would haue done we would not haue endured so great vnthankfulnesse but god was more patient
before the contract hee did not so much as reproue them much lesse strike them for their murmuring
and how often doth god passe in silence our sinnes and winne vs to our owne good with second fauours when he might iustly punish vs with neglect of the former

in steed thereof he recounts those things wherein he had alreadie well deserued of them that the remembrance thereof might make them more willing to enter the couenant by vertue whereof god was pleased to deserue of them much better
the workes of god whereof they are put in mind are two
the first is that which he had done for them and it was a worke of iustice he had reuenged the wrongs which they had receiued from the egyptians
the egyptians were of the posteritie of cham infamous for quis nescit qualia demens aegyptus portenta colat so that there was cause enough why god should destroy the egyptians though they had nothing to doe with

the israelites but god tooke an occasion from the wrongs done to his people to powre forth his displeasure vpon them

the wrong was double
first they brought friends into bondage that had wel deserued of them
the storie is plaine in genesis how ioseph saued them from perishing by famine and therefore how willingly they receiued him and his into the communion of their lawes therefore it was against all law to make them bondmen
god therfore which is iudge of all the world sent moses and by him commanded pharaoh to deliuer them and to suffer them being his first borne to goe three dayes iourney into the wildernesse and sacrifice vnto him
but so farre was pharaoh from obeying god that hardning his heart he vexed the israelites more what then did god in reuenge of his people hee brake pharaohs hard heart hee made the proud king giue him the glorie both of his iustice of his power while he destroyed that ancient that goodly kingdome and slew the persons the principall persons of it the ofspring of those whom ioseph had saued together with their countrie
moreouer hee forced them to make an amends to the israelites for their seruitude not onely in willingly letting them goe but in furnishing them also for their iourney with the richest of their garments and most precious of their iewels
this did god to the egyptians
and indeed it was god that did it
for though there were some ceremoniall meanes vsed yet there were none vsed that were effectuall moses and the people did but looke on gods immediate power produced those wonderfull effects
the same god that tooke this vengeance for them is the same still and he will neuer suffer his church to be vnreuenged though hee suffer her to bee cruelly persecuted when he seeth time hee will doe to her enemies as he did to the enemies of israel
saint paul saint peter and saint iude teach it briefely

saint iohn in the reuelation deliuereth the doctrine more a large by way of prophecie and the ecclesiasticall storie sheweth that that prophecie is accomplished for a good part of it

the second worke sheweth what god did to the israelites and that is a worke of mercie
moses here teacheth the manner and the end of it

the manner
god bore them on eagles wings we account it a great honour that god doth vnto men when hee giueth his angels charge ouer them to carrie them in all their wayes that they dash not their foote against a stone
and indeed it is a great honour that these glorious spirits which attend gods throne should become ministring spirits and attend sinnefull men
how great an honour is it then that god doth vs

when hee himselfe vouchsafeth to bee the supporter of israel carrieth them as a man carrieth his little babe
god putteth them in mind of it by esay chap
vers
hearken vnto me house of iacob

and all the remnant of israel which are borne by me from the belly which are caried from the wombe and euen to your old age am he and euen to the hoarie haires will carrie you haue made and will beare euen will carrie and will deliuer you
and christ like the good shepheard in the gospel beares his sheepe and so likewise in the prophets
and indeed the passage out of egypt

was a diuine transportation for of so many hundred thousand that past so great a iourney through so desolate places ther was not one sicke not one tired and how could they haue all beene so well at ease except god had carried them they might well take to themselues those words of esay

they that waite vpon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount vp with wings as eagles they shall runne and not be wearie they shall walke and not be faint
when at any time wee haue strength to doe that which neither in our owne iudgement nor in the iudgement of others we are able to doe we must giue the glorie of it to god as dauid doth in the
psalme we must acknowledge that god did carrie vs through

god doth not onely say that he did carrie them but hee carried them vpon eagles wings quasi super alas aquilarum saith the chalde paraphrase as it were vpon eagles wings
there is a simile in the phrase which breedes two inquiries first who is vnderstood in the eagles secondly what the wings meane

some vnderstand moses and aaron the two guides that led the people of israel out of egypt and will haue them compared to eagles propter acumen intelligentiae altitudinem vitae by reason of their piercing iudgement

and their holy life
saint chrysostome nearer to our purpose saith that they were mollissimae pennae misericordiae diuinae as it were the downe feathers of gods mercie because they handled the people committed to their charge tenderly and intreated them gently in imitation of eagles of whom some report how truely let the naturalists inquire that whereas other birds carrie their yong ones in their talents or clawes which cannot bee done without some griping they lay them vpon their wings and so transport them without any grieuance which is a good embleme for magistrates and teacheth them paternall affection towards their people

saint ambrose resembleth christ to an eagle

and that in three points
first because as the eagle fluttereth ouer her yong ones and safegards them from any that would annoy them so doth christ carefully protect his church
secondly as the eagle stirreth vp her nest and taketh vp her yong ones enforcing them to looke towards the sunne thereby trying her generous or degenerating brood euen so doth christ make triall of true and counterfeite christians he reiects them as counterfeits that haue but owles sight and which hate the light but those which can looke vpon the sunne of righteousnesse and delight in beholding him they goe for true christians
and why they can see their pray a farre off and where the carcasse is there will the eagles be
sursum corda though christ be in heauen their thoughts ascend thither
thirdly the eagle hateth the serpent and wheresoeuer hee seeth him renteth him with his beake and christ the seede of the woman did breake the serpents head there is perpetuall enmitie betweene them and their seede
there is good correspondencie in these points betweene christ and the eagle but they cannot be so fitly applied in this place because the word in my text is plurall aquilarum of eagles except wee shall say that christ had in him the perfection of many eagles or was attended with

many angels which are sometimes compared to eagles

and the cherubins in the temple and tabernacle had large and broad wings

but let vs come to the wings
by them are meant two things the first is the height the second is the swiftnesse of the flight

the eagle flieth very high

whereupon many prouerbs are grounded in scripture
and this high flight intimateth that the israelites were carried aboue the reach of their enemies so that they could neither hinder nor hurt them
not that they were lifted vp in the aire but they were as safe as if they had beene because saith the psalmist thou hast made the lord the most high thy habitation

there shall no euill befall thee
certainly the cloud interposed betweene the israelites and egyptians would not suffer them to take any harme
and indeed the children of god are very secure except it bee for their good their enemies shall neuer haue their will of them no more then the egyptians had of the israelites

as the eagle flieth high so doth hee flie swift also the scripture groundeth many similies hereupon iob
sam

and giueth vs to vnderstand that from the time that the egyptians let the israelites goe which was soone as moses had performed all the miracles intended of god for plaguing the egyptians the israelites had a very quicke passage
and indeed it is a wonder that sixe hundred thousand men besides women and children and a rabble of strangers should in one night be readie and get out of their enemies land and that with all their impediments of stuffe and cattle and flockes
neither was it a lesse wonder that in one night they should all passe through the red sea and standing on the shoare the next morning see that all their enemies were destroyed
certainly they that made such speed were carried vpon eagles wings it was a diuine power that conueyed them
and how quickly doth god change the face of the world when he is pleased to worke a great deliuerance the church of christians is not herein inseriour to the church of the israelites
for as the israelites had a dragon so pharaoh is called ezek
from whom they fled euen so haue the christians reuel

and eagles wings are there giuen to the woman the type of the christian church to slie into the wildernesse as the israelites vpon eagles wings were carried into their wildernesse
so like is god alwayes to himselfe and the church alwayes prouided for a like

may not forget the order of these words that worke which was first done is first commemorated and that which was last done is commemorated in the last place
and why though god for sinne doth otherwise punish the wicked yet in this world he doth it commonly that hee may free his church
but toucht at this before therefore will passe it ouer and come to the end of both workes
god brought them to himselfe
and this is a greater blessing then that he carried them on eagles wings that shewed a deliuerance from euill this a bestowing of good
the eagle doth sometimes carrie her young ones only from a dangerous vnto a safer nest sometimes shee

rouseth them out of their sloth and directs them where they may find their prey
euen so dealeth god with his children hee freeth them from danger

and bringeth them to comfort hee bringeth them to himselfe to his seruice saith the one chaldie paraphrase to the doctrine of his law saith another and indeed we are deliuered from our enemies that wee may serue god and liue according to his lawes
if there were no more in it it is a great comfort so to be imployed

but there is more in it told you that the end was a couenant of wedlocke so that to my selfe is as much as to be appropriated vnto me and to be my spouse to bee the mother of my children and beare inheritors of the kingdome of heauen
any way to come neere god is a great honour but to come so neere and become so deare is more grace then mans heart can conceiue or his tongue vtter
but the two next sermons will bee spent for the most part in amplifying this therefore will speake no more of it at this time

you haue heard of both the workes
one point remayneth which will touch in a word
both these workes are vndeniable the proofe is vos vidistis appeale to your eyes whether speake not a truth and your fresh experience doth iustifie my words
rationall proofes satisfie much but not so much as sensitiue therefore the intuitiue knowledge that angels haue is farre more excellent then our discursiue and what is our hope but that our faith shall be turned into sight neither doth sight worke so vpon our head only but vpon our heart also

segnius irritant animos dimissa per aures quam quae sunt oculis commissa fidelibus

had god done these things and they had only heard of them they would haue beene moued with them much lesse the more vndoubted their knowledge the more strong should their affections be

finally obserue that vos vidistis you haue seene is referred not only to the worke of mercie but also to that of iustice wherein god doth condescend to an affection that is predominant in vs
it doth adde not a little to the content we take in our better estate if we see withall our enemies brought into our worser

when the righteous seeth the vengeance he will reioyce and wash his feet in the bloud of the wicked

your eyes saith god to the iewes shall see the desolation of edom and you shall say the lord will be magnified from the border of israel

lazarus in abrahams bosome to his greater comfort seeth diues burning in hell

and after the last judgement the saints shall goe forth and see the carcasses of them that haue transgrest against god
this doth not commend undefined span alphabet but allowes congratulating of gods iudgements

to conclude
these two workes serue to worke two affections which sway much in the ordering of our life feare and loue
in the worke of iustice you see that god is almightie there is no striuing with him hee that will not relent with repentance shall bee grinded with

his vengeance
in the worke of mercie you see that god is bountifull
let vs not bee vnthankfull but let vs repay loue with loue
in a word seeing euery day god doth present such spectacles before our eyes god grant wee bee not like the israelites of whom moses complayneth that they were as if they had no eyes

rather he giue vs grace to make such vse of our eyes in beholding his workes that his feare and his loue may euer liue in our hearts
so may hee euer manifest his iustice for vs his goodnesse to vs vntill hauing deliuered vs from all our enemies here on earth hee bring vs to himselfe to liue with him blessed for euer in heauen
amen

the third sermon
epigraph

exodvs
vers
now therefore if yee will obey my voice indeed and keepe my couenant then shall yee be a peculiar treasure vnto me aboue all people for all the earth is mine
and yee shall be vnto me a kingdome of priests and an holy nation
these are the words which thou shalt speake vnto the children of israel

in the motion which god by moses maketh vnto the israelites told you that there are two points considerable the first is whereof god doth remember them the second vpon what termes god will contract with them
haue handled the former come now to the later wherein you shall see first what god requires then what he offers both points are to bee handled first seuerally and then ioyntly
that which god requires is obedience and fidelitie obedience they must heare gods voice fidelitie they must keepe gods couenant that which god doth promise is a plentifull reward which is set forth first comparaetiuely then absolutely comparatiuely it is a gracious prerogatiue for they shall be a peculiar treasure to god aboue all people and this prerogatiue is gracious because all the world is gods absolutely it is set forth in regard of eminencie and sanctitie eminencie for they shall be vnto god a king dome of priests sanctitie for they shall be vnto him an holy nation
hauing considered these points seuerally wee must consider them ioyntly also wee must see how that which god doth offer depends vpon that which god doth require gods blessings are promised vpon condition of our duties now therefore if ye will obey
then shall ye be

this is the substance of the whole passage whereof meane to handle at this time only the first branch whereunto that wee may all learne to conforme let vs in the feare of god listen to the particulars thereof as they shall now be vnsolded briefly and in their order

first then of the obedience israel must heare gods voice
need not in many words obserue vnto you that god being a spirit hath properly no corporall voice such as wee haue but yet by his almightie power hee can at his pleasure create voices and by them reueale his word vnto men· or else if he not create a new voice he can by his inspired seruants deliuer his minde
but to make this point a little plainer
gods voice is either direct or reflected direct is that which he doth immediately vtter vnto men such was that voice wherein god deliuered the decalogue in mount sinai a terrible voice and wonderfull wonderfull in that it was heard of so many hundred thousand at one instant terrible for it did so affright them that they desired to heare it no more
moses in deutronomie doth not only describe but remember also the israelites of this voice and it is this voice that is principally vnderstood in this place
besides this direct there is a reflected voice of god wherein god maketh himselfe knowne to some particular persons with whom he talketh face to face as hee did to moses and by them maketh his will knowne to the whole church this reflected voice was vsed by god because the people could not indure to heare the direct they did deprecate the hearing of that and god condescended to their desire and from that time forward spake vnto them first by moses and then by other men
but this reflected voice hath a reflection also as there may be an echo of an echo and so the priests that receiued the law from moses and the prophets and reade it to the people and the pastors that receiue the gospell from christ and his apostles and preach it to the world are gods voices of them all christs saying is true hee that heareth you heareth me and he that heareth me heareth him that seut me
the voice then must not be restrained to the direct it must bee extended to the reflected also to the primarie and to the secondarie so long as all three agree in one and the later doth represent the former and so by consequent all the scripture is gods voice and they are gods voices vnto vs that are sincere preachers of the scripture which now is the summarie of gods word for other voice of god wee must now acknowledge none but leaue the romanists and enthusiastes to be deluded with their counterfeit echoes and imaginarie voices

hauing shewed you what is meant by the voice must now shew you what it is to heare of hearing then there are two sorts a physicall and a morall a man is defined to be animal rationale a liuing creature endued with reason now if he heare only as a liuing creature that hearing is common to him with beasts which hauing sense are apt to apprehend sounds and be moued with them but a man in hearing must doe more hee must heare not only as animal but also as rationale his sense must be but as a

gate to conuey the voice vnto his reason and then must the voice worke vpon his reasonable powers his vnderstanding and his will it must informe his vnderstanding and he must assent to it and it must perswade his will and affections and he must also submit to it otherwise hee doth not heare as a reasonable creature though as a liuing creature hee doth heare well may his action be physicall morall it cannot be
but euen morall hearing is of two sorts philosophicall or theologicall philosophicall call that which goeth no farther then naturall reason can carrie vs and so if we heare the voice of god the contents thereof will be no better then folly to our blind vnderstanding which scanneth them

or we shall proue our selues fooles when wee draw our conclusions out of them and as for our will and affections they will be enmitie to them and that our sinfulnesse may appeare more sinfull by them we will bee more exasperated to set our selues against god

mans reason is vnreasonable in hearing gods voice which otherwise in hearing mans voice sheweth it selfe very reasonable witnesse the many examples of philosophers in humane literature but when they read the scripture such were porphyrie gallen and others

there is then an other morall hearing which is theologicall
when god saith ephata to a mans eares as christ did to the deafe man in the gospell when god doth circumcise mens eares as the law speaketh when god doth open mens eares to heare as the learned when our hearing is tempered with faith and wee rest vndoubtedly resolued of gods truth in regard of our vnderstanding and in regard of our will the word of god is sweeter vnto vs then honie and the honie combe more to be desired then gold yea then much fine gold

then we heare theologically we doe audiendo audire heare indeed or as it is rendred we doe obey gods voice wee are such hearers as are doers of gods word

and this was excellently figured in the boaring of the seruants eare who in the sabaticall yeere would not take his libertie out of the loue hee bare to his master and his wife and children christ in his owne person maketh the allusion and we may accommodate it to our owne persons
in a word a man doth heare theologically when the law which is perfect conuerteth his soule the testimonie of the lord that is sure

maketh him wise of simple the statutes of the lord that are right reioyce his heart and the commandement of the lord that is pure doth illighten his eyes so that this is of god

as also the voice is and therefore moses tels the israelites that god hath not giuen them eares to heare and christ in the gospell saith qui habet aures ad audiendum audiat for vobis datum est it is not to euery body giuen to heare but of them to whom it is giuen christ hath pronounced blesse are the eares that heare that which you heare

hauing heard what the voice is and what it is to heare we must now ioyne them together and indeed speaking is for hearing in ciuill societie neither would god euer haue giuen men tongues if hee had not giuen them eares
and if for this life hee so prouideth how much more doth he prouide so for the life to come surely paul saith that he receiued

grace and apostleship undefined span alphabet

that men might heare him with faith and he calleth the word of god undefined span alphabet a word of hearing that is a word which must be heard esay goeth a step farther and calleth the word of god

schemugnah saint paul rendreth it undefined span alphabet hearing who hath belieued our hearing so it is in the originall the meaning is who hath belieued the word that we preach to the end that men might heare it the word of god is still to sound in mens eares and men are still to heare the sound thereof

how iniurious then is the romane discipline

which like the iewish lawyers takes away from people the key of knowledge and shut vp the kingdome of heauen against men which heretofore made it a mortall sinne to read gods word and now clogs the libertie it grants with such cautions that very few especially of those that are with in the reach of the inquisition dare bee acquainted with it yea and those clogs content not but now it is thought fitter vtterly to denie libertie

as such teachers are iniurious so are there some schollars impious that may but will not heare whether out of contempt or neglect they are impious murtherers of their owne soules for this voice onely is the voice of life and it quickneth by the eare although wee must not so limit the conueiance thereof by the corporall eare that wee exclude the eye for our eye also since gods word is written by reading may conuey gods voice vnto the eare of our soule and men by this second meanes are not a little edified in gods truth the fathers especially chrysostome doth commend reading earnestly to the people yea the law hath commanded it long since when it willed the iewes to write the law vpon their doore posts certainely the iewes euen at this day inure their children to a daily reading of the law so soone as they come to yeeres of discretion and it were to be wisht that christians did imitate them therein
but marke that as the israelites must heare gods voice so they must heare it absolutely for god doth not yet acquaint them with the contents of his voice he speaketh indifinitely hee requires obedience not to this or that commandement not to this or that article of faith but to whatsoeuer he shall purpose
and well may god require such obedience for he is first undefined span alphabet truth of himselfe yea truth it selfe so that a man need not feare that at any time or in any thing god can bee deceiued or will deceiue vs neither can agree with the omniscience and holinesse of his nature
secondly god is undefined span alphabet almightie and the soueraigne commander of man so that his word is not onely truth but a law where the word of this king goeth there goeth power it admitteth no disputing no resisting as he is undefined span alphabet truth so we may safely captiuate our wits vnto his wisedome as he is undefined span alphabet so we must dutifully submit our wils vnto his commands vpon these two foundations are built our absolute obedience vnto gods indefinite voice

the word my voice is a word of limitation

christs sheepe heare his voice the voice of a stranger they will not heare gods voice must bee

reputed obiectum adaequatum of his people hearing wee must neither stretch nor shrinke it neither adde thereto nor take

these two attributes of truth and power are so proper vnto god that they are not communicable to any creature omnis homo mendax

euerie man may deceiue or be deceiued and omne sub regno graniore regnum est the greatest soueraignes vnto men are subiect vnto god therefore mens words must be tried before they must be belieued wee must not credit all their words and we must yeeld obedience vnto men no farther then may stand with our obedience to god
this must be obserued because the glorie that is due onely to god is too often communicated to men so disciples take their masters instructions as diuine oracles and follow them in errour out of a preconceipt that they are not men likely to erre
but saint pauls rule is omnia probate

quod bonum est tenete proue all things but hold that which is best and saint iohn trie the spirits whether they be of god or no for many false prophets are gone out into the world amicus plato magis amica veritas we must neuer dote so vpon any man as to forget that he is a man that is a creature subiect vnto errour
if this caution had beene obserued and the disciples had in all ages examined their masters doctrine by his word that is undefined span alphabet neither should the church heretofore haue beene neither would it now be pestered with those many sects that dictract the same

as disciples haue their caution so haue subiects also they must dutifully obey their superiours but alwayes with a sauing sauing the allegiance which they owe vnto the superiour of superiours that is vnto god so long as there is no contradiction betweene the commandements of god and superiour men subiects must obey though the obedience be vnsauorie and the command rigid but so soone as there appeares a contradiction endure they must patiently the sanction of the law but perform the precept they must not
were this caution obserued by subiects did they consider the subordination of all earthly powers to the power of god many enormous sinnes had neuer beene committed neither would the people so familiarly shift their religion at the becke of their superiour
but aboue all vsurpations of gods glorie in this kind take notice of the votiue blind obedience of the religious romanists especially of the iesuites they make it a part of their solemne profession and put it in practise impiously and mischieuously as the world hath palpaple and woful proofe true it is that they pretend good limitations set to their vow as that the superiour must not be obeyed against gods law and the law of nature but while they make the superiour the interpreter of both these lawes and that they must rest in their superiours voice as in the voice of christ what they abhorre in words that they commit in deeds they commit many things both against the law of god and nature
and in generall all papists that hold the popes infallabilitie taking from him the resolution of our faith and manners how doe they serue god against gods will and massacre gods seruants out of an erroneous zeale for gods glorie

let the conclusion then of this point be that no man may dispute or resist any voice of god but withall he doth challenge gods truth and his power and whosoeuer requires absolute credit and obedience to all his words he vsurpes gods attributes which are incommunicable that is undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet vnerring truth and vncontrowable power and so haue you the first of those things which god doth require which is obedience

the second followeth which is fidelitie israel must keepe the couenant of god a couenant is a solemne contract made betweene diuers persons and gods couenant is the contract that is made betweene him and his church in those termes will bee your god and you shall be my people
but of couenants there are two sorts foedus aequum and faedus iniquum as the ciuilians speake foedus aequum is that which is made betweene persons that are of equall ranke whereof one is not superiour to the other foedus iniquum is that which is made betweene persons that are impari iure of vnequall ranke whereof the one is superiour to the other
when we speake of gods couenant made with man wee must not conceiue that that the persons are equall they are very vnequall there is no proportion betweene them neither can there be betweene an infinite and a finite person this must be obserued in the very first couenant that euer god made the couenant of the creation for then the persons differed as the creator and creature there was oddes betweene them
secondly as there may bee oddes betweene the persons that enter into a couenant
so there may haue beene before they enter into the couenant no enmitie or no great enmitie betweene them nations that neuer were at warre may enter into couenant one to strengthen himselfe by the other or one to haue the freer commerce with the other but oftentimes it fals out that leagues put an end vnto quarrels and couenants are the securitie of a reconciliation and open the intercourse of mutuall good offices which war shut vp
though the couenant of the creation had no precedent enmitie yet that of the redemption had and therefore it is called not only undefined span alphabet a couenant but also undefined span alphabet a reconciliation when we were enemies christ died for vs and by his bloud was the new testament ratified

thirdly the couenant primarily here meant is the decalogue on those ten words did god make a couenant with israel and the tables wherein they were written were called the tables of the couenant

the arke wherein the tables were put is called the arke of the couenant

and the tabernacle wherein the arke was was called the tabernacle of the couenant
but this couenant of the decalogue hath a double consideration whereof the one is intrinsicall the other is extrinsicall the intrinsicall is that which looketh to the naturall power of the law which is to discouer sinne to conuict a sinner and to doome him according to his desert the extrinsicall consideration is that which looketh to the supernaturall power of the law and that is

to be a schoolemaster to bring vs vnto christ who is the end of the law and came to fulfill it
to shadow this double consideration the decalogue was cloathed with the ceremoniall law wherein the offerer imposing hands vpon the sacrifice did confesse himselfe guiltie and the slaying of the beast shewed the desert of a sinner thus there appeared what is the naturall power of the law
the supernaturall power also appeared in the ceremonies in that the offerer vnburthened himselfe vpon the sacrifice as a sinner doth vpon our sauiour christ and that by the death of the beast the offerer was exempted from death as men are deliuered from death by the death and passion of our sauiour christ
wherefore though the couenant of the redemption bee but one yet in regard of the shadow it is called the old and in regard of the substance the new

you haue seene what is the couenant of god you must now learne what it is to keepe it
first wee must learne to obserue our distance though god doe vs the honour to contract with vs yet must not we presume to equall our selues to god for so shall wee betray our ignorance that we know not of what kind the couenant is we must therefore discerne the inequalitie of the persons that haue contracted and wee must confesse how low god hath descended that hath vouchsafed to take vs into so neere a reference
as in keeping the couenant wee must obserue our distance so must we not be vnmindfull of the danger which we haue escaped thereby he that considereth not that he stood at gods mercie when hee was receiued to grace that he was by merit a firebrand of hell when by mercie he was designed to be a saint in heauen cannot as he ought keepe the couenant of god
now the decalogue wherein this couenant standeth hath a double consideration therefore he that will keepe gods couenant must make vse of both
first he must make vse of the intrinsecall consideration and of euery branch thereof by the law commeth the knowledge of sinne therefore that he may haue a true iudgemement of the nature differences and degrees of sinnes he must be well conuersant in the decalogue he must not trust to morall philosophie to ciuill constitutions and customes to pharisaicall or papisticall traditions these are but imperfect guides in such inquiries
only gods couenant can tell what is and what is not finne moses is the best casuist
secondly he must often suruey himselfe at this glasse of the law and there find the excesses and defects of his life no other thing can represent them so truly as this will doe this glasse will neither flatter nor deforme vs our consciences directed hereby will returne a true verdict and indict vs of no lesse sinne then we haue committed
thirdly as a man must conuict himselfe according to the law so according to the law must hee doome himselfe acknowledge whatsoeuer is due to a wretched sinner what place what state what worme what fire what losse what paine that all these are due vnto himselfe this intrinsecall consideration of the law must euery one haue that will obserue gods couenant

but he must not rest here he must come on to the extrinsecall the supernaturall power of the law whereat the lawgiuer did finally aime man finding no innocencie in himselfe must seeke it in christ hee must vnload his conscience vpon the propitiatorie sacrifice and wash his garments white in the bloud of that lambe through confidence in christs death hee must insult against that death which is the wages of his sinne

finally what was impossible for the law by reason of the weaknesse of his flesh

this must be his comfort that god sending his owne sonne in the likenesse of sinfull flesh and for sinne condemned sinne in the flesh that the righteousnesse of the law might bee fulfilled in vs who walke not after the flesh but after the spirit

you see what it is to keepe the couenant of god
may not omit the reason why god calleth it his couenant and the reason is twofold first because we being inferiours and enemies could not prescribe any articles to god but were to take such as he was pleased to prescribe both to himselfe and vs so that though there be two parties to the conenant yet is there but one that proscribes
and we may well be content with it for being in that case that we were in wee could not haue wisht for so much as god hath done for vs
a second reason is because in point of religion couenanting with any other is forbidden god brooketh not that he hauing appropriated himselfe as it were vnto vs wee should communicate vnto others the honour that is due to him
the couenant of god is of the nature of those leagues which require intire offensiue and defensiue seruice we must haue to doe with no others but for the lord and in the lord
draw to an end
let vs lay together the two parts of the text and so you may learne two good lessons
that which in the former part is called gods voice is in the later part called gods couenant the later name sweetens the former the first is imperious the second is gratious and who would not heare that voice the argument whereof is nothing but gods wonderfull fauour though the pride of our nature be impatient to be commanded yet can it not chuse but take it for a great honour that wee are contracted with by the soueraigne lord of heauen and earth that we are contracted with about our heauenly aduancement and our euerlasting emolument
our second lesson is
that seeing to heare gods voice is to keepe his couenant the breach of our dutie is not only sin but persidiousnesse our euill deseruing of god is aggrauated by gods well deseruing of vs which we should well obserue for if we haue not lost all ingenuitie the due consideration hereof will worke in vs the deeper remorse for sinne past and be vnto vs the stronger preseruatiue against sinne to come
adde a third lesson that hearing the voice is put before keeping the couenant because that is a meanes vnto this for we cannot keepe gods couenant but by the grace which we receiue by hearing his voice
will end with the prayer of king dauid

teach me

lord the way of thy statutes and shall keep it vnto the end giue me vnderstanding and shall keepe thy law yea shall obserue it with my whole heart

the fourth sermon
epigraph

exodvs
vers
then shall yee be a peculiar treasure vnto mee aboue all people for all the earth is mine
and yee shall be vnto me a kingdome of priests and an holy nation

in the message which god sent by moses to israel testifying vpon what tearmes he would couenant with them there are as heretofore haue obserued two remarkabe points the first teaching what god doth require the second what god doth offer
and these points must be considered first in themselues wee must see what they meane then betweene themselues we must see how the one depends vpon the other
haue handled the first of these points haue shewed you what god requires of israel he requires their absolute obedience and their constant fidelitie that they heare his voice indeed and that they keepe his couenant
it followeth that now come on to the second point that shew you what god offers and that which he offers vnto israel is a gracious prerogatiue
a prerogatiue is some great good vouchsafed vs wherein wee exceed others and in gods offer there is a manifold good contained
this good is first specified then it is amplified
in specifying it god doth first resemble it he telleth the israelites they shall bee a pecullar treasure then he brancheth it into a double blessing an eminencie of their state they shall be a kingdome of priests and a sanctitie of their persons they shall be an holy nation
these blessings so specified are also amplified in the words eritis mihi yee shall be to me
it is a great blessing to be a peculiar treasure to be a royall priesthood to be an holy nation but to he any of these how much more to bee all these vnto god doth not a little improue our blessing you see the good is great which they are vouchsafed but wee doe not yet see that the hauing of it is a prerogatiue
it becomes then such if it be not a common good and if therein wee goe beyond others and such is israels blessing that which god will vouchsafe them to be they shall be aboue all other nations
the offer you see doth containe a prerogatiue
but this prerogatiue is moreouer gracious gracious whether you respect the receiuer or the giuer the receiuer vos yee persons of no worth the giuer god that hath no want all the earth is mine in so litle worth of theirs and lesse want of gods to honour them so farre must needs be a worke of grace

haue laid before you gods offer

it deserues your attentiue listning vnto it the day which we solemnize putteth vs in mind of our interest therein and wee may become all saints because this gracious prerogatiue is offered to vs all
wherefore that we may partake it let our diligent eares quicken the desire of our hearts to entertaine these particulars which shall now vnfold vnto you briefly and in their order

begin with the prerogatiue the good therein offered is first resembled vnto a peculiar treasure
of the goods which a man hath if a man haue much goods he committeth some to his seruants they are trusted with the keeping and the care thereof but if hee haue any thing of speciall price and which hee esteemeth more then ordinarie that he layeth in his owne cabinet he reserueth the keeping thereof vnto himselfe
the portion of good which is so tendered is by the holy ghost called segulia

which we render a peculiar treasure such as king dauid had and salomon
vnto this practice of kings or great men doth god allude in this resemblance all the world is his but by commission or permission hee intrusteth his creatures with much of it but his church is more deare vnto him then so he maketh her the subiect of his speciall care and giues vs to vnderstand that she is a speciall iewell undefined span alphabet an exempt people and undefined span alphabet a people of extraordinary note so the translators render segulla no phrase more vsuall in moses then to call israell a pretious people and neuer doth god resemble his church when hee meaneth to honour it but hee resembleth it to things of greatest value
will not trouble you with the canticles

where it is called hortus conclusus and is made the verie paradise of god will keepe my selfe to our present allusion
in the old testament the tabernacle was a type of the church as it was militant the temple of salomon was a type of it as it shall be triumphant and what were both of them made of but of the costliest timber mettall stones silke that could bee had esay foretold the fabricke of the church in the state of grace that it should be of carbuncles and precious stuffe and how sumptuous is the state of it in glorie as it is described by saint iohn in the reuelation

our sauiour in the gospell compares the kingdome of heauen

which is the church vnto a treasure hid and to a pearle of very great price

but to speake more plainly the fountaine from which the church springeth is the pretious louing kindnesse of god

the redemption that was paid for it was the pretious blond of christ the foundation whereupon it is built

is a pretious corner stone the doctrine by which it is built vp is gold siluer and precious stones the persons whereof it consisteth are vessels of gold

vessels of honour all the promises that are made vnto it are pretious promises and their faith is pretious how can they then chuse but bee a pretious people

if you haue not enough to proue it that one phrase putteth it out of all doubt that the church is gods peculiar treasure god himselfe resides there and frameth the church vnto his image christ liueth there the church is his body the holy ghost doth breath there the church is his temple finally the angels attend there the church is undefined span alphabet

it is the sanctuarie of god
can there be any thing added vnto the value where there is such a presence and where there is such a prouidence becommeth not the church most peculiar certainely that which is the treasure of those diuine mysteries must needs bee accounted gods peculiar treasure

will dwell no longer vpon the resemblance onely take notice that it promiseth more then an ordinarie good in so significant a phrase
and indeed what tongue can expresse the fauour that is implied in the value that god setteth on vs and the care that he will take of vs when he calleth vs his peculiar treasure

but what god resembleth that hee brancheth hee openeth the good more plainely which he did but shadow figuratiuely and the first branch doth set forth the eminencie of the state of israel they shall be a kingdome of priests
the phrase is read diuersly

moses hath here a kingdome of priests saint peter rendreth it a priestly kingdome in the reuelation saint iohn telleth vs that christ hath made vs kings and priests
the reconciliation is easie for in the church euerie member of the church is so a king that he is a priest and so a priest that he is a king
and why he is primogenitus gods first borne

so god called israel and saint paul telleth vs that they that come into the church

come into the congregation of the first borne
now the law of nature doth acknowledge this right of primogeniture that is made a man lord of his brethren and priest of the most high god so that these words kings and priests are equipollent to first borne and are the ground of our prerogatiue whereof you shall heare anon

but let vs take these words a sunder

first then the israelites shall bee kings
the church as it is described in ezekiel is adorned with a crowne and that woman which is described in the reuelation hath a crowne of twelue starres vpon her head

the psalmist calleth her a queene the parable of the marriage feast calleth her the wife of the kingssonne her state is royall and all her children are filij regni children of the kingdome the gospell that is verbum regni doth so honour them they are heyres apparent vnto the kingdome of heauen
saint chrysostome vpon cor

doth excellently open the analogie betweene a member of the church and a king
a king saith he hath a crowne and god doth crowne his people with mercie and louing kindnesse

a king hath his robes of state and the church is at the right hand of christ in a vesture of gold wrought about with diuers colours

christ himselfe is her clothing
a king hath his guard tending vpon him for his honour and safetie and the angels of god pitcht their tents round about the godly

a king hath a multitude of subiects whom hee doth direct and correct and the children of god haue many thoughts and desires ouer which

they haue power to order and represse them
and indeed herein principally standeth the kingdome residet in se quis{que animo regali euerie man is a soueraigne ouer himselfe hee doth polish his owne little prescribing a measure and obseruing good order in his head in his heart in his soule and in his body
it is the kingdome of grace which is preached in the gospell

by which we obtaine the kingdome of glorie which is promised to them that rule well therein to sinne is the direct opposite vnto this kingdome this title forbiddeth vs all earthly and sensuall thoughts and desires it requires that wee be kingly in both or else we doe not answere our title
and the more is the pitie there are but few that answere it but let vs take heed this is our danger hee that is not a king in grace shall neuer bee a king in glorie

you see the first aduancement of the churches state which is to bee kings the second aduancement is to be priests and a priest was he that offered sacrifice and euerie member of the church must offer hee must offer at both the altars
at the altar of incense prayers and prayser
prayers psal
dauid prayeth that his prayers may come vnto god as the incense
prayses psal
we are willed to sacrifice praises
and as they must offer at the altar of incense so must they at the atar of burnt offerings also

a sinner repenting becommeth a priest because a broken and contrite heart is the sacrifice of god such an undefined span alphabet sacrificing of mans owne selfe is a speciall act of christian
and so is in generall undefined span alphabet well doing

be not wearie saith saint paul of well doing for with such sacrifices god is well pleased and he exhorteth the romanes to offer vp their bodies a liuing sacrifice holy and acceptable vnto god which is their reasonable seruice of him
a priest saith origen is mens deodicata and he is called a leuite which doth continually attend god

and minister to his will in this sense esay saith of the church you shall be called the priests of the lord and they shall say vnto you the ministers of god

this second title of honor putteth vs in mind religiously to serue god for it is a plaine contradiction for a man to be a priest and not to attend the altar he that neuer prayeth vnto god neuer praiseth him for his benefits hee that neuer repenteth of his sinne nor crucifieth his sinfull flesh he that doth not exercise himselfe in good workes doth really renounce the christian
and here by the way let me obserue vnto you how senselesly they cast durt into their owne faces that vilifie gods ministers in the name of priests forgetting that it is one of the honourable titles which themselues are vouchsafed of god and it is their dignitie in gods word to be stiled priests
but happily they would be such kings as are no priests absolute in themselues and acknowledge no superiour which was the pride of angels and of adam

put this title of priest to that of king and then you shall find that this doth temper that for it teacheth that our eminencie is subordinate for a king is he that hath inferiours a priest is he that hath a superiour

for a priest doth honour those aboue him as a king is honoured by those that are below him the name of a king must not make vs thinke so highly of our selues but the name of a priest must teach vs to bee humble we must so carrie our selues masters of our selues as that in all things wee be the dutifull sernants of god

well then kings we are and priests but how in christ
the name of christ is as much as anointed and christ was anointed to bee the the king of glorie and a priest after the order of melchisedecke and we in baptisme put on christ we are grafted into him

and so become christians partakers of his vnction and if of his vnction then of his kingdome and priestood whosoeuer therefore doth seperate himselfe from christ doth withall depriue himselfe of his royaltie and his priesthood for we are not kings nor priests but in him and by him who is the soueraigne both priest and king so saint iohn teacheth in the first yea all the saints professe in the fift of the reuelation

you haue heard hitherto much of a king and a priest but these titles must not be misconstrued they fauour not the rebellion of corah

dathan and abiram nor anabaptisticall anarchie not the wrest of those words in daniel
the kingdome shall be giuen to the saints

as all are kings so are all priests and as all are priests so are all kings all are both spiritually without preiudice to ciuill or ecclesiasticall gouernment
the case is cleere both in the old and new testament

for notwithstanding this promise moses continued a king so hee is termed in israel and aaron with the leuites did minister in the tabernacle and the rebels against both were fearefully swallowed vp by the earth that cleft vnder them
and though the apostles giue vnto christians the same honourable title that god by moses giueth to israel yet doe they require them to be subiect to higher powers

and obey them that watch for their soules and threaten vengeance and damnation to such as are disobedient

wherefore that we be not carried away with the errour of the sonnes of belial let vs obserue first touching our roialtie that regnum dei est intra nos the kingdome here spoken of is a kingdome within vs and rex est qui se regit the king in this kingdome is he which ruleth himselfe well the sphere of this soueraigntie extendeth not farther then a mans owne person wee may not confound it with the kingdomes of this world with those powers that are ordaind of god for the peace and benefit of church and if we doe we doe misconstrue gods words and are vsurpers of the ciuill sword

so likewise must we conceiue of the priesthood for there is sacerdos in persona sua a priest that acteth only his owne person and there is sacerdos in persona aliena a priest that doth act the person of another
lay men are priests if they bee christian men but they act no bodies person but their owne they performe no other sacred duties but such as euery man doth owe to god the cleargie they are priests but they are so in persona aliena they represent the persons of others you may perceiue it in their forme of speeches they speake in

the plurall number we beseech thee lord wee praise thee god and all the people saith thereunto amen confessing in that word that the minister is but their mouth not that hee deriueth his power from them as if they had it habitually and communicated it actually to him for neuer can it be proued that holy orders were at any time in the multitude it hath euer beene either natiue or donatiue still by the appointment of god who made it natiue only to the at first and then to the seed of aaron and after their priesthood determined it became donatiue christ gaue it to his apostles and by his apostles tooke order to continue a succession but so as to deriue the power of holy orders still from them that were in holy orders so that undefined span alphabet in vse it was euer the whole churches as the sight of the eye is the sight of the whole bodie but undefined span alphabet in possession it was neuer

no more then the whole bodie could euer see
wee must not then confound the hierarchicall and the mysticall priesthood no more then we may the externall and the internall kingdome each must keepe within his bounds

and as we must in our priuate be religious as priests in seruing god so wee must not without a lawfull calling and a mans lawfull calling is not as anabaptists dreame his owne conceited abilitie but a mission and commission from lawfull superiours without such a calling say we may not intermeddle with pastorall functions

finally the publike kings and priests must neither of them abuse these titles neither of them must wrest this place
the romanists are carefull to remember kings that they play not priests they amplifie vzziahs example that was stricken with leprosie for being so presumptuous would they did aswell remember christs speech whose vicar the pope claymes to be

my kingdome is not of this world and that man who made me a iudge to diuide inheritances they would not so often being priests vsurpe vpon the sword
but let them take heed christ told saint peter

and they will find it one day true the priest that medleth with the sword shall perish by the sword the kings ouer whom the pope hath long tyrannized shall one day worke his ruine
and thus much of the eminencie of the churches state

come now to the sanctitie of their persons israel shall be an holy nation and indeed kings who are priests such as you haue heard described how can they chuse but bee holy especially seeing the persons that communicate in those titles are the

for the by the law were holy to the lord
and what is the oyle wherewith they were anointed

but oleum sanctitatis holy oyle what are their persons but temples of the holy ghost ieremie calleth them gods and saint iames telleth vs that all christians are a kind of to god

the church is by the apostle said to be a chast virgin without spot or wrinkle in the reuelation the spouse is clothed in fine white linnen

which is the righteousnesse of saints in the prophet she is called the land of righteousnesse finally in our creed the holy catholike church

king dauid required vertue in his seruants he that

walketh in a perfect way he shall serue mee how much more god to whom the psalmist speaketh thus lord who shall dwell in thy tabernacle who shall abide vpon thy holy hill god answereth hee that leadeth an vncorrupt life

but what is holinesse origen will teach vs the holinesse of a man must be conceiued as the holinesse of a beast a vessell a vestment now those things were separated from prophane vses and dedicated to sacred so must a man be first seperated from earth and earthly things he must not set his affections vpon them though he be in the world

yet hee must not be of the world hee must not loue the world nor the things in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life

he must haue no fellowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darknesse this is his separation the first branch of holinesse

the second is dedication his life must be deuoted vnto god christianitie is an imitation of the diuine nature a reducing of himselfe to the image of god in which he was created

to righteousnesse and holines of truth a shewing forth of the vertues of him that hath called vs into his maruellous light
if a man professe himselfe to be a painter and take vpon him to make the picture of a king and him doth hee not deserue iust blame yes surely for hee occasioneth strangers to thinke meanly of the kings person because of his ill fauoured portraiture and shall a christian escape punishment whose life is to be a visible representation of christ if infidels blaspheme christ while they iudge of him according to his counterfeit hee shall not
wherefore faciamus de terra coelum faith saint chrysostome

let vs represent heauen in earth let vs so liue as that men may say that god is in vs of a truth let our light so shine before men that they may see our good workes and glorisie our father which is in heauen
holinesse is the true characterizing qualitie of a christian it distinguisheth betweene the faithfull

and infidell they differ not in place in apparell in diet but in charitie in pietie in obedience in patience in euery christian vertue whatsoeuer shew a man make if he want these vertues he is but like the iuglers ape which being attired like a reasonable creature and dancing curiously to his masters instrument deceiued the people of alexandria vntill one espying the fraud threw a few dates vpon the stage which the ape no sooner espied but he tore all his vizard and fell to bis victuals to the scorne of his master which gaue occasion to the prouerbe an ape is an ape though hee bee clad neuer so gaily
nyssen applies it vnto men that call themselues christians professe that they know god

and that their hope is in heauen but no sooner doth any vanitie come in their way but their heart doth betray where there treasure is but let them remember the prouerbe it is a snare for a man to deuoure that which is holy origen applies it to the sacriledge that a man committeth that vowed himselfe in baptisme to the lord and giueth himselfe vnto the world
conclude this point with gods words in the law

be yee holy for am holy and with christs words in the gospell bee yee perfect

as your father in heauen is perfect sinne must not raigne in our mortall bodies because we are an holy nation

you see how the good which god offereth to israel is specified you must next heare how it is amplified that appeares in the words eritis mihi
as the proprietarie is so doth the value of a thing rise hee addeth to the worth at least to the esteeme thereof though man only to the esteeme yet god also to the worth for hee can proportion the creatures worth answerable to his esteeme he whose glorie shineth in the heauens and handie worke in the firmament doth declare his glorie much more in the church according to that in the prophet this people haue formed for my selfe

they shall bee to set forth my prayse

and indeed of what regard the church is with god we may gather out of that which god hath done for it he is become a father vnto it in christ and tendreth euery member thereof as his deare childe hee hath giuen his only begotten sonne to death for the saluation of it and made him the bridgeroome of the church the holy ghost doth he send to guide to comfort it and the angels are ministing spirits for their sakes that shall be heires of saluation
can any man beleeue this

and not beleeue that wee are a pretious treasure vnto god hee hath prouided for vs a kingdome that cannot be shaken

an immarescible crowne of glorie hee hath communicated vnto vs the throne of his owne sonne and giuen vs power ouer all our enemies and can wee doubt but we are kings vnto him

and as for our priesthood

that is as euident the prayer of the righteous auailes much their sufferings are to him sacrifices all their life is a sauour of a sweet smell and he is well pleased with the worke of their hands

finally they haue washed their robes white in the bloud of the lambe they are clothed with the righteousnesse of christ god vouchsafeth to conuerse with them to dwell with them therefore they are to him an holy nation

we that account our selues happie if wee bee deare to great men great if we be but pettie lords thinke not meanly of our selues if we be but priests vnto baal and looke bigge if we haue but the righteousnesse of a pharisie how happie should wee thinke our selues that are vouchsafed to be the fauorites of the king of kings how should we esteeme our selues that are made kings of heauen how should we glorie in our diuine priesthood and ioy in our true holinesse when we consider our selues as we are in our selues dust and ashes weake and wicked ones wee may well crie out with dauid who am lord and what is my fathers house that lord should be such a one vnto thee and sing the virgins hymne my soule doth magnifie the lord and my spirit hath reioyced in god my sauiour for he that is mightie hath magnified me
and when vnder the crosse wee find that in the eye of worldlings wee are reputed wormes and no men the reproch of men and the despised of the people when they oppresse

vs with more then egyptian bondage scoffe at the sighes and groanes which the holy ghost indites in vs and repute all our deuotion to bee but madnesse when they traduce vs as samaritans as friends of publicans and sinners yea as instruments of beelzebub and condemne vs to a shamefull death as pestilent fellowes traitours and blasphemers what greater comfort can we haue then this promise of god eritis mihi you shall be to me a peculiar treasure a kingdome of priests an holy nation but goe on

you haue heard of much good but what you haue heard doth not yet amount to a prerogatiue that appeares in these words aboue all people
when we haue good things that are not common to others especially if it be better then they haue any then haue we obtained a prerogatiue and this was israels case for the church was not now catholique as it had beene before abrahams time and was to bee after the comming of christ
gods promise was catholique to adam though cain played the apostata it was catholique also to noah but his children fell away therefore when gods reuiues it vnto abraham hee made it but particular and israel only was his inheritance in iuda was god knowne his name was great in israel

not that others might not bee if they would become israelites but ordinarily none but israelites or proselytes had part in the promise
therefore the law speaketh thus what nation is there so great

who hath god so nigh vnto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call vpon him for and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and iudgements so righteous as all this law that set before you this day and the psalmist god sheweth his word vnto iacob

his statutes and iudgements vnto israel he hath not dealt so with any nation
this is often repeated by moses deut
but especially chapter
seeing then god doth compare one nation vnto all people and preferre it he doth extoll his owne grace and teach vs that the blessing is singular and if singular then a prerogatiue and because singular and a prerogatiue the more to be esteemed

surely in worldly things we thinke so for what is he that hath any gist or good which others haue not who doth not esteeme it as much for the rarenesse as for the greatnesse thereof would wee did passe as true a iudgement vpon our heauenly treasures surely the church was wont to doe so pone me vt signaculum

saith the spouse set mee as a seale vpon thy arme and in her plea populus tuus omnes nos wee are thine enen the sheepe of thy pasture

as god doth honour vs aboue others so will hee that we be mindfull of his speciall fauour

put now together the greatnesse of the good which god offers with the singularitie of the fauour which god vouchsafeth israel and they will yeild vs a definition of the church for what is ecclesia but a people chosen out of the world and preferred before it in that it is gods peculiar treasure and to him a kingdome of priests and an holy nation

but leaue that point to your priuate meditations which will bee the fuller if you adde the next particular vnto it for that also is considerable in your contemplations of the church
that which god offers is a prerogatiue and such a prerogatiue as is gracious gather it first out of vos

yee yee shall bee vnto mee a peculiar treasure
and who are yee neither the most nor the best of people moses from god telleth them so bondslaues in egypt and much more bound to satan for they were a rebellious nation more base in minde then in condition and therefore god biddeth them looke vnto his free loue the cause of their deliuerance et dare non dignis res mage digna deo the lesse worth there appeares in the receiuer the more grace doth there shine from the giuer

as israels want of worth made the gift gracious so also was it gracious in that god was not driuen to make the choice out of any want for all the earth is mine saith god all nations they are the same by nature and it was free for god to make choice of any other the more choice god had the more grace hee vouchsafed to them whom hee chose so that wee must resolue the words thus although all the world be mine yet thou shalt be to me and so the offer will appeare absolutely free
what shall we say then vnto these things surely as god hath little cause by reason of our vilenesse to ioy that wee are his so wee haue great cause by reason of our happinesse to ioy that god is ours who would be ambitious after any woddly thing that may be partaker of this gracious prerogatiue

and all nations may partake of it
it is true that these words were spoken to israel and therefore the iewes at this day count all nations slaues beside themselues appropriating vnto themselues this prerogatiue but their pride should blush when it considers that god hath so many hundred yeares stript them of their spirituall ornaments and made them corporall slaues to all the world

saint peter applies this very text vnto christians and the foure and twentie elders confesse thus vnto christ

thou hast redeemed vs to god by thy bloud out of enerie kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made vs vnto our god kings and priests

these words then belong to vs

yet must wee not bee but feare

if israel lost his primogeniture so may we god may say to vs as iacob said to reuben for his sinne non excelles thou shalt bee disinherited

gnammi may become they are gods people may cease to bee his people
what is the way to preuent it surely dutie to consider of this gracious prerogatiue and indeuour carefully to partake thereof
if we esteeme it as it deserues and desire it as we ought we shall not faile to haue it and by it be entred into the houshold of saints those saints whose memory wee solemnize this day for they became such by this prerogatiue and this prerogatiue will make vs such if wee bee gods peculiar treasure here on earth wee shall be it much more in the kingdome of heauen by how much our gold shall be freer from drosse and no cloud shall dimme our precious jewels

if we be kings here in the state of grace our kingdome is but like that of dauid full of warre but when wee come to heauen our kingdome shall be like that of salomon it shall bee a kingdome of peace
and our which is now often interrupted and neglected often shall neuer depart from before god and wee shall sacrifice to him day and night

finally holy wee are now rather in the good purpose of our minde then in the performance of our life but then we shall bee trees of life euer laden with kindly fruit fit to honour to cheare both god and men

let vs all pray for and god grant vnto vs all such a beginning of this gracious prerogatiue in this life that we may haue the full consummation thereof with all the saints departed in the life to come amen

remember me lord with the fauour of thy people visit me with thy saluation that may see the felicitie of thy chosen and reioyce in the ioy of thy people and glorie with thine inheritance psal

now therefore if yee will obey my voice
then shall yee be

in the first message which from mount sinai god sent by moses vnto israel haue told you heretofore that there are contained two remarkable points the first sheweth what god requires the second what god offers
told you then also that the text leadeth me to consider these two points first seuerally then ioyntly haue already considered them seuerally haue shewed you what they meane it remaineth that now consider them ioyntly that shew you how they depend one vpon the other
and this obseruation draw from the reference of these two particles if and then if yee shall obey my voice
then yee shall be vnto me
but to deale more distinctly
out of this reference we may draw too good obseruations the first wee must not exspect what god doth offer except we performe what god doth require for thus speaketh the text if yee shall heare my voice and keepe my couenant then shall yee bee vnto me
the second we may not slicke at that which god requires because that which god offers doth infinitely exceed it that will be euident if wee compare them as they are laid downe in the text yee shall be vnto me a peculiar treasure aboue all people a kingdome of priests an holy nation if you heare my voice and if you keepe my couenant now there is no comparison betweene these

out of these two obseruations doe arise two other for this reference will teach vs that our faith and our charitie must goe before our hope for wee must heare gods voice which is the worke of faith and keepe gods conenant which is the worke of charitie before we can exspect to be gods peculiar treasure a kingdome of priests an holy nation which blessings are the matter of our hope
and backe againe our hope must keepe in heart both our faith and charitie for he that is thus resolued that he shall bee gods peculiar treasure a king to him and his priest finally holy to the lord no doubt no danger will stay him will quell him from hearing gods voice and keeping gods couenants he that so hopeth will beleeue and loue god

these are the particulars wherewith will endeauour god willing to order and quicken yours and mine owne faith hope and charitie pray god wee may all so listen to them as those that meane to liue by them

but before open them vnto you must acquaint you with a difference of gods spirituall promises of them some are absolute some are conditionals wee may not confound them absolute are all those prophecies of the messias to come and the worke of redemption foretold and presigured in the old testament whereof in the new we read the full accomplishment they take vp the first part of our creed and of all these absolute promises gods saying in esay is true my counsell shall stand and will accomplish all my will

mauger all the infidelitie of man and the machinations of satan without great absurditie yea impietie cannot these promises bee conceiued to depend on the will of any ereature angell or man

conditionall promises are those which concerne particular persons or states participation of christ incorporation into the church fruition of crernall life of all these the rule of saint austin is true quifecit te sine te non saluabit te sine te euerie person euerie state must put their hands to this worke or else it would neuer goe forward
my text doth containe a promise of this later sort a conditionall not an absolute promise
let vs come then to it

the first obseruation that made vpon the reference of if and then was this
we may not exspect what god doth offer except we performe what god requires
in conceiuing the mysterie of our redemption we must obserue a double method of god the one according to which he resolu'd on it the other according to which he was pleased to communicate it
if you looke vnto the first method that was first in gods intention which was last in his execution he resolued first vpon the end to manifest his mercie and iustice in sauing a certaine number out of the masse of perdition and leauing others to perish therein through their owne default and he made choice of and proportioned such meanes as in his wisedome might seeme fitest to compasse this end
if we denie this we make gods prouidence more indiscreete then is vsually that of well aduised men for in all their deliberations they begin at the end and according

to the rule of wisedome finis praescribit speciem mensuram mediorum they dispose all things answerable thereunto

but as when men haue done their deliberations and giue order for their worke they prescribe first the meanes in their order and by those meanes will haue such as they imploy to compasse those ends euen so doth god setting men in time on the way to their saluation wherevpon he was eternally resolued lead them first to the meanes without which it is not his pleasure they should euer come vnto their happie end
these two methods must not be confounded the method of publishing the gospell with the method of gods making the first decree thereof the decree of sauing men did not runne the same way with the decree of bringing men to saluation
would not obserue this darke point vnto you but that our english anabaptists are become plaine arminians as their pamphlets shew which they scatter abroad to corrupt the people
the ground of the errour of both as the learned may perceiue in ripping vp their discourses is the confounding of these different decrees and methods when they studie the mysterie of our saluation
but let vs come to plaine matter
god from the beginning though he were lord of all and might at his pleasure giue law to any yet hath he proceeded with his reasonable creatures by way of couenant now a couenant consisteth of mutuall stipulation or promise gods to vs and ours to god so runneth the law hoc fac viues to doe gods will was to be our promise and gods promise was to giue vs life so runneth the the gospell crede saluus eris we must yeeld faith vnto god and god will bestow saluation vpon vs it is the first thing children learne in their catechisme as they are taught that by baptisme they are made children of god members of christ and heires of the kingdome of heauen so likewise are they taught that by their suerties they haue vowed to renounce the diuell and all his workes the pompe and vanities of this wicked world to beleeue the articles of the creed and keepe gods holy commandements
there is then a mutuall conditioning betweene god and man man with god so iacob genes

which is generally to be obserued in all votiue prayers· god with man here and elswhere deut

and yet we may not mistake for there is great odds betweene these conditionings for when god conditioneth with man hee asketh nothing but what was due to him before all the obedience wee can performe is due by our natiue allegeance the allegeance which a creature oweth to his creatour but we in our conditioning with god may not desire ought of god which he hath not first promised for no creature may carue to himselfe hee must be contented with that which god will vouchsafe him and whatsoeuer he offers vnto vs is such as whereunto we haue otherwise no right
adde hereunto that we may bee sure of god that what he offers he will performe for with god there is no variablenesse nor shadow of change
scio cui crediderim

but he cannot bee so sure of vs omnis homo mendax we neuer abide stedfast in our couenant

but gods conditioning with vs must open vnto you a little more

fully
know then that though what god requires wee must performe yet performe it out of our owne strength we cannot originall sinne hath dinabled vs and by adding actuall vnto it wee are made lesse able though in regard of their natural gifts there is inequalitie betweene men yet a bono caelesti omnes aequè auersi nisi discriminet gratia
god requires that we should heare his voice

beleeue in him but a naturall man cannot perceiue the things of god yea hee will winke with his eyes and stop his eares least should see and heare returne and bee saued
god requires that we keepe his couenant

but the wisedome of the flesh is enmitie against god it is not it cannot be subiect to his law
yea so impotently are we giuen to spirituall fornication that though god graciously wooe vs yet gracelesly we reiect him
thereis no remedie then but the condition which god requires on our part must remaine vnperformed except he giue vs grace wherewith to performe it he must giue vs supernaturall power to performe this supernaturall worke

quis te discernit quid habes quod non accepisti he biddeth vs heare his voice beleeue in him whereas faith is his gift he must purifie our hearts by faith
he biddeth vs keepe his couenant and loue him but charitie is a fruit of the spirit

and this fire must be kindled from heauen god must circumcise our hearts and make vs keepe his lawes dat non tantum nouas reuelationes bonas voluntates for no man can come to the sonne except the father draw him ex nolente faciens volentem as saith saint austin

but if god giue that which we must giue to god how is the worke ours surely thus though god giue the abilitie yet hee will haue vs make vse of it vse the eye of faith which he doth illighten and so obey his voice vse the charitie wherewith he doth seasen our hearts and set our affections vpon him let it be our chiefest care to hold fast vnto him if we doe so we shall be reputed performers of the condition for grace doth not take away the libertie of our will though it giues new qualities working vpon it not onely physically but morally also
yet here againe remember that we need a second grace that we may make vse of the first for our vnderstanding though enlightned may bee circumuented with sophistrie and our will may bee transported with vanitie euen after god hath sanctified it though otherwise the will doth tend naturally to good when it is sanctified as the vnderstanding to truth
it is cleare in adam and eues case immediately vpon their creation after gods image how foully were they by the serpent how shamefully did they plunge themselues in sinne in the full integritie of their nature and if they could stand so little in the fulnesse of grace how little shall we bee able to stand that come so short of their their measure least therefore we make no vse of our abilitie god must be pleased to doe for vs that which he was not pleased to doe for them hee must in compassion of our frailtie either keepe off temptations or arme vs against them hee must giue vs grace to make vse of his grace
in any other sense to conceiue that the first grace is indifferent and our will doth determine it is an arminian dreame

not that we are excusable if hauing abilities we doe not vse them for

temptations worke not physically but morally perswade they may they cannot compell and it is plaine that wee doe not vse that care and conscience in trying the fallacies wherewith wee are tempted to disbelieue god and those allurements which endeauour to withdraw vs from god as wee doe in reading the discourses of humane arts and entertaining aduises concerning our worldly state
therefore wee are without all excuse and should iustly perish for our sinne when wee neglect the meanes that are giuen vs of god inward or outward
and indeed all would so perish that haue them because all would so neglect them did not god as well follow as preuent some with his grace prouide by a second that they receiue not the first grace in vaine

you haue not yet heard the vttermost that god doth for vs toward the performance of this condition for the condition must bee performed not for a day or a yeare but all our life long it is not enough for to heare gods voyce to day and to morrow to despise it to day to bee true to him and to bee false to morrow our faith and our charitie must be as lasting as our life
but alas our faith and our charity haue their wanings they fall often into a sowne wee breake euery day with god and if wee breake with him hee is no longer bound to vs yet he doth not so deale with vs nor take the aduantage which wee doe giue him hee is like a kind landlord who when his tenant neglecteth his couenant and he by vertue of the lease may make a forbeares and giues his tenant leaue to salue the forfeiture hee is toward vs and giueth vs space to repent and returne to our good god which is alwayes ready to receiue vs vnto grace and to pardon our offences
yet we may not presume of this vpon the couenant for when god doth it hee doth it vpon another ground vpon the ground of predestination
yea that which the kindest land lord vseth not to doe god out of his goodnesse doth supply vs with those helpes whereby wee may recouer againe his fauour by the ministry of his word or some other meanes hee seasonably worketh in vs repentance and faith and indeed this is a great hight of grace

that hee that beginnineth this good worke in vs will perfect it to the day of the lord that wee are thus preserued by the power of god and that hee doth so put his feare into vs

that wee depart not from him totally or finally

what shall wee say then to these things seeing that god by grace is alpha and omega the beginning and the end the author and the finisher of the performance of the condition required therefore though wee performe what wee are commanded yet must wee giue him the glory and hee that doth glory must glory in the lord

will shut vp this first obseruation with two good admonitions
the first shall bee this when wee receiue these commands from god heare my voyce keepe my couenant let vs humbly pray with saint austin da domine quod iubes iube quod vis lord enable mee to obey thee and then lay vpon me what commandement thou wilt
or rather if you will let vs pray as the church teacheth vs when wee heare the ten commandements lord haue mercie vpon vs and encline outr hearts to keepe thy law

and god giue vs all this spirit of grace and prayer

the second admonition let vs take from saint peter brethren giue all diligence by the practice of christian vertues to make your calling and election sure for if yee doe these things you shall neuer fall if wee follow the first admonition god will not bee wanting vnto vs if the second wee shall not bee wanting vnto our selues
thus much of the first obseruation

the second followeth we must not sticke at that which god requires because that which god offers doth infinitely exceed it that which god requires is neither thanke worthy nor in comparison of any worth
it is not thanke worthy for what thankes doth a man deserue for yeilding that which he doth otherwise owe to god nay which god as before you haue heard doth giue him to bestow
will not againe amplifie these two points adde a third what thankes doth a man deserue for working his owne perfection for to heare gods voice and to keepe his couenant are the perfection both of our head and of our heart they were first qualified for this vse and this vse is their happinesse
it is true that so long as concupiscence doth distemper our soule these imployments at first are not so pleasing they rellish as medicines to a sicke bodie
and if you marke it well this is no small difference betweene vertue and vice wickednesse is sweete in the mouth and a man hideth it vnder his tongue but when hee hath swallowed it it is like the gall of aspes vnto his conscience but with vertue it is cleane otherwise the first time wee enter thereupon is the harshest time

the longer wee are acquainted the better friends shall we be put thy feet saith the sonne of syracke into wisdomes fetters and thy necke into her chaine bow downe thy shoulder and beare her and be not grieued with her bonds

for at last thou shalt find rest and it shall be turned to thy ioy for then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee and her chaine a robe of glorie
he that maketh his eare liable to gods voice maketh his eare happie and he maketh his heart happie that maketh it stedfast in the couenant of god for wherein can hee take more contentment and doth a man deserue thankes for thus bringing his owne person to perfection

put the case these things were thanke worthy yet certainly in comparison they are but of little worth for of what worth is the obedience of a seruant in regard of the fauour of a soueraigne that vouchsafeth him to bee his fauourite of what worth is our loue of god which is our soueraigne good in regard of gods loue of vs which haue in vs no louelinesse at all

nay marke it biddeth vs tender our selues vnto him and what are we but as earthen vessels and what doth hee with vs hee maketh vs vessels of gold the peculiar treasure of the king of heauen
he biddeth vs obey but that hee may make vs commanders wee must heare his voice keepe his couenant these are markes of obedience but thereupon we shall be kings and priests those are markes of authoritie
finally hee biddeth vs apply our selues vnto him which doth

beseeme a creature and hee will make vs like vnto himselfe like vnto our creatour we shall be holy as he is holy

behold here then the bountie of god and folly of man the bountie of god who giueth though according to our capacitie yet not according to our deserts hee giueth as beseemeth himselfe according to the widensse of his owne greatnesse and goodnesse doth hee fill his creatures with his blessings especially man and aboue all men these whom hee receiueth into the church
a man would haue thought that it had beene mercie enough in god in such a strange fashion to deliuer israel out of egypt to take such sharpe vengeance vpon their enemies to promise the israelites that they should not bee subiect to the plagues of egypt and that hee would bring them into a good land a land flowing with milke and honie a man would thinke say that these blessings did more then deserue their best obedience and fidelitie and they could in reason desire no more but so to deale with them was not enough in the eye of gods bountie he measureth vnto them with a more liberall hand and how often doth he giue vnto euery one of vs more not only then we deserue but also then we can desire especially concerning our spirituall state wherein hee is most bountifull to the meanest of his chil+dren

as god exceeds in bountie so doe men in folly for their eares are open to none seldomer then vnto god to whom they are due neither are they false to any so much as vnto him
let the world or the deuill or our owne flesh sollicit vs how attentiue how credulous are we how willingly doe we suffer our selues to bee deceiued to bee robbed by them but when god speaketh to vs whose word is truth who counselleth nothing but for our eternall good how heauie eared are we shall say nay how rebellious christ may complaine haue laboured in vaine haue spent my strength in vaine

all the day long haue stretched out my hands to an vnbeleiuing and a gainesaying nation

yet this is not the vttermost of our follies for in our falshood to god we are not only contented to be robbed by others but rather then wee will not haue our will to doe our selues mischiefe we will hire them that shall rob vs god in ezekiel obserueth it in the resemblance of the israelues to a strange kind of harlot for whereas vsually they are hired to be naught she did vse to hire her louers and prodigally to bestow vpon them the blessings which shee had receiued from god that with them shee might commit spirituall fornication against god so much more doth our sottishnesse esteeme our chiefest enemies then the author of our soueraigne good
this folly first tooke place in eue wherewith she infected adam and from them both doe we all deriue it and there is none of vs which doth not vsually betray it witnesse the many good sermons which we heare and whereby we profit little but runne madding after euery vanitie that woes vs and euery new corruption how suddenly doth it ouerspread most of vs

will dwell no longer vpon these primitiues obseruations come to those which deriued from them

there are three vertues which are called theologicall faith hope and charitie of these three consisteth as it were the life of a christian man now though they are all three giuen to a christian at one time yet in nature one of them goeth before another
this text will teach vs how we must order them faith must haue the first place for wee must first heare gods voice

and to heare gods voice is the worke of faith
and indeed the apostle telleth vs that hee that commeth vnto god must beleeue and without faith it is impossible to please god
saint austin therefore maketh faith the foundation of our spirituall building we must begin our pietie there
there is in euery one of vs by nature a knowledge of god and so a kind of pietie but this will not make a man gods peculiar treasure but the limiting of our pietie to his voice and performing his couenant for naturally men vanish in their discourse and undefined span alphabet doth not please god

the next vertue must be charitie for as heate springeth from light euen so doth charitie from faith faith worketh by charitie and as a man beleeues so will he loue
now charitie is meant by keeping gods couenant that is the worke of charitie

but withall obserue that faith and charitie both goe before hope for wee must heare gods voice and keepe his couenant before wee can looke to be his peculiar treasure which is the matter of our hope if we doe not we shall be peruerse seruants hope vntowardly for sine fide spes non habet firmamentum a man that doth not beleeue cannot hope how should a man hope for good from him whom he doth not belieue and sine charitate spes non habet inuitamentum hee should not hope that doth not loue and loue is a strong incouragement vnto hope
a very heathen could say undefined span alphabet

they that are well bred hope not but vpon sound reason
saint paul

a better author saith that faith is the ground of things hoped for hee then that hopeth without faith hath an vngrounded hope
the same heathen author saith that the hopes of a vertuous soule are genuine but if they be in a vitious soule they are but bastards iob compares them vnto a spidersweb the booke of wisdome varieth the resemblance of them with great cloquence yee that feare the lord trust in him
quaenam spes hypocritae what hope hath the hypocrite seeing then that vice can bee no ground of hope it is not without cause that saint paul in his two apologies which he maketh for himselfe the one to the high priest acts
the other to agrippa acts
layeth for the foundation of his hope his care to keepe a good conscience and indeed by how much the more a man loueth god the bolder may he be to trust in him

when faith and charitie haue done their worke and yeilded their furtherance vnto hope then commeth hope in seasonably with her worke and maketh amends vnto them both by quickning both faith

and charitie
first it quickneth our faith hope

saith clemens alexandrinus est sanguis sidei it is the bloud of faith and you know what the law saith in sanguine anima in the bloud is the life of that thing whose bloud it is certainly the life of our faith is in bloud of hope for the more we let out this bloud the weaker groweth our faith and he that despaires will quickly become an apostata therefore that wee may bee constant in our faith when the windes blow and the waues beate and wee are tost in the seas of this world with perplexing doubts wee must take sure anchorhold in heauen wee must draw vp our soules in that golden chaine of hope and by it bee as it were present with our future felicitie

and then wee shall find that it is as saint peter calls it spe viua a liuing hope it will answere its definition spes est futurae pollicitationis religiosus assensus hope most deuoutly resteth vpon the promises of god the performances whereof are yet for to come it is vnto vs a second faith

as it doth thus keepe our faith in heart so doth it our charitie also for it biddeth our charitie not to consider what it leaueth but what it shall haue spes semper in tendit non retrò respicit it forgetteth the world which wee haue forsaken and still presseth forward vnto the blessed estate whereunto wee are called
christ for

the ioy that was set before him endured the crosse and despised the shame and moses and the prophets that forsooke their countrie their kinred their profit their pleasure were animated hereunto by hauing an eye to the recompence of reward
had vtterly fainted

saith king dauid but that verily looke to see the goodnesse of the lord in the land of the liuing

gregorie nyssen hath a wittie conceit undefined span alphabet afflictions are but the flowres of eternall felicitie wee must them willingly gather the flowres for the fruits sake
and indeed many abhorre the flower because their hearts are not stedfastly set vpon the fruit wherefore when our charitie to godward groweth cold let vs rowse it and warme it as dauid did his why art thou cast downe my soule and why art thou so disquieted within mee hope thou in god for shall yet praise him who is the helpe of my countenance and my god
saint chrysostome meditating vpon those word of the psalmist
trust in god why say yee then to my soule flie hence as a bird to the mountaines giueth vs a good obseruation spes omnia componit hope calmeth all things he falleth vpon diuers particulars which dishearten men from the seruice of god banishment into a wildernesse who will bee disquieted with it that hopeth that god will accompanie him there dreadfull armies besieging vs what need we feare seeing our hope is confident that hee that is with vs is mightier then they that are against vs the racke and threatning vs torture the foresight of our crowne will make vs senselesse of our most bitter crosse
in a word no man euer

trusted in god and was confounded he that buildeth vpon this principle whatsoeuer hee suffereth for god will neuer bee disheartned

but may not forget to put you in minde of a good saying of austines qualis res talis spes godlinesse hath the promise of this life and the life to come if our hope rest vpon the earthly thing it is but an earthly hope it becomes heauenly if it bee carried vnto those things which are heauenly
god dieteth his children in regard of things earthly he would haue them hope for them as if they did not hope as those that can be contented to want them when god thinketh it not fit to bestow them but the hope which must support both faith and charitie it must be a resolute hope of this plentifull reward that is promised in my text of the gracious prerogatiues of the church we must looke for them assuredly and without wauering long for them such a hope will keepe our faith waking and our loue working donec spes fiat res till god make good his word

draw to an end
that which god offers in reward of that which hee requires doth as in the last sermon told you amount to as much as ius primogeniturae the of gods
you know the storie of esau he had it in a type and sold it for a messe of pottage saint pauls admonition giuen thereupon to the hebrewes shall be mine to you

let there bee no such profane person amongst you esau when hee had so despised his found no place of repentance though he sought it with teares and we if we neglect the hope of so great saluation offered vs in refusing the condition which god requires of vs shall weepe and sue in vaine with those wretches in the gospel after the doore is shut and find no entrance into the kingdome of heauen

wherefore will close vp my sermon as the sonne of syracke closeth vp his behold saith hee with your eies how that haue had but little labour and haue gotten me much rest
worke therefore your worke betimes and in his time he will giue you your reward
and god grant we may so performe that which god requires that wee may obtaine what hee doth offer and in due time find that faithfull is he that promiseth and that saying in the psalme to bee true
in keeping of his commandements there is great reward

vers
and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him
and all the people answered together and said all that the lord hath spoken we will doe

on the two verses immediately going before we heard of a gracious message which god by moses sent vnto israel on these two verses we shall heare that moses deliuered it and the israelites returned an answere to it
touching the deliuerie of the message we must obserue first to whom moses maketh his report and secondly how hee doth discharge himselfe therein
he maketh his report vnto the gouernours of the tribes for he called the elders of people
and in his report hee dischargeth himselfe fully and clearely fully for he reported all which god had commanded him vnto them and cleerely for what was commanded him he laid before their faces
touching the answere wee are to consider first who maketh it then what manner of answere it is that is made
they that make it are the congregation the people answered and said
and in them wee find here two commendable things vnanimitie and alacritie
vnanimitie for they ioyned together in the answere all the people answered and said
alacritie for not one stucke at it euery one was as forward as another they answered all together
as for the manner of their answere it is a consent they accept of the motion which god maketh by moses they will doe
in this acceptance there is an obserueable mixture of very much modestie and ouermuch considence they doe not presume and yet they doe presume
they doe not presume for whereas in the message there was something which god required of them and something which god offered vnto them they passe in silence that which god doth promise and doe not capitulate for that
neither doe they limit god in that which be requires they yeild absolutely vnto it all that the lord hath said we will doe
in these two points they shew very much modestie they doe not presume

looke vpon the words againe and you will acknowledge in the answere ouermuch confidence you will confesse they doe presume presume of their abilitie and presume of the extent of their abilitie
for what say they faciemus we will doe that which god commandeth yea

faciemus omnia we will doe all that which god commandeth
and are either of these in mans power can hee make good the least of these vndertakings surely he cannot
therefore they lay too hard an obligation vpon themselues and so expresse in their answere ouermuch confidence
though as you shall heare anone there is a commendablenesse in their confidence

these are the particulars which purpose god willing to speake of at this time pray god we may all so heare as to imitate that when god sendeth a gracious message vnto vs wee may returne no worse answere then israel doth vnto god

the first particular that pointed at

was the persons to whom moses maketh his report they are the gouernours of the tribes who are here called the elders of the people
but the elders when they note gouernours are in this booke vnderstood two manner of wayes elders by birth and elders by choice
elders by birth such were all the first gouernours in the world as parents in their families and the firstborne of many brethren after the death of parents by the law of nature and in this sense doth moses speake of elders in the third and in the twelfth of this booke
but because the eldest in yeares are not alwayes the wisest nor the most vpright therefore when the israelites became a nation moses ordained elders by choice as appeares in the chapter next before this he made such persons gouernours as hee thought were best qualified for such an imployment
and these gouernours still retained the name of elders partly because they were as neere as might be chosen our of those that were eldest in age as appeares in the fore cited place or at least such as succeeded them in their right

and partly because wisdome is grey haires and an vnspotted life is old age
their office giueth them this title to put them in minde that the maturitie of their iudgement and the grauitie of their carriage must be such as be seemeth the ancientest of the people
so haue the very heathen conceiued

as may be gathered out of the lacedaemonian undefined span alphabet the roman senatus both of them assemblies of ancient men ancient not so much for their yeares as for their good parts
and we also in our gouernours ciuill and ecclesiasticall retaine this title giuen by the holy ghost
for in corporations the chiefe are called aldermen and in the church the pastors are called presbyters or priests that is elders of the church

the only obseruation that will giue vpon the title is this interpretetur quisque vocabulum suum nitatur id esse quod dicitur let euery one in authoritie consider often of this his name and endeuour that his life may be answerable vnto it
the rather because there can bee no shrewder prognostication of a states or a churches downefall then the degenerating of those elders into youngsters whether in head or heart whether greene witted or inordinately affected

but why doth moses make his report vnto the elders surely because there was of it a kind of necessitie and in it a very good policie
a kind of necessitie there was because the voice of one man though neuer so

strong a voice could not be heard by such a multitude
therefore as in great armies and this was a very great one it consisted of six hundred thousand men besides women children and a rabble of strangers that acco~panied them as say in great armies the general calleth the vndercommanders and acquaints them with his pleasure that by them it may be made knowne to their seuerall companies euen so dealeth moses what by himselfe he could not doe he is faine to doe by these elders by them he reporteth the message vnto all the congregation of israel
yea and sometimes when all israel is named you must necessarily vnderstand immediately the elders
this he did of necessitie

but with this necessitie there was a very good policie for the gouernours being newly created he did inure them to exercise their authoritie and the people to reuerence the word of their mouth that so the ordinance might not be in vaine
and according to this rule doth saint peter direct christians to be subiect to all manner of ordinance of man not only to the king as supreme but also to those that are sent from him
there is not the meanest officer but he hath some beame of the kings power which challengeth from the people a proportionable respect
you haue heard to whom moses maketh his report let vs now see how he dischargeth himselfe therein
surely he sheweth himselfe a faithfull and a wise messenger faithfull for he deliuereth his message fully wise for hee deliuereth his message cleerely
let vs consider these points asunder

he deliuereth his message fully for he told the elders all that the lord commanded him
it is the rule of the law

thou shalt not adde nor take from it it is the promise of our sauiour that the spirit should lead the apostles into all truth and bring into their remembrance all that hee had spoken
and for practice we haue our sauiour christ

all that haue heard of my father haue made knowne vnto you and saint paul haue shewed you all the counsell of god
these are in the new testament

and in the old testament micheas the prophet when the messenger of ahab would haue had him doe as the other prophets did that is

speake pleasingly to the king as the lord liueth saith hee what the lord saith vnto me that will speake
nay balaam though otherwise hee loued the wages of iniquitie yet did hee answere balaks messengers

though balak would giue me his house full of gold yet can not goe beyond the word of the lord to doe either more or lesse
from these good rules and these good precedents they that are honoured to bee gods messengers must learne that it beseemes referendaries to keepe themselues to their instructions and deliuer so much as and no more then they haue receiued in charge

but to speak a litle more distinctly to this point
the message did consist of two branches first that which god required secondly that which god offred
moses that did deliueral gods co~mandements deliuered both these branches he informed them of their dutie aswell as of gods mercy and of gods mercy no lesse then of their dutie
and indeed both are requisite

to be taught our dutie that wee doe not presume gods mercie that we doe not despaire omit either and you may me the doctrine of gods couenant
there is also committed vnto vs the law and the gospel the one to humble the other to comfort men we ought to conioyne both and you must be content to heare of your dutie aswell as of gods mercie

we preach them both to our people the papists charge vs with taking from the doctrine of the couenant but the bookes of our confession the articles and catechismes and the booke of our deuotion our publike lyturgie and finally the homilies which are appointed to be read vnto the people refute this slander
but wee iustly charge them with adding to the doctrine of the couenant the bookes apochryphall and their vngrounded traditions and wee remember them of that saying of salomon

adde not to gods word lest he reprooue thee and thou be found a liar
and what wee haue censured in them are nothing else but the forgeries of mens braines which may not bee reputed the oracles of god
therefore though we call vpon you dutifully to heare and receiue aswell what god requires as what hee promiseth yet as necessarily to saluation wee doe not wee should not call vpon you to heare more then he requires or to beleeue more then he promiseth

but enough of moses fidelitie let vs now see his wisdome
as hee dischargeth himselfe fully so doth hee discharge himselfe clearely also
for he laid all that god commanded him before the faces of the elders nec incautis nec nescientibus ingeritur lex

here first we meete with a strange phrase for can words bee laid before mens faces you would expect that the text should haue said moses spake that which god commanded in the eares of the people and here wee find their eares turned into eyes
when the holy ghost meaneth euidence of speech it vseth to expresse it in such significant tearmes
saint paul telling the galathians of his perspicuous preaching the gospell vnto them

saith that iesus christ was described in their sight and crucified before them
although the holy ghost doe speake to some in parables

that in hearing they may heare and not vnderstand which he doth in punishment of their contempt of euident truth which hath beene laid before them

because as the prouerbe is pearles are not to bee cast vnto swine nor holy things vnto dogs yet to those that heare with a reuerent and an obedient eare

datum est nosse mysteria regnicoelorum the parables are vnfolded the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen are laid before their face

to open this point a little better
we must distinguish the couenant of god from the illustrations and amplifications thereof
the couenant it selfe both old and new is plainly deliuered whether you respect that which god requires or that which godoffers aswel in this chapter as in other parts of the bible
but there are many illustrations and amplifications of either of these typicall mysticall darke and hard to be vnderstood which the people cannot vnderstand without an interpreter

ea which the interpreter himselfe cannot vnderstand without manifold helpe helpe of deuotion that gods spirit may inlighten him and helpe of meditation painfully scanning and comparing the branches of the text with other places finally helpe of varietie of humane literature which giueth great light sometimes to the phrase sometimes to the matter in hand
but aboue al in matters necessarie to saluation we follow catholike tradition
this we say
and yet the wrangling romanists beare the world in hand that wee say there is no difficultie in the scriptures and that for their guide wee referre the people only to their priuate spirit which are grosse vntruths
we encourage the people to read the scripture and tell them that though there bee some depths therein wherein an elephant may swimme yet there are some such shallowes wherein a lambe may wade
the simplest may meete there with all parts of their catechisme the ten commandements the articles of their creed the lords prayer the sacraments
these points containe the substance of the couenant and they are plainly deliuered there
and more then these are not necessarie to saluation
some may haue more some lesse vnderstanding of these according to their breeding yet all should vnderstand these
and for this purpose did moses and the prophets christ and his apostles and the fathers of the primitiue church commend vnto the people the reading of the scriptures
but we aduise them to leaue vnto the learned at least to learne of them to vnderstand those things that are vailed and soberly to edifie their pietie with these things which they shall find there vnuailed or laid before their faces

haue done with the deliuerie of the message come now to the answere that is made thereunto
and here we are to take notice first who maketh it the whole congregation the people answered
but doe not you remember that the message was deliuered to the elders why then doe the people answere surely because the elders receiued it to deliuer it to the people and therefore not only the elders but the people also were to make an answere

some are of opinion that the elders were the representatiue bodie of all the people and that their consent was the consent of all and that all were bound by that which they did as in parliaments the chosen knights and burgesses in synods the chosen proctors of the clergie haue such obliging voices
which conceit the romanists wrest so farre as therupon to make the tenents of the elders of the church the ground of the peoples faith to which purpose they also abuse the maxime of cyprian ecclesia est in episcopo the church subsisteth in the bishop vbi non sunt sacerdotes ecclesia non est
the same premises serue aswell to conclude for the lyturgie in an vnknowne tongue and for their priuate masse
for if the people may beleeue because their bishops beleeue they may aswell as indeed they doe serue god in the priest and in the priest they may communicate without any their priuitie to what hee doth or any their cooperation with him from which they are necessarily

excluded by priuate masses and vnknowne prayers
but the reason why the people are said to answere to that message which is said to haue beene deliuered to the elders will better bee declared by another simily taken from an armie
in the spirituall host of the lord euery one taketh sacramentum militare and solemnely professeth his consent to the couenant
in the old testament children of eight dayes old when they were circumcised and receiued the seale of god had their sureties that vndertooke for them that they should stand to the couenant
so in the new testament when children were baptized they anciently had as appeares by the ancient lyturgie and so now they are required to haue sureties that vow in their name
whereby it is cleare that the church hath euer taught that the stipulation necessarie in the couenant doth personally concerne the people and that they cannot vnburden themselues of it vpon their elders and therefore of purpose the holy ghost nameth not the elders but the people when it specifieth the answerers
although we will not denie that of the stipulation made by the people the elders which heard it made report vnto moses

hauing found the answerers we must obserue two commendable things in them whereof the first is vnanimitie for they ioyned all in the answere
the word all is taken sometimes communitèr sometimes vniuersalitèr that is sometimes for the greater part sometimes for euery particular person
againe whereas men are ranged into diuers degrees some nobles some commons some rulers some subiects
all doth sometimes note only genera singulorum all sorts of men sometime singula generum euery one of euery sort
the vnanimitie which is here meant is of the largest size and signifieth not only the greater part but euery one not only all sorts of men but euery one of euery sort
and indeed if in the message you shall heare you shall be god doe meane euery one of euerie ranke then all in the answere must meane so for all that were spoken vnto answered
god in his couenant as the ministers haue authoritie to promulge it comprehendeth all wee are to preach the gospel to all and tender the sacraments to all

all must heare all must receiue god will haue all men saued and come to the knowledge of his truth
if any be excluded hee excludeth himselfe
yet are there in the world of such wretched men many more then of those that doe consent for many more are infidels then christians
and betweene those that consent there is not that vnanimitie as is to be wished some hold of paul some of apollo some of cephas the east church against the west and the west against the east and each part hath its subdiuisions thus the seamelesse coate of christ is rent into many pieces
would wee could all learne vnanimitie of these israelites and that with one heart and voice wee would make the same restipulation vnto god which here they did

besides their vnanimitie there is in them a commendable alacritie
for they did not only answere all but they did answere all at once all the people answered together
there are two wayes of collecting voices

per scrutinium by priuate whispering in the eare or some other priuate course or viua voce by a free and open deliuerie of the mind
the first was thought sit to auoid quarrels that were likely to arise if the voices were knowne who gaue them
but when men vse not the benefit of that course but undefined span alphabet with open face professe their consent it is a signe they are neither ashamed nor afraid of their doings which are the characters of a chearefull heart
whereas therefore they might priuately haue exprest their consents and they do it openly it is a plaine argument of their alacritie but were not this yet their answering altogether putteth it out of question
saint paul telleth vs that in a race all runne but one carrieth the prize and therefore he biddeth all so runne as that euery one may obtaine
now these so answered

as that no precedencie of voice could be distinguished and while euery one did striue to speake first all their voices made vp but one first voice
so willingly did they all consent that one was not suffered to bee more forward then another
the like shall you find in exod
in esdras and in the booke of chronicles when the people come to professe their readines to stand to gods couenant
and god is pleased that there should be monuments extant of the forwardnesse of his people to receiue him as there are of his enemies to reiect him
in the parable of the mariage feast the inuited guests undefined span alphabet without deliberation

and with too much readinesse refused to come
and shall wee not be as forward that doe purpose to come god loueth a chearefull giuer as of his goods

so of himselfe
and in this case the old prouerbe is true bis dat qui dat will interpret it by those words of christ in the gospel

the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence and the violent take it

enough of the answerers let vs come now to the answere

the answere doth containe their acceptance they promise that they will stand to the couenant which was represented to them by moses
neither had they receiued the law except they had first had a disposition to be commanded
god will not couenant with the vnwilling his people must be as the psalmist calleth them populus

a willing people
especially those that are parties to the couenant of grace for that is a coniugall couenant and a coniugall couenant is knit by loue both parties consent with a readie minde
god inquires after his former gifts in vs for our capacitie of more
therefore we may not looke that god will offer force to our will by grace hee away the seruilitie but the libertie of our will he neuer taketh away our choice is free such as beseemeth reasonable men
yea the nearer god draweth vs vnto him the more in our doing will he haue vs like vnto himselfe hee will haue vs not only to doe well but to doe it willingly

whereupon will follow two things the one is that we cannot murmurre against god for imposing the law seeing he layeth no heauier burden vpon vs then we are willing to vndergoe
the other that wee cannot excuse our inconstancie seeing what we did resolue on we resolued vpon it aduisedly we liked well of the conditions when we first entred into the couenant
and certainly as it doth adde much to

gods mercy that hee would take this louing course so it will adde much vnto our sinne if hauing vpon deliberation dutifully accepted what god doth offer we shall gracelesly breake with god

but in this acceptance of the israelites there is a remarkable mixture of contrarie qualities modestie and confidence for therein they doe not presume and yet they doe presume
first see their modestie

you must call to mind that in the message sent them there were two parts the one shewed what god required of them the other what he offered to them
in their answere they shew much modestie in regard of both parts will shew that modestie first that respects what god doth offer
obserue then that in their answere they passe that ouer insilence they doe not capitulate with god for it
and indeed the stipulation of our dutie must bee absolute and not conditionall though gods promise to vs bee conditionall and not absolute
and why we owe our dutie to god absolutely and gods mercie is not due to vs but out of his gracious promise
so that to capitulate would imply a deniall of our natiue obligation and that we would not obey were it not for the adoptiue besides wee should seeme to doubt whether god will be as good as his word as god hath reason to doubt of vs that we will not be so good as our word
so that to put a difference betweene gods fidelitie and ours this branch of the israelites modestie may beseeme vs all it may beseeme vs rather assuredly to expect then vnmannerly to capitulate for that which god doth promise so deale children with their parents subiects with their soueraignes and we much more ought so to deale with god our father and our soueraigne in heauen
our eies yea and our hearts too must be more vpon that which god requires then vpon that which god doth promise
not that we may not hearten our selues with that which god doth promise yea and remember god of it also in our prayers after the example of the patriarch iacob

but if wee bee silent wee doe in godly humilitie insinuate that we hold our selues vnworthy of it and we shall speed neuer a whit the worse
for what wee forbeare to doe out of this consciousnesse of our vnworthinesse god will supply out of his abundant goodnesse hee will set an honourable estimate vpon our dutie and will take it as worthy of whatsoeuer hee doth promise
we cannot vnderualue our selues so much as god will ouerualue vs

the second branch of their modestie is that replying to that which god requires they doe not limit him but yeild their obedience as farre as he requires it
yea if you compare the clauses you shall find that god spake but indefinitely
if you will heare my voice if you will keepe my couenant but they doe answere vniuersally all that the lord hath said we will doe they submit themselues vnto gods charge in the largest sense
and indeed this is true pietie not to carue out our owne obedience but to let god carue it out we must absolutely captiuate our wits vnto his wisdome and surrender our wils wholy vnto his pleasure his law must be the bounderie of our life

hitherto you haue seene that in their answere there is much modestie

much modestie you haue seene they doe not presume
but told you that if we looke vpon the words a second time we shall find that there is ouer much confidence in them we shall find that they doe presume

they presume first of their abilitie faciemus we doe not thinke gods commandements impossible we will doe that which god commandeth wee thinke wee may aduenture to promise so much

saint iames checkes mans confidence in a smaller matter goe to saith he you that say to day and to morrow we will goe to such a place and there buy and sell whereas you should say if we liue if the lord will
if our abilitie bee so small in regard of those things which are here below and concerne this animall life that we may not presume of our selues but vnder such a condition how much more must we adde a condition when wee speake of those greater matters those that concerne our spirituall life here wee should adde if gods grace be sufficiently vouchsafed me if hee shall be pleased that his strength bee made perfect in my weaknesse
for auxilium speciale is more extraordinarie then generale and we must begge the speciall the generall will not suffice is this case
if king dauid confessed and did as it were wonder at gods grace that himselfe and his people offered their goods so willingly vnto god how much more commeth it of grace and grace to be wondred at that a man doth wholly and cheerefully deuote himselfe vnto the seruice of god therefore we must all remember that item which christ gaue to saint peter a great vndertaker in this kind

the spirit is willing but the flesh is weake and imitate saint paul a more modest vndertaker who affirmeth of himselfe can doe all things

but it is through christ which strengthneth me
wherefore what the israelites omitted we must in all these vowes supplie if god shall conuert if god shall incline our hearts otherwise our vndertaking will sauour of too much confidence and we shall be guiltie of presuming

it was too much that they presumed of their abilitie but see their confidence goeth farther they presume of the extent of their abilitie also faciemus omnia we will doe all that the lord commandeth vs certainely if they will doe so much they will doe more then euer any man did or can doe except him that was both god and man our lord iesus christ
to make this plaine vnderstand that in the law there are two parts the affirmatiue and the negatiue and either hath something in it which is impossible to be done in this life
the affirmatiue requires that wee loue god with all our hearts with all our minds with all our strength and our neighbour as our selfe
the negatiue ne concupiscas thou shalt not lust
it is confest by all that are not pelagians or pelagius like that neither of these can be performed in this life

touching the affirmatiue will say no more then that which saint bernard obserued that whereas in our charitie thereis affectus and actus the affection and the action we must exspect in heauen the integritie of our affection as the reward of the best endeauours of our action while we are in this world and if the integritie of our affection be aboue the reach of this life much more the integritie of our action which

flowes from the other and is correspondent to it
will insist a little longer vpon the other clause the negatiue part of the law
the rather because if can make it plaine that wee cannot performe the negatiue it followeth vndeniably that wee cannot performe the affirmatiue
for as one instance to the contrarie ouerthroweth an vniuersall affirmatiue so if we be tainted with the least spot of concupiscence our charitie cannot be entire
obserue then that may treade the steps of the romanists and ouerthrow their conceite of morall perfection in this life out of their owne principles that in regard of the negatiue part of the commaundement there is perfectio viatoris and comprehensoris
perfectio comprehensoris the perfection of a man when hee commeth to heauen will bee this saith saint austin non concupiscet hee will not there couet at all couet any thing against the prescript of gods law
but wee may not exspect to haue that perfection in this life because god is pleased euen in his best children to continue here luctam inter spiritum carnem a conflict betweene the flesh and the spirit
onely in baptisme hee taketh away reatum concupiscentis and regnum concupiscentiae those that are regenerated are not guiltie because sinfull concupiscence is or stirreth in them neither doth concupiscence continue her soueraigntie ouer them

so that god vnto their perfection in the church militant requires onely of his children vt post concupiscentias ne eant that they take no care for the flesh to sulfill the lusts thereof

and there is no condemnation to them that are in christ iesus that walke not after the flesh but after the spirit which is saint pauls conclusion vpon the conflict described rom
and he shewes plainely that hee would haue it vnderstood of the new and old mans conflict not of reason and sensualitie as the arminians
and can men performe so much as in the apostles words is required the romanists say they can but they say it vntruely
for this contention of the spirit and the flesh is not duellum but bellum it is not a single combat but a plaine warre
and you know there is great ods betweene these for in a single combat a man is to ward but one and bee hath but one to wound
but in the warre in a pitch't battaile singuli pugnant contra omnes omnes contra singulos euerie man must take care of all his enemies that are in the field
for there is not one of them but may giue him a wound eminus or cominus either buckling with him or striking him from aloofe
so that when he gardeth his head from one another may smite him at the heart when he maketh all sure before he may be smitten behind or he may be pierced in the sides
as hee is thus encumbred in the defensiue so is he in the offensiue also he may not thinke himselfe safe so long as any one of his enemies doth liue
behold here a liuely image of the militant souldiers of christ they haue not to doe with one but with many enemies the flesh the world the diuell
and these haue vnder them many desperate souldiers
the flesh as many as wee haue senses and affections parts of our bodies and powers of our soules
the world as many as there are creatures
and the diuell is a prince of many legions
wee must withstand them all and that at all times and

not onely withstand them but also stand against them at all times wee must looke to be set vpon by them and we must set vpon them
a very hard taske pluribus intentus minor est ad singula sensus saith the prouerb and the more our strength is distracted by many the lesse must it needs be against any one
were onely to defend my eye happily might make my part good against the lust thereof but at the same instant that turne them away least they behold vanitie am assaulted with an itching in my eare that is exposed to flatterie
put the case bestirre my selfe so well that keepe the enemie out of both those inlets he will giue mee a fall by my tongue he will cast some firie dart into that it shall be set on fire of hell as saint iames speaketh to slander to blaspheme

to speake some idle or euill words
neither are my hands secure at the very same time from being sollicited with briberie or vnto bloudshed
it were infinite to goe ouer all the powers of my soule all the parts of my body they are all at once and euer in the same danger and must all at once and euer be put vnto the same labour both defensiue and offensiue

adde hereunto three great disaduantages of the spirituall warfare aboue the corporall for in the corporall warfare as there are many enemies so those against whom they come being many distract them that they cannot all fall vpon one but in the spirituall warre it is not so all our spirituall foes at one time may set vpon euerie one of vs yea they neuer goe a sunder for our flesh euer ioyneth with the world and the diuell with them both
the second disaduantage is that whereas open hostilitie in earthly warfare is not alwayes accompanied with treacherie in the spirituall it is
for our selues hold secret intelligence with and yeeld assistance to our ghostly enemies we betray vnto them a propension that we haue to be conquered
and when the battle ioynes our members become weapons of vnrighteousnesse and with our owne lusts wee fight against our owne soules

the third disaduantage is that in earthly warfare when the souldiers come to execution they spare none and they goe vpon a good principle shall spare his bloud that will be euer ready to spill mine

saul in sparing agag and ahab who spared benhadad were taxed and punished for their foolish pittie
but of this foolish pittie there appeares too much in our spirituall warfare for if god bring the world vnder vs yea and our flesh too we are afraid to be hard hearted to either of them wee hold it too much spiritualtie to crucifie the world and wee hold it too much inhumanitie to crucifie our owne flesh
and by reason of this indulgence euen when they are foyled they are still in heart still in hope to recouer the masterie and bring vs vnder againe

this being the condition of sinfull man the schoolemen hold that no man in the state of grace is of sufficient strength to ouer come all sin though they adde that there is no one sinne which hee may not ouercome they speake of actuall sinnes and they speake truely if they bee vnderstood of that which a man may doe
for if a man be tempted vnto any sinne if hee pray vnto god for grace and make vse of that grace

which god doth giue him hee may his consent and choose whether he will act it and if he doe consent and act it hee is without all excuse
tertullian hath a prettie simile when two striue oftentimes the one ouercommeth the other not because the conquerour was the stronger but because he that is conquered was the more cowardly and such cowards the best of men doe proue very often in their spirituall war are
but it is in vaine to dispute what may be done by grace against all sin or any one sin otherwise then to shew al mens frailty
for the least of the two was neuer so done as that any man can truely boast of perfectio viatoris wil follow this point no farther
by this time doubt not but you conceiue that the israelites in their answere were ouer confident they presumed too much of their abilitie

especially of the extent thereof they did not know what was impossible to the law by reason of the flesh

and yet mistake not there is a vertue in this vice
neither is their confidence so blameable but there is something commendable in it
when a father willeth something to be done by his child the child doth not so much consider what it can doe as what it would doe and therefore vndertaketh euen beyond its strength
the father that seeth it doth not so much dislike the vanitie of the attempt as hee liketh the willingnesse to obey he delighteth in the good nature of his child and desires that his abilities may be answerable to his endeauours
and in this sort did god take the answere of the israelites as it appeares in the speech which he made to moses when he presented the like words vnto him haue heard saith he the voice of the words of this people they haue well sayed all that they haue spoken so he commends their confidence
but to giue them to vnderstand that they vndertooke more then they were able to performe

god addeth a wish that there were such an heart in them that they would feare mee and keepe my commandements alwayes
for nullius momentiest subitus affectus nisi accedat perseuerandi constantia
as the parable of the two sonnes matth

plainely sheweth

god foresaw that all this profession of the israelites was in them but a flash of a temporarie faith

such as out of temptation appeares in most of vs
for if we be preuented with grace yea in many good things out of the light of nature we assent vnto the truth of gods law and our hearts incline to the good thereof
yea if we sit iudges in other mens cases and are not transported with preiudice and acceptance of the persons we manifest this assent and inclination to the law of god in generall in our dooming of other men but we doe not cast vp our owne accounts
when our owne case commeth a foote and wee are exercised with any particular temptation then gods wish is necessarie that there were in them such a heart it is necessarie euen for those that haue beene so forward to say and that commendably all that the lord hath commanded we will doe
let vs then know that the strictnesse of gods charge serues onely to exercise our faith in christ to inflame our loue towards god and to encourage our hope of perfection in heauen
multum ille in hac vita profecit qui quam longe sit a perfectione iustitiae proficiende cognoscit

but draw to an end
this answere did the israelites make vnto the message that was sent from mount sinai what answere then must wee make vnto the message that commeth to vs from mount sion the yoke that moses put vpon them was grave an heauie yoke

the yoke that christ putteth vpon vs is suave an easie yoke
the easier our charge the readier should be our acceptance it could not bee so commendable in them to vnder take beyond their abilitie as it will bee shamefull in vs if wee come short of them in expressing our forwardnesse to obey god
for if their state were glorious ours doth much more exceed in glorie
cor
what remaineth then but that we oblige our selues chearefully to the couenant of grace and penitently bewaile our manifold defects in obseruing our obligation and that in our conflicts when wee are driuen to cry out wretch that am who shall deliuer mee

wee answere thankes be to god through iesus christ our lord

conclude all with that passage in the psalme lord thou hast commanded that we should keepe thy precepts diligently and let dauids wish bee euery one of ours oh that my wayes were made so direct that might keepe thy statutes

vers
and the lord said vnto moses loe come vnto thee in a thicke cloud that the people may heare when speake with thee and beleeue thee for euer

you may remember that brake this whole chapter into two parts a mutuall stipulation that passed betweene god and the israelites and a preparation of the parties for so great a worke as was the promulgation of the law
haue spoken of the mutuall stipulation it followeth that now come on to the preparation
this preparation is first ordered then the parties being orderly prepared doe meet each other
the order for gods preparation is set downe in this verse for the israelites in many verses following
touching gods preparation we must obserue first that hee will vouchsafe his presence at this great worke come to thee secondly touching gods presence the text will teach vs the manner and the end
the manner is such as beseemeth the person and fitteth the businesse as it beseemeth the person so it is maiesticall as it fitteth the businesse so it is mysticall both are included in the thicke cloud

the end of gods presence was partly to grace moses who was to be the that the people may heare when speake with thee and partly to dispose the people aright who were to receiue the law that they may beleeue thee for euer

these be the points and they are remarkeable therefore are they prefaced with a note of attention loe which will also direct our application it is remarkeable that god was present it is remarkeable that his presence was full of maiestie and mysterie the countenance which god vouchsafeth moses is remarkeable and remarkeable is that disposition towards moses which god requires in israel
beseech you therefore in the feare of god to marke these points diligently whilst cleere them vnto you briefly and in their order

come
god vouchsafeth his presence at the worke and is this strange must this haue a loe put vpon it is it strange for god to doe that which hee cannot chuse but doe

for hee filleth heauen and earth heauen is his throne the earth is his footstoole reade the psalme and see whether a man can be any where without the presence of god hee beareth vp all things by the word of his power saith the apostle therefore it is not strange that god should be present at this work who is euery where it is rather strange that god should be said to come to it as if he changed the place of his presence which he cannot doe because he is infinite
obserue therefore that though god be euerywhere alike in regard of his being yet in regard of his being manifest he is not euery where alike now it is not his being but his being manifest that is meant in this place therefore the chaldie paraphrase insteed of the hebrew come saith fitly to this purpose will appeare and because god doth not alwayes appeare to men alike therefore when hee doth more notably appeare vnto them hee is said to come
touching the varietie of gods appearing or manifesting himselfe to the world take a similitude from the sunne
the sunne doth manifest it selfe first by daylight and that is common to all that dwell in the same horizon vnto which the sunne is risen some haue more then the daylight they haue also the sunshining light which shining light of the sunne is not in all places where the day light of it is finally the sunne is manifest in the heauens in his full strength for the very body is present there which none can endure but the starres which become glorious bodies by that speciall presence of the sunne amongst them in like manner god in whom all things liue moue and haue their being doth manifest himselfe vnto some by the workes of his generall prouidence of which manifestation saint paul speaketh when he saith

god left not himselfe without witnesse to all nations in that he did good and gaue vs raine from heauen and fruitfull seasons filling our hearts with food and gladnesse this manifestation of god is like the daylight

it is common to all it is an vniuersall grace the eies of all things looke vp vnto thee lord and thou giuest them their meate in due season
there is a second manifestation and that is peculiar but to some it is like the it is that manifestation which god

vouchsafeth his church of which esay speaketh arise shine

for thy light is come and the glorie of the lord is risen vpon thee but darknesse shall couer the earth and grosse darknesse the people for in comparison of the church the rest of the world sitteth in darknesse and in the shadow of death
the third and last manifestation is that which god maketh of himselfe in heauen to the angels and saints the cleerest and fullest whereof a creature is capable and those which partake this presence of god become thereby glorious saints more glorious then the starres which receiue their resplendent lustre from the aspect which they haue to the sunnes bodie
the manifestation that we haue to doe withall is of the second sort it is not so cleare as that which the saints enioy in heauen it is not so darke as that which is common to the world but it is of a middle temper proper to the church militant to whom god is said to come when hee doth so manifest himselfe vnto her
from hence we must take notice that as there are those who are in better case then we are so there are who are in worse case and therefore we must thanke god for our present aduancement and remember that wee make forward to that neerenesse vnto god which is reserued for vs in heauen
this may suffice for our vnderstanding of this phrase come

the next point is the manner of his comming in the thick cloud
before speake distinctly hereof will giue you a note vpon the cloud
some make a question whether it be the same cloud which guided the children of israel through the wildernesse or some other they thinke some other greater and thicker but they thinke so without great reason for after that the guiding cloud once rested on the tabernade we heare no more of any cloud vpon mount sinai neither did moses after that ascend vnto mount sinai but god deliuered his minde vnto him in the tabernacle where the cloud then rested and god promised to dwell amongst the people after the tabernacle should be built by bringing the cloud and his glorie thither which was accordingly performed exod

before that the people remooued from mount sinai yet after that time wee reade of no other cloud vpon mount sinai
insteed then of coyning a new cloud obserue rather how by degrees god approched to his people at their first comming out of egypt he kept aloft in the aire the people had not yet shaken off their egyptian disposition neither were they sitted for any nearenesse to god
when they rose higher in their thoughts and had contracted with him god descended lower and came neerer vnto them he descended to the top of mount sinai
afterward when they had yet better exprest their affection to entertaine god by building the tabernacle god vouchsafed to come lower to them he chose to reside in the midst of their campe
and let vs take this for an vndoubted lesson the better wee preuented by grace prepare our selues for god the nearer will god approach to vs

now come to speake distinctly of the manner
told you that the manner of gods appearance was first maiesticall because in the thicke

cloud in this cloud that you may see the maiestie of god obserue first that god was in it for there was the angell of god that angell in whom is gods name so we reade exod
verse
and who is called gods presence exod
verse
so that the cloud was gods chaire of state or his chariot or pauillion as the scripture doth call the clouds when god putteth them to this vse
and as god was in the cloud so was the cloud enuironed with an host of heauenly courtiers becomming the maiestie of such a king learne it out of the sixtie eight psalme the chariots of god are twentie thousand euen thousands of angels the lord is amongst them as in sinai in his holy place
and besides these attendants we find obserued two other ceremonies of state
as kings giue notice of their comming by the sound of trumpets so this cloud was attended by the voice of a trumpet exceeding lowd
and as before kings there is wont to bee carried the instrument of iustice and vengeance the sword so was gods appearance in this cloud attended with those dreadfull meteors lightning and thunder
lay together those particulars and you will confesse that god appeared in awefull maiestie when he came in the thicke cloud
the israelites confessed as much deut
behold the lord hath shewed vnto vs his glorie and his greatnesse we haue heard his voice out of the midst of the fire
mortall kings neuer put on greater state then when they goe to their parliaments the reason that moueth them is the same that moued god that men should feare to offend them whom they see armed with so great power and the greater regard be had vnto their lawes

as the thicke cloud doth set forth gods maiestie so is it also full of mysterie
the first mysterie to be gathered out of it is obserued by god himselfe he clothed himselfe with a thicke cloud to put the people in mind that hauing seene no shape of him they should not presume to make any image
let our lesson be voluntas dei non essentia quaerenda in hac vita what god is is a lesson for the life to come in this life it is enough for vs to learne what gods will is

a second mysterie in the cloud is that it agreeth well with the reuelations of the old testament

for god appeared then in shadowes and figures there was a vaile cast ouer the law which was figured in the vaile wherewith moses couered his face
cor
so that though the church in the old testament had much more knowledge then the rest of the world for they had sauing knowledge as appeareth heb
yet he that is least in the kingdome of god saith christ is greater then iohn baptist notwithstanding that he was greater then any prophet of the old testament

a third mysterie is the condition of the law

which in deuteronomic is called a fierie law very piercing and very scorching it enters farre in searching of a mans conscience it is a discerner of the thoughts had neuer knowne

saith saint paul that lust is sinne had not the law said thou shalt not lust
as the law is piercing because fierie so is it

scorching also it vexeth and tormenteth their consciences whom it findeth guiltie it is a burden too heauie for the best of vs to beare acts
saint austine obserues well breuis differentia legis euangelij timor amor although both these affections beseeme both testaments and he that loueth must feare and he that feareth must loue yet feare was preualent in the old testament and loue is in the new we haue not saith saint paul receiued the spirit of bondage to feare

which was the state of man vnder the old testament but we haue receiued the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father which is the libertie of the new testament
the same apostle resembleth the different conditions of the church vnder the two testaments to the different conditions of a child when he is in nonage and when he is come to his full age

while he is in his nonage though he be heire yet is he kept in awe and vnder a pedagogue but when he commeth to full age his father affords him a more chearefull countenance and more liberall maintenance euen so vnder the law the church was kept vnder and scanted of grace but vnder the gospel shee is more free and indued with a more plentifull measure of gods holy spirit
finally hereunto looketh the difference that saint paul maketh betweene mount sinai and mount sion heb
the terriblenesse of the one and the sweetnesse of the other shall haue occasion to compare them before come to the end of the chapter

by the mixture of the cloud and of the fire you may also conceiue a mixture of our knowledge of god as the light of the fire signifieth that he is in some good sort manifested vnto vs

so doth the cloud signifie that out knowledge is very imperfect wee see but as through a glasse darkly that which we know not of god is much more then that which we doe know
let this suffice for the manner

come now to the end which is twofold for god came first to grace moses whom he designed lawgiuer to israel or rather referendarie of that law which himselfe would giue vnto them
and hee graced him two wayes
first in comming to him and not vnto them so saith the text will come to thee
moses was vpon the hill the people in the bottome now the cloud came downe but to the top of the hill not into the bottome wherein there was no small grace done to the person of moses in the sight of all the people god vouchsafed his presence only to him and not to the people

the second grace is yet greater that in the hearing of the people god would speake with him for it is not here said that god did speake with them
but that wee mistake not this grace which is done to moses and giue him more honour then hereby was by god intended towards him we must obserue that though here we find no mention of gods speaking with the people but only of his speaking with moses yet deut
verse
moses himselfe saith that god talked also with them and here we reade that god so talked with moses as that he talked in the hearing of the people
when here wee reade of gods talking with moses only without any mention of gods talking with the people hereby the holy

ghost intends to honour him with the mediatour ship of the old testament that honour which saint paul giueth him when hee saith the law was giuen by angels in the band of a mediatour
but where moses saith deut
that god talked with the people there the holy ghost would teach vs that god intended the law to the people
and out of both places compared together it followeth that the law was committed to moses to the end that the people might receiue it from him not only as hee should deliuer it in the two tables but also as he should report vnto them by word of mouth
and because they were to receiue gods law as he should report it that they might be sure hee brought them nothing but that which hee receiued from god therefore god vttered the law to him in their hearing
whatsoeuer commeth from a man as a meere man will hardly worke vpon the conscience because of that knowne principle omnis homo mendax men haue their errors and their priuate ends therefore their proiects are entertained with iealousie that they mistake or intend their owne good but if a law be once knowne to be gods pleasure we readily submit because we know he is undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet hee can neither deceiue nor bee deceiued and hee hath absolute power to command
vpon this principle those famous lawgiuers amongst the heathen did make it their first labour to perswade their people that they had familiar colloquies with some diuine power by whom they were directed in their minos with iupiter lycurgus with apollo numa with aegeria mahomet could neuer haue made his alcoran so currant but by that notorious imposture of a doue which had beene taught to come familiarly to his eare and which to the people hee pretended to bee the holy ghost heretikes old and new haue had their enthusiasticall guides papisticall pretended apparitions and reuelations are much of this kind abuses of that sacred principle
but to the point when god would establish the canon both of the old and new testaments by two demonstrations hee shewed that they came from him the one of miracle the other of oracle
so did hee establish that which the church receiued by moses
first hee gaue him power to worke many miracles which was a second proofe that he came from god for no man could doe what he did except god were with him the very magitians confessed so much digitus dei est hic
secondly god not contented to giue him the power of miracles because magitians might if not doe them yet make shew of them added also this second confirmation of oracle which putteth the other out of controuersie because it is not so casie to be counterfeited
our sauiour christ by whom was laid the foundation of the canon of the new testament had the same euidences to confirme his doctrine besides the many miracles which hee wrought that oracle was once and againe vttered from heauen

this is my beloued sonne in whom am well pleased heare him
and withall he forewarned his church not to rest barely vpon miracles for that false christs and false prophets shall arise and shew great signes and wonders

but why did god grace moses by speaking with him in the hearing of the people surely the end was that they might beleeue him for ouer that faith towards his person might be wrought in them
for faith properly relieth vpon the person and resteth vpon his word although it doth not comprehend many things which he speaketh as indeed the israelites did not vnderstand many parts of the law yet neuer did they question them because they were deliuered by moses undefined span alphabet was enough to them farther enquirie they made none

but how could moses be beleeued for euer seeing he is dead diuers thousands of yeares since surely moses liueth in his writings hee that beleeueth them beleeueth him
the prophets long after him referre themselues to him in his writings ad legem testimonium

saith esay remember the law of moses which gaue him in horeb saith god in malachie
thus also in the new testament

christ referreth to him you beleeue in moses

the scribes and pharisees sit in moses his chaire and wee find the iewes still couering their oppositions to christ and his apostles with pretence of their faith to moses wee know that god spake to moses wee are moses his disciples
so deeply did this oracle of god take roote in them that through ignorance and misconceit it became their stumbling blocke and that which truly vnderstood should haue brought them to the gospel through the errour of their iudgement set them against it
god doth as much as is fit to establish our faith but we often peruert the best meanes to our owne ruine

may not here forget to obserue vnto you a grosse errour of the church of rome
god spake once to moses saith my text in the hearing of the people that the people should beleeue his words for euer therefore the canon of the the law was to stand for an eternall truth
the same must we affirme of the canon of the new testament whose confirmation is much surer as saint paul testifieth heb
hence it is that wee call vpon the church of rome to reforme according to this double canon but they call as fast vpon vs for miracles and oracles to confirme our doctrine
but new proofes are only for new doctrines wee alleage nothing but that which was taught by christ and his apostles and consequently nothing but that which hath beene alreadie proued by miracle and oracle that which hath beene once thus proued is to bee beleeued for euer

the last note which gaue on my text is that it hath a word which biddeth vs marke diligently all the points thereof marke what gods comming is in what sort hee doth manifest himselfe vnto vs that which is not vulgar must not vulgarly bee regarded marke that gods comming to giue the law was full of maiestie full of mysteries wee must adore his maiestie and not neglect any one of the mysteries finally marke that whom god employeth in his seruice he vouchsafeth honour to their persons that his word may passe with

more weight from their mouthes
the end of all is our good that we may cleaue faster vnto god

and god grant that by the ministerie of man our faith in god may so increase that at christs second comming our faith may end in a beatificall vision and then we shall haue no other teacher but god

the eighth sermon
epigraph

exodvs

vers and part of the and
verses
and the lord said vnto moses goe vnto the people and sanctifie them to day and to morrow yea and the priests to verse
and let them wash their clothes and be readie against the third day
adde out of verse
and not come at their wiues

you may remembe what haue told you more then once that there was a preparation to goe before the promulgation of the law a preparation of god and of the israelites
this preparation was first ordered and then the meeting followed
so much of the order as concernes god opened the last time it followeth that now come to the other part which concerneth the israelites
this branch of the order doth prescribe first their puritie and secondly their modestie
their puritie whereof only at this time is deliuered in those words which now haue read vnto you
wherein we will obserue first a worke that is enioyned and secondly the circumstances that doe attend that worke
the worke in a word is to sanctifie
but we are moreouer taught wherein this sanctification doth stand and whom it concernes
it standeth in a ceremoniall obseruance they must wash their clothes and forbearance this you must must supply out of the
verse they must not come at their wiues
these workes that must be done concerne the gouernour and his charge the gouernour is moses he must sanctifie his charge are the israelites but they are diuided into the people and the priest you must supply the priest out of verse the
both these must be prepared

the circumstances that must attend this worke are two place and

time the place is the tents the ordinary place of the israelites abode
goe to this people
the circumstance of time is double for here wee haue mentioned first the time during which the worke was to bee a doing and that is to day and to morrow secondly the time against which the worke was to be done and that was the third day the day wherein god would appeare vnto them and they were to come in his presence

you see then the particulars of my text purpose god willing to open them now and god now so open all our eares and hearts that we may learne by them to sanctifie our selues so shall god neuer appeare vnto vs nor wee appeare before god but to our endlesse comfort

come we then to the first particular and that is the worke which must bee done this is in a word to sanctifie
to sanctifie is to separate from a common to a sacred vse
god made vs not only men that is reasonable creatures but also his children that is consorts with angels and wee were by times or by turnes to intend no lesse our heauenly then our worldly vocation the things of a better no lesse then the things of this present life
to take off our thoughts and desires our care and endeuour from this world and bestow them vpon the world to come from the earth place them vpon heauen is that that which the holy ghost meaneth by sanctifying of our persons
and verily before the fall no more was required thereunto then such a change of our employment but after the fall more is made necessarie for sin cleaueth vnto our nature we are conceiued and borne therein

not only those that are without the church whom saint paul describeth rom
but also those that are within the church whom hee describeth in the third of that epistle
and this sinne doth defile vs read esay the first chapter and ezech
there you shall see how lothsome how vgly we are by reason of our sinne

all our righteousnesse as the prophet speaketh is like a menstruous cloth

neither doth sinne only defile vs but by vs it defileth all other creatures concupiscence is a contagious thing contactu omnia foedo inquinat what it toucheth it staineth

vnto the impure saith the apostle nothing is pure nothing is pure to a sinfull man because his mind and conscience is defiled
so that undefined span alphabet are synonyma

the common thing or things vnseparated the things of this life that are not hallowed are all impure
wherefore to sanctifie now is not only to change our imployment but also to clense our selues from sinne and before we doe dedicate our selues vnto god wee must remoue not only our imployment from the world but also our corruption from our persons corruption not only that which is inherent in vs but also that which by our meanes is adherent vnto our goods and to other creatures whereof we make any offering to god

this which in grosse haue said concerning sanctification is distinctly taught in the rest of my text and the rest of my text is a faire commentarie vpon this word for therein you shall see first the separation

of sinne from them in the washing of their garments secondly the seperation of their employment from the world in not comming to their wiues and last of all that which is the of all their preparation to meete god
let vs looke into these points orderly

first into the ceremoniall obseruance
the israelites were to wash their clothes
god fitted his law in the old testament vnto the nonage of his church so the time before christs incarnation is called by the apostle

and all things came to his people in types and figures much of their law was ceremonial
but those ceremonies of gods institution were as the fathers call them sacramenta they were mysticall things they had an and an an corporall an spirituall wherein they differed from heathenish and pharisaicall ceremonies for example to instance in the ceremonie which we haue in hand
the heathen the pharises had their washing
touching that of the heathen we read in the prophane authors and in the gospell we read of that of the pharises both of them had lauacrum but not mysterium the but not the of the washing their thoughts reached no farther then the carnall worke ascribing to the carnall worke a supernaturall power which the poet taxeth in the heathen

ah nimium faciles qui tristia crimina coedis tolli fluminea posse putatis aquâ

and our sauiour christ taxeth it in the pharisies who thought when they had washed their hands they were quit from their briberie
neither is the romish sprinkling of holy water much better whether wee looke to the consecration of it or the confidence that is put in it
in the the consecration the priest doth pray without a promise and as for the people they rest vpon opus operatum the doing of a worke that hath no warrant and so trust in a lye
ceremonies of significancie the church may institute but ceremonies of efficacie it cannot institute god onely who is the fountaine of grace can institute those conduits by which hee will conuey them to vs

but to leaue these carnall ceremonies and come to the mysticall
saint austin giueth this good rule to guide vs in vnderstanding them

humana consuetudo verbis diuina potentia etiam rebus loquitur it is vsuall with men to expresse their meaning in words god hath moreouer another language sutable to his power hee speaketh by things by corporall things to let the israelites vnderstand spirituall and their ceremonies were symbola pietatis sensible images as it were of their morall duetie

but least we mistake we must obserue three differences betweene the cutside and inside of the ceremonies

first the corporall part of it was to be considered not according vnto its owne nature but according to its reference not according to that which it was in it selfe but according vnto that whereunto it was ordained of god so sacrifices were to be considered not as beasts or birds

but as types of christ that was to die for the sinne of the world but the spirituall part of the ceremonie was to bee considered and esteemed according to its owne and absolute nature

a second thing is that the type containeth good or euill in regard onely of the commandement which requireth the doing or the forbearing therof whereas otherwise the thing in it selfe is indifferent but the inward part of that ceremonie is commanded or forbidden because in its owne nature it is good or euill
thirdly man can onely performe the corporall or outward part of the ceremonie the inward and spirituall can be done onely by the speciall grace of god and we may not ascribe vnto the creature that which is in the power and gift onely of the creatour
these rules being considered in generall must also discreetly bee distinguished according to the maine parts of religion which are two undefined span alphabet that wherein god doth exhibite ought vnto vs and undefined span alphabet that wherein wee doe present some thing vnto god
the ceremonie wherewith we haue now to doe is of the later sort for washing our clothes is a part of mans sernice which he doth to
in all the purifications of moses law washing of clothes was alwayes one as you may find in the booke of leuiticus where those lawes are set together and the iewes from this precept gather the practice of baptizing them whom they receiue into their couenant and church

neither was this an introductorie law of moses but a declaratorie for we read of it in the story of iacob when he did purge his family

one of the ceremonies practised was the shifting of garments which shifting implieth washing because it was a putting off the soule to put on the cleane and the garments of those countries were cleane by being washt as anon you shall heare

by the way take this obseruation that the ceremoniall lawes of moses excepting such as were requisite vpon the churches becomming nationall or were occasioned by the israelites deliuerance out of aegypt were in practice amongst the patriarkes from the beginning of the world as may be gathered out of genesis

let vs now come closer to our present ceremonie
and here first it is worth the inquiring why god should pitch vpon this kind vpon the washing of garments the reason is euident in the scripture the similitude of god according to which we were created is compared to a garment not onely by the fathers ieremie ambrose austin and others but also by the holy ghost who speaking of the losse thereof saith that thereby wee become naked

and the recouerie of that image is the buying of rayment from christ the phrases of putting on christ

putting on the new man putting on the armour of light allude hereunto and if you marke it well our originall righteousnesse resembled a garment in three things

for first it did couer and adorne vs as a robe of maiestie sit for him that was made to rule in this lower world
secondly as a garment that is put on may be put off so might we loose our originall righteousnesse

and indeed adam was disrobed thereof and wee in him the fathers say

he was meant by the man that going from ierusalem to iericho fell amongst theeues and was robbed
thirdly though a man keepe his robe on yet may it be stained so though a man doe not forgoe his righteousnesse recouered in christ yet may he much blemish it
these correspondencies are faire grounds of gods choice of this ceremonie

we haue not now to do with the wanting or loosing of our garment onely let me tell you

that christ speaketh of some that thinke they are clothed when they are let vs take heed of being such blind laodiceans

againe christ biddeth all take heed that they loose not their garments and their nakednesse and filthinesse appeare let vs take heed of such vnthriftinesse though adam smarted well for it wee shall smart worse god restored vnto him undefined span alphabet his first rayment

and hee restoreth it to all his to as many of them as put on christ but if they loose it againe if they put off that garment their nakednesse shall neuer bee couered againe heb
and cap


but we haue not to doe with that desperate sinne we haue now to doe with stayning of those garments which wee keepe
the ancient colour of garments which they did vsually weare was white and so very apt to be stained therfore they were often to be washed and scoured
in the primitiue church one of the ceremonies of baptisme was this the baptized person had a cleane white garment put vpon him with these words take this white garment and keepe it vnspotted vntill thou be presented before the tribunall of christ
the churches meaning was that wee should continue in that innocencie which we receiued in baptisme
but that which christ said vnto the church of sardis thou hast a few names which haue not defiled their garments was spoken but comparatiuely of them and absolutely it can be spoken of none for who doth not defile himselfe more or lesse and staine his innocencie yea and that more wayes then one and that too in a high degree and the ground of this commandement is because the israelites in aegypt had defiled themselues with idolatrie and other kinds of impietie

the church of rome exempteth some of their saints from mortall though not from veniall sinne some from actuall of both sorts but not from original as iohn baptist the virgine marie from originall also but they are conceites whereupon themselues are not agreed wherefore leauing them to wrangle

wee will hold with saint austin that if all the saints in the world during their militancie had beene assembled their common confession would be this if we say we haue no sinne we deceiue our selues and there is no truth in vs

now when our corporall garment is vncleane what doe we wee doe that which is commanded here we wash it we scoure it but wee must doe it as it is commanded here that is mystically
when a dogge is beaten before a lion the meaning is that by that which is done to the dogge the lion should see what he deserues
and theoderet noteth well vpon this place that when god biddeth them wash their garments timorem illis ingerit religiosiores{que reddit ex his enim colligebant magis expurgandam animam
god doth not delight so much in the cleannesse

of garments as in the purity of oursoules for undefined span alphabet is undefined span alphabet

and no maruell for undefined span alphabet saith nazianz
as that wihch doth enter a man doth not defile a man no more doth that which couereth a man therefore christ biddeth the pharisees wash their owne insides and then all things should be holy vnto them for vnto the pure all things are pure

except happily wee may say that the garment also is defiled

because spotted with the flesh and so there is in this phrase a touch at the contagion of sinne which was also meant in the ceremoniall vncleannesse when they were bid to wash their garments but that vanisheth so soone as our selues are purified the holy ghost would haue vs take principall care of our soules that they may bee purified
and there is a fountaine opened to the house of dauid and to the inhabitants of ierusalem

we may wash our selues white in the bloud of that lambe for his bloud doth cleuse from all sinne and if our sinnes bee as red as scarlet he can make them as white as snow malachie saith

it hath in it the vertue of fullers sope it is his bloud that can make his spouse all faire make his church without spot or wrinkle hee that is purged therein shall haue his conscience cleansed from dead workes to serue the liuing god
by his spirit and our faith doth christs bloud worke these things wherefore let vs all pray with king dauid

purge me lord with hysope and shall be cleane wash mee and shall be whiter then snow

marke that the israelites are bid to wash their garments not to change them though it appeareth exodus
that they had change of raiment
there is a mysterie in it it signifieth that the children of god from the time they are incorporated into christ though they haue often occasion to scoure out the staines which their regeneration contracteth yet they doe not shift it it shall abide the same for euer bettered in qualitie but neuer altered in substance
finally obserue that though the children of israel did often wash their garments ceremonially while they abode in the wildernesse yet did their garments neuer weare out contrarie to the common obseruation a landresse washeth faire but shee weareth withall euen so though we doe spiritually bathe our soules often in the bloud of christ our regeneration will not spend at all nay it will bee very much increased
haue dwelt long vpon this ceremoniall obseruance will bee shorter in the rest
the second part of sanctification is the ceremoniall forbearance when wee haue remoued that vncleannesse which commeth from our person by sinne then must wee withdraw our person from imployment on the world and that is meant by the israelites not comming as their wiues

and marke the phrase
saint paul doth exhort vs

to keepe our vessels that is our bodies in honour and not in the lusts of concupiscence that is not for to accompanie strumpets which we cannot doe but we

shall betray our selues to bee subiect to dishonourable affections so saint paul calleth them undefined span alphabet in opposition to mariage which is honourable in all

this honourable state of mariage doth saint paul make a branch of holinesse
but here is a straine beyond it euen that holinesse is as it were no holinesse when we are to prepare our selues for god we must forbeare the vse thereof
will you know the reason of it we may say that though the ordinance bee holy yet the accessory which from our concupiscence commeth to the vse thereof maketh some thing cleaue thereunto which may make vs vnfit to come immediatly from the vse thereof to giue our attendance vpon god which is intimated in the ceremoniall law deliuered leuit

besides the presence of carnall pleasure maketh vs not so readie to entertaine those pleasures that are spirituall
these things a man may say and say truly that it is sit euery man should obserue saint pauls rule

by consent for a time the man must for beare his wife and the woman her husband that they may giue themselues to fasting and prayer

but there is an higher point which at this time concerned the israelites and that is the day of their appearing before god was to be their espousall day god was then to contract himselfe to them as appeares ezech

and should a man minde the earthly when hee is called vnto an heauenly espousals no verily it is then time if euer for a maried man to be as if he were not maried to be as if he were an angel to shew that he hath no other loue but christ to shew that christ is his beloued as he is the beloued of christ
the desire of that match must drowne in vs all delight in our earthly companion bee shee neuer so louely in our eyes
but when they are bid not to keepe companie with their wiues it is not meant simply of their companie for they should both ioyne as in suspending their power each ouer the other and each endeuour to please the other· so in prouoking each the other to care for those things that belong vnto the lord and with a disposition to prepare themselues for him

it is not needfull for mee to remember you that god in forbidding the coniugall act forbiddeth all attendants thereupon or prouocations thereunto for that is a common rule to bee obserued in all gods commandements as hereafter you shall heare
only this will note vnto you that by this one carnall content all others are meant yea all lawfull profits and pleasures and god will haue vs shew that being not only reasonable but religious persons also we are so farre masters of our worldly desires that wee can when wee are to attend god and his seruice forbeare not onely illicita but licita also and bee so farre from delighting in any thing that is vnlawfull that we can willingly denie our selues those things the vse whereof god hath otherwise and at other times made lawfull for vs vrias would not keepe companie with his wife while the arke was in the field
sam

brutish is the iewes conceit that thinke the sabbath the fittest day to lie with their wiues chastitie beseemes married men

when they goe about sacred things especially at solemne times

haue done with the separation required separation of sinne from our persons and our persons from the world
you would think that it were fit should now come to the other act of sanctification which is dedicating our selues vnto god
but there are some things mentioned in my text which must take in by the way
wee must see first whom this sanctifying concerneth it concerneth first the gouernour moses he must goe and sanctifie

but moses did as yet sustaine two persons hee was both king and priest for hee had not put off the priesthood seeing aaron as yet was not consecrated
and indeed this worke may be done either by the priest or by the prince by the priest so ioel commanded them to sanctifie a fast ezechias and others did the like as princes

but the difference is that the prince doth it imperio and gladio by peremptorie command and threatning the sword but the priest doth it mimsterio verbo as a seruant and not vsing any other power but of the keyes prince and priest both serue god in this worke but they serue him with this difference

it skilleth not much whether of these persons moses did act in this businesse it is plaine that he was authorized to doe it from god
and his authoritie was to doe it two wayes
first to acquaint them with gods pleasure and then to take care that they did conforme thereunto
and indeed good magistrates whether temporall or ecclesiasticall

must not only giue lawes to the people but also see that they bee executed and in vaine is the wisdome of good lawes if no care bee vsed to haue them kept a gouernours prouidence must extend to both
therefore the text goeth on and sheweth that this sanctifying concerneth all the israelites the people are mentioned here and out of verse the
you must supply the priests

some thinke that the name priest is vsed in this chapter by anticipation and that moses here informeth them how they were to sanctifie themselues after they were consecrated and it is very true that while they did serue they did forbeare their wiues and wash though not their clothes which they shifted in the sanctuarie yet their hands and feet
but the priests here meant were the who were then the ordinary priests and the worke was presently to be done it was not to stay till aaron was consecrated
the principall note that giue you herein is that though there bee different callings in the church some are pastors and some are people yet as the saluation is common vnto both so are also faith hope and charitie
in morall duties in workes of pietie and charitie the priest must goe with the people and the people must goe with the priest though the priest must goe before the people in these things yet must hee not goe alone yea moses himselfe though otherwise a shepheard yet herein is a sheepe he that sanctified others must sanctifie himselfe
a gouernour must in vertue be exemplary to his charge

these persons must be prepared
and sanctification is the best preparation the word signifieth also to be confirmed
and indeed puritie is the ground of confidence sinne is fearefull as you may perceiue by esay's is me chap
and saint peters goe from me master luke
reade psal
luke
esay
and wisdome
it appeares there that righteousnesse is confident in the presence of god and the enemies thereof

haue done with the persons whom this sanctifying concerneth let vs now come to the circumstance
will runne them ouer briefly
the first is the place the place was the tents the ordinarie abode of the israelites thither moses was sent goe to the people and whether he was sent there is was to be done
and indeed the acts required could conueniently bee done no where else for where a man vsed his wife there he was to forbeare and where doe the people vse to wash their clothes but at home that which we must take notice of is this
before we come from home wee must thinke whither wee are going and fit our selues for gods presence before we come at him
we must not haue our worldly much lesse our wicked affections to put off when wee enter into gods house our shooes must be put off before we tread vpon holy ground priuate meditations and deuotions must goe before the publike hearing of gods word and performing of diuine seruice and seldome doth hee serue god at church that doth not beginne his pietie at home
and the reason why our deuotion is so often interrupted by vnseasonable and vnreasonable thoughts and desires in the church is because we doe not rid our selues as we ought of them by preparing sanctification before wee come there
wherefore that wee may bee much more religious when we come into this place let euery man begin the practice of his religion in his owne house
the second circumstance is the circumstance of time this told you is twofold
first here is set downe a time during which this sanctifying was a doing that is to day and to morrow
the time allowed for sanctifying varieth much in moses law in some cases it was but one day in some seuen dayes in some fortie dayes in some eightie dayes you may read it in leuiticus will not now enquire into the reason of the varietie

that which will obserue is this our clensing or sanctifying is not perfected in an instant
as wounds are easily taken but not easily cured so are sinnes quickly contracted but not quickly purged
sinnes are compared vnto scumme and you know meate will aske some good boyling before all the scumme will come out of it it is compared to drosse and you know metals must be long in the fire before they will bee refined from their drosse or to keepe my selfe to my text staines if they bee deepe in a garment will not bee fetcht out without the fullers sope and he doth not scoure garments without a great deale of toile
dauid therefore desirous to be rid of his sinne prayeth thus multiplica laua wash mee againe and againe wash mee throughly from

my sinne and the old canons required that penitents should spend a good deale of time to scoure off their contracted guiltinesse and corruption

if the women that were to be ioyned with the kings of persia were to be so many moneths a purifying shall it bee much that wee take this time to be purified that must be ioyned with the king of heauen a time there was of purifying before all the iewes feasts

the iewes prepare before they goe to their synagogue so doe the turkes it was one of the lawes of the twelue tables deos castè adeunto procul hinc procul este profani and sancta sanctè was the admonition giuen to the people in the christian churches the fasts that went before all solemne feasts the forbidding of mariage for certaine time which some without cause except against although we cannot denie that dispensations are growne to an abuse tend to this purpose
finally the old vigils and the ordinarie eues of sundayes and holy dayes shew the churches desire herein to imitate god and to appoint a moderate time to dispose vs to diuine seruice and the commemoration of gods blessings

a time is here appointed by god but it is a very moderate time god doth not tire vs out in our preparation

and saint paul that would not haue the incestuous corinthian swallowed vp of sorrow by reason of an penance doth bid man and wife for deuotion not to forbeare companie lest satan tempt them

the church is to be discreet in appointing and christians in vndertaking this time of washing lest that which otherwise is good may bee turned into euill

if the law required three dayes preparation for hearing how many more for obscruing it if the law required preparation how much more the gospel iosepus saith that the iewes during these two dayes did feast huge de sancto victore saith that they fasted
and verily the latter opinion is much more probable for surely mysticall washing of garments and forbearing of wiues are workes fitter for fasting then feasting

but will not trouble you with that come to the last point which is the time against which this worke was to be done and this is the third day the day wherein god would vouchsase his presence and they were to giue their attendance and this will bring vs to the complement of sanctification
for god delighteth not in our separation from sinne and the world except it be to remoue them as impediments that so we may be capable of him his spirit his word and his grace

for wisdome will not enter into a wicked or worldly soule god will not put new wine into old vessels nor new cloth into an old garment hee will not cast pearle before swine nor holy things vnto dogges
the children of israel borrowed of the egyptians rich clothes when they went to sacrifice to god exod

the prodigall child was not permitted to eate of the fat calfe before hee was clothed with the chiefe robe and a ring vpon his finger iacob before his going vnto bethel

gods house purged his family

iob sanctified his children before

he sacrificed

esayes lips were touched with a coale from the altar before he could receiue his message
when we come before god wee must endeuour to bee like vnto him

holy as hee is holy for god is a god of pure eyes

and can behold no iniquitie such as bee wicked cannot stand before him

wherefore clense your hands

yee sinners and purge your hearts yee if he that was inuited to the mariage was challenged for wanting his wedding garment how shall god take it at his spouses hand if she come vnprepared we reade ezech
how god trimmed her against that day the day of espousals and how he will trimme her against the mariage day we may reade reuel
but cannot stand to amplifie these things
to draw to an end will put you in minde to doe that to a good purpose which you vsually

vers

and thou shalt set bounds vnto the people round about saying take heede to your selues that yee goe not vp into the mount or touch the border of it whosoeuer toucheth the mount shall surely be put to death

there shall not a hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not liue when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come vp to the mount

that branch of gods order which prepared the israelites receiue the law required their puritie and their modestie spake last of their puritie come now to speake of their modestie
it is deliuered in those words that now haue read vnto you
therein we must obserue that moses had his charge and the israelites had theirs
moses charge is to make a fence betweene the people and the hill hee must set bounds round about the people
the israelites charge is they must not breake through the fence made by moses they must not goe vp into the mountaine
the israelites must not
but they are diuided into common people and the priests the prohibition is laide vpon them both vpon the people in this
verse and in the
verse it is laid vpon the priests moses is to bid both take heede vnto themselues
neither to themselues onely but to their beasts also they are put into the number verse
besides this in the prohibition the text doth lead vs to consider the stricktnesse wherewith the israelites were to obserue it and the sharpnesse of the punishment which they were to vndergoe if they presume to violate it
the stricktnesse is great for they might not transgresse the bounds set them either cominùs that is at hand by so much as touching the border making the very first and least approach vnto it there can be no lesse then touch and the first touch is in the border
as they must not transgresse cominùs so must they not eminus aloofe they must not gaze on the hill and you know the eye can goe whether the foote cannot come
god will haue the first inlet and the first outlet of sinne to be heeded
and hee will haue them both heeded vnder a paine a sharpe paine it is no lesse then death the transgressour must die

but obserue touching this death that it is such as is inflicted vpon an

execrable thing and the doome thereof is vnpardonable
see both these points in the text

first the execrablenesse of the transgressour all must abhorre him for no hand may touch him and yet all must be against him for they must stone him with stones or shoote him through with darts
and he that dieth so dieth as an execrable thing
he that transgresseth must die that death without remission moriendo morietur he shall certainely die non viuet he shall not liue both phrases are peremptorie they leaue no place for pardon
not for the pardon of any one for the text saith quicun{que whosoeuer shall presume to transgresse be hee of the people or bee he of the priests be he a reasonable creature or be he a beast the doome is vnchangeable they must die
die certainely for though they scape the hands of men yet they shall not scape
god will breake out vpon them as we read verse
especially vpon the greatest of them which are otherwise most likely to scape
he will breake out vpon the priests
finally obserue that the charge of the israelites is often repeated and limited to a time you haue it in my text and you haue it againe and againe in the
and
verses what god will haue carefully obeyed of that he will haue vs often remembred
but our obedience is limited
though in morals our dueties are euerlasting yet our ceremonials doe last but for a time when the trumpet soundeth long then the israelites may goe vp into the mount
you haue heard the particulars whereof meane to intreate on this text they all preach vnto vs modestie to bee shewed whensoeuer wee approach god or haue to doe with sacred things
that we may learne and practice it let vs in the feare of god listen to that which shall further say of these points briefly and in their order
the first is moses charge
he must make a fence betweene the people and the hill set bounds round about the people or as it is in the
verse he must sanctifie the mountaine and make of it a sanctuarie
and indeed well might it so be reputed when it was couered with all the visible tokens of gods maiesticall presence and if it be sanctified hereunto then it followeth it must be reuerend in our eyes and inuiolable by vs wee must not esteeme it as common ground nor make bold with it as if it were such
euerie man should know his distance and obserue it but ignorance in some and negligence in others are the causes why men left to themselues either know not what they should doe or doe not what they know
god therefore in pitie of our ignorance and to hold in our vnrulinesse hath appointed those that shall set vs our bounds especially in things indifferent wherein presuming of lawfulnesse few will haue an eye to expediences
the vulgar eye is not sharpe enough to discerne it neither is the vulgar heart plyable to the obseruance of it
it is the worke of the gouernour to remedie both these defects

neither onely in things indifferent but also in moralities for they

are to make lawes euen vpon the law of nature and keepe vs to the doing of that which we would not doe though our conscience suffer vs not to bee ignorant thereof because the morall law is written in our hearts
what man that hath not put off a man knoweth not that murder adulterie theft are sinnes and yet what more common in mens liues the commonnesse hath made it necessarie for all states to set bounds vnto their people in regard of these things

and if in regard of ciuill how much more of ecclesiasticall things men are neuer more lawlesse then in those things wherein you would exspect that euery man should especially bee a law vnto himselfe that is in keeping his distance from god
but herein also we need a boundarie and god hath appointed those that must set it
and who are they but such as moses those that are set ouer vs for moses must be considered here not onely as a messenger from god but also as a ruler of the israelites neither were they to heare him onely as a counselour but as a commander his words did more then informe they did order their liues
and in a word this is a principall branch of magistracie to take away the common excuse of offenders which is non putaram wist not that this was my dutie and to direct them by lawes before they call them to an account for their liues
will not here fall vpon the question which is much debated at this day whether magistrates may set bounds vnto the people in causes ecclesiasticall as well as ciuill
onely take notice that here by an example we are taught that they may
and let this suffice for moses charge

the israelites charge is they must not presume to goe vp vnto the mount
and indeed a boundarie were no boundarie if it might bee passed
you know by your ground that an inclosure is no inclosure if it may bee common how much more must this be conceiued of the inclosure of god that ground which he hath fenced vnto himselfe for a sanctuarie if it be a trespasse to breake through your neighbours fence how much more through the fence of god this is transgression indeed it is indeed peccatum for that is quasi pecuatum playing the vnruly sheepe that will not be kept within his penne or to speake plainely with iohn

it is undefined span alphabet the transgression of gods law
but god will not haue his people sonnes of belial such as cannot indure his yoake

hee will not haue them like those insolent ones that say let vs breake his bonds and cast his cords from vs god hath giuen a law to the sea saying

hitherto shalt thou come and here thou shalt stay thy proud waues and the sea passeth not the bounds which god hath set it
how much lesse should we presume notwithstanding the swelling of our nature and the impetuous affections thereof god exspecteth we should checke the presumption of our nature

but about all presumption we should take heed of that which is the highest going vp into the mount prophaning of the sanctuarie of god and ventring in sacred things farther then he giueth vs leaue
curiositie in this kind hath beene the mother of heresies when men haue beene

busily wittie in searching into rather then belieuing of that profound article of the trinitie

man that is not able to vnderstand his owne nature dauid confesseth such knowledge is too wonderfull for him dreameth that hee can comprehend the nature of god

others haue lost themselues while they haue diued into the mysteries of the incarnation who are not able to vnderstand their owne regeneration
some themselues in the booke of gods prouidence and would know more then is possible for man to conceiue of gods counsell in predestination of the cooperation of grace in others climbe not so high but yet they goe to farre in determining the manner of the mysticall vnion in the sacrament and discouering of mysticall senses in many passages of the scriptures
to say nothing of the iewish cabalists of astrologian diuinations of hereticall reuelations and heathenish mysteries
it is too cleare that what with the curious cur why of some and quomodo how of others there hath beene manifold passing the bounds climbing the mount and intrusions vpon god and the things of god

it is naturall to a man to desire knowledge but since wee did eate of the forbidden fruit we haue beene very peruerse in that desire we that haue no mind to know god as we ought are very eager to know him as we ought not
in this world non deum scrutari sedam are debemus we should rather desire to loue god then to know him whereas wee desire rather to know him then to loue him and as our first parents desire rather to eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euill then of the tree of life
and we need as a spurre vnto good and sauing knowledge so a bridle to restraine vs from that knowledge which is curious and presumptuous

wherefore blessed is that discretion which maketh vs wise vnto sobrietie

will conclude this point with a good admonition of the sonne of syrach

seeke not out the things that are too hard for thee neither search the things that are aboue thy strength but what is commanded thee thinke therevpon with reuerence
the ground of that good aduise you shall sind in meses

the secret things belong vnto the lord god but those things which are reuealed belong vnto vs and to our children for euer that we may doe all the words of this law

haue hitherto told you onely in generall whom this prohibition doth concerne but in the
verse wee find a distribution of these persons there we sind that the law is laid not onely vpon the people but vpon the priest also

no body will make a a question of the people what modestie beseemeth them yet there was a time when the question was made of them also

for korah dathan and abiram came vpon moses and aaron thus
you take too much vpon you all the congregation is holy and the lord is amongst them god is as neere to euery man as he is to you and euerie man may come as neere god as you doe
see you how they plead for confusion and animate the people to be bold with god but they were taught better manners

but if the people be what is that to the priest yea the priest also is to learne modestie
not only the minor cleargie as the rhemists mince it but the maior too they that are likely most to presume were to haue a speciall item
for the pride of our heart will carrievs aboue our selues when wee see that others are placed below therefore they that are aduanced in any degree need to bee remembred that they keepe their station

this did god excellently expresse in the fabricke of the tabernacle and of the temple wherein there was
first atrium prophanum thither might infidels and vncleane persons come but no farther within that was atrium populi thither might the lay both women and men come that were circumcised and not vncleane but farther they might not come except it were to offer their speciall sacrifices within that was atrium sacerdotum thereinto might the leuites come to doe their seruice to the priest but no farther within that was sanctum thereinto might the priest goe to offer incense but no farther within that was sanctum sanctorum whereunto the high priest only had accesse and that but once a yeare in reuerence of gods maiestie sitting in the cloud there vpon the mercie seate betweene the cherubins
you see that the neerest places to gods presence were of rarest accesse and that by fewest persons

looke what state god kept in the tabernacle and temple the same he kept at this hill appointing vnto the israelites seuerall stations the multitude both of priests and people haue their station allotted in this text
some might come nearer as aaron nadab and abihu and the seuentie elders but they are willed to worship afarre off and moses alone was to come neare the lord but they are expressely willed not to come nigh

in this chapter moses and aaron are called vp alone and are excepted out of the prohibition they may passe beyond others whom god calleth and they only
god was pleased to doe them this honour
and wee must repute it a great honour done vnto them that they might come so neare vnto god

our sauiour christ in the dayes of his humiliation kept the like state so farre as might stand with his forme of a seruant
for he did not so familiarly with the multitude as with the seuentie disciples nor with the seuentie as with the twelue apostles nor with the twelue apostles as with the pillars of them peter iames and iohn who only were admitted to bee priuie to the highest glorie that hee manifested on earth which was his transfiguration and the deepest passion which hee endured on earth which was his agonie
yea euen of these three he chose out one as the principall fauourite iohn whose stile is the beloued disciple who at supper leaned on his bosome whom saint peter himselfe vsed vnto christ when he would be resolued who it was that should betray him finally him he made the high soring and sharpe sighted eagle the beholder and penner of that reuelation which hath as many mysteries as words

god then who is an absolute monarch will bee a free disposer of his fauours and we must not presume of more then hee vouchsafeth the people may not the priest may not both must take heed vnto themselues that they doe not presume

take heed vnto themselues then themselues haue a pronenesse to curiositie

and indeed so it is for euery man is baited and so ledaside by his owne lusts and there is no lust so ancient in man as pride is
yea the first sinne of angels was the stepping ouer their bounds and though pride be not homebred in man as it was in angels yet experience proued in adam and eue that mans nature is a soile very apt to conceiue the seed of pride if it be sowne in it by the deuill neither will any seed of iniquitie proue sooner or faster
considering then the aptnesse of our nature to receiue and forwardnesse to bring forth this euill fruit god doth not without cause by moses bid the israelites take heed vnto themselues

neither to themselues only but to their cattell also they must bee watcht that they breake not the bounds
and indeed if our peccare be quasi pecuare if wee shew our selues beasts when wee doe straggle then it is the propertie of beasts to straggle and seeing it is their propertie they must be looked vnto
but you will say that they are vnreasonable creatures and so able to doe morally neither well nor ill
true but yet the place which we must not prophane our selues we must much lesse suffer our beasts for to prophane
yea obserue it well and you shall find that whether wee keepe fasting dayes or feasting dayes god will haue euen beasts to communicate in some sort in the ceremoniall part of our pietie
in the solemne repentance of niniue not only the men but the beasts also are commanded by the king to bee kept from meate to bee clothed with sackcloth
in the law of the sabbath when man resteth the beast must rest also thinke you only in a cruill sense there is more in it then so as hereafter shall shew you
god would haue them also to obserue his feasts
and here we see that what prohibition god layeth vpon men he layeth vpon beasts neither may prophane holy ground
and may ours doe that which theirs might not doe may dogges tread in gods sanctuarie during the new testament which vnder the old testament were not suffered to be so very dogges that is impudent creatures it should seeme wee thinke they may else would wee not bring them hither and indure them here not only to disturbe gods seruice but also to disgrace gods house
shame to speake what we blush not to see the markes of their vncleanlinesse in the most sacred places of this church and thinke other churches are not vsed much better
well would wee were more sensible of it
but if we be not assure our selues that not only papists but iewes turkes and infidels will rise in iudgement against vs who indure no such brutish prophanenesse of holy places

might tell you of your children also if the time would giue mee leaue whom you bring hither but no otherwise then as to a market place to pipe and dance to crie or to mourne

to doe any thing sauing that which beseemes a christian and the reuerence that they should shew here
whereas you should inure them to heare to bow their knees hold vp their hands and eyes and testifie that they honour god euen before that they haue discretion to know him
but will take some other time for this now goe on in my text
the next point herein is the strictnesse wherewith this prohibition is to be obserued
the israelites must not transgresse their bounds either cominùs or eminùs at hand or aloofe by but touching so much as the border of the mountaine or gazing vpon that representation of gods presence which was vpon the mountaine

as god doth honour kings by giuing them the title of gods so doth he vse to resemble the state of earthly kings when he representeth himselfe vnto the world
now the easterne kings to whose state the scripture doth commonly allude when it setteth forth god vsed to require two ceremonies of their subiects
the one that they should not presse into their presence vncalled that you shall read ester
the other they neuer looked their king in the face but euer demissely fixt their eyes vpon the ground while they were in his presence
alluding to these ceremonies of state doth god here require that the israelites be not too forward with their feet nor misplace their eyes

and indeed if we may not without vnmannerlinesse presse into the presence of a mortall king how much lesse into the presence of the king of kings if earthly maiestie is thought to bee vnderualued if it be made the obiect of a subiects eye what disrespect is done vnto the glorie of god if it become a familiar spectacle of a creature

surely the angels vaile their eyes with two of their wings when they attend the presence of god and in the most holy place the cherubins were made with their eyes looking downe vnto the mercie seate not vpward to the cloud the type of gods presence

whereunto saint peter alludeth when he saith that into the mysteries of the gospel the angels themselues desire undefined span alphabet with bowed heads to peepe
if there be such modestie in the angels eyes that are such glorious creatures how much modestie should there bee in our eyes that are but mortall men most weake and wicked creatures and if euer god may expect reuerence from vs certainly then when he sitteth as it were in parliament and giueth lawes vnto his people

yea verily god doth vs a fauour in that he doth prohibit our presumption
for our abilities are nothing proportioned to that obiect and our neare approach without extraordinarie support would but worke our confusion as they haue confessed that haue made triall of it
and it is the maxime of philosophie excellens sensibile corrumpit sensum
god as the sunne is not comfortable but in a reasonable distance

marke moreouer that both the first and the first of

sinne are restrained by this prohibition
the first is by the eye by that the tempting obiect entreth vs so it entred eue the sonnes of god achan and dauid all of them were taken by gazing
adde hereunto that there was another euill that might bee feared from the eye they were called now to vse their eares and not eyes to heare god not to see him
in heauen wee shall see god here we must heare him here we must liue by faith there we shall liue by sight
therefore god will not haue our eyes to hinder our eares our gazing on the mount to hinder our listning to his law

not that it is an euill thing to see god but it is euill to see with curiositie when we are forbidden as it was for lots wife to behold sodome after the angell had bid her not to looke backe
therefore is this first of sinne forbidden the rather because it will easily set on worke the first of sinne and whether the eye goeth before the foot will be readie to follow after if we gaze vpon the mountaine it will not be long before we touch the border
and touching is a kind of tasting and a taste doth but set an edge vpon our appetite he that doth once rellish any sinne will neuer leaue till he be glutted with it giue your appetite an inch and it will take an ell
where
fore god cutteth off all occasion of presumption as in the of this booke he tooke order lest the israelites should eate leauen in the prohibited time that they might haue no leauen in their houses euen so here lest the israelites should venter vp the hill hee forbiddeth them so much as to touch the border thereof or gaze on that which appeared thereon
and we must make a couenant with our eyes and with our feet that neither of them come within the lists of sinne and so we shall be sure to sinne with neither
you haue seene how strict the charge is now you must heare how sharpe the punishment will be if they breake their bounds
the punishment is death
you may thinke this very rigid iustice no lesse then death for violating a ceremonie
for it was but a ceremonie to hold backe the foot and withold the eye from that sacred place the accesse whereunto was not in its owne nature vnlawfull for others without blame went vnto it
but gods ceremonies containe moralities and we must not looke so much vpon the outward as the inward action which of this ceremonie was modest reuerence or reuerent modestie
secondly our eye must not bee so much vpon the matter wherein we offend as the person against whom we offend though the matter commanded be but small yet it is no small matter to despise him that commandeth
and how shall it appeare that we surrender our sclues absolutely to his pleasure if our obedience bee not at his command when his command doth limit our vse of things indifferent yea the lighter the thing wherein he doth trie vs the greater our contempt if we disobey

by these rules must you take the scantling of adams sinne which

was much greater indeed then in shew neither was his doom more grieuous then his sinne was hainous
the like must you iudge of this doome

and this will stay your wondring when you reade the storie of vzza in the second of samuel

who was stricken dead when he offered to doe as he thought a good office to stay the arke when it was readie to fall but the arke was not made to bee carried in a cart but vpon mens shoulders and for neglecting that was he stricken dead as you may gather by the correcting of that fault in the very same chapter
neither would dauid haue beene displeased with vzaes death if he had sooner knowne this

nor the bethshemites would neuer haue asked this question who is able to stand before this holy lord god when that more then fiftie thousand were slaine for looking into the arke
for god had prouided

that the that bare it should not come neere till the sonnes of aaron had wrapt it in three or foure couerings if before that they touched it they were to die
how much lesse might the promiscuous multitude behold it and not suffer for their presumption

two affections there are loue and feare which must order our respect towards god and the lesse we are apt to loue god the more doth god take order we should feare him
and seueritie is neuer more seasonable then when the first foundation of a state is laid as this of israel now was for if lawes be then slighted they will neuer be obeyed and awe well begun in the people is like to be the longer liued
therefore will god haue iustice so quicke in this case but here is not only death denounced but such a death as belongeth to an execrable thing
for first all men must abborre the person so vnderstand the phrase no hand shall touch it
though some conceiue thereby that all rescuing of the malefactor is forbidden
but that sense though it bee good yet is not so naturall to my text
this rather is meant that no man must desile himselfe by touching him who by his presumption had made himselfe abominable
for as hee that being himselfe impure touching holy things in the law maketh them prophane and abominable so he that being otherwise pure intrudeth vpon holy ground or holy things makes his owne person abominable
and none is reputed of god more abominable then he that is sacrilegiously presumptious
though no man must touch him yet euery mans hand must be against him they must stone him with stones or shoot him through
if neare then must they stone him with stones if farther off from them then they must shoot him with darts euery hand must trie euery meanes rather then they must suffer the malefactors to scape
and hee must needs be an execrable person against whom god doth arme the hands of all the people with iustice

finally note that this doome is vnpardonable the very phrase importeth as much moriendo morietur non viuet these words note a peremptorinesse in the sentence
you haue the like in ezech

as the

contrarie thereunto in that place he shall liue hee shall not die noteth a certaintie of life
we must take heed of corrupting the phrase as eue did

who when god told adam at what time thou shalt eate of the forbidden fruit moriendo morieris thou shalt surely die she turned the phrase which was vndoubted into a peraduenture and told the serpent lest yee die

and see our weaknesse
commonly in doubtfull cases wee incline to the worst she did but doubt she might not doe it the deuill putteth her out of all doubt and telleth her shee may doe it
it is not good therefore for vs to play the wantons with gods threatnings if we meane to hold in our vntoward nature from sinning we must vnderstand them in that rigour as god doth deliuer them
euery man must
for here is quicunque no respect of persons none of the people none of the priests as many as are forbidden to sinne so many are threatned the doome
neither haue the great any priuiledge to doe ill and farewell all shall fare as they doe
neither only men but beasts also you haue heard before they were forbidden to transgresse so here you see if they doe transgresse they are doomed to die
the master shall bee punished in the losse of his beast because hee looked not better to him and the beast shall bee punished because it had ventured to prophane holy ground for told you before that euen beasts were tied to doe reuerence to the sanctuarie
man and beast must die if they transgresse die by the hands of the israelites
but a malefactor may yet hope that the people will bee foolishly pitifull at least great ones may thinke they may find as much fauour as agag did at the hands of saul
what then shall they escape shall gods doome bee reuerst it shall not bee reuerst they shall not scape the lord shall breake forth against the greatest of them
gods iustice is fenced with mercie and his mercie is as it were a bulwarke betweene vs and his iustice but if so bee our sinnes grow to this height it will not be held in
and when it rusheth forth it is like an ouerbearing flash of lightning which flieth not abroad without a fearefull clap of thunder it terrifieth and destroyeth together
but more of that hereafter

there remaine two points more which will touch in a word
the first
this prohibition is often repeated here we haue it in my text and we haue it once and againe towards the end of this chapter you would thinke this superfluous moses himselfe thought so he seemeth somewhat discontented with god for inculcating it so often
but moses was but a nouice in gouernment therefore he thought once telling was enough

god which is the ancient of dayes and throughly acquainted with mans infirmitie knowes that his forgetfulnesse his vntowardlinesse needeth be remembred he must be vrged more then once and often is not more then enough to worke our care and keepe vs in awe

see then gods clemencie that doth not hold his tongue in warning that hee may hold his hand in striking
wee are no better then the israelites neither doe wee lesse neede reiterated warnings then the israelites did the minister therefore must not bee secure of his charge but suspect these defects in them and redouble his admonitions to them
as moses added a deuteronomie to the former bookes of the law though he repeated but the same thing and the euangelists added gospel vpon gospel of the same argument and the apostles added epistles to epistles not much varying their doctrine so it must not grieue vs to write and speake the same things to the people and for them it is a sure thing as the apostle teacheth philip



the last point sheweth how this prohibition is limited in time when the trumpet soundeth long then shall they come vp to the mount
it is disputed whether these words point out the time wherein the israelites must come out to meete god and then come vp the hill is but to come to the foot of the hill whether moses brought them
or whether it point the time when god would goe from the mount and leaue it free to be resorted vnto by man and beast
this last agreeth better with the old translations the septuagint and chaldie and the most iudicious diuines pitch vpon it and wee will follow them
though will not rashly define whether the symbolicall presence of god left the hill before it rested vpon the tabernacle which almost was a twelue moneth after
but this note
that positiue precepts are not perpetuall when their end ceaseth the law is at an end
yea and the vigour of it sensibly decayeth when the people become vnsit to vse it so that god doth not tire out their care and feare of danger but setteth them free in due time whom for a time hee doth restraine
after god was departed that hill was no more a sanctuarie well might the israelites beare a ciuill respect vnto it a religious they might not without impietie
which note the rather because of the common superstition especially of papists who continue a religious opinion and respect vnto the places which christ frequented in the dayes of his flesh and the apostles after him canaan for example which they tearme the holy land
whereas god hath long since as hee long before threatned prophaned that place neither may we expect any heauenly vertue from it but out of grosse superstition
yet will we not denie vnto all those monuments a due respect so that it be no more then ciuill

but to our purpose
the ceremoniall prohibition is ceased but the morall contained vnder it must neuer cease we must neuer cease with reuerence to come to gods house

and not forget in his feare to worship towards his holy temple

moses bad the israelites take heed to themselues he discharged his dutie in commanding this modestie and the israelites obeyed they

did not passe their bounds nor came before they were summoned verse
and therefore scaped the punishment a blessed concurrence both of pastor and people
and what can say but bid vs take heed to our selues let vs take heed of the sinne here forbidden let vs take heed of the punishment here threatned let vs bee as readie to obey that admonish not in vaine and we shall neuer vndergoe the punishment if we auoid the sinne

and a better way to auoid it cannot commend vnto you then that which was practised by king dauid you haue it in the psalme
lord mine heart is not haughtie

nor mine eyes loftie neither doe exercise my selfe in great matters or in things too high for mee surely haue behaued and guieted my selfe as a child that is weaned of his mother my soule is euen as a weaned child

here should end but may not forget to bid you ioyne this sermon with the former
that taught you puritie this modestie
it is not enough for a man that vnto god to be pure he must bee modest also wee are apt to presume vpon our holinesse but modestie will keepe vs humble
modestie will teach vs that bee we neuer so pure in our owne eyes

we are not so in gods the heanens are not cleane in his sight and hee layeth folly to the angels how much more to men who dwell in houses of clay and who drinke iniquitie like water

wherefore let vs neuer thinke our selues more worthy then god thinketh vs yea let vs acknowledge our selues vnworthy of the least grace that god doth doe vnto vs so may our humble holinesse make vs more capable of gods goodnesse heere and blessednes hereafter

when god and the israelites were prepared in such manner as at seuerall times haue shewed you god to deliuer the israelites to receiue the law then they met together
this their meeting is the onely point in this chapter that remaineth vnhandled my purpose is god willing to dispatch it at this time that so hereafter may come on to the next chapter which containeth the principall matter of my arrant
we are then first in this meeting to consider when and what it was when it was vpon the third day and that in the morning
to know what it was we must see pirst in what manner secondly by what mediatour
the manner hath two remarkable things the signification which god gaue of his readinesse to come and the impression which that made vpon the israelites
the signification was full of dreadfull state for the came before to prouide gods place thunder lightning the cloud the trumpet
and these harbingers were very dreadfull some to the eye the slashes of lightning that brake out of the cloud the duskie flame that ascended from the whole hill on fire some to the eare the claps of thunder and the loud sound of the trumpet
as the harbingers were dreadfull so they made an answerable impression in the israelites the impression was hopefull feare
feare the israelites quaked in their tents yea and moses himselfe quaked vpon the way
neither will you wonder that the reasonable creatures did quake at such a presence when you read in my text that the mountaine the senslesse mountaine became as it were sensible at this foretast of gods accesse vnto it it trembled exceedingly
such was the feare
but this feare was not without hope for notwithstanding it they set out from their tents and came onto their standing to the foote of the hill the place where they were to attend gods comming downe vpon the mountaine and this they could not doe without some hope
but in this interuiew we must take notice of the decorum or decencie obserued by the israelites and the gracious benignitie exprest by god

the decorum or decencie was this the israelites came first to their place before god came to his
and you know it is good manners when

vnequall persons meete that the inferiour should waite for the comming of his superiour

the benignitie was this no sooner did man make towards god but god vouchsafeth to meete man halfe wayes
out of both these will arise another note
that except man ascend aboue himselfe and god descend below himselfe there can be no meeting of god and man
these things we shall consider in the manner
but this manner sufficeth not vnto the meeting except there be moreouer a mediatour for persons so farre distant in nature as god and man cannot come together except some body come betweene
and here we find moses acting that person hee puts heart into the quaking israelites and led them out of their tents to the place where they were to attend god and he kept them in heart standing betweene god and them while the articles of the couenant were proclaiming
haue pointed at the particulars which purpose god willing to handle at this time briefly and in their order
god grant that we may so profit thereby that whensoeuer god giueth any signification of his accesse to vs we may bee affected with a religious feare toward him that so keeping this manner by the helpe of our mediatour wee may giue him a blessed meeting
come we then to the first particular the circumstance of time
it was the third day the third after their comming vnto mount sinai but the fiftieth after their comming out of aegypt
which you may gather if you adde hereunto the time specified in the first verse of this chapter there you read that they came to the hill the first day of the third moneth
now the moneths of the iewes being lunarie and reckoned from one coniunction to another in vulgar computations are reckoned to consist of thirtie dayes one with another though in the exactnesse of astronomie it bee somewhat otherwise this being knowne we must calculate thus
the children of israel came out of aegypt the fourteenth moone as they call it that is the fourteenth day of the lunarie moneth so that of the first moneth they spent seuen teene dayes on their way for so many there are from foureteene to thirtie inclusiuely
adde hereunto the whole second moneth which consisteth of thirtie dayes and seuenteene and thirtie maketh fortie seuen whereunto if you adde the three dayes which they had beene now at the mount your number will be iust fiftie
so that the law was deliuered the fiftieth day after the celebration of the passeouer

you may not thinke this note it is of speciall vse in comparing the new testament with the old
the truth did exactly answere vnto this tipe and whitsuntide keepeth the same distance from our easter
christ the true passeouer was offered for vs to deliuer vs from the slauerie of sinne death and hell at the season of the yeare wherein the passeouer was offered for the redemption of the israelites out of the aegyptian thraldome
and at that time in which god deliuered the

law vnto the redeemed israelites hee gaue the spirit which is the life of the law vnto the redeemed christians
that spirit which is the finger of god to write the law in the fleshly tables of our hearts which the sraclites long before receiued written indeede with the finger of god but in no better then the two tables of stone
so that that we enioy the truth whereof they had the type
vnderstand me de undefined span alphabet of the formall administration of this first couenant

which did containe onely undefined span alphabet as the apostle calleth it mans obligation what dutie hee owed what punishment he deserued
these be the things that are principally represented in the forme of this first couenant
and therefore doth the apostle call it the ministrie of the letter and of death

in opposition to the second couenant which hee calleth the ministrie of the spirit and of life
otherwise wee may not denie that the patriarches had the spirit of grace also though not dispenced by the forme of the old couenant yet whereunto the old couenant led them as a schoolemaster making them sensible of their miserie it made them seeke vnto christ for remedie

but haue touched at this point once before therefore will dwell no longer on it
onely take this note that as whitsontide followeth easter so doth sanctification follow after iustification whom god redeemeth to them hee giueth his law and he doth sanctifie all those whom he instifieth
he that keepeth one feast must keepe both because he that hath one hath both these gifts
need not speake of the morning which shewed gods exemplarie forwardnesse for this blessed meeting which we shall doe well to follow as dauid did psal enough of the time
come now to the signification of gods readinesse to come
told you it was full of state the harbingers come before to prepare gods place

mortall princes come not to great assemblies to parliament to the throne of iudgement to the ratifying of leagues

but undefined span alphabet with a great deale of pompe
if euer they then shew their royaltie they make it appeare that they are neither beggerly nor contemptible nor vnable to reuenge themselues they make shew of their glorie and their power
there is reason for it for the vulgar that haue no iudgement of true moralitie are held in from disrespects to their gouernours by these ceremonies and the attention of their eares is kept waking by such amazing of their eyes and discreete policie doth this way make them obedient beyond their vnderstanding

god taketh the same course and sheweth not himselfe vnto his people but with much ceremonious maiestie at this meeting which did partake of these three kinds of assemblies
for it was a parliament it had the image of an assises and therein was the coniugall league confirmed betweene god and israel
shall touch at all three

might lead you to behold this in his appearing to abraham

when he entred into couenant with him where the thicke darknesse the smoaking furnace the fire goe before him

his apparition to elids which was attended with an earthquake a whirlewind and a fire too
none so

stately

so ample as that which is described by ezechiel and daniel except happily that in the reuelation
omit many others it is enough in these to let you see that it was vsuall with god to shew himselfe in state to send his harbingers before him
the reason whereof is to worke a due respect towards his sacred maiestie you are taught it plainely in the psalmes
giue vnto the lord yee mightie giue vnto the lord glorie and strength giue vnto the lord the glorie due vnto his name worship the lord in the beautie of holinesse
the reason followeth in the psalme and it is taken from these harbingers of god the thunder and the lightning you may read it at your leasure

call these the harbingers of god because we may not grossely conceiue

that god is like vnto any of these
saint austin hath refuted that dreame and indeed it is the seed of idolatrie
they are but the attendants vpon god his guard you may call them or you may call them his hoast they are the instruments of his power he was pleased to vse them to set forth his state both in mount sinai as we read here and in mount sion as wee read act

the place paralell to this
but will keepe my selfe to mount sinai

told you then that the harbingers here specified were dreadfull dreadfull some to the eare some to the eye
the eye and the eare are the best intelligencers of the reasonable soule the quickest of apprehension and truest in their information
and therefore when god will worke our heart he worketh it by these and in these you shall first see what feeling we haue of dreadfull obiects
you haue a prouer be touching the eare

which the holy ghost vseth more then once will doe a thing which whosoeuer heareth both his eares shall tingle
experience doth discouer this that hideous noyses worke a commotion in our spirits and make them flie vp into the head ring there as it were an amazed alarum and that in diuers formes which are better discerned by our feeling then can expresse in words
and as for our eye such spectacles how doe they fixe them as if they could not moue dazell them as if they had no sight melt them as if they were a fountaine of water god could not present these obiects to such eyes such eares but they will be confest to be dreadfull
dreadfull in their owne nature for so are flashes of lightning huge duskie flames of fire great claps of thunder the sound of such a trumpet whose loud sound might be heard of so many hundred thousand people
and if they were dreadfull in their owne nature as experience teacheth how much more when they are cloathed with such circumstances as these were the circumstance of place for these meteors were wrought in the lower region of the ayre whereas the middle region is their naturall place in the deserts of arabia a drie parched countrie which yeeldeth no exhalations no vapours which are the matter of these meteors

adde hereunto the season of the yeare for it was now the moneth of iune

a time wherein these meteors are not vsuall
but specially obserue out of nyssen that as at the destruction of sodome so now the skie was cleare there was no prognostication in the ayre of such an imminent

storme
so that it could not be imputed vnto nature it must needs bee confest that the finger of god was there

and god whom the booke of iob doth set forth as the father and treasurer of raine of winds of thunder of lightning can at his pleasure immediately by his word or else if it please him by his ministring spirits the bad angels as it appeares iob
how much more by the good who attend his throne and whom he vsed at this time produce such meteors when and where hee he will but the more vnexspectedly hee produceth them the more dreadfull they are and were at this time and place

am not yet come to the quicke
it is a good rule in diuinitie that these harbingers or attendants vpon gods apparitions are an image not onely of his greatnesse but of his prouidence also
in them as in a looking glasse you may behold the worke which he hath in hand
will shew it you in this present one you may make vse of the rule in vnderstanding other of gods workes

god was now about to deliuer his law and these harbingers represent the dreadfulnesse thereof
the dreadfulnesse of the precept that is noted first by the lightning and then by the thunder
by the lightning for the precepts of god are like sire they search and discouer the duetie of a man
it is a shallow conceite that the naturall man hath of his duetie to god or to his neighbour

saint paul confesseth what a stranger hee was in it till hee was better nurtured by the law and giueth this for a generall rule
by the law commeth the knowledge of sinne
so that the law suffereth not a man to be ignorant of his obligation but setteth it most legible before his eyes
this is the lightning of the precept of the law

and this lightning commeth not without a clappe of thunder for when a man from the law reflecteth vpon himselfe and seeth how short he commeth of fulfilling the law what perplexing terrours will arise in his thoughts what vnquietnesse will distresse his soule his spirit within him will bee ouerwhelmed and the tumult of his conscience will drowne the sound of all consolation that shall be ministred vnto it many haue had wofull experience hereof
as you haue seene the image of the precept of the law so must you also behold the image of the sanction
for the trumpet calleth to iudgment the flaming fire is an image of the doome the wicked shall bee summoned with much terrour and they shall bee sent into endlesse torments
for the summons shall be by the trumpet and the wicked shall goe into euerlasting fire
cannot stand to amplifie these things onely take these few obseruations that if this high parliament of god bee kept with so great terrour how dreadfull shall the grand assises bee our sauiour christ in the gospell hath set it forth by three euangelisls matth

whom you may paralell with marke and luke where you shall find that if this be terrible that is much more terrible

secondly obserue that things corporall come short of things spirituall and no words can fully expresse those things which are here meant

for much more is meant then can be said and according to the meaning doth the terrour arise
gods motto may well be nemo me impunè lacesset

thirdly we must consider the wonderfull patience of god and stupiditie of men
god sheweth vs in this spectacle of thunder lightning what he can doe what we deserue
but what sometimes caesar said to the questor who would haue hindred him from entring into the treasurie at rome shaking his sword it is easier for my power to dispatch thee then for the goodnesse of my nature to bee willing to strike thee may much more truely bee said of god his power maketh him mercifull and his mercie doth manage his power
the author of the booke of wisdome openeth this at large

but what stupiditie is there in the meane time in men in prouoking of god that is armed with such power and hath in readinesse such instruments of death yea which giueth such euidence of them to the intent that they may feare before him

it is true that mocking atheists aske

where is the promise of his comming
but this is vox coeci surdi they doe winke with their eyes and stop their eares other wise there is no man but in all ages god hath discouered vnto him the ensignes of his reuenging power

for haue we not thundring and lightning in all ages you will say they are but ordinary meteors no more is a rainbow
and yet that meteor hath a mysterie in it and that bow of heauen is called gods bow because it containeth a perpetuall prophesie that the world shall be no more destroyed with water

and are not the thunder and lightnings called gods voice and why because they signifie that god will come to iudgement with a tempestuous fire

wee may also make the same vse of the trumpets sure saint hierome had a good meditation when he said that whether he did eat or drinke or whatsoeuer hee did hee heard the trumpet sounding in his eare surgite mortui venite ad iudicium
will not stand to allegorize the two siluer trumpets still sounded while the sacrifice was burning at the altar

will only bid you remember saint iudes note of sodome and gomorrah whose perpetuall burning god hath left as a remembrance of the euerlasting fire of hell

some are yet more desperate and call for the day of the lord let it come let vs see it as you may read in the prophets
foole hardie wretches that desire that which they will neuer be able to endure

vpon the first ouerture of it their hearts will faile them they will bee at their wits end they will call to the hils and rockes to couer them
the kings of the earth the great men the mightie men bond and free all sorts of men shall then crie out the great day of the lambes wrath is come

and who is able to stand and indeed if the righteous scarcely be saued where shall the wicked and vngodly appeare

but to leaue them the last obseruation that will giue vpon this dreadfull state shall be that wee are much bound vnto god that wee liue not vnder the old testament but vnder the new that god hath brought vs not vnto mount sinai but vnto mount sion
where

god appeares in our nature and commeth meeke and in the forme of a seruant so sensible of our infirmities that hee cryeth not

his voice is not heard in the street hee will not breake a bruised reed nor quench smoking flaxe
he putteth vpon vs a light yoke and an easie burden his doctrine is a gospel their feet are beautifull that bring it

this yeara is an yeare of iubile his trumpet soundeth nothing but deliuerance his light is comfortable like the sunne

for he is the sonne of righteousnesse his lips are full of grace his mouth is most sweet
in this hill all things are louely there is nothing dreadfull at all
and why god hath giuen vs the spirit of adoption which is the spirit of loue

and of a sound minde so that wee can indure the very top of mount ston whereas they could not endure the bottome of mount sinai

time will not giue me leaue to pursue this comparison you may amplifie it out of saint paul
cor
heb
and if you will haue it to the full you must paralell the whole oeconomic of the new testament with that of the old
only let me giue you this note for a farewell to this point that as the patriarkes that were brought vnto mount sinai did beare themselues out vnder those terrors by casting their eyes forward vnto mount sion the place of comfort so wee lest we grow carnally secure during our abode at mount sion and surfet vpon the comforts thereof must cast our eyes backward vpon mount sinai and rowse our selues with the terrours thereof
the solace of sion is to none so pleasant as to him that commeth newly from sinai their soules doe best rellish the gospel whose consciences haue first sinarted from the law or that haue beene exercised by that hopefull feare the point that commeth next to be handled in my text
hopefull feare then is the impression that was made on the israelites by the dreadfull harbingers of god
first feare
feare is argued from quaking
for wee vsually say that men quake for feare
and indeed what is quaking of the bodie but a consequent of feare in the soule for the spirits are conueyed by the arteries the sinewes and the veines into the outward parts to sustaine confirme them inable them to their functions and the vitall parts send them forth abundantly while themselues are secure
but while we are or suppose our selues to be in any great danger all those forces repaire vnto and endeuour to safegard those principall inward fortresses especially the heart
whereupon the outward parts being vnfurnished fall as it were into a shaking palsie and so quaking is a consequent of feare

but let vs fit this impression vnto the apparition and so you shall find that it followeth thereupon
if there were nothing in these harbingers but an image of gods maiestie yet you shall not find in all the bible that euer any man had any extraordinarie glimpse of gods glory that did not vpon the apprehension thereof become as it were dead and giue himselfe ouer for a dead man
reade the storie

of gedeon and maneah in the booke of iudges and of the prophets whose inspirations were accompanied with visions ezechiel daniel others the generall rule is si te nouerim domine me ipsum nouerim shall neuer know how vile how fraile am by any thing so well as by presenting my selfe before the glorious maiestie of god

let vs descend to the second image that is to bee beheld in these dreadfull harbingers the image of the law and let vs see how that worketh feare

the image of the precept told you it is scarching and you cannot therewith search a man but you make him feare
aske saint paul he tried it and will tell you so he found by surueying himselfe that the law was spirituall and hee was carnall and out of a sensible acknowledgement that his strength was nothing proportionable to the law

he brake out into those passionate words wretch that am who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death king dauid surueyed the law and the excellent properties of the law but what is the vpshot of his meditation euen this who knoweth how oft he offendeth lord cleanse me from my secret faults keepe thy seruant from presumptuous sinnes lest they haue dominion ouer me
and verily no man can behold himselfe in that glasse and consider what manner of person he is but hee will bee driuen to that prayer in the last penitentiall

enter not into iudgement with thy seruant lord for in thy sight shall no flesh liuing be iustified

the precept then maketh afraid
and doth not the sanction also certainly it doth
the prophets that had a sight of god armed with vengeance against sinners how doe we find them affected and affrighted

esay saw the lord sitting vpon a throne high and lifted vp his traine filled the temple aboue it stood the six winged seraphins it is a vision of iudgement and it made esay crie out woe is me for am vndone

habakuk had a vision of the like argument which he describeth more at large and heare what was the effect when heard it my belly trembled my lips quiuered at the voice rottennesse entred into my bones

dauid confesseth of himselfe my flesh trembleth for feare of thee lord and am afraid of thy iudgements

but you will say such obiects may worke feare in a naturall man but what need these israeltes to feare they came armed against it they came prepared with puritie with modestie and should such men feare it is certaine they did feare and there was good reason for it for what proportion betweene mans abilitie and the maiestie of god when man is at the best and the israelites ceremoniall preparation could not so suddenly become morall that will aske more time then three dayes
the more they had of the old man the more they were subiect vnto this passion and it might well rise in them though the obiect which they discerned were aloofe off as indeed it was for their tents were in some good distance from the hill and though they were so farre cut of danger yet were they not out of feare the

dread of these harbingers of god seised vpon them

adde hereunto that the spirit of the old testament as saint paul telleth vs is the spirit of bondage and feare and so this passion had good correspondencie with that couenant

neither vpon them only but vpon moses also did these dreadfull harbingers worke for so must you vnderstand those words in the text moses spake saint paul will tell you what he said

exceedingly feare and quake so terrible was the sight in his eyes

the rhemists come in here vnseasonably with the doctrine of their traditions and they will haue saint paul by tradition know that moses spake those words
as if he might not know it aswell by reuelation for the spirit of prophecie looketh aswell backward as forward
else how did moses pen the booke of genesis that speaketh of things done so many hundred yeares before but what gaine they if we doe acknowledge he had it by tradition doe wee denie all traditions wee acknowledge traditions of many histories as that of iannes and iambres
of ceremonies as that of concluding the passeouer with blessed bread and wine whence christ tooke an occasion to improue them to an higher vse and institute the eucharist
our question is about articles of faith and hope this is none and therefore they may keepe the note in store vntill they meet with a more pregnant place
but let vs leaue those wranglers and come to moses
happily you wonder why hee should quake a man that came so neere god and was so deare vnto him god talked with him face to face as familiarly as a man talketh with his friend

but then these harbingers did not appeare no thunder no lightning then no burning hill no loud sounding of the trumpet when these appeare they will make moses himselfe to quake
and why shall say because there are some relikes of sinne euen in the best of gods saints during this life and being not perfect in loue they must needs bee subiect vnto feare if should say so

should say something but not all that is to bee said
for our sauiour christ that was without all sinne when he appeared in our nature at the as it were mount sinai
certainly at the tribunall of god where he had presented if not to the eyes of his bodie yet of his soule those dreadfull attendants vpon the throne of iudgement the sight cast him into an agonie and made him sweat water and bloud it made his humane nature to droope as himselfe confesseth and bee heauie vnto death
and doe wee wonder that the seruant feareth where we see the sonne in such a case let not the holy ones of god thinke to bee priuiledged from that whereunto the holy of holies was pleased to bee subiect
let vs all rather confesse that that indeed is dreadfull which is dreadfull to such a person and let vs all feare that which christ himselfe feared

but why goe so high as christ if they should not haue feared the mountaine would haue risen in iudgement against them for that trembled

it trembled exceedingly
in the psalme it is said that the earth shooke and trembled the foundations also of the hils were moued and were shaken alluding vnto this storie another psalme saith that the mountaines skipped like rams

and the little hils like young sheepe and mouing the question what ailed yee yee mountaines that yee skipped like rams and yee little hils like lambes the answere is made tremble thou earth at the presence of the lord at the presence of the god of iacob
and shall not wee feare him nor tremble at his presence when the senselesse creatures shew themselues awfully sensible of his accesse vnto them surely our senselesnesse must needs bee without all excuse
yet some such there haue beene
such were the scribes and pharisees who when the sunne lost his light the rockes cleft the graues were opened and the earth quaked were so little touched that their heart could serue them to contriue a forgerie wherewith to countenance that villanie wherewith they brought christ to his painfull and shamefull death
this was a spirit of slumber indeed and neuer did a greater spirituall lethargie seize vpon the sonnes of men

god euer keepe vs from such senselesnesse and giue vnto vs the spirit of feare whensoeuer his dreadfull harbingers present themselues before vs yea let vs often represent them vnto our selues that this feare may be seasonably present with vs
but let our feare be such as was that of israel and of moses a hopefull feare

for there is a feare that deterres from god and there is a feare that doth only humble vs before god

the first is the reprobates feare and maketh men like vnto caine renegadoes and vagabonds forsake god and goe they know not whether
but the godly mans feare maketh him tremble and yet keepe on his way though he goe quaking yet he goeth to god

and indeed after god hath made vs sensible of our weaknesse and his greatnesse he vseth to support and strengthen his children he makes them experience the truth of that answere which christ gaue to saint paul

my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weaknesse
cor
vers
so did he hearten esay with a cole from the altar daniel with a touch

moses with an answere a kind answere and by moses he bid the israelites not feare
and what wonder if he support his children in these tremblings seeing he supported the hill for other wise the hil being al on fire trembling in the fire must needs haue bin consumed but it held out
yea and so did moses aaron when they entred into the cloud trod vpon that fierie hil no lesse securely then the three children did in the fierie furnace whereinto they were cast by the appointment of nebuchadnezzar

and so shall the righteous at the day of iudgement when all the world is on fire and a lowder trumpet shal sound then this

at mount sinai
and wee must repute it a singular priuiledge of the children of god that they can subsist in such a place and such a presence

the lesson wherewith will conclude this point is that of the apostle

we must worke out our saluation in feare and trembling or if you will that of the psalme serue the lord in feare

and reioyce before him with reuerence
the lord loueth in his children the mixture of feare and hope

the argument of the sraelites hope is that they set out from their tents and came on to the place of their attendance and expecting of gods descending on the hill
will not here trouble you with the maner of their march
after the tabernacle was built god prescribed a manner what they did before the iewes tell vs but in the silence of the holy ghost we will not bee curious
it is likely they came as deut
when the couenant was as it were renewed
in this mouing of god and israel to the place of meeting obserued the good manners of the israelites and the benignitie of god
first the good manners of the israelites
for if you marke the text they came first to their place before god came to his
and it was fit it should be so for god being so much better then man it had beene insolent rudenesse for man not to waite for the comming of god
need not spend time to proue so common so knowne a moralitie at your ordinarie meetings if they be publike you practice the same
rather choose to note a mysterie enwrapt herein which is that although god preuenr vs in regard of our abilitie to come to him yet when wee are enabled he looketh that we should make vse of his grace and cooperate with him and not expect a second blessing before wee haue well husbanded the first and we should thinke it grace enough done vnto vs if hee then vouchsafe to answere our desires and crowne our endeauours
doe not here patronize popish freewill for speake not de libero but liberato arbitrio what our will can doe in entertaining the first grace is not the question but what it must doe after it hath receiued grace
and therefore here also the romanists come in vnseasonably with their obseruation

the second thing that obserued was gods benignitie which appeareth in this that if man make towards him he will meete him halfe way god descended vpon the hill after the children of israel came out of their tents towards the foote of the hill

wee know the parable of the prodigall childs father who descried his sonnes returning home a farre off and made haste to meete him it is a liuely picture of gods benignitie and we cannot haue a better encouragement to seeke vnto him

put both these notes together and then obserue that if euer wee looke there should be any meeting betweene god and man man must rise aboue himselfe but god must fall below himselfe
for we see here that the children of israel came out of their tents and moued towards the vpper ground giuing vs to vnderstand that sursum corda

we must set our affections on those things that are aboue
base thoughts and groueling that are sixed vpon things below and mind earthly things a naturall

man that will continue himselfe and that cannot put himselfe off or soare aboue himselfe and haue his conuersation in heauen is not fit to giue meeting vnto god

againe if god should keepe at his owne pitch and fall not much below himselfe humble himselfe as the psalme speaketh to regard those things that are below how should wee poore wretches be raysed out of the dust how should wee needie ones be lifted out of how should we euer bee set with princes and ranged with glorious angels come not home enough told you before that this was gods parliamentarie meeting that it bare some image of his grand assises
it was more it was the great day of the espousals of christ and his church
and did not the kings sonne and heire the sonne and heire of the king of heauen stoope very low when hee came to espouse himselfe vnto such base and sinfull persons surely when we consider the exceeding hight of gods estate and the lownesse of our owne of how little regard wee deserue to be and yet of how great regard we are wee haue good reason to thinke that gods goodnesse maketh him as it were lay aside his maiestie and be vnlike himselfe that he may so farre like vs and linke vs so neere vnto him
how then should we striue to ascend vnto him that doth thus vouchsafe to descend vnto vs you would think that by this time there is enough done to fit the meeting
we haue purified the israelites wee haue learned them modeie they haue beene humbled with feare and they haue gone out from themselues ascended aboue themselues and god hath fallen below himselfe there hath beene much done

and yet there is one thing more to bee done there wanteth a mediatour

and so indeed the apostle saith the law was giuen by the hands of a mediatour
and we haue here a typicall one and that is moses these persons would neuer haue come together except hee had come betweene

and we find here two acts of his the first is that hee put them in heart when they quaked and led them the way towards the mount neither would they euer haue aduentured had they wanted such a guide their feare would haue beene too strong for their hope
neither did moses only put them in heart to goe on but also kept them in heart when they were come to their standing by his incouragement it was that they held out while the articles of the conenant were proclayming they had flowne off if he had not stood betweene god and them

but this was but a typicall mediatour the true is our sauiour christ it is by him

that with boldnesse we come to the throne of grace it is by him that we haue accesse vnto god hee is the doore the way the truth and the life euen the true way vnto eternall life hee hath the key openeth and no man shutteth shutteth and no man openeth neither doth any but he bring children to god

and whether he bringeth vs there hee keepeth vs wee are preserued in him and by him
for as at first wee are accepted in gods

beloued so by his perpetuall propitiation and intercession are wee continued in the loue of god hee standeth betweene god and vs couering our imperfections that they offend not god and tempering the dreadfulnesse of gods maiestie with so much grace that the aspect thereof becommeth comfortable vnto vs

will not fall into any long refutation of the romish new coined mediators they egregiously dishonour the saints and angels while they make them vsurpers of christs office
and howsoeuer their schooles qualifie the matter their liturgies cannot be freed from this imputation
and the notions of the vulgar vnderstanding and the affections of their heart in their practicke deuotion are framed according to their liturgie not according to their schooles the more reason haue we to censure the abuse
moses at mount sinai aaron in the tabernacle may be typicall mediatours but there is no true one either in earth or heauen but only our sauiour iesus christ none of redemption as the papists confesse neither any of intercession as we moreouer hold and hold it with the primitiue church
but here end my text and with my text this whole chapter
only will giue you one generall obseruation vpon it which may not bee neglected
this whole chapter is but an exordium to the next chapter shall say or to the whole law indeed to the whole law but immediatly to the next chapter
now in this exordium would haue you obserue how god playeth the skilfull oratour and performeth all things which the best rules in rhetoricke require in an exordium
the rules require that an orator should captare beneuolentiam worke himselfe into the good liking of his auditors
and why because if they like not the man they will not much care for the matter
and doth not god this at the fourth verse doth he not set forth his well deseruings of them in ouerthrowing their euemies in setting them free and what may better giue god an interest in their loue then the experiment that hee had giuen them of his reall loue the next rule of rhetorike is reddere auditores dociles to bring them that alreadie affect the man to bee desirous to bee informed of the matter
and how is that done by shewing how much the matter concerneth them how beneficiall it will bee to them
for men gladly heare of their owne good and the greater the good the more gladly doe they heare of it
see how excellently god playeth this part of the orator at the fift and sixt verses how significantly hee setteth forth the benefit which they shall reape by their obedience shewing them what a rate hee will set vpon them what an approach they shall make to him how sacred how blessed their state shall bee which is so much the more to be esteemed in that they shall haue it as a prerogatiue none shall haue it but they
and who will not bee curiously inquisitiue after such a matter and heare them gladly that bring such good tydings

the third point of rhetoricke is auditores attentos reddere to rowse

his auditory make them shake off all dulnesse and drowsinesse that no part of the speech slip by or passe vnweighed

this is done by setting before vs the danger that may ouertake vs and the respect that must be vsed by vs
and god omitteth not this point of rhetoricke all the rest of the charge is spent hereabout
it serueth to quicken and quallifie the israelites as beseemed that heauenly sermon which they were to heare from the mouth of god

hitherto tend their preparation which you heard of heretofore and the humiliation wrought by the harbingers of god whereof you haue heard this day

what shall say now to you but only this the same sermon that was preached to israel is to be preached now to vs for we are now the israel of god therefore vnto vs belongeth this oratorie of god
yea god hath deserued better of vs then euer he did of israel for we enioy the truth whereof they had but the type
we haue reason then to affect him
yea and to affect also that which is deliuered by him for it containeth our soueraigne good our blessed communion with god
and those spurres of attention must worke vpon vs no lesse then vpon them because though wee be not called to the parliament we must come to the assizes the assizes is much more dreadfull then was the parliament
finally though wee were not at those espousals we shall be at the mariage feast it concerneth vs therefore to prouide our wedding garment
in a word will we nill we we are parties to this couenant though not as it was vailed yet as it was vnuailed
therefore not one of the articles must passe vs vnregarded because enquirie will be made after our conformitie vnto euery one of them

god grant that we may so set god and our owne good before our eyes that we may willingly open our eares and gladly apply our hearts to heare him and heare of it that what we shall learne at the foot of mount sinai may make vs more fit to climbe to the top of mount sion

so shall we be incorporated into the blessed societie that dwelleth there while wee liue here and hereafter hauing our harps sing there a new song before the throne before the foure beasts and the elders

which none can learne but the
which are redeemed from the earth
amen

then said he to the people that were come bee baptised of him
generation of vipers who hath forewarned you to flee from the wrath to come

this chapter is the second lesson appointed for this morning prayer the argument whereof is nothing else but a storie of saint iohn baptists seruice what paines he tooke and what successe he had his paines were great his successe diuers
to say nothing of them with whom hee preuailed nothing at all such as were they that despised the counsell of god against themselues being not baptised of him luke
this chapter sheweth that betweene them with whom hee preuailed there was no small odds for some were sincere some hypocrites saint iohn vseth them accordingly
for he instructeth the sincere mildly but his sermon against hypocrites it very sharpe you haue it in my text my text is saint iohns reproofe of those iewes which came dissemblingly to his baptisme

more distinctly to open it consider whom hee reproueth and how
the persons were many a multitude and they seeme well disposed whether you respect their paines or their pretence
their paines they came out they tooke a iourney from home to come vnto him and the

pretence of their iourney cannot be disliked for they came to be baptised
such were the persons

but how dealeth saint iohn baptist with them surely notwithstanding their great number and their faire shew hee doth not spare to tell them that they were in worse case then they thought and must take a better course then hitherto they had
for their case whereas there are but two heads whereunto we reduce all euill malum culpae and malum paenae sinne and the wages thereof hee telleth them that they were free from neither deepe in sinne for they were a generation of vipers in danger of the wages of sinne which is the wrath to come
in danger they were of it and yet they were not aware for who had forewarned them to from the wrath to come no master as yet had taught them that leison
so he opened their case
but here to haue ended his sermon had beene to leaue them to an vn end euen to desperation but hee doth not leaue them so as would haue them throughly to vnderstand their owne case so doth prescribe them a good course his words are plaine but of them is darke by a few propositions will make it
the was to haue a double being in the couenant an here the hereditarie was nothing but the which ad rem be that lineally descended from abraham might to bee admitted into the couenant which god made with him
the posseorte consisted in his personall grace which gaue him ius inre when hee did not onely descend from abraham according to the flesh but communicated also with him in the graces of the spirit
these two beings in the couenant were to concurre in euerie iew and they could not bee scuered without danger danger not to the but to the iew
now marke saint iohns words hee sheweth that the iewes did separate the personallgrace from their birth right wherefore he calleth vpon them to remedie that bring forth fruites worthy of repentance
this is the personall grace which saint iohn will haue the iewes adde to their buth right and which hee telleth them they cannot separate without danger danger to themselues not to the couenant
to themselues begin not to say with your selues we haue abraham to father we haue abraham to our father is too single a plea it pleadh onely the birth right god can deriue that vnto others without
this couenant he can raise children vnto abraham of the verie steres
and he can according to his couenant reward you as you deserue roote you out of that family now the
you see what is the substance of this scripture and the that shall handle thereon not all at this time but so many as the time will perm
consider what say and the lord giue vs vnderstanding in all things

begin at the persons and of them first consider the number the na great a multitude in the originall it is multitudes saint matth conimes it by particularising the seuerall companies
but whereas the word undefined span alphabet may signifie either the qualitie or the quantitie of persons

the qualitie and so is vsed for the vulgar people whom in english wee call the multitude or else may signifie their quantitie here it is taken not for qualitie but quantitie
for the persons are many in number ierusalem came out all iudaea came out and so did all the confines of iordan

so saith matthew and he saith also that amongst them that came out there were more then vulgar persons for there were pharisees saduces

persons of principall note amongst the iews as appeares not only in the gospel but also in iosephus
and of those there came a great many so many as that some would haue the word multitude in saint luke to be restrained vnto them according to the direction of saint matthew in whom this sharpe sermon seemeth to be made onely vnto the pharisees and saduces

but because hypocrisie might bee common vnto more we will take the words at large and concerning the multitude obserue this that though they had lost the true knowledge of the messias yet the hope of a messias they had not lost they hearkned diligently after him
their calamitie sharpned their desire such was their miserie vnder the romanes that no person either seditious or superstitious promised newes of the messias but he was flockt vnto by men of all sorts we haue a touch at it in the acts but in iosephus it is deliuered more at large

the same god that in punishment of their grosse mistake of the messias suffered them to bee abused by impostors honoured the comming of the true messias with resort of no small numbers to his harbinger
and this agreeth well with those titles that the scripture giueth vnto saint iohn he is called the voice of a crier he was heard farre and rowsed many he was a burning lampe he shined cleare and drew many his doctrine his life were both such and so powerfull as be seemed the harbinger of christ that harbinger that was to take vp many lodgings for him by them saint iohn preuailed
and ministers must herein imitate him and the people must imitate these multitudes they must learne of them to come forth

and so from the persons come to their disposition
they seeme well disposed first in their paines they came from home vnto saint iohn and some of them came somewhat farre
the principle is good and ancient that men that will serue god must goe from their owne home though a man may serue god at home yet the sollemne place of worship was commonly distinct from the priuate home so was it euen in the dayes of adam as bertram obserueth it is more cleare in the dayes of the patriarches but most of all in the time of the tabernacle and temple to say nothing of the synagogues and the most christian emperours did not disdaine to come into publique assemblies of the church
as religion grew cold so priuate oratories were at first onely for kings afterward for peeres and now scarce any man of more then ordinarie ranke that must not haue a church in his owne house
men thinke themselues too good to sort with the common assembly
but though their bee a subordination of states in the yet this subordination ceaseth when we come into the church where all should alike bow and pray heare and obey as hauing but one god one sauiour one faith one

hope and all these farre from respect of persons whereupon saint paul grounded his exhortation

which also renue vnto you forsake not the assembly as some doe
in a word wee must goe out to saint iohn baptist not from our home only wee must goe from our state also these iewes did goe out from their houses indeed but not from themselues and so their paines was rather great then good not like abraham that did not only come out from his fathers house but from his idolatrie also especially if wee come to receiue sacred things wee must forsake our former euill wayes

let vs vs see their pretence that cannot be disliked they went to be baptized
baptisme was a sacrament wherewith god began the new testament
whensoeuer god began a new reformation of his church he did alwayes accompanie it with some new ceremonie which serued to shew the beginning of that worke and to keepe it in remembrance
when adam fell god altered the ceremonies whereunto he was vsed before the fall namely the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and euill into sacrifices that might prefigure the redemption by christ
when the world degenerated againe and god renued this couenant with abraham hee instituted a new ceremonie that of circumcision
when abrahams posteritie degenerated god reformeth againe and to point out this new reformation hee instituted the tabernacle the priesthood of aaron
and when this could not hold the iewes in the truth of religion god commeth to his last reformation and that hath his ceremonies also whereof the first was baptisme baptisme whereby men were admitted into the church of christ
and this baptisme was the easier entertained by this because the prophets had foretold that when the messias came he should poure forth cleane waters

and cleanse the filthinesse of israel with them
galatinus saith that the old rabbins did vnderstand it of such a worke of the messias
but whatsoeuet is to bee thought of his iudgement who doth oftentimes make the most of the rabbins sayings sure it is that the prophets words doe sound that way reade ezech

esay
zacharie
where this point is enlarged and baptisme foretold

which also was prefigured in naamans cleansing and in the curing vertue of the poole of bethesdah
in a word hearing that by this ceremonie they might be admitted into the kingdome of the messias they frequented it

a dispute there is whither saint iohns baptisme and christs were all one some difference is pretended out of the fathers but they are mistaken as zanchius hath well obserued in the annotations vpon his confessions
neither is it likely that the baptisme of christians should differ from the baptisme of christ although the efficacie of saint iohns baptisme was not from his sprinkling of the water but from christs giuing of the spirit

the defect of these persons that came to be baptized was that they did affect baptismum fluminis but not flaminis and this saint iohn apprehended and this made him to be quicke with them as he shewed

himselfe to bee in the manner of his reproofe come now to that wherein you may perceiue the spirit of elias
notwithstanding their great number and faire shew whereof the one would haue terrified the other deceiued ordinarie men this prophet of whom christ saith

more then a prophet reuealeth and declareth the bad case of these as by the holy spirit it was no doubt discouered vnto him for christ elsewhere vseth the same phrase and that to the same persons
and marke that he doth not only in generall preach repentance but he doth discreetly apply himselfe to the persons and tempereth his language as is fitting to them
and so should wee doe for nothing is more absurd then vniformitie of language when wee haue to doe with different hearers
but yet herein we must not be indulgent to our corrupt affections but the fire that kindleth our zeale must bee heauenly
wee must reproue those within the church more sharpely then those without and the leaders more sharply then the followers those that are hypocrites then plaine dealing men
and it was fit that the pharisees and saduces that were so and so domineered ouer the consciences of the common people should heare how little they did answere the opinion they had of themselues and the people should see there was no reason they should haue their skill in the scriptures or holinesse of life in so great admiration
the saduces and pharisees were at oddes betweene themselues but all agreed in this qualitie of vipers
and if they that pretend so fairely are so reproued how should they bee reproued that are openly prophane there are but two heads whereunto we reduce all euill malum culpae and malum poenae sinne and the wages thereof he sheweth that they were free from either
first not a malo culpae not from sinne for they were a generation of vipers few words but they reach home and challenge these persons as being gone as farre as may bee in sinne
for behold the three dimensions thereof the intensiuenesse noted by the word viper secondly the extensiuenesse noted by the word generation and thirdly the protensiuenesse the generation of vipers
the word viper sheweth that they were corrupt euery one in his owne nature and the word generation sheweth that the corruption had ouerspread whole multitudes for a generation is a multitude of persons that liue at the same time put generation and vipers together and that will import that the infection reached from parents to children whereof the later were no better then the former
it is a wofull thing if sinne be only personall and defile the nature of any one man but yet there is good hope that the righteousnesse of a multitude may slay gods hand from proceeding against the personall sinne
if of personall sinne become nationall the case groweth much worse and yet some hope remayneth euen for a whole sinfull nation if their parents were not such for god doth oftentimes spare the children farre gone in sinne in remembrance of their parents which had serued and feared him
but when they also haue beene bad and sinne is become naturall to a nation what hope none for sinne can goe no farther

then of personall to become nationall and of nationall to become naturall
so farre was sinne gone in these persons whom here saint iohn calls a generation of vipers

but to single the words a viper is a beast the persons of whom saint iohn speaketh were men behold that vnto men hee giueth the name of beasts
man that was created after the image of god was to better his estate and become like an angell but by the fall he made it worse and fell below himselfe to the condition of a beast
man being in honour saith the psalmist hath no vnderstanding

but becommeth like the beasts that perish
hence is it that the scripture doth often giue him the name of a beast

of a lion of a leopard of a wolfe yea what beast is there whose name the scripture doth not fit vnto man giuing vs to vnderstand that he is a compound beast compounded of all those ill qualities that are obserued in any beast so that no one beast bee it neuer so bad can bee matched vnto man seeing man can transforme himselfe into the sauagenesse of all be as cruell as any lion as rauenous as any wolfe as implacable as a beare as craftie as a fox as filthy as a swine
but of all beasts he is most compared vnto the worst that is to the serpent and of all kinds of serpents for there are many kinds euen an alphabet almost as gesner obserues the last in the catalogue and worst is the viper mentioned in my text
the fathers obserue sundrie properties of the viper and they are wittie in the accommodation of them vnto men but because the learned naturalists disproue the obseruations will not trouble you with the applications
and indeed the holy ghost is not very curious in distinguishing the kinds of serpents but applyeth them indifferently vnto men calling them sometimes by the name of one serpent and sometimes of another

that which wee must principally obserue is the ancientnesse of this phrase which leadeth vs to the first fall of man of all beasts the deuill pitched vpon the serpent and by the serpent wrought the ouerthrow of man and vnto this ouerthrow doth the scripture allude when it calleth men a generation of vipers which in plaine tearmes is the children of the deuill as christ speaketh iohn
and
epist
iohn chap
we are all by nature children of wrath but by adoption children of god and if grace be in vs we are denominated from our new not our old birth but these are denominated from their old as if they had no new
iohn

but there are three things in the serpent which carrie a correspondencie vnto sinne the venome the craft the terrestreitie
the venome being in the serpent is insensible but comming from him disquiets those that receiue it euen so sinne is not felt of the sinner yet is it mischieuous to them that haue to doe with him
secondly the serpent is craftie in conueying his venome euen so are sinners they recommend their wickednesse vnder some faire pretence euill worketh not vpon well disposed persons except they be deluded by some faire shew
and therefore they are like serpents in that their outward shew is faire

though the inward be venemous

and so christ compareth the pharise to painted sepulchres within full of dead mens bones
last of all the serpent groueleth vpon the earth and feedeth thereon euen so of sinners the highest minded sinners their thoughts are but base and earthly

hitherto haue spoken but in generall this phrase in speciall sort belongeth vnto the iew then whom none is more properly the brood of the serpent
the first enmitie and the most direct was to bee betweene the woman and the serpent his seed and hers and the seed of the woman is our sauiour christ and they are most the brood of the serpent that most directly impugne him and none doth this so much as the iew
the heathen people as they know not christ so they care not for him
the turkes though they doe not receiue him for the sonne of god yet doe they reuerence him for a great prophet yea they will not receiue a iew to be a turke except he first as it were purifie himselfe by being a christian and of a christian turne turke
only the iew is in direct opposition and the most desperate impugner of our sauiour christ witnesse their talmude as galatinue reporteth and other histories of this day haue registred such blasphemies as neither can indure to vtter neither would you indure to heare more then enough to shew that they are most properly the brood of the serpent
neither is this sinne personall to some few of them but nationall the same malice is found in them all
neither is it only nationall but naturall also they haue for many generations brought vp their children in it so that wee may well say that sinne is growne in them to the highest amongst them there is neither good egge nor bird they fill vp the measure of their fathers iniquitie nay they farre exceed them
ordinarily sinfull parents doe not teach their children to bee like themselues a drunkard will not indure that his children should bee such no more will the adulterer only the iew laboureth nothing more then that his child should be like him in his sinne euerie succession eateth more sowre grapes then did their predecessors they are a generation of vipers
a pitifull fall for those that had not only abraham as they thought but god also to their father as hereafter you shall heare to become such and a great to their pride to be branded with such a name·

but to leaue them and touch a little at our selues seeing there will alwayes be a generation of vipers in the world it is gods pleasure also there should be a seed of the woman this to impugne that and vniuersities were intended principally to nourish such seed wee doe little answere the intent of founders and benefactors and requite their liberalitie very ill if these goodly buildings degenerate into vipers nests and harbour a generation of such vermine
mistake mee not meane not iewes for though they principally are yet are they not the only generation of vipers all sinners are in their degree vipers drunkards adulterers blasphemers whatsoeuer wicked persons and of such there are some in these places sinne is euen here become personall
yea

there are a great some we may say it is nationall also there is a generation of these offenders
and it is too much endeauo~ured to make these sinnes naturall also those that are growne old in them labour to leaue a succession after them and cannot indure that though they die their sinnes should die also
but so ill a brood should bee crushed the very head of the serpent should be bruised the seed of the woman should set it selfe to this worke and none of vs should be at rest till this is done

the time is past and can goe no farther only this wish that because you are next to heare of malum poenoe the wages of sinne you would in the meane time thinke well vpon this malum culpoe which you haue heard meane the measure of sinne that the feeling of this may prepare you for the fearing of that and both may make vs fitter to entertaine that remedie which saint iohn doth teach vs of both

who hath forewarned you to flie from the wrath to come

saint iohn doth not only tell the iewes that they were deepe in sinne but also that they were in danger of the wages thereof and hee telleth it them in these words who hath forewarned you to flie from the wrath to come wrath to come is the proper and full wages of sinne from which they that must flie are certainly in danger
but this danger is of that nature that of our selues we may runne into it but we cannot of our selues foresee it wee need a forewarner
the iewes needed one but had not what they needed which made saint iohn presse them with this question who hath forewarned you of this you haue not beene forewarned
so then the argument of these words is the iewes second euill wrath to come whereof wee are taught first what is the remedie flying and secondly that these iewes wanted that remedie for who hath forewarned you to flie from the wrath to come

begin at the euill wrath to come few words but a full definition of the wages of sinne for they consist of wrath and that wrath hath his note of difference it is wrath to come
will not enter into any subtile dispute how wrath is incident to the impassible nature of god only lest you should with marcion dreame of an euill or with the epipicure of an idle god must put you in minde of athanasius his rule

the speeches wherein we talke of god are borrowed from men but wee must so conceiue them as is befitting god undefined span alphabet

now the oddes that is betweene god and men wee may learne of saint iames who giueth vs to vnderstand that there is the same oddes as is betweene the sunne and the moone hee compareth god vnto the sunne when he calleth him the father of lighss but remoueth from him the properties of the moone which is the image of man namely variablenesse and shadow of change
the sunne and the moone both worke vpon the earth but the moone altereth nothing but she is first altered her selfe if she cause a flux and refluxe of humours below she waxeth and waineth in her light aboue but the sunne that so turneth and windeth the hue of all this lower world continueth still the same and when it scorcheth most is neuer a whit the warmer
euen so men cannot disquiet others but they are first disquieted themselues whereas god changeth his creatures continuing himselfe vnchangeable
the skie of god is euer cleere

raise he neuer so many stormes on earth
this being heeded that we fasten nothing vpon god vnbeseeming his maiestie neither turne the suune into the moone or god into man will now plainly let you see what the holy ghost meaneth by gods wrath
god giueth his law and expecteth obedience thereto and if wee faile two things follow vpon our transgression god is displeased and wee shall smart both these doth the holy ghost vsually vnderstand by gods wrath
wrath then noteth not only a bare act of gods will but it signifieth moreouer two effects that are ioyned therewith the effect of sinne which offends gods holinesse and the effect of gods iustice that taketh vengeance on sinne the first may be called wrath in god the second wrath from god
but to cleere this a little farther
all our actions should haue a double end a direct a reflected end the direct is to please god the reflected is to procure our owne good they were both shadowed in the sacrifices sacrifices should all our actions be
now the sacrifices were of a sweet smell they gaue content vnto god and also of rest they procured peace vnto men and it is gods pleasure that his honour and our welfare should both goe together and when we would diuide them

then ariseth wrath
first· wrath in god for god is a god of pure eyes he can abide no iniquitie so saith the prophet and the psalmist that such as be wicked shall not stand in his sight he hateth he lotheth

he abhorres sinne stoppeth his eares turneth away his eyes and shrinketh in his hand at the presence of sinners nay his spirit wrastles is grieued despited and quenched with and by the vngodlinesse of men these be all scripture phrases to set forth the first wrath which floweth from the neglect of the first end whereat wee should aime in our workes
but this wrath goeth not alone the other wrath doth still attend it wrath from god attends wrath in god and therefore sinnes are vsually called prouocations a commentarie vpon which word we haue in the seuenth of ieremie doe they prouoke mee to anger saith the lord and not rather their owne selues to the confusion of their faces

though god be patient yet will he not suffer the wicked vnpunished exod
if men will not turne he will what his sword he hath bent his bow and prepared the instruments of death psal
no man euer discontenteth god but he doth it to his owne woe

thus haue so farre as was requisite to my present purpose shewed what the holy ghost doth vnderstand by gods wrath must now seuer so much as doth not belong to my text
whereas then there is wrath in god and wrath from god my text hath to doe with the latter and whereas that also is either in this world or in that which is to come the note of difference which is here put vnto wrath sheweth of which of these wraths we are to speake no present wrath but wrath that is to come

and first epiphanius scanneth this word to come and telleth that it argueth the impassibilitie of the nature of god affectus exortem se probat deus praeuaticinatus futurum iudicium
if a man doubt whether the wrath in god be a passion he may saith epiphanius be resolued that it is not in that it is foretold for passions are wrought by present obiects but here the effect is foretold before the working of the obiect which is an argument that wrath is no perturbation in god but a mature resolution
this by the way
let vs come to the point

punishment is meant by the wrath to come but what punishment whether the destruction of ierusalem or the damnation of these iewes surely both both doe communicate in this name wrath to come compare matth

with matth

as all other things so this wrath to come came to them in a type and therefore christ ioyneth the destruction of hierusalem with the desolation of the world in one sermon prophecying of both
immediately then saint iohn meaneth the destruction of hierusalem but mediately the last iudgement day will touch at both
first at the destruction of hierusalem
to open which briefely and yet competently might relate christs prophesie and referre you to the commentarie that sheweth the euent thereof flauius iosephus his historie
but choose rather to present vnto you hosea's three children that were borne therein you haue them in the first of his prophesie and they are these iezreel loruhama which intimate the three degrees obserueable in that wrath
the first noteth that gods arme acted it though we hold truely that there is no penall euill in the citie which god hath not made and that it is he which createth all light and darknesse yet extraordinarie plagues are especially ascribed vnto him when these fall vpon men his axe his sword are said then to be working the very magicians will confesse the finger of god is in them

and who will not vse the words of elihu it is god that hath cast him downe and not man philostratus reporteth that when titus the emperour

after the ouerthrow of hierusalem should haue beene crowned by his souldiers as a conquerour hee refused it and gaue this answere this worke is none of mine lent my hand but god gaue the strooke
you see a very heathen did confesse the birth of iezreel
but iezreel was not the onely child was borne also god gaue the stroke and it was a mercilesse stroke theodoret obserueth well in comparing the many iudgments

that besell the iewes that they were vindemiati defoliati at other times their enemies had fruit gatherings vpon them and they had fals of the leafe they were made very bare and brought very low butyet neuer so low as now when they became as the which christ cursed in those words neuer fruit grow on thee any more when they became not onely a naked but also a withered tree

when the habitation of iacob became like the habitation of esau a border of wickednesse and the iewes as the edomites a people with whom god is effended for euer
tertullian in his apologie describes their wofull state caeli soli extorres sine deo sine homine rege they may neither breath in their owne ayre nor tread on their owne ground they haue helpe neither from god nor man as if they were the brood of caine continuall vagabonds semper noui vbi{que alieni neuer suffered long in any one pla neither entertained otherwise then as meere strangers whatsoeuer liber they haue they pay for it to the vttermost

saint nard goeth farther in an epistle of his saying neuer was there such a as god hath brought vpon the iewes who are catholike slaues slaues in the world
will not rip vp stories to proue this euen this yeare god hath made vs see the truth hereof germanie hath yeelded a spectacle of their slauerie
in the citie of frankford which was inhabited with many thousinds of them when they were preparing themselues to solemnize that day wherein they bewaile the destruction of hierusalem the inhabitants otherwise exasperated against them wreakt their displeasure vpon them and hazarding many of their liues rifled most of their goods and forced them out of their citie
there is yet a third child the worst of the three the heauiest calamitie that euer befell the iewes
god oftentimes afflicted them and the affliction was very sharpe but he neuer before dissolued the bond whereby israel was knit vnto him and was by couenant his peculiar people but now that which theodoret would haue the world to wonder at silij facti sunt canes canes filij we that at the plauting of the gospell were no better then dogs haue now the honour to bee children of god and they that then were children what are they now but dogs dogs not vouchsafed so much as the crummes that fall from their masters table at first their kingdome failed then failed the prophesie and now the priesthood faileth also there is no bond of commerce left betweene them and god such was the destruction of hierusalem
but this was but a type we were in this to behold a greater euill the eternall damnation of the iew
non aliquid vsitatum dicit saith chrysostome it is no vsuall matter that iohn baptist meaneth by the wrath to come it is not the sword or pestilence or famine that he terrifieth them with he puereth them in mind of some other iudgement such as they had neuer heard before
wee are then from the type to come to the truth from the destruction to the damnation which is here called wrath to come

and the first thing that this phrase putteth vs in mind of is the difference that god hath made betweene angels and men both sinned and were sentenced but the stroke of iustice was respited vnto man which on the angels was inflicted presently no space left vnto the angels to be reconciled vnto god but god hath giuen a space vnto man
saint chrysostome obserueth well there vpon if thou sinne and god doe not presently strike thinke not that he doth it out of impotencie hee doth it out of patience it cannot be impotencie for he presently did strike the angels that are greater then men it is patience then which argueth gods wonder full mercie towards man
yea and thereupon it followeth vndoubtedly that during this space which god granteth for repentance no man need to despaire

or to be despaired of
saint ambrose is confident herein am perswaded saith he that if iudas iudas that betraied christ had spoken vnto christ that which he spake vnto the high priest haue sinned in that haue shed innocent bloud he might haue beene saued if iudas who not man is not doomed definitely in this life

but must remoue a stumbling blocke for restraining wrath to that punishment which is to come may bee thought to denie it in any of those punishments which we feele in this life and indeed doe denie it
for whatsoeuer is inflicted here is improperly wrath and in comparison deserueth not the name of wrath you may call it wrath materially but formally it is no wrath
will shew it by a three fold difference which is betweene the punishments of this life and those of the life to come the first is in their originall the second in their measure the third in their end
for the originall we must learne that wrath is no immediat affection there is something else that commeth betweene it and the will and that is loue and hatred the will is prepossest by one of them before it bringeth forth wrath and wrath is the immediate fruit either of loue or hatred we learne it out of gods message sent by nathan to king dauid

if thy children breake my lawes and walke not in my statutes will visit their sinnes with the rod and their offences with scourges but my mercie will not take from them as did from saul dauids house felt stripes and so did sauls but mercie laid on those and hatred these
the very same may you gather out of gods words in the first of malachi iacob haue loued esau haue hated and these two god exprest in punishing them both as it followeth in that text

now all punishments in this life they are effects of loue that loue which fixed a space betweene our sinnes and the receite of our wages
but when the space is ended the loue doth end whatsoeuer we feele after it is the stroake of hatred

god forgetteth then to be mercifull and shutteth vp his louing kindnes in displeasure
so that as this stroake is properly wrath so the other cannot be but improperly so called seeing thereby god so chastiseth vs not because he hateth vs but because he loueth vs castigo te non quod odio habeam sed quod amem is in this life much more truely said of god then it can be by any man

the second difference is in the measure a double measure of the stroake

and of the time
touching the stroake nazianzen obserues

that in this world god doth allay his seueritie with mercie but they that shall be punished in the world to come shall drinke the very dregges of the cup of his wrath the iudgements in this life are but the smoke of wrath the preface vnto torments such stripes as schoolemasters giue vnto little children that learn their a.b.c
but the iudgments in the world to come they are more then smoke they are the flaming fire it selfe read mal
they are more they the preface to torments they are the torments themselues so we read of the rich glutton that he was in the torments finally they are more then childrens smart they are the stripes of the oldest truants such as are prouided for the deuill and his angels

then god will deale in his furie his mercie will not spare neither will hee haue pitie and though they crie in his eares with a loud voice hee will not heare them
if any bodie desire to know more of the measure of the stroake let him reade the prophets they are copious in amplifying the terrour of the lords day

besides this measure of the stroake there is a measure also of the time for in this world afflictions are but momentanie in the world to come they are eternall here heauinesse may continue for a night but ioy commeth againe in the morning as god doth not suffer all his indignation to arise so is he very quickly reconciled so quickly that it scarce can be remembred that he was offended certainly it is too vsually forgotten
but in the world to come wrath is permanent affliction as nahum speaketh ariseth not the second time the worme neuer dieth neither doth the fire euer goe out
this being the oddes in the measure it proueth that in comparison that which is inflicted in this life deserueth not the name of wrath especially if you adde the third difference the difference in the end

saint austine doth giue vs a distinction of wrath

and telleth vs that there is a wrath consuming and a wrath consummating a wrath which god inflicts to make men the better and a wrath which god inflicts therewith vtterly to destroy men that is the wrath which he inflicteth in this life and this is the wrath which hee inflicteth in the life to come
and indeed god in this life doth not punish man but the deuill god reserueth mans punishment to the life to come
the corruption that is in our nature is the deuils possession in working out that god worketh out him and it is his intent to worke him out his stroakes here are like a physicall potion giuen to a sicke bodie not to abide in him but when it hath drawne vnto it selfe the matter of his disease to be cast out againe with the humour that did offend him
this is the true end of gods chastisements in this world
but it is as true that this physicke doth not alwayes sort this effect the fault is not in the potion but in the stomacke that taketh it if the stomacke haue strength to make vse of the potion then doth it recouer thereby but if it want strength then doth the potion increase the peccant humours and augment the patients disease
the wicked for want of grace are the worse for their punishment it proueth vnto them wrath of

consumption but they that haue grace are the better wrath to them is better then laughter as the preacher speaketh because by the sadnesse of the countenance the heart is made better

and chastisement bringeth forth the quiet fruit of righteousnesse to them that are exercised thereby

yea

saint austine obserues well god is most displeased with vs in this world when hee is displeased least and his long patience here doth prognosticate his heauier vengeance hereafter it maketh it suspitious that we are bastards and no sonnes if seeing such is our infirmitie that wee cannot but sinne wee bee not timely reclaimed by chastisement of sinne
but to shut vp this point that which proceedeth from loue and is executed with so tender a hand to so good a purpose as is our perfection doth not deserue the name of wrath this name belongeth more properly to that punishment which proceedeth from gods hatred and is executed without mercie to the eternall destruction of man and that is the wrath to come therefore is the day thereof properly called the day of wrath and the persons that suffer then are properly the vessels of wrath in the number of which that we may not be we must harken to the remedie

and the remedie is flying flie from the wrath to come if the remedie be flying then there is no standing to it no trauersing of our indictment no bribing of our iudge no priuiledge of our persons no reliefe from our strength no standing to it by these or any other meanes we must flie
but flying is either corporall or spirituall the corporall will be attempted it should seeme so by christs relation in the gospel and saint iohn saith in the reuelation

that captaines and rich men and great men shall flie to the rockes to the hils and desire to be couered to be hid from the wrath of the lambe but all in vaine for they are reiected by rocks and hilles
and indeed whether should they flie then when all the world becommeth gods jayle and euery creature becommeth his jaylour yea the showre that doth attend christs comming to judgement is a showre of snares

and the prophets amos especially doth excellently shew the vanitie of this flight it shall be as if a man did flie from a lion and a beare met him and he runneth from the beare vnto a wall and there a serpent biteth him that is whithersoeuer he turne he shall find those that will seize vpon him he cannot possibly escape not by flying corporally
he must then flie spiritually and indeed it is spirituall flight that is the remedie
but what is spirituall flight surely wee must conceiue and bee in trauell with amendment of our liues and neuer stop vntill we haue brought forth a compleate spirit of saluation that is we must flie from sinne and flie vnto grace in both which consisteth the flight from wrath

hee that iudgeth himselfe in this world he whose heart is prickt with remorse of sinne whose heart trembleth melteth and is broken with the feare of gods wrath hee that singeth the song of mercie and layeth hold vpon the desiring to be made a vessell of mercie this man flyeth and the more he exerciseth himselfe in these the swifter he flyeth from the wrath to come

but to come closer to the text flight from the wrath to come is the benefit of baptisme for these iewes came to the baptisme and saint iohn mouing then this question thereupon doth shew that flight from the wrath to come is the right vse of baptisme

which nazianzen doth wittily intimate when he saith that baptisme is such a water as is able to quench the eternall fire saint peter more plaine in his paralel of baptisme to noahs arke sheweth that in baptisme there is to be considered not the washing away of the filth of our flesh but a good conscience maketh request vnto god through the resurrection of iesus christ
this is the manner of flight

but from what must wee flie marke from wrath from wrath to come
from wrath there is the stroake which wee feele and the stampe of gods displeasure in that stroake that wherewith wee must be moued most and from which we must especially flie is gods displeasure which is the sharpest part of the stroke
as good men out of grace in this world when they repent doe grieue more for that they haue offended god then that they haue cast themselues in danger of hell so by gods prouidence to the damned shall the losse of gods fauour be more gricuous then the torments of hell which is answerable to the nature of sinne wherein auersion from god is more grieuous then the conuersion to the world therefore in our flight our eye must bee principally not vpon the stripes which wee might feele but vpon gods disfauour
thus must we flie from wrath

and our flying from it must be whiles it is yet wrath to come no flying from it when it is present there is no oyle to bee bought by the foolish virgins when the bridegroome is come noah entred the arke before the floud came lot went out of sodome before it rained fire and brimstone the children of israel sprinkled the bloud of the paschall lambe on their doores before the destroying angell slue the of egypt in ezekiel in the reuelation the seruants of god are marked and sealed before gods wrath is executed all these are but types signifying that if we meane to escape wee must take aduantage of the time agree with our aduersarie in the way

left hee passe vs ouer to the iudge the iudge to the serieant the serieant to the goaler neuer to bee released vntill wee haue paid the vtmost farthing then hath god no eares to heare our crie no eyes to pitie our state but wisdome will laugh at our destruction and reioyce when our feare commeth wherefore prouide phisicke before thou art sicke and righteousnesse before iudgement

you haue heard the euill and the remedie the miserie of these iewes was this that they wanted this remedie and why they wanted one that should forewarne them to flie
wee can cast our selues into danger but foresee that whereof we are in danger wee cannot it is the deuils policie to hoodwinke vs in this respect or to vs with other obiects lest we should be reclaimed by this therefore it is gods second mercie that wee haue forewarners
the word signifieth to shew

and to foreshew

to shew to sense and reason
touching our sense that axiome is true if there be any obiect that busieth it other obiects are not discerned by it now hee that draweth vs into sinne taketh order that wee shall not want varietie of other obiects therefore this obiect needeth a remembrancer we need haue a map of hell to bee set before vs not such an apish or rather impious one as is depainted in the iesuites chamber of meditations whereby they make proselytes treacherous proselytes such as this age hath had too much proofe of but such a map as the scripture maketh and which by the finger of the spirit is able to make a solid impression in our soules as it is excellently described in iob

so must he shew to sense

there is a shewing also to reason for euen when we see these things flesh and bloud hath sophisters wherewith to stay this flight they that doe not denie there is a hell yet thinke that gods prouidence doth not see them amongst so many thousands or cares not for that which they doe therefore there must be a confutation of that sophistrie such a one as is psal
vnderstand yee brutish among the people and yee fooles when will yee be wise he that planted the eare shall not he heare and he that framed the eie shall not hee see hee that chasteneth the heathen shall not hee correct thus must the forewarner shew

neither shew only but foreshew also for if there bee no flying but from the wrath to come then before the wrath come it must be shewne for when it is present it shall need no shewing the testimonie of our owne conscience shall the cleere our fancie

and resolue our reason our sense shall then haue nothing else to apprehend neither shall our reason cast any doubts of the truth thereof whosoeuer then is iudged of god

shall also be condemned of his owne conscience he shall set to his seale that god is true and that his iudgements are most iust you haue such a confession in the fift of wisdome
foreshew then he must
but all foreshewing is not enough for many can indure to see it afarre off

as they in amos that did not denie but put farre off the euill day and so the euill seruant in the gospel my master will come but after a long time therefore the word here vsed signifieth to foreshew a thing imminent undefined span alphabet who hath foreshewed you to flie from the wrath hanging ouer your heads that the iudge is at the doore that yee are at the gate of hell such a kind of foreshewing is that that will shake off carnall securitie and will if any thing make men betake themselues to this flight

finally marke that the forewarning must be not only of the wrath to come but also of the flight
if the forewarning were only of the wrath to come and wee had only the torments of hell set before our eyes what could this doe but make vs at our wits end and ouerwhelme vs with despaire but here is the comfort of the forewarning that it setteth before vs the flight also and as it fixeth one eye vpon the danger to humble vs so doth it the other vpon the remedie wherewith it is gods pleasure to relieue vs
the ministers for they are chiefly these

forewarners haue two branches of their power to bind to loose to bind the obstinate to the wrath to come and to loose all those that will make vse of the flight amongst which these iewes were none for who hath forewarned you saith saint iohn vnto them
before come to the question must a little describe the persons they were sadduces and pharisees
there are but two extremities of religion into which men run superstition and atheisme these fell the one that is the pharisees into the one extremitie and the other that is the saduces into the other extremitie
now sinnes are of two sorts some whose nature is in opposition to the flying from the wrath to come and some which are such as they doe not exclude the same
a drunkard an adulterer a murderer are grieuous sinners and in danger of the wrath to come but the principles are not corrupted vpon which the forewarner must worke when hee perswadeth then to flie they doe beleeue the iudgement to come and in cold bloud will easily belieue that there is euill in their liues therefore vpon such good counsell may worke and wee see daily that many such are reclaimed
but there are many whose sinnes are opposite vnto this counsell of flying either because they thinke there is no wrath to come as the saducee or that they are out of danger of it as the pharisee vpon such it is hard working

now come to the question who hath forewarned you am not ignorant that sundrie writers ancient and later suppose that this is quaestio admirantis and make saint iohn baptist who receiued all others quietly when these persons came to stand amazed and wondring is it possible hath gods grace preuailed with saduces with pharisees and will they also bee christs disciples is saul among the prophets can hee that thought there was no hell be brought to flie from hell and hee that thought himselfe righteous prouide against the iudgement day surely such examples are rare not that god doth not some to shew nothing is impossible to his grace but he yeildeth but few because men should take heed of such sinnes and wee see by experience how pharisaisme in papists and in atheists saducisme frustrate the labours of many painfull forewarners the corrupt principles of their conscience hinder their preuayling who forewarne them to flie from the wrath to come

but take the question rather to bee negatiue and that as christ often so saint iohn here doth detect their hypocrisie and telleth them that they aimed little at that which was intended by baptisme
the kingdome of god happily in their sense they could bee content to enter into by the baptisme of saint iohn for their messias was to bee a worldly king or if so be they thought vpon wrath which they desired to escape it was wrath present not wrath to come the wrath of men not the wrath of god they would shake off the yoke of the romanes they feared not the paines of hell when they perceiued that saint iohns baptisme sorted not with their desire

it is obserued that they despised it to their destruction and when christ asked them whether it were of heauen or of men they durst not answere him from heauen least christ should come vpon them with why did you not then belieue it adde hereunto that it is not likely saint iohn would haue reproched them with these words generation of vipers had there not bin hypocrisie in them
conclude then that the question containeth a negation and that iohn herein doth set forth the second euill of these iewes they wanted meanes of forewarning which might apply to them the remedie which god hath appointed against the wrath to come

nazianzen obserueth well it is not the nation but the disposition that maketh a pharisee euery countrie may haue pharisees and saduces for it is not the name of a nation but a conuersation and therefore this question may concerne vs and we must inquire into our selues whether wee haue either a pharisees or a saduces disposition
and indeed wee shall find too many of both heretickes atheists vpon whom forewarners cannot worke and if we be better disposed wee must acknowledge gods great mercie that as hee hath appointed wrath so hee hath appointed a remedie wee must learne both of our forewarners and so learne both that we be the better for them and scape the vengeance that is to come

the summe of all is sinnes and punishments are not inseparable god hath set a space betweene them and appointed a remedie to the one for the auoyding of the other for the knowledge hereof hee referres vs to our spirituall pastors and we must take heed we haue neither saduces nor pharisees eares which may make vs vncapable of their forewarnings

lord that hast appointed forwarners to thy church so blesse their paines that they may fixe our thoughts on and resolue our reason of that wrath which is to come not only the sight of it but also the flight from it
let vs not despise the riches of thy goodnesse forbearance and nor with hard and impenitent hearts treasure vp vnto our selues wrath against the day of wrath

but knowing that thy goodnesse leadeth vs to repentance let vs so thinke vpon the wrath that shall be at the end that we may flie from sinne to grace and so bee thought worthy to escape this euill and stand in the last day with comfort before the sonne of man stand for euer to giue glorie vnto thee the father of mercie through iesus christ our only meanes to obtaine this mercie in the communion of the holy spirit who only teacheth vs to make the right vse of this mercie
amen

the third sermon
epigraph

lvke
verse
bring forth therefore fruites worthy of repentance

saint iohn baptist hath in his sermon hitherto shewed the iewes of their bad case in regard both of sinne and woe
if he had here ended he should rather haue seemed to bee a minister of moses then an harbinger of christ and although happily he might haue awakned the worme of conscience to bite them with the terrours of the law yet should hee not haue answered his fathers prophecie by giuing light to them that sit darknesse

and in the shaddow of death and guiding their feete into the way of peace wherefore to shew that hee came indeed in the spirit of elias and meant to turne the hearts of the fathers towards their children

and the children towards their fathers before the lord came and smote the earth with cursing as he vnpartially gaue the iewes to vnderstand the euill of their case so doth he carefully endeauour to set them in a better course

the ground and scope of his words is in effect this
euerie iew is to haue a double being in the couenant an hereditarie a possessorie in that he is the of spring of abraham he hath a title to the promises but possession of that whereunto he is entitled he hath none except he partake of the same grace that was in the patriarke
these two must concurre they cannot bee seuered without danger danger not to the couenant for god will be true though all the world be lyars

but vnto so many as were gracelesse iewes although they vaunted that they were abrahams seede yet were they neuer to come into abrahams bosome
wherefore seeing the iewes did diuorce these things which god would haue conioyned saint iohn aduiseth them to correct this errour and to begin to tread abrahams steps least otherwise they be nothing the better for being abrahams sonnes
so then the baptists exhortation hath two parts the first teacheth what these iewes ought to intend the second vpon what they may not stand
that which they ought to intend is penitencie that whervpon they may not stand is their pedigree at this time only of the former

that which the iewes ought to intend is exprest in these words bring forth therfore fruits worthy of repentance wherin we are to obserue first the inference then the argument
the inference iohn gathereth this counsell out of his former reproofe and wisheth them to take a better course because they were in so bad a case this is the force of the particle therefore
in the argument we haue the workes and an answerablenesse that must be betweene them the workes are two gods and mans god giueth

repentance which man must imploy in bringing forth fruites
the answerablenesse is mans worke must keepe good correspondencie with gods men must bring forth fruites such as are worthy of repentance
of these points briefly and in their order begin with the inference

although in the fits and heate of our passions it seeme otherwise yet is it a grounded truth that there is no man except he be giuen ouer to a reprobate sense which doth not naturally abhor to be either wicked or a wretch
you may perceiue it by his iudgement in cold bloud

certainely reason doth acknowledge this to be so true that seneca thought one of the best meanes to reclaime a man that goeth a stray was to set his case before him though shall little please saith hee yet will bee bold to let him that erreth know his fault for it is likely that thereupon if hee doe not presently turne

yet hee will at least make a stand
gregorie the great a better authour speaketh in the voice of religion we cannot take a better course to reclaime vntoward natures then if wee shew them how ill they doe when they suppose they doe well and turne their vaine glorie into a profitable shame
the holy ghost master both of reason and religion is the guide vnto them both
for in the scriptures wee find that the prophets seldome shew what god requires before they haue shewed the iewes what they want they preface the doctrine of that which they should be with a former doctrine of that which they were the instances are euerie where to bee found will alleadge some few god himselfe when he dealeth with adam after his fall beginneth with where art thou the fathers commentarie is not vnfit

god demandeth of him not onely in what place but in what case he was
surely their commentary is made probable by adams answere for adam doth answere as well in what case was naked as in what place he was hid my selfe
wisedome in the first of the prouerbes dealeth thus plainely with men how long yee simple ones will yee loue simplicitie and yee scorners delight in scorning our sauiour christ vseth the same method in his epistle vnto the church of laodicea

thou art wretched and miserable and poore and blind and naked
thus they all set before their eyes with whom they deale as saint iohn baptist doth their poore and wofull case
but they rest not therein but proceed from the reproose vnto the remedy as iohn baptist doth least other wise they should seeme rather to reproach then to reproue to insult vpon them rather then to correct them

it is not so much as good policie much lesse pietie to punish because men haue offended they should rather prouide by punishments that they offend no more and therfore are chastisments called corrections because they are not so much afflictions for as preuentions from committing sinne
now reproofes are verball punishments therefore they must imitate them so shew a disease as that withall they prescribe the cure thereof

imitating god who as anno speaketh killeth and maketh aliue againe
certainely he which asked adam where are thou relieued him againe with the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpents head and wisedome that began with how long will yee fooles delight in folly concludeth with turne you at my reproofe

will powre out of my spirit vpon you will make knowne my words vnto you and our sauiour christ least he should seeme to vpbraid the laodiceans offereth them a present supplie of gold of rayment of

of whatsoeuer they did want
certainely if so be we adde the meanes how they may recouer whom we reproue we are most likely to speed of their amendment for the remedie prescribed is an euidence that the reproofe proceeded from loue and the reprehender may say with paul

wrote not these things to shame you but as my beloued warne you and loue is so necessarie in reproofe that saint austin is of opinion that no man should reproue except he first strictly examine his conscience whether hee doe it out of loue adde that this loue must bee made euident by the care that we shew of the reproueds good
the reason is plaine for although the inborne principles before specified meane our naturall desire of goodnesse and happinesse make vs capable in our worst case of good counsell yet whether the counsell that is giuen vs be for our good wee argue oftner from the person then from the things and our iealousie of the person is a preiudice to his words and stoppeth vs from deliberating vpon the truth of his reproofe whereas on the contrarie side the loue of the person doth open our eares and be his words neuer so tart they sinke downe into our soule and our most stubbourne affections are contented to bee wrought by them let the righteous reproue me saith the psalmist and it shall be a precious balme and saint austin loue me and say what thou wilt let it appeare that they meane our good and it shall not grieue vs if we be blamed so much as wee deserue
note this the rather because wish that all ministers would herein follow saint iohn baptist and neither smother sinne which is no farther hated then it is knowne nor yet neglect christian wisedome to winne a sinner who seldome distasteth the law if it be seasoned with the gospell neither murmureth at the reproofe if it doe not degenerate into a reproach if any thing will reclaime it is the prescribing of a good course coupled with the description of a sinners bad case

so the words of the wise will proue as goades and as nailes fastned by the masters of the assemblies which are giuen from one shepheard they will hasten vs speedily and couple vs most firmly vnto the church and our sauiour christ
and thus much of the inference

come now to the argument of the words where of the first branch was the workes they are two the first is gods hee giues repentance
though the author be not exprest yet is he necessarily to bee vnderstood the apostle is cleare for it

the seruant of god must meekely instruct those that are contrarie minded trying if god at any time will grant them repentance and were not the text so plaine the nature of the worke putteth it out of all doubt for what is repentance but the soules rising from death to life and no man euer quickned his owne soule hee must leaue that to god for euer the same god that made man after his image must repaire his image in man and therefore in the psalme and in the apostle it is plainely called a creation

but because the authour is not exprest in my text forbeare further

to speake of him and come vnto the worke his worke is repentance

the grecians according to lactantius speake better and more significantly that vse the word undefined span alphabet

then the latines that vse paenitentia
tertullian before him writing against marcion presseth the significancie of the greeke word and because words doe lead vs to the vnderstanding of things we will a little looke into the word it may happily make vs to sound the things much better
undefined span alphabet commeth from undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet doth signifie properly the first facultie of the reasonable soule but by a trope it is vsed oftentimes to note the whole whereupon undefined span alphabet signifieth a change of the mind signifieth a change either of the vnderstanding or ioyntly of the will also
the vnderstanding of man is the first moouer in the whole course of his life because nothing is desired which is vnknowne our appetite and our will stirre not except they be informed of some thing which may occasion their stirring and informed they can not bee but by the vnderstanding
now the vnderstanding for want either of light or care doth very often mistake and then the will that taketh all vpon trust must needs goe astray and we are called to a reuiew of our wayes

and vpon after thoughts alter our iudgements or as lactantius speaketh in the place before cited after a fit of madnesse wee come to our wits againe
this is the first kind of of undefined span alphabet or changing of our mind
but vse hath obtained and the practise of the scripture which is the best commentarie vpon the words to take undefined span alphabet in thesecond sense for the changing of the whole reasonable soule and then it is compounded of undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet the change of vnderstanding and of the will

and indeed seldome doe they goe asunder for as it is true that whither the will bends thither the whole man inclines so it is as true that our vnderstanding cannot be resolued but it carieth vs with it which way so euer either of them incline they vsually earie the whole man though in a different manner the will by compulsion and the vnderstanding by perswasion so that we may not restraine this change to the one facultie but extend it also to the other by them to the whole man

but tertullian doth giue vs a good obseruation telling vs that the heathen or those that are without the church often change their mind and doe repent but it is of their good deeds of their temperancie truth liberalitie fidelitie and more vsually doe they change from better to worse then from worse to better
he obserueth it of them that are without the church would it neuer had beene or now were not also true of them that are within the church how many iewes haue vncircumcised themselues and how many haue vnchristianed the~selues that were sometimes members of the church how many doe dayly returne like dogges to their vomit and like swine to their wallowing in the myre yea how few are there of vs that doe not oftner sorrow for some thing which we haue done well then for many things which we haue done ill vnto whom must remember that of saint peter it were better neuer to haue knowne the way of righteousnesse then after we haue entred it to turne from it

tertullian giueth the reason for they saith hee that repent of their repentance towards god by how much they shall bee more acceptable

to the diuell to whom they come by so much they shall bee more odious vnto god from whom they goe wherfore we must adde one clause more to the definition of repentance and not onely hold it to be a change of the mind but as nazianzene and theophylact

repentance is not onely a change of man but a change from worse to better
saint paul openeth the change very plainely fashion not saith hee yourselues like vnto this present world but be yee changed by the renewing of your mind wherein he sheweth vs that as in sinne so in repentance there is a whence and a whither
sinne is an auersion from god and a conuersion to the world so likewise repentance must shake off the world and imbrace god
nazianzene setteth it forth in a very fit resemblance

comparing the soule of a man to a paire of writing tables out of which must be wathed whatsoeuer was written with sinne and insteed thereof must be entred the writing of grace both these are necessarie in repentance god hath dedicated both parts in his owne repentance for as when he repentech of the euill intended against vs he doth not onely giue ouer to hate vs but also doth imbrace vs with loue euen so when wee repent of our sinnes against god wee must not onely cease for to hate him but beginne to loue him also
secondly christ founded both these partes in our redemption for hee dyed and rose againe saint paul telleth vs there is a morall in that mysterie it lessoneth vs to dye vnto sinne and to rise vnto righteousnesse finally the sacrament of baptisme which in the scripture is called the baptisme of repentance symbolically preacheth both vnto vnto vs the dipping into the water and the taking out of the water what doth it figure but the drowning of sin and the recouering of a sinner the vse that wee must make hereof is that we must not onely desire to be rid of the vncleane spirit but also to be possest of the holy ghost if wee doe not change one for the other we are not changed so fully as we ought to bee and we must feare his doome out of whom the vncleane spirit was cast in the gospell whom because the holy ghost succeeded not the foule spirit repossest the person with seuen worse then himselfe

and made the latter end of that man worse then his beginning
and thus much of the nature of repentance which is the first worke gods worke which changeth vs from bad to good not onely cleansing sinne but also giuing grace

come now to the second worke which is mans worke in handling whereof we must consider the order and the nature of it a word of the order
gods worke goeth before mans man could neuer doe good if god did not first make him good as truely as the dew doth first fall from heauen before there can bee fatnesse in the earth

euen so must gods grace change man before any alteration will appeare in the conuersation of man the tree must be planted by the riuers of waters

before it can bring forth her fruites and we must bee gods workmanship created vnto good workes before we can walke in them
wee must not therefore take such pleasure in beholding the tree bee it neuer so richly loaden with fruites as to forget the roote which yeeldeth the iuice without which the tree could beare no fruit we must so regard mans worke that wee

giue the precedencie alwayes to gods and acknowledge this to bee the off spring of that but enough of the order

come now to the worke which is bearing of fruites
that which is here called fruites acts
is called workes whereby we gather that good workes are fruites and indeed onely good workes deserue this name for if saint austins definition bee true

that is fruit which a man may with comfort enioy how should sinne be reputed fruites who can take any content in it not the sinner himselfe for though it be sweete in his mouth as iob speaketh yet when it commeth downe into his maw

it turneth into gall of aspes

well doth moses compare it to the fruites of sodome and gomorrah for as the booke of wisedome describeth that fruit faire on the out side but the nothing else but cinders euen so the appearance of sinne is pleasant but the substance of it is very vnsauorie
if onely our lustes should be iudges howsoeuer at first they taste it as fruit yet euen they also loath it if they bee long vsed to it but if they swallow it and find no offence in it as too often they doe yet when it commeth to our conscience and thither sooner or later it must come saint pauls question will then come seasonably

what fruit had yee then in those things whereof yee are now ashamed sinnes then may not passe for fruits fruits properly so called this title belongeth only to good workes they are fruits indeed they may say as the vine in the iudgess they cheare god and men

god taketh delight in them they are to him a sacrifice of a sweet smell yea hee taketh as much content in them as if he did feed vpon them we learne it in the fiftieth psalme thinkest thou saith god that will eat buls flesh and drinke the bloud of goats offer vnto god praise and call vpon his name in denying the former he acknowledgeth the later to be his food not that god is the better for ought we doe but so is hee pleased for to honour our workes as the angels that came to abraham did partake of his not to refresh themselues but to doe him honour

as god accepts them for fruits so are they fruits vnto men also vnto others and vnto our selues but with this difference that whereas god was not the better for them men are other men by our good workes are either brought to goodnesse or confirmed therein and as for our selues wee grow thereby in grace and fauour with god and feele more comfortable ioy in our owne soules therefore well may good workes beare the name of fruits
and the very name of fruits distinguishing good workes from bad containeth a good motiue to doe well and forbeare sinne for who would labour for nought and spend his strength in vaine being not to haue so much as his labour for his paine for he must write vpon his wages not only vanitie but also vexation of spirit
and againe who would bee wearie of well doing that knoweth his labour is not in vaine but that in good time he shall eate the fruit of his labours well is hee and happie shall he be

but wee must marke that our worke is called fruit and not flowers not but that the flower goeth before the fruit but it is the hope of

the fruit that maketh the flower to bee esteemed and god counteth that flower little worth that neuer commeth to be fruit we see this in the parable of the seed where that ground only goeth for good in which the feed giueth not ouer vntill it be fit for the barne and hee that puiteth his hand to the plough saith christ in the gospel

and looketh backe is not fit for the kingdome of heauen
obserue this the rather because here we may see many faire flowers which in their youth shew good effects of their gouernours care and paines who no sooner are set at libertie as too often they are before the flowers become fruit but they wither and faile neither church nor nor themselues are the better for their breeding whom would haue to carrie this lesson with them that goodnesse is not a flower it is fruit and they must aswell ripen as blossome otherwise it will appeare that god in them hath done his worke but they come short of their owne
neither is goodnesse only called fruit in the singular number but the word is plurall our worke is many workes wee must beare fruits we must as the apostle speaketh be fruitfull in all good workes

the soule of a man is but one but it quickeneth a bodie consisting of many different members all which it setteth on worke the eye to see the eare to heare the foot to goe euen so though the grace of god which is the soule of the soule of man be but one yet doth it animate the whole man and doth as truly communicate good manners to the parts as the soule doth life

the grace of god which bringeth saluation vnto all teacheth vs to denie all vngodlinesse and worldly lusts and to liue soberly righteously and godly in this present world

hereupon saint paul biddeth vs put on the whole armour of god and to cast away all workes of darknesse and in another place whatsoeuer things are iust whatsoeuer things are holy

whatsoeuer things are true whatsoeuer things are of good report thinke vpon these things
wee must haue not only a disposition to doe well but remember that wee are to doe well more wayes then one
the same god that commandeth one vertue commandeth all and he will not haue any part or power of man exempted from his seruice
which must bee heeded by vs because there are few that are of saint pauls minde

to forget those things that are behind and make forward no sooner haue wee brought forth one good worke but we fall in loue with that and there take vp our rest and thinke that may serue insteed of all suffering gods graces to be idle which are aswell able to make a as a sober tongue and an obedient eare as a diligent hand
much more good might come from euery man if he did not thinke hee did good enough therefore let vs remember that nothing must bee accounted enough that is lesse then all and that wee set not straighter bounds to our duties then those which are in gods law

but we haue not now to doe in generall with good workes my text restraineth me to workes of repentance come then nearer to those
and although hane alreadie opened vnto you the nature of repentance yet must wade a little farther in it and branch it as it were

into its kinds
the law of god hath two parts the precept and the sanction
the sanction sheweth vnto vs the danger of sinne obliging vnto punishment from which wee are not free but by iustification and this iustification is attended with repentance repentance that looketh vnto the guilt of sinne which cleaueth vnto the act thereof
this repentance is that which is practised in the times of humiliation when we deprecate gods wrath which is vpon vs or hangeth ouer vs by reason of enormous sinnes of the whole state and of particular persons

such is that which is called for in ioel and whereof wee haue the practice in ionah
the primitiue church was well acquainted with it as appeareth by the ecclesiasticall storie the canons of the first councels the writings of tertullian origen cyprian and others our church taketh notice of it in a part of the liturgie and wisheth the publike restitution of it

but it is rather to bee wished then hoped for
notwithstanding what is not done in publike by malefactors should be supplied by better obseruance of those dayes which are appointed weekly and of those weeks which are appointed yearely to be poenitentiall to be dayes and weekes of fasting and praying
wee cannot denie but crying sinnes are daily committed and therefore gods wrath might daily bee inflicted the way to stay it is to shew that wee are not guiltie thereof and as he is not guiltie by the law of man which had no hand in sinne so by the law of god none goe for not guiltie except they doe expresse a penitent sorrow that any should bee so wretched as to commit the sinne
you remember how one achan troubled all israel and his sinne is layed to all their charge ioshua the seuenth and they were all made to sanctifie themselues from that sinne and how the vnknowne murder was expiated wee reade deut
there must bee a feeling in vs of other mens sinnes a religious feeling seeing thereby they put not only themselues but vs to in danger of gods wrath and therefore though our conscience haue no speciall burden of its owne yet must it haue of others and endeuour to ease both it selfe and the whole state thereof and how may priuate men better doe this then by those solemne acts of humiliation the only attonement which by faith in christ we can make with god but saint pauls complaint may be renewed

it is reported commonly that there is fornication wee may adde murder adulterie and any other enormeous sinne the seates of iudgement can witnesse that our land is fertile of all sorts but as saint paul said so will all men are puffed vp and who doth sorrow the emptinesse of our churches vpon fridayes and wednesdayes and other fasting dayes sheweth how litle feeling there is in vs of the crying sinnes of our state it were well if we had some feeling of our owne
but where is that drunkard where is that adulterer where is that murderer where is that blasphemer that vsurer that oppressor that commeth into gods house bathed in his teares broken in his heart stript of his pride humbled in his bodie and making a reall crie for mercie in the eares of god no wee come not

so farre as a vocall our tongues crie not god bee mercifull to mee a sinner which is but the voice of man much lesse doe our sighes doe it which are the voice of gods spirit we shame not to sinne

but to repent wee are ashamed
ashamed of that whereof we should glorie surely theodoret thought better of king dauids repentance when he pronounced of it there were many heroicall vertues in king dauid but for none is he so illustrious as for his repentance so much more illustrious by how much it is a rarer thing to see a king come from his throne clothed in sackcloth sitting in dust and ashes feeding vpon the bread of sorrow and mingling his drinke with his teares then to see him in state either vttering prouerbs like a solomon or triumphing ouer his foes as at other times he also did

or doing any other act in the maiestie of a king but most men are ashamed of this glorie and chose rather to glorie in their shame vnto whom will vse saint austines words it is grosse folly to liue in that state in which a man would bee loth that death should take him hee addeth that the man which dareth goe to bed with a conscience charged with the guilt of one enormous sinne is much more desperate then he that dareth lie vnarmed with seuen armed men that are his deadly foes for a sinner is lesse sure of his life then the other
and yet how many such desperate ones are there in the world that sleepe securely vpon the brinke of hell yea how many that inuring not themselues daily to reconcile themselues to god make a comfortlesse end and are taken before euer they haue thought of making their peace my exhortation is that we presume not so farre vpon gods patience as to neglect this kind of repentance
but this is not an euery dayes repentance
it hath his times appointed by the church if it be publike or if it bee priuate the times are assigned by a mans owne conscience

there is another repentance which attendeth sanctification inioyned by the precept of the law vnto sanctification wee make way by mortification and this is an euery dayes repentance which doth not looke to the act of sinne as the former but to the habit
were it possible that there were no act of sinne committed then we should not need the first kind of repentance but yet this second we should need because the best beare about them a habit of sinne

saint bernard setteth it thus before our eyes when adam fell and when euerie one of vs doth fall be may be compared vnto a man that falleth not only into the mire but also vpon a heape of stones hee may quickly be washed but not so quickly healed there is great time spent therein euen the whole time of our life we must begin our repentance at baptisme which we must continue vntill our death
as there bee many other reasons why the church is compared to the moone and christ to the sunne so one may bee the oddes betweene iustification and sanctification iustification maketh christs righteousnesse ours and it is from the first moment at the full not capable of any increase but sanctification is righteousnesse in vs which if it haue not his waines certainly it hath

its waxings and will not be at the full till the day of our death
this fruit is nothing else but the putting off the old man

the crucifying of the flesh with the lusts thereof the casting away of the sinne which cleaueth on so fast the abolishing of the whole bodie of sinne
hee that neglecteth this

forgetteth that a christian must offer vp his bodie a liuing sacrifice holy acceptable vnto god that the name of a christian is the name of iustice goodnesse sinceritie chastitie humilitie for what else are these but drops of that oile wherewith hee is anointed might amplifie this point

but hasten to that which followeth only obseruing that of saint paul euery creature groaneth desiring the libertie of the sonnes of god and therefore it is a shame for the sonnes of god not to beare a part in this mourning but to stand still as if they made no haste to heauen and had no desire to be that whereunto they are called
it was not so with christians of old report mee to the character of the church as epiphanius calleth it and describeth it in the last chapter of his third booke but specially to gregorie nyssenes oration of baptisme where he bringeth in a baptized christian thus resisting the temptations of the deuill a vaunt thou wicked fiend am dead and can a dead man be moued with those things which hee affected when he was aliue when was aliue could riot couldlie can a dead man doe these things certainly when wee looke vpon our selues and see how common sinnes are amongst vs the ranknesse the plentie of the fruit that we beare sheweth that the sinfull root is not dead in vs and the scarcitie of good fruit sheweth that the root of grace is not aliue
so that our abrenunciation was but in word that it was not indeed it appeareth by the raritie of our mortification
conclude with the exhortation of saint paul

let vs therefore mortifie our which are vpon the earth formication vncleanesse inordinate affection

euill concupiscence and couetousnesse which is idolatrie and let vs take no more care for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof

you haue heard what is our worke there remaine two things yet the one is the commandement to doe it the other is the degree in which wee must performe it men doe not light a candle to put it vnder a bushell neither doth god giue grace but for the vse
but the phrase in english is scant it seemeth only to call for in the sight of men but the greeke undefined span alphabet is of a larger extent and may reach those things which can bee discerned only by the sight of god
and indeed the fruits are inward or outward for there is a in the inward closet of our heart where wee must fructifie and lay the foundation of those workes which wee doe in the outward man all our outward deeds should be but deeds of deeds the deeds outward haue no more value then they receiue from the inward

but wee must not bee contented only with the inward wee must bring forth the outward also hee that hath an inside for god and an outside for the deuill may with his pardon be cast into hell wee must therfore shew some outward euidence of the efficacie of grace

gregorie nyssen setteth it forth excellently come on you saith he

which glorie in your baptisme how shall it appeare that the mysticall grace hath altered you in your countenance there appeareth no change nor in your outward lineaments how then shall your friends perceiue that you are not the same suppose no other way but by your manners they must shew that you are not what you were when you are tempted with the same sinnes whereunto before you were subiect and yet forbeare them
it is reported of one of the worthiest of the ancients that before his conuersion had kept companie with a strumpet when after his conuersion she came towards him he sted she calleth after him whither flyest thou

it is his answere was but am not and indeed euerie one should say with saint paul line yet not now but iesus christ liueth in mee and let euery one that is in iesus christ become a new creature
and so come from the commandement to the degree
there must bee an answerablenesse betweene gods worke and ours it is not enough to bring forth fruits they must be worthy of repentance

undefined span alphabet saith a learned interpreter hath his name from undefined span alphabet and is a metaphor taken from ballances when one seale doth counterpoize another the syriacke word seemeth to sound that way also
but etymologies doe not alwayes yeild good grounds of diuinitie it is well if there bee a correspondencie an equalitie is more then may bee hoped for betweene gods worke and ours
which obserue the rather because the rhemish note findeth sacisfactorie workes in this word forgetting their owne dininitie which maketh satisfaction attend penance but not the sacrament of baptisme
but to leaue them and deliuer the truth concerning repentance
we must obserue that in sin there are two things the guilt and the act of sin the guilt infinite the act finite
nothing can worthily satisfie for the guilt but only the pretious death of iesus christ his bloud only is the propitiation for our sins
but the act is finite wherwith we sin so is the act wherwith we repent between these acts we shuld endeuour to shew an emulation so that looke what pleasure we tooke in sinne against god so much sorow should we expresse when wee returne againe vnto god hee that sinneth a great sinne must not thinke it enough to sorrow as hee doth for a small one peter wept but bee wept bitterly because he had sinned grieuously and king dauid wore out his eyes and watered his couch with his teares sorrowing for those sinnes wherewith he had prouoked god
but let vs draw this through both parts of repentance

and see how the degree must appeare in them
in the first of solemne repentance the rule is if a man slip in his faith or loue of god and recouer he will cleaue faster vnto god and loue him mere ardently and he pleaseth god the better when his loue after a recouerie groweth zelous then when in innocencie it groweth lukewarme
as in the bodie of a man if an arme or legge bee broken and bee well set againe it groweth the stronger
take an example from saint paul who as he was a bloudie persecutor so did hee proue a most painfull apostle and most patient martyr
saint austines confessions shew how erroneous in iudgement how dissolute in life he had beene but since the apostles dayes neuer had the church a better bishop then was

saint austin
but if we should looke for this degree in this age we might happily seeke long but scarce find any parallel not but that there are euery where those that exceed them in sinne but of those that imitate them in repentance we find none no adulterers that so change as to become markable spectacles of continencie no oppressors that turne deacons and minister out of their goods to the necessitie of the poore no drunkards that pinch their bodies with fasting and abstinence he that hath not commited vnlawfull things may be bold to vse the lawfull blessings of god and notwithstanding performe acceptable workes of pietie but hee that hath beene a fornicator an adulterer must goe as farre in abstaining from the contentments of this life which are otherwise allowed him as hee hath exceeded in the vse of them

but this rule is growne too much out of date and we thinke that so we repent it matters not in what degree we repent and so we make a reall confession that howsoeuer we doe turne to god yet wee are afraid to bee too farre estranged from our sinne
wherein god doth not obtaine so much of man as the deuill doth
for when a good man degenerateth hee keepeth no meane but commonly striueth to be the worst plunging himselfe most deeply into sinne and persecuting goodnesse and good men most bitterly
it were to be wisht that our zeale that turne vnto god were no worse in the loue of goodnesse and the hatred of sinne but it is rather to bee wisht then hoped for
the reason of it lieth in our neglect of that degree which should be in the second kind of repentance for if we did affect that we would bee more apt vnto this

the degree of the second kind of repentance is when a mans outward life striueth to bee answerable to his inward calling
it is strange to see how in worldly state euerie man striueth to liue futably to his ranke and is accounted base if he doe not so if of a yeoman hee become a gentleman of a gentleman a knight as his person is improued so will he improue his port also yea the excesses of all sorts of men shew that herein euery man goeth beyond his ranke in his house in his fare in his clothes
but in our spirituall state it is nothing so for our house we can be contented to dwell in seeled houses when the arke of god is vnder tents and who doth endeuour that himselfe may be a temple fit for god as for our clothes they should be royall our garments should euer be white the wedding garment should neuer be off but we are so farre from couering our nakednesse with conuenient robes that it appeares not in the eyes of god as that we take no care to hide our filthinesse from men
certainly we doe not endeuour to be clothed with the righteousnesse of saints
finally for our diet we that are called to the table of the lord and should be sustained with angels food content our selues with swines meate for what else are filthy lusts wherein wee are so much worse then the prodigall childe in that he did desire them and no man gaue them to him we haue our sils his was desired of necessitie but our food is voluntarie
in a word we are called to be sonnes of god our eye is seldome

vpon our father to see what beseemeth his sonnes wee are called to be members of christ but little doe wee care what beseemeth that mysticall bodie wee rather are in name then in deed either children of god or members of christ
conclude this point with nazianzens admonition we may not counterfeit our puritie but haue it remarkable and illustrious wee must haue our soules perfectly died with grace
let vs walke worthy of that vocation whereunto we are called

this lesson belongeth to them that are of age betweene whom and infants there is this difference that undefined span alphabet repentance which is gods worke is enough for infants but bring forth fruit belongeth to them that are of riper age
if time be granted vnto vs after our conuersion it is granted to the end that by our good conuersation wee may set forth the vertues of him that hath called vs into his maruailous light
and we should thinke it enough if not too much that we haue spent the time past in those lusts that are vnbeseeming christians but wee may vse that saying of the apostle

know you not that the patience and longsuffering of god draweth you to repentance but you after your hearts that cannot repent treasure vnto your selues wrath against the day of wrath
repentance should be vsed while we may sinne for then it will be fruitfull and medicinall because we leaue sinne before sinne leaueth vs but if we will then vse repentance when we can sinne no more our repentance will be vnfruitfull and only penall
and indeed they which will not vse repentance in this world fruitfully shall will they nill they repent in the world to come but it will be vnfruitfully they will not weepe here for their sinnes but in hell they shall both weepe and gnash their teeth they will not here manicle and fetter their lusts but there they shall be bound both hands and feet they will not here purge their stubble and drosse with the fire of gods spirit therefore hereafter they shall burne and their drosse their chaffe shall be endlesse fuell of the flames of hell
then let mee weepe let mee repent out of the loue and with the comfort of iesus christ that hereafter be not driuen to repent out of feare and with the paine of the fire of hell

the conclusion of all is god by the sight of our euill moueth vs to a desire of our good when he preuenteth vs with his grace we must take care that we receiue not his grace in vaine and this shall we doe if we disparage not our heauenly conuersion with an earthly conuersation
lord graft in thy preachers such charitie that they may aime wisely at their hearers good and increase in their hearers that desire of goodnesse and happinesse which may make them capable of wholsome counsell so shall the dew of heauen worke fotnesse in the earth and wee shall all grow in thy church as trees loaden with abundance of fruit when wee sinne wee shall repent and we shall repent also that we may not sinne vntill the haruest day come when thou shalt haue reaped all the fruits thou requirest of vs in this state of grace and we shall begin to reape those fruits which thou hast premised vnto vs in the state of glorie
amen

the fourth sermon
epigraph

lvke
verse
and beginne not to say within your selues we haue abraham to our father for say vnto you that god is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto abraham

of the remedy of their heart which came to saint iohn baptist haue already spoken the next point is the remedy of their heads which taketh vp the remainder of the text
in applying this remedy the baptist doth first open then correct their errour hee openeth it in their obiection and in his owne answere doth correct it their errour was this vaunt we haue abraham to our father this they obiected against the first part of iohn baptists sermon
but the words are ellipticall they include more then they expresse you may gather it out of the baptists answere which is the rust measure of their obiection for what he correcteth in that they erred
now he correcteth in their obiection ignorance and arrogancie both double double ignorance double arrogancie double ignorance for they first maine secondly misplace the truth
they maime it in that not knowing how much was requisite to the making vp of a child of abraham their words meant that they were wholly his whereas they were his but in part and that too the worst part
saint iohn correcteth this he forbiddeth their claime say not we haue abraham to our father you haue nothing in you worthy of so honorable a title
as they did maime the truth through ignorance so did they also through ignorance misplace it they did misplace it in beginning their defence at this claime
for although there bee comfort in being any wayes a child of abraham yet the triall of our comfort must begin at our resemblance of not our allyance vnto abraham therefore saint iohn that corrected their defect in matter correcteth also their defect in order begin not to say let not this be the entrance to your apologie

hauing thus corrected their ignorance hee goeth on and correcteth their arrogancie
arrogancie is the child of ignorance of the good things which we thinke we haue the lesse we know the more we crake certainely the iewes did they were doubly arrogant first they did appropriate abrahams family vnto them selues
as they thought them selues to bee wholy his so they thought none his but themselues onely they held all other nations vile the iewes onely to be noble
and this first branch of arrogancie sprang from the first branch of their ignorance for indeed as they were children of abraham so none were children but they
saint iohn correcteth this arrogancie and telleth them that there is no

impediment in gods power but abraham may haue yea there is faire euidence in gods couenant that abraham shall haue other children seeme they neuer so vnlikely to become children not onely besides them which is enough to take downe their pride but also which striketh them to the very heart insteed of them though they all faile this saint meaneth when he saith that god is able euen of these stones to raise vp children vnto abraham
the second branch of their arrogancie is their scoffing at gods iudgements as if we haue abraham to our father were armour of proofe against them and they needed no buckler but their pedigree
this second arrogancie springeth from their second ignorance for where they begin their defence vpon that they stand and thinke their needeth no more prouision against the wrath to come so they put it off as if liued they neuer so inordinately it did nothing concerne them
this saint iohn correcteth hee telleth them that they are not so in the couenant but they may be cast out that they must haue some worth of their owne besides that of their fathers otherwise they must looke for and that shortly a totall a finall eradication now is the axe layed to the roote of the tree

you see what particulars remaine vnhandled of these by gods affistance and your christian patience will now touch at so many as the time will permit

and first because no defect nor excesse and such are the iewes ignorance and arrogance the on detracting from the other adding to the truth can bee knowne without the meane which is their measure in reference whereunto we iudge of them the truth of abrahams fatherhood must first be opened and we must see what grace god vouchsafed him that thereby we may conceiue the vprightnesse of the baptists censure
will not fall into the common place of abrahams praise the large texts which the scripture doth yeeld thereof hath found most eloquent most aboundant commentaries there is scarse a iew or christian greeke or latine father that doth not write of him and make a panegyricke of his worth will cull out of them so much as will illighten my text
and the first thing that obserue is that there were patriarkes before him and patriarkes that came after him yet none left behind them so honourable a name
if you looke to the patriarkes that liued before him they had the same couenant in substance but in ceremonies and circumstances wherwith god was pleased to cloth his couenant abraham did excell them
as for the patriarkes that succeeded though they did partake of all that abraham had yet this was abrahams aduantage that god first gaue these things to him and onely confirmed them vnto them

and that too for his sake
but to speake more distinctly
chrysostome obserues that which is cleare
cor
that abraham was the tenth from noah and that god tooke him out of that prophane age and place wherin he liued as his owne portion for the tithe is sacred vnto god noah was such a tithe before in whom god began the new world abraham was then a person sacred vnto god
not onely so but consecrated also by god himselfe for eusebius in his chronicle obserueth that abraham was the

first prophet to whom the sonne of god appeared in the shape of a man

at what time he inuested him with the patriarkship
now of a person so sacred so consecrated we must looke to heare of some thing more then ordinarie and indeed saint austin telleth vs that whatsoeuer the scripture reporteth of abraham it is factum prophetia

a propheticall fact it concerneth not only the time present but the time to come as well his as him
but two things principally set forth abrahams prerogatiue the first is that his family was to bee the depositarie of gods couenant the second is that his vertues were to be exemplary to the whole church
touching the first the promise is plaine that in his seed all nations of the earth shall be blessed the prophets vsually meaning the gentiles call them israel

and the apostle saith that the branches of the wild liue must bee engrafted into the true it is not enough that the partition wall is broken downe but we must bee incorporated into the same body for god is not pleased that any shall ordinarily be saued except he bee of abrahams family
secondly of those which are of abrahams family it is not gods pleasure that any should bee saued that doth not exemplifie abrahams vertues in his life

for abrahams vertues were to bee exemplarie of his vertues in generall chrysostome obserueth that any man might take a patterne of any vertue from him for they were limmed with liuely colours in him
but of his vertues saint paul doth especially insist vpon his faith iames vpon his charitie our sauior christ vpon both both are sauing vertues and no hope without them of entring into abrahams bosome
this may well goe for a third prerogatiue of abraham that the place of blisse beareth his name and that our best fare in heauen is to be guests at the same table with him to bee blessed with blessed abraham but no hope say to attaine this but by conforming our liues to abrahams in such a faith as worketh by charitie
therefore gregorie nyssen calleth him viam fidei the path of saith

irenie saith that his faith was prophetia sidei ambrose that hee was forma credentium but saint austin obserueth well that which commeth yet nearer to my text duplex prophetia facta est abrahae carnalis spiritualis he was a most noble patriarke corporally but spiritually hee was much more noble yea whatsoeuer he was corporally was but a type of that which he was spiritually obserue in the points of his prerogatiue the sacrament a pledge of gods couenant the sacrifices types of his vertues in both the thing corporall was but a type of a better thing of that which was spirituall
the last thing which obserue concerning abraham is gregorie nyssens note

abraham had a carnall and a spirituall generation or whereof the carnall was to continue but during the old testament but the spirituall was to last vntill the end of the world it is an errour of the iewes to thinke that circumcision must bee catholike both in time and place for when the spirituall seed came then the carnall was to cease and with the carnall the character thereof so doth epiphanius call circumcision
in a word christ when he came changed not the couenant but the sacrament that so although carnall children cease yet spirituall might continue vnto abraham

hauing thus farre opened vnto you the prerogatiue of abraham it is time that we now come to speake of the errour of the iewes
in handling whereof for more breuitie and greater perspicutie will branch by branch carie along the answere with the obiection
let vs come then to their ignorance
whereof the first branch is the mayming of the truth they vnderstood the prerogatiue of abraham onely according to the flesh and not according to the spirit

though in their synagogues they doe boast of foure things first their secondly their circumcision thirdly their lawe and fourthly their countrie and them all yet doe they glorie most in their and that they vnderstand worst
it is true that euen according to the flesh no nation may compare with the iewe in nobilitie parentage none euer sprang from such worthies as they doe saint paul doth them but right when rom cap

cap

hee acknowledgeth their preheminences therein to say nothing of that which we find in the prophets
and certainely it is in it selfe a great blessing to be borne of worthy parents because it is a monument of gods fauour to a family but vnto vs it is no blessing except we communicate in their vertues
for there are certaine notes by which euerie liuing thing must bee knowne notes stamped in the body and notes stamped in the soule lineaments and qualities of which the qualitie doth morally denominate rather then the lineaments
take for example a sheepe or a wolfe they haue outward shapes and inward qualities whereby they are distinguished the qualitie of the one is meekenesse of the other is rauenousnesse when wee come to consider whether either of the se be such as he should bee we find that either of them may degenerate either in the lineaments or in the qualities in the lineaments for a sheepe may happily haue the shape of a wolfe and yet retaine the meeknesse of a sheepe a wolfe may haue the linearnents of a sheepe and yet retaine the rauenousnesse of a wolfe
it is not the lineaments of either but the qualities that will giue them their name
doth reason acknowledge this in beasts and shall not religion acknowledge it much more in men it was grosse ignorance in the iewes to thinke that the outward character could denominate them without the inward and that they should goe for sonnes of abraham who in pietie were so vnlike abraham
therefore saint iohn correcteth this ignorance of theirs and telleth them they are not worthy of so honourable a title nay god himselfe doth vilisie them calling them sometimes gentiles in generall sometimes descending to particulars

are you not all as the children of vnto me and as if that parentage were too good thy natiuitie saith god is of the land of canaan

thy father was an amorite thy mother an hittite yet this doth not villifie them enough the worst place of canaan was sodome and gomorra thither doth god send them for their pedigree deut
finally after yee are past sodome there remaineth nothing but hell and so low doth christ debase them ioh
you are of your father the diuell euen you that say yee haue abraham to your father
doe not wonder why saint paul after that he had reckoned vp all the parcels of his corporall nobilitie concludeth am not

the better am the worse for all this all this is but dung it recommendeth me nothing vnto god nay it may make me blush for that haue no inward resemblance of him with whom haue this outward alliance
it were good our nobilitie and gentrie did learne this who haue nothing to shew that they are the of spring of such worthies as their fathers were but onely that which tully yeeldeth to piso a genealogie or an earthly patrimonie
saint chrysostome compareth such vnto froth and indeed generous liquor doth cast a froth which froth is insipid and hath nothing of that taste which is in the liquor euen so are they descended of their parents but their parents liue not in them and therefore all that they can boast of

is but an ignoble nobilitie as theophylact speaketh it is not worth the standing vpon

malo pater tibi sit thersites dummodo tu sis aeacidae similis vulcania{que arma capessas quam te thersitae similem producat achilles

the truth whereof saint chrysostome setteth before vs in an excellent simile behold saith he gold commeth of the earth a precious mettall of a very base element we esteeme the gold we care not for the earth euen so

if a child be worthy it skilleth not how vnworthy his parents were faithfull abraham is not the worse because the child of idolatrous sarah
the similitude goeth on siluer yeeldeth tinne the better a worse mettall wee neglect the tinne and keepe the siluer so if a child be vnworthy what doth it auaile him to be of worthy parents what is ismael the better for being the sonne of abraham if this rule haue exceptions as indeed it hath in worldly societies for many make idols of rich nabals

and knottie blockes yet to godward the rule is true none can claime spirituall kindred with abraham but they that are new creatures dissimilitude of manners argueth bastards and no sonnes

you haue heard the first branch of their ignorance they maimed the truth
the second is they misplaced it for they began their defence against the wrath to come at this claime we haue abraham to our father
the fathers note that this is preposterous dealing it is not enough for vs to take care that we partake as well of the substance as of the ceremonie in sacred things we must adde a second rule which is this
as in knowing god so in knowing our state to godward we must rise from the effects to the cause that so afterward we may from the cause conclude the effects the euidence is in the effects whereof the assurance is in the cause that wee are the children of god we see most cleerely in our vertues though the ground whereupon wee stand most assuredly is gods couenant
wherefore the couenant is not the first step where wee must begin our triall much lesse may wee begin at predestination we must by degrees of reason read the gifts of god in our faith hope and charitie to worke which the word and sacraments were ordained if wee find these they argue gods loue to vs they prooue wee stand in good

tearmes with him
and when we haue thus argued from the effects we may safely make demonstrations from the cause and then it will bee a good plea if our conscience doth question the certaintie of our saluation because the good that we would doe we cannot doe

to say with saint paul thankes be to god through iesus christ our lord or that which is equiualent haue abraham to my father
this plea was prouided to keepe vs in heart in that conflict
of this the iewes were ignorant and therefore saint iohn correcteth this in them blameth them for putting in their claime to the couenant before they had giuen some proofe of their vertue
we are not ignorant of the romish calumnies and of the distraction of our brethren in forraine parts about this doctrine happily some occasion hereof may be because some deliuer theologie more theoretically then practically
it were to be wished that at least in so much as must come to the vulgar eye and eare this method were changed lest as it hath so it prooue dangerous to many though dare say that if the parts of the doctrine publikely authorized by the reformed churches be charitably laid together and otherwise to construe the writing is against good manners by a rule in the ciuill law wee shall find nothing but that which may passe for sound and good
but to leaue methods of bookes and come to methods of our liues when rip vp the tracts of this argument written by those that either would seeme to be or are indeed zealous of pietie find that mens liues opened both their mouthes and set both their pens a writing therefore thinke there can be no more compendious course to silence the slaunders of the one and reconcile the distractions of the other

then to let our lights so shine before men that they may see our good workes and glorifie our father which is in heauen
and thus much of iohns answer to the first part of their errour the correcting of their ignorance

come now to the second part their arrogancie double arrogancie for first they appropriate abrahams family to themselues
as they thought themselues to be holy so did they think the~selues to be the onely children of abraham
in their synagogues it is one of those things for which they giue thanks vnto god that they are born israelites not goim gentiles of whom they neuer speak but with great scorn cyril alexandrinus amplifieth this point vpon osea cap

the israelites looking loftily and speaking bigge boasted we haue abraham to our father he addeth to our purpose

that they did most insolently despise all other nations
hierome ecclesiastes the sixth that the gentiles were reputed but vpstarts and abortiues yea this pride was so rooted in them that the crossing of it was their greatest heartbreaking theodoret obserueth it in rom cap

for neither their seruitude nor their dispersion nor the ruine of their temple and countrie doth so much vexe them as the glorie of the gentiles church
and there is good ground for this note both in rule and practice god foretold it should be so deut
because you haue prouoked me to iealousie by those that are no gods also will prouoke you to iealousie with that which is no people by a foolish nation will anger you
the gospell telleth vs it was so when christ went into zacheus did they not murmur

were they not

filled with indignation when a whole citie of the gentiles came to heare the word of god

did they not forbid the apostles to preach to the gentiles all these are proofes in what estimation they had the gentiles
and doe not the romanists in the like manner glorie now in saint peter and thinke none built vpon the rocke of saint peters confession but themselues syrians armenians ethiopians graecians protestants all are heretickes but themselues they are not so eloquent in any argument as in their inuectiues against these but nothing so galleth them as the glorie of the reformed churches which is a spice of their iewish pride saint iohn shall correct them in the iewes let vs come then to the correction

saint iohn disproueth the iewes appropriating of abrahams family to themselues shewing that there is no impediment in gods power but that abraham may haue yea rather there is faire euidence in his couenant that abraham shall haue other children euen those that seeme vnlikely to become chilren though all the iewes saile
both these propositions are contained in saint iohns answere the fathers obserue both and will shew you what ground there is for both
but because the latter doth presuppose the former the former must first bee vnfolded vnto you
some then take the name of stones properly though they also differ amongst themselues some vnderstand the twelue stones that were by ioshuah pitcht in the middest of iordan when the children of israel passed it vpon the drie ground other vnderstand common stones such as lie by the riuers side
but the difference is not worth the standing vpon those which ioshuah pitcht were common stones and to the working of the miracle it skilleth not whether they were those or any other for it must be an almightie power that must worke this alteration of any
by gods power then you must vnderstand his absolute abilitie to doe what he will and can there be any question but that the same god which out of the dust of the earth made man of the rib of man made woman can raise vp children vnto abraham to take away all doubt from the iew and to make it out of all question that god can doe this see how he speaketh in the prophet esay looke vpon the rocke from whence you were hewen and the pit out of which you were digged looke vpon abraham that begat you and sarah that bare yee the fathers thinke that saint iohn in his phrase alludeth to this place of the prophet and if out of the withered bodie of abraham and sarah god could draw isaak why cannot other children by the same power bee giuen vnto abraham there should bee no doubt with vs the first article of whose creed is belieue in god the father almightie and yet a doubt is made of this

a double doubt one impious another curious

the impious is made by galen for thus hee saith were god neuer so willing he cannot make a man of a stone and in this doth our opinion and the opinion of plato and other greeke philosophers which haue written aright of the nature of things differ from moses for god thinkes moses is almightie and can doe what he will although it be of ashes to make

an horse or an oxe
but wee thinke not so
but afsirme that there are somethings which nature cannot doe and that god neuer attempts any such thing but of that which is in his power he chuseth to doe that which is best
the weaknesse of so worthy a mans iudgement censure not as it deserueth because it was a fault of his infidelitie only answere him as christ did the saducees he erred not knowing the scripture

nor the power of god he equalled nature vnto god whereas god is the god of nature and therefore many things which nature cannot doe

god often doth the instances are many that may be giuen hereof in the old testament and in the new the apostles rule is hee can doe aboue all that we can thinke according to which words we must vnderstand those of our sauiour that which is impossible to men that is not only aboue their power but also aboue their conceit is possible to god

for as saint bernard there is neither number nor boundarie of those things that come within the compasse of gods omnipotencie
but here the papist commeth in vnseasonably with his transubstantiation thinking this a faire ground to prooue the possibilitie of it but they racke gods power too farre
for as god simply hath no passiue power because he can faile in nothing so in his actiue power he is dissinabled by their owne confession vnto some things namely to make contradictories and they cannot with all their sophistrie free this their tenent from manifold contradiction
but to shut vp this first dispute

abraham had an eye to this almightie power both when hee expected and also when hee would haue offered his sonne and so must wee in our faith and in our obedience gods almightie power must make vs resolute in both

the second dispute is curious the schoolemen moue it they inquire how these men which god by his almightie power can make of stones can possibly bee the children of abraham whereas abrahams children must spring from abrahams loines a question vnworthy of diuines but to the purpose

a man is distinguished into naturall constitution and supernaturall condition
in this dispute we haue not to doe with man as a man but as a member of the church that it is so you may gather out of the very phrase it is not said god shall raise children of abraham but vnto abraham they are not to bee his children by generation but by regeneration
which the rather must be admitted because the apostle telleth vs

they that are children of abraham are children of god and then saint iohn will tell vs that the children of god are not borne of flesh and bloud but of the will of god
adde hereunto that they are first members of christ then abrahams seed and christ hath no natiue but adoptiue members
finally gregorie nyssen doth wittily meditare vpon those words of god to abraham looke to heauen and behold the starres so shall thy seed bee

meane those starres which haue their originall from the holy spirit and haue suddenly turned the church into a firmament
the children here ment are not naturall but spirituall and this cognation excels the other as much as the soule excels the bodie
certainly christ did so esteeme

his kindred

when hee moued that question who is my mother and who is my brother and god meant no other when he promised king dauid of his sonne will be his father and he shall be my sonne he meaneth that god would take him for his sonne though he bee not so by nature

but this leadeth vs vnto a second proposition and saint ambrose doth preferre the meaning thereof before the former
the former seemeth to say that god will worke a miracle rather then abraham should want children but the second proposition importeth a mysterie in the words the promise is mysticall that supplyeth children vnto abraham

am more benefited by the mysterie then the miracle therefore in the speech of christs harbenger obserue specially the building vp of the church which was not erected of stones materiall but of conuerted soules
wherefore the fathers for the most part vnderstand the word stones figuratiuely for the gentiles and obserue a resemblance betweene the gentiles and stones a double resemblance the one in regard of senslesnesse another in regard of worthlesnesse

the senslesnesse is double actiue and passiue actiue in that they worshipped stones and then you know what the psalmist saith they that make them are like vnto them so are all they that put their trust in them

their passiue senslesnesse is that whereby they are incapable of the mysteries of heauen hauing stonie hearts like vnto stonie ground whereon whatsoeuer seed is cast is cast away
besides their senslesnesse there is in them also a worthlesnesse wherein they resemble stones a double worthlesnesse a passine for they are without ornament an actiue for they are without fruit they are as the church of laodicea blind wretched naked miserable and what fruit should they beare that drinke not in the dew of heauen you see good resemblance betweene stones and the gentiles

you must also note that the power here meant is not absolute but limited
though gods power bee equall to his will yet is not his will alwayes as large as his power therefore are there many things which the scripture saith god cannot doe meaning not absolutely but vpon supposition

the angell could doe nothing whiles lot was in sodome

christ could worke no miracles because of the iewes vnbeliefe god himselfe could no longer forbeare the iewes because of their wickednesse the meaning is that the contrarie was decreed and god would not alter his decree
now vpon this distinction ariseth the question seeing the gentiles may bee figured by stones whether here they be figured by them
why not there were before iohn at this time publicans and souldiers which for the most part were gentiles and why might not saint iohn point at them sure am that when zacheus a publican receiued christ

christ himselfe doth witnes this also is a sonne of abraham

and when the centurion exprest his humble faith in christ christ assigned him a place at abrahams table

and it is worth the marking that saint peter calleth conuerts to christ liuing stones and what is that but a periphrasis of a sonne

of abraham made of a stone there are two things in a stone insensiblenesse and firmenesse that must be remoued this must continue that the parts of the building may be sutable

and we built vpon the rocke christ may grow vp into a holy temple in the lord
the gentiles then may here be meant and there is no impediment in gods couenant but that they may become children of abraham
yea it is so farre from being against gods couenant that it is contained in it abrahams name is a prophesie of the gentiles conuersion it is contained in the promise that is made of abrahams seed when the god of all flesh saw that he purposed to make our church of iewes and gentiles and that he would saue them by faith hee prefigured both in abraham

and the apostles text is cleere for it
the fathers make thamars children a type hereof wherein the gentile seemeth to haue a prioritie and to bee in the couenant before the iewes for abraham was a type of the gentiles being iustified and receiuing the promises in vncircumcision before hee was a type of the iewes and had the promises renewed after that he was circumcised
but as of thamars children that which first put out the hand was not first borne so fell it out betweene the gentiles and the iewes finally galatinus proueth out of the rabbins that the gentiles aswell as the iewes were to be saued by christ
to conclude the apostles rule must bee held

it cannot be that the word of god should be of none effect

but why doth the baptist make mention of gods power only and only say that god can doe this chrysostomes opinion is that hee would feare them only and not driue them to despaire others say that taking gods will for a thing cleare hee did put them in minde that hee could performe his will when he would

but the time is past wherefore will now conclude saint cyril saint chrysostome both say that this text may be applyed vnto christians for euen of them also more then a good many ar with this ignorance with this arrogance they maime the truth in contenting themselues with outward characters little caring for the inward which principally make a christian and how many doe enter their names into gods book in heauen before euer they looke whether they haue a counterpart thereof written by the finger of the holy ghost in their soules and what wonder if this ignorance breed arrogancie and they that think better of themselues then they should think worse then they should of others but let vs take care to be sure of our resemblance before wee crake of our alliance let vs find in our selues faith and charitie abrahams vertues and then hope well that wee are abrahams children let vs so hope well of our selues that we despaire not of others gods hands are not tyed his power hath no bounds they that seeme to be of least hope may proue more worthy then our selues
but whether we looke vpon our selues or others if we find that of stones we are become the children of abraham let vs magnisie god according

to his mercie which we shall the better doe if wee call to mind what we were and what we are how senslesse we were how litle feeling we had of gods either words or workes how brutishly wee adored the basest of the creatures
neither were wee only so senslesse but we were most worthlesse also poore soules indeed spirituall lazars not worth the looking after but with contempt
and as we had litle so it was litle wee could doe wee could doe no good either in glorifying god or edifying the church or increasing our owne comfort wee were as barren to these things as very stones
but see now these stones doe liue our hearts are sensible of the influence of heauen and wee adore only him that liueth for euer hee with a liberall hand hath inriched vs and wee with a cheerefull heart fructifie vnto him wee cannot turne our eyes vpon our selues but wee behold his mercies and wee present before his sacred eyes our most humble duties thus should we magnifie our god that hath done so great things for vs for vs say that are the ofspring of them that were sometimes very stones

end with saint bernards caution

god indeed can raise of stones children vnto abraham as sometimes he did saint paul yet must we not tempt god and neglecting what is to be done on our part presume that gods hand will worke all wee must reade the scripture meditate therein seeke knocke pray and then we shall find grace the windowes of heauen will bee opened vnto vs and the hand of god will new mould vs he will mollifie whatsoeuer is stonie in vs and supply whatsoeuer worth we lacke what god can doe that he will doe if we be in any part stones hee will make vs euen in that part also children of abraham and if children then heires heires annexed with iesus christ

god by his grace make vs all abrahams sonnes and giue vs all grace to walks abrahams steps that wee may all finally meete in abrahams besome
amen

the fifth sermon
epigraph

lvke
verse
and now also is the axe laide vnto the roote of the trees euerie tree therefore which bringeth not foorth good fruite is hewen downe and cast into the fire

saint iohn baptist preaching to the vnbeleeuing iewes shewed them that they were sicke both at head and heart and therefore applied fit remedies to either part
hauing before in your hearing ended the first remedy that is applied to the heart began the last time spake out of this place to intreat of the second remedy which is applied vnto their head
their head was sicke of ignorance and arrogancie both double haue spoken of their ignorance and the first branch of their arrogancie their appropriating abrahams family vnto themselues there remaineth yet one branch of the text that which checketh their second pride their conumpt of god
they did contemne god in that they set light by the iudgements that were denounced from him marke their ground they thought they had such interest in abraham that for his sake god would spare them and his wrath should neuer seize on them
but they heare from the baptist that they are not so in the couenant but they may be blotted out and if they haue not some worth of their owne besides that of their parent they must looke for an imminent totall finall eradication for now is the axe laide to the roote of the trees

these words are a parable and therefore they haue a morall
for a parable is a comparison of things spirituall vnto corporall wherein the things corporall and spirituall doe mutually giue light each vnto other the spirituall doe guide vs in the setting bounds vnto the corporall and the corporall doe helpe vs to vnderstand the secrets of the spirituall seeing then the spirituall is the key that must vnlocke the corporall sense we can say little to the corporall vntill we haue found out the spirituall
but where shall we find it it is not here wee must looke it else where
we haue it for a good part in saint iohn cap

where christ speaketh thus am a vine you are branches my father is an husbandman

euerie branch in me that beareth not fruit is taken away and cast into the fire esay is more full and expresse to my text the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and iuda is his pleasant plant hee looked for iudgement and behold oppression for righteousnesse and behold a crie therefore hath the lord of reuealed this in mine eare many houses shall be desolate faire goodly houses left without inhabitants yea hell hath enlarged it selfe the

mouth thereof is opened without measure their glorie their multitude their pompe euerie one that reioyceth shall descend into it

according to this mo~rall if we breake vp the parable wee must obserue the persons therein contained and the iudgement that is denounced the persons are two god compared to a husbandman surueying his orchard the iewes compared vnto trees of the orchard trees planted therein to beare good fruites
of the iudgement we haue here the cause and the parts
the cause is the iewes not liuing sutably to their incorporation which is represented by a tree not bearing good fruites
the parts are two first the iewes are depriued of that blessed estate wherein they stood the axe is put to the roote and by the roote they are cut vp so the parable doth resemble it
secondly they are exposed to the miserie which they deserued they are cast into the fire a fruitlesse tree burning in the fire is the embleme of a sinner tormented in hell
if you lay these two parts together they are a totall a finall desolation for kill the roote kill the whole tree
what life can he haue that is separate from christ the fountaine of life trees that are rooted vp for their barrennesse are not set againe and when doe we heareof an apostata a second time incorporated into christ the iudgement is fearefull
and yet as fearefull as it is our husbandman doth denounce it vnto these trees god doth denounce it against the iewes euerie tree shall be cut cut vp shalbe cast into the fire
neither doth he onely denounce it but biddeth them also to looke for it speedily for now is the axe layed to the roote of the tree and vniuersally euerie tree that beareth not good fruit
you heare what particulars are remarkable in my text whereof it remaineth that you now heare againe somewhat more fully as the time will permit

but before come to the particulars must point at a stratageme of sathans which he vseth to stay men from amending their liues
it is impossible for a man in cold bloud to silence the accusing voice of conscience

not to thinke on and thinking with faelix not to tremble at the remembrance of the iudgement day now left men should be reclaimed hereby he hath prouided fig leaues to couer their nakednesse and perswadeth them that if they be attired therewith they will not bee so cowardly as adam was and flie from the fearefull presence of god he filleth their heads with the holinesse worthinesse of the ceremonies which they vse the parentage from whence they come and perswadeth that these are armour of proofe against the heauie stroake of gods wrath they need no more but crie out the temple of the lord the temple of the lord

and we haue abraham to our father
these words if they had no more to say for themselues but these words are able to stay the punishing angell and sheath the sword of god certainely the iewes put their trust in them and they were the rather induced so to doe because they seemed to haue a faire warrant for it

god himselfe promiseth that in their greatest extremitie hee would remember abraham

isaac and iacob and for their sakes relieue them

and how often doth he diuert his wrath onely out of the remembrance of his owne name by his name meaning his visible residence in their tabernacle and temple which were built to put his name there euen the cloud that led them out of egypt wherein resided the angell of whom god said that his name was in him
of this kind of indulgence you haue a whole chapter in ezekiel

but they did not distinguish betweene temporall and eternall wrath
it is true that the stroake that is but temporall is often kept off from the children in contemplation of their worthy parents there are many examples in the scripture but no example of any child that scaped eternall wrath out of gods regard vnto his parents
there is an example to the contrarie for christ setteth forth the rich glutton in hell torments who being there calleth abraham his father and abraham yeildeth him the name of a child and yet that childe of such a father did burne in hell fire and not he alone for christ saith that many shall come from the east and the west and sit downe with abraham isaac and iacob in the kingdome of heauen

and the children of the kingdome shall be cast out into vtter darknesse yea they shall see abraham isaac and iacob and all the prophets in the kingdome of god

and themselues thrust out
so farre is it off that gracelesse children should fare the better for their worthy parents that god vseth to exaggerate their sinne by comparing them with their parents as appeareth in the doome of iehoiakim the sonne of iosia who vnder the verie name of the sonne of iosia for being so vnlike his father

is heauily doomed and in the same forme doth god proceed against the leuites

if god were so much in loue with the children of abraham and if they failed could not supply others haply he might tolerate them notwithstanding their vnto wardlinesse as many a naturall father beareth with an vnthriftie sonne and putteth not off his naturall affection towards him because if hee doe iustice vpon him and disinherit him it is not in his power to haue another but this is not gods case you heard it proued at large in the censure of their first arrogancie therefore doth saint iohn beat them from this hold and make way in this text to the terrour of god which he would haue timely to enter into their soules

and in them hee doth warne vs neuer to presume vpon like pretence they made a parasite of gods fauour to abraham which was euer at their elbow to sooth them in their foulest sinnes but let no prerogatiue so blind vs as to make vs thinke that the sermons of repentance doe not concerne vs and wee will neuer so thinke if we thinke as we ought vpon the particulars of this text let vs then come to them and begin with the persons whereof the first is god

god is here rather intimated then expressed yet so intimated that by resoluing of the words we shall easily perceiue him to bee here for if the axe must be laid to the root of the tree there must be some bodie

to lay it and who is that but god none besides god can giue the stroke that is here threatned
men take their first rooting in god according to the maxime in him we liue moue and haue our being if naturall much more spirituall none then can root vs out of him except he haue power ouer him such power hath none besides himselfe others haue insolently threatned eradication to the church as you may reade often in the prophets but you may reade withall how the holy ghost doth scorne them and how vaine their attempts haue beene it is only for god to pronounce it sadly and effectually to performe it whereupon it followeth that the person here meant must needs be god

and god is here compared to a husbandman surueying his orchard
the scripture that euery where speaketh of god doth more vsually teach vs what he is to vs then what hee is in himselfe and describeth him rather according to his prouidence then his essence because although the later would more affect our curiositie yet the former doth worke more vpon our conscience and it is our conscience whereat the scripture doth aime it desireth rather to make vs good then wise which we shall be if we learne so to know god as we may best be brought to feare him a knowledge which the more earnestly commend vnto you because this otherwise learned age seemeth not so much as it should to be acquainted with it
but that you may the better perceiue this description of god you must obserue that of his prouidence there are two parts the first is the blessing of his creatures especially man the second is the inquirie how these creatures vse his blessings this later point concerneth my text
as then no husbandman is so carelesse as hauing planted an orchard not to looke into it and see the successe of his paines no more is god
esay will teach vs that the husbandmans discretion commeth from the lord of hosts which is wonderfull in counsell and excellent in working neither is there any perfection in man which is not much more eminent in god
wee may not then dreame that wee hold of god without account or impeachment of waste wee owe our apparence both at his court and at his audit hee taketh his times for both or not to goe from our parable the sonnes of adam haue no exemption seeing their father had none god placed him in paradise and came into paradise to suruey him and the that grew in the vineyard was surueyed by the lord thereof
and let this suffice touching the first person and the resemblance that is made of him

the second person is man
but as the description of god doth shew vs rather what god is to vs then what hee is in himselfe so in the description of man the chiefest consideration is what hee is to godward not what he is
wee haue here then to doe with not simply a man but a member of the church the law speaketh to them that are vnder the law now of a member of the church wee haue here an excellent resemblance hee is resembled to a tree bearing

fruit

the church is likened to a paradise which is full set with fruitfull trees
as god in the creation made the whole world but of a part of the whole made paradise so hath hee selected his church out of a whole masse of the sonnes of adam and calleth it his orchard and of this vineyard or orchard the members of the church are trees euery member is a tree though he be called sometimes by the name of a branch for euerie branch is potentially a tree a tree growing in a tree
you may perceiue it by the litle shoots that wee take to inoculate and many branches that bored or otherwise planted take root in the ground although while they are but branches they doe not immediately root in the ground euen so euery member of the church seeing he hath no communion with god but by the mediation of christ is but a branch yet seeing gods promises are made both to him and his

and others may spring from him he is not vnsitly compared to a tree

but it is to a tree that beareth fruit whose inward vertue manifesteth it selfe by outward workes
as a tree that sucketh nourishment from the ground spendeth part of it in sustayning it selfe and when it is sufficed therewith worketh the rest of the juice vnto fruit so should the members of the church themselues bee the better for the grace which they receiue and doe good to others also they must beare fruit

fruit is significantly expressed

for the likenesse of leaues doth often deceiue the but when the profit of the doctrine doth shew it selfe in workes then it appeares who is a sincere faithfull man and who is an hypocrite

adde hereunto that though great is the ornament of leaues yet their best commendations goeth no farther then undefined span alphabet pleasure it doth not come so farre as undefined span alphabet meat but out of the ground of paradise god made to grow euery tree that was both pleasant to the sight and good for sood and such a tree must our tree be

but euery tree by nature is a fruit tree

god that made all made no other
saint basil hath obserued it and because some trees make shew of the contrarie he giueth vs a distinction of secret and open fruit with one of which euerie tree is furnished and indeed seeing euerie tree hath seed according to his kind it hath fruit because naturally the seed is included in the fruit and followeth the condition of it being as that is either secret or open
seeing then euery tree beareth fruit to beare fruit is not enough wherefore there is another word added it must beare good fruite there are trees of the field and trees of the orchard both beare fruit but the fruit of the field tree feedeth only beasts and birds only the fruit of the yeildeth sustenance for man
there must bee some difference betweene them that are within the church and them that are without as betweene orchard and field trees the fruit of the one and the fruite of the other they without the church fructifie for the deuill and the world but the members of the church beare fruite to god and good men as

it is intimated by the vine

by the figge by the oliue vnto which trees the godly are compared
marke then that the difference betweene the trees of the field and of the orchard is not the bearing and not bearing of fruit in bearing fruit the natiue and the satiue both agree but it is good and bad fruit that doth distinguish them
and this distinction is necessarie because it is possible that trees of the orchard should become as bad as the trees of the field and why since the fall of adam they are all grafted trees and you know that a grafted tree may shoot out either out of the wild stocke or out of the sweet graft and it is a speciall care of a good husbandman to cut off still all the shoots of the stocke that the graft may prosper the better origen obserueth well wee haue inward trees a good and a bad we haue the flesh and the spirit

and saint paul telleth vs that both these haue their fruits

to beare good fruit then is to walke in the spirit and not to fulfill the deeds of the flesh here is no species of good workes set downe neither intend at this time to fall into the common place of good workes a former clause of my text gaue mee occasion to speake heretofore of them nazian zen hath a good epitome of that argument

in two words of good workes there must be varietie and plentie
but may not forget that there were two speciall trees in paradise the tree of the knowledge of good and euill and the tree of life

god forbad the one and permitted the other
theophilus patriarch of antioch giueth the reason and it is that god would haue vs captiuate our wits to his wisdome and for knowledge bee contented with so much as he doth reueale but we should spend all our time and paines in obedience and conforming our selues to gods law

therefore doth gods law and a showre of raine come in hebrew both from one root to signifie that wee should drinke it in as fruit trees doe raine to be the better for it in it is plainly called the raine of righteousnesse and of raine athanasius his obseruation is good though the substance of it be but one yet doth it yeild sustenance for diuers fruits
sure am that the scripture calleth vs trees of life trees of righteousnesse and we should bring forth fruits of the spirit which is called the fruit of sanctification haue a man neuer so much knowledge if hee goe no farther then knowledge hee can deserue no better a name then the deuill hath who from his knowledge is called daemon

but the scripture denominateth a good man from his vertue chasidh

but there remayneth one note more which theophylact maketh vpon this description hee saith not euery tree which hath not borne but euery tree which is not bearing for wee must alwayes bee bearing fruit though the other day thou wert mercifull if to day thou be an extortioner thou shalt not goe for a good tree and god himselfe doth iustifie this doctrine telling vs that all the righteousnesse of an vnconstant good man shall be forgotten those that be planted in the

house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god

they shall still bring forth fruit in their old age they shall be sat and well liking
the tree described psal
and reuel

confirme this truth

to shut vp this description of a member of the church out of it we must learne these few lessons
first god expecteth to behold in vs rather our workes then his owne what we yeild then what wee receiue and our care must be rather to doe our duties then boast of our gifts seeing for those not these we are called to an account
secondly we must beare fruit according to our kind men doe not gather grapes of thornes nor figges of thistles it is vnnaturall for vines to beare hawes or burres wee betray our selues rather to bee in then of the church if we beare such fruit and though wee cannot bee challenged for being idle yet shall wee be for being ill imployed
if to beare fruit were enough the case of the wicked would bee better then that of the godly for as wild trees commonly beare greater burthens then the grafted or planted you know aesops reason for it so doe the wicked commonly abound in workes more then the good
but god considereth not how many but how good yea the more of euill workes the worse so that when we come to cast vp our account wee must consider not so much the number as the qualitie of them remembring to write vpon the euill vanity of vanities all is but vanity and vexation of spirit for what fruite is there in those things whereof we shall be then ashamed wee must desire to beare that fruit which may abound to our accompt

and so haue deliuered vnto you so much of my text as concerneth the persons speaking of them so farre as haue beene occasioned by their resemblances

come now to the iudgement whereof wee must consider first the cause where we shall see that god obserueth his owne law and cutteth vp no tree in this siege that his vengeance layeth to his church but such as are no fruit trees
it is a clause in the couenant

that as god maketh vs fruit trees so we should beare good fruits if we faile he is no longer tied to continue vs trees or performe vnto vs the blessing sanction of his law

his iustice requireth that hee make good the second sanction which curseth sinners and come to eradication

but to open this cause a little fuller wee must obserue that gods dealing with men though it bee acted by his power yet it is ordered by his iustice neither doth he vse his power vntill he haue examined our deserts this is vndoubtedly true in plagues though not in blessings
in blessing he preuenteth vs but he neuer striketh vntill he bee pronoked therefore the scripture seldome mentioneth any iudgement of god but it prefaceth it with some cause thereof first giuen by man you may reade it in the doome of adam the old world sodome

and israel in this place the not bearing of good fruit is expressed as the cause of the iudgement which followeth the not bearing say of good fruit
for whereas the commandements of god are affirmatiue or negatiue the affirmatiue are those for which our faculties were giuen

vs the performing of the negatiue are but with standings of such impediments as hinder vs therein adde hereunto that the affirmatiue is the measure of the negatiue so that wee know not how farre we must withstand but by knowing how much we are bound to doe moreouer the deuill that hee might haue vs at leasure to doe what wee should not maketh vs neglect to doe what we should
because then we should striue to the heighth of vertue for homo est animal officiosum man is made for vertuous action and his commendations is well doing and doing ill is but a necessarie consequent of not doing well as appeareth by the parable of the vncleane spirit it is impossible for a man to be idle it would imply a contradiction to the definition of the soule therefore the transgression of the affirmatiue commandements are here called in question they are alleadged for the cause of iudgement

and if be so punished what is due to commissions it is fulgentius his collection
if barrennesse burne in hell what shall wickednesse seele the deeper men goe in sinnes the greater is the account they haue to giue

but lest men should not well conceiue this cause wee must learne of saint augustine that there is a double good fruit of grace and of repentance we should indeed principally take heed of omissions and bee filled with the fruits of righteousnesse but if insteed of those good fruits we fall into sinnes of commission there is a second good worke wherewith we must relieue ourselues a worke of repentance in the defect of the first this second must succeed
though god might by the law punish vs for want of the first yet from the gospel wee haue this comfort that he will not punish if we doe the second
and indeed this being a sermon of the gospel supposeth vs to want the first good fruit and challengeth vs that we doe not supply the second
the world is very busie in seeking out the cause why so many run into hell doubt not but they which with sobrietie enter the sanctuarie of god may discerne a higher ground of gods iudgements but let no wicked man deceiue himselfe if hee will take the paines but to studie himselfe he shall find that himselfe is the cause of his owne ruine wittingly and willingly refusing to beare that good fruit that should grow vpon such a tree as he is vouchsafed to be barren not only according to the law but also to the gospel and then what remaineth but if the cause bee found in him the iudgement one day light on him and so from the cause come to the iudgement whereof told you there are two parts

as our sinnes are compounded of omissions and commissions so is our iudgement either priuatiue or positiue there is some good which we should doe but we doe not and therefore there is some good which we might haue whereof we misse there is some euill we should not doe but we doe it and therefore there is some euill which we might scape and yet we shall feele it the omission goeth before the commission in sinne so doth the priuatiue before the positiue part in

iudgement
begin therefore with the priuatiue figured by the laying of the axe vnto the root and cutting vp of the tree what is the axe

saith nazianzene hee answereth that which cutteth off an vncurable person though god hath done what was fit for his recouerte which you may expound by that of the poet cuncta prius tentanda sed immedicabile vnlnus ense recidendum est when milder physicke will doe no good we must come to searing and cutting off a rotten member
after gods complaint what could haue done for my vine which haue not done the next newes we heare is the desolution of the vine and the instrument of desolation is the axe
by the axe some vnderstand gods owne hand some the armie of the romans both say true for both did concurre gods hand intelligibly and the romans sensibly but if we parallel this place with that in esay

it seemeth more proper to vnderstand the romans here
for the axe is an instrument and the instrument is distinct from the efficient
but howsoeuer the word giueth vs to vnderstand that god wanteth not meanes to execute his vengeance the scripture obserueth varietie of them sometimes his bow and arrowes sometimes his sword sometimes his hammer but here his axe as best fitting an husbandman that hath to doe with barren trees the axe is laid to the root of such trees

what is meant by the root there is some question to passe by the tropologicall interpretations of the word the literall is vnderstood by some to note abraham by other some christ
and indeed abraham is immediatly meant as you may gather out of saint paul

if the root bee holy and hee is tearmed the father of the faithfull but mediately christ is meant who is the root of that root and therefore doth he make all the faithfull branches of himselfe who is their vine

but wherefore is the axe layed to this root to cut it vp
the axe hath two vses the one to prune the other to cut vp if a tree beare not so much fruit as it should then it is enough to prune away the rotten the watrie branches but if it beare none then cut it vp for the tree that doth no good will doe a great deale of hurt it maketh the ground barren

not only by taking vp the roome of a fruitfull tree but by hurting aboue ground and hurting vnder ground it keepeth off the comfortable sunne from better plants that is the mischiefe that commeth from the barren trees boughes besides which there is another mischiefe that commeth from his roots for they sucke away the iuice that should feed better trees therefore must the axe be put to them not only to the branch but also to the root
behold the image of gods lesser his greater iudgments if our deuotion be cold god correcteth vs by restrayning our luxuriant affections and cutting off our wastfull lusts hee pincheth vs in things temporall that wee may haue the more appetite to things eternall but if our deuotion be none at all he will no longer indure vs to be the bane of others
but wee must not mistake it is not meant that the root shall bee cut vp but the tree shall bee cut from the root the fruitlesse branches

should bee cut off from the cognation which they haue with abraham

abraham shall continue a root still you heard that proued in my last sermon much more shall christ continue a root without whom no tree can bee
but the wicked shall take no root in them they shall not be partakers of these roots either sweetnesse or fatnesse they were trees planted in gods orchard the choicest of grounds the best manured on which the husbandman bestoweth his greatest care but they are not suffered to abide there any longer
to speake it plainly see what they were and iudge thereby what it is to bee cut off

it is to be depriued of god our father christ our sauiour the holy ghost our comforter the protection of angels the communion of saints the inheritance of heauen a wofull case to indure such losse
and yet this is the losse which they endure which haue beene members of the church and are cut off infidels as well as christians are shut out of heauen yet they that had meanes shall bee more afflicted with the losse then they which neuer had meanes shall bee afflicted with the want of heauen for miserum est fuisse foelicem it is a double woe to haue beene happie
hee that is borne poore is not so sensible of pouertie as he that of rich is become poore neither is he so sensible of sicknesse that was neuer well as hee that hath long enioyed his health want is not so bitter as losse this we must consider as the chiefest part of the trees punishment which beareth not good fruit

it is the chiefest but not the only part one mischiefe commeth not alone there is another part which is more feared before hand though when wee are in it it is lesse felt and yet the sense thereof must needs be very painfull the word importeth as much the word is fire

the curious wits of the schoolemen misled by their bad geographie

and worse historiographie haue deliuered a great deale of vngrounded stuffe concerning the nature and place of this sire but wee shall doe well to follow the sobrietie of the fathers greeke and latin touching hell fire what kind it is of and where in what region of the earth
thinke no man can tell except hee to whom god will bee pleased to reueale it saith austine and chrysostome we must not be curious to know where is the place of hell fire but studie rather how is auoid it
only let vs learne of nazianzen that there is a double vse of fire for therewith undefined span alphabet men are doomed undefined span alphabet or they are purified
we haue not now to doe with the purgatiue but with the correctiue vse of fire and seeing that fire is the symbol of plagning we must from our fire learne two properties of fire it searcheth most and spareth least it leaueth no part vnseized vpon and looke whereon it seizeth it afflicteth to the vttermost which nabuchadnezer knew that chose that wherewith to torment the seruants of god yea god himselfe doth shew who therewith destroyed sodome and gomorra certainly in the valley of hinnom it was so dreadfull that the holy ghost was pleased to vse it as a symbole of the tortures of hell which

leaue no part of the tormented vnpained and paineth euery part extreamely only when we looke vpon our fire wee must obserue two differences betweene that and the fire of hell
first hell fire goeth farre beyond it in degree well may the torments be like they are not equall
secondly they are vnlike in durance for ours consumeth and is consumed but hell fire neither wasteth his fuell nor is wasted it selfe both are euerlasting so that let ours afflict neuer so painfully

it cannot afflict long but hee that is in hell fire endureth an euerliuing death
the tree that growes in the field growes for fuell and it is no wonder to see it proue so but a heauie thing it is for a tree to to become fuell that grew to beare fruit but in this case the case of a barren fruit tree is worse then a tree of the field because a tree of the field may bee cut downe not for fuell but for building but fruit trees are not fit for building and nature hath made this their ineptnesse a priuiledge against the axe when for the building of stately palaces the trees of the field goe downe they stand and are not cut downe vntill they giue fruit and then they are cut downe only for fuell for they are good for nothing else
ezechiel hath a whole chapter of it wherein as in a glasse wee may behold the condition of a sinner

if you put these parts of the iudgement together you may easily perceiue that they amount to a totall a finall eradication it is totall for if a tree bee cut vp by the roots there is no hope of the branches because the branches haue no life but deriuatiue from the root cut a tree as close to the root as you will iob will tell you there remayneth still hope of him but it is past hope when the root is dead

as the iudgement is totall so it is finall

we neuer heard of the second grasting of a tree certainly not of these trees the parable of the foolish virgins sheweth that there is no getting in when the doores be shut and that there is no passage from hell to heauen

abraham telleth the rich glutton burning in those flames

but of this undefined span alphabet reprobation of and bill of diuorce giuen to to the iewes spake enough when spake of that which they were willed to flie which in former words of this sermon is called wrath to come wherefore forbeare to enlarge this point any farther only wishing vncurable impenitents herein to behold what a feare full thing it is to sall into the hands of the liuing god
you haue heard of the persons and the iudgement that the one of them doth denounce against the other

but the iudgement is not onely threatned but threatned that it shall come vppon them speedily and ouertake them vniuersally the speed is intimated in the first word now now is the axe laid to the roote of the tree all the words are present now is put now is cut which carrie with them an emphasis and hasten the repentance of the hearer
before it was calied wrath to come least therefore they should put it farre from them as the wicked in amos and the bad seruant in the gospel and grow atheisticall scoffers as some doe in esay and others


peter he is instant wiih them and proposeth this iudgement as imminent

but this seemeth to be a paradox iohn was the harbinger of christ and with christ began the kingdome of grace and how doth he then make it the time of iudgement so terrible a iudgement we must therefore obserue that god neuer did any publike remarkable good to magnifie his mercie but he did withall shew the world some notable spectacle of his wrath therein to magnifie his iustice when noah was saued the world was drowned and fiue cities burnt when lot was deliuered how were the egyptians destroyed when israel was set free and when the gentiles were receiued into the church what a desolation did hee bring vpon the iewes god will haue feare and hope still to liue in the hearts of the sonnes of men

adde hereunto that christs comming is the last offer of grace both to iewes and gentiles he that refuseth now shall neuer speed marke this point pressed by the apostles both to the iewes and to the gentiles this is the reason why the baptist christ his apostles beginne their preaching with repent

this is as the greatest so the last manuring the tree that proueth not now must needs downe needs into the fire

but is not god alwayes putting the axe to the tree yea verily he maketh daily spectacles of them but to whole nations he putteth not the axe euery day hee forbeareth them vntill they haue filled vp the measure of their sinne but if they abuse his patience and longsuffering whereby hee laboureth to draw them to repentance then they shall find that they haue treasured vnto themselues wrath against the day of wrath

the axe shall goe vnto the root
but in this iam there are two other remarkable things the one is noted by saint ambrose

hence learne how gracious god is that euen when he threatens irefully yet leaues place for mercie
it is not with god as it is with men men cannot checke their passions nor hold their stroakes god can and he leaueth it to our choice whether he shall strike or no for to that end doth he forewarne and his messengers so temper their speech as if they would haue vs feare they would not haue vs despaire
the axe saith iohn is layed to he doth not say it is entred into the roots
the second is noted by saint chrysostome a man would thinke that the iudgement being so neare the time were too short to beare any fruit

but the fruit of rationall trees is not such as that of irrationall it needs not so long time to ripen be willing and by and by thou maist be said to fructifie
wherefore we must not put off from day to day when will we repent if not when the stroke is at hand punishments worke the more the more they are imminent on themon whom they will worke at all let vs bee sure that if wee will not turne god hath whet his sword bent his bow prepared the instruments of death when the axe is cutting thou shalt call and will not heare saith wisdome
therefore wee must take aduantage of our iam our now euery man must for the iudgement is denounced vniuersally

euery tree that beareth not good fruit though he be a child of abraham
esay doth excellently amplifie this figuratiuely saint paul to the corinthians and saint iohn in the reuelation expresseth it plainly there is no prerogatiue no respect of persons euery barren tree shall beare his punishment although there be difference betweene fruit trees in regard of quantitie yet fruit of the same qualitie will bee expected of all

neither may we thinke that the eradication did seize vpon euery particular saint paul hath taught the contrarie there were amongst them remainders of grace but their state perished irrecouerably and thinke they are much deceiued that thinke they shall euer become a nation againe
from the beginning of the gospel god hath euermore as they became christians mingled them with the gentiles and so thinke will doe vnto the worlds end

but to leaue them and come to ourselues
this sermon was preached vnto the iewes this iudgement was denounced against them but our sauiour christ hath giuen vs a good obseruation when they told him of certaine persons

thinke you saith hee that these were the only sinners nay tell you that except you repent you shall likewise perish
repentance then concerneth vs no lesse then them and here is a good motiue vnto repentance to thinke on these things how great an euill it is to bee excluded heauen what a miserable thing it is to burne in hell it is a sure way saith prosper to make a man renounce all vice to refraine all allurements of the flesh specially if we adde hereunto this humilitie not to presume of any good fruit excepting that of iesus christ that will profit vs if we want our owne or rather that also prositeth no man in whom it doth not worke some of his owne
when saint iohn had ended this sermon the chapter goeth on and telleth vs that many came to him saying master what shall we doe

although saith chrysostome a wicked man will not be reclaimed no not with plagues yet a good man except hee feare shall perish therefore denunciations that profit not the wicked doe notwithstanding discouer the difference that is betweene the good and bad
saint iohn had diuers kinds of auditors his sermon did good to some though to othersome it did no good the scribes and pharisees were none of them that asked what shall wee doe the publicans and souldiers the common people were euery one of them had his question and receiued his answere
you perceiue whom wish you like in these dayes so like those of noah and lot that we knew those things that belong vnto our peace the axe hath beene often put to our branches if we profit it shall not come to our root but it will not faile to strike as deepe as the root if wee proue not more fruitfull for the pruning of the branches let vs inquire into our selues before god make his inquirie and prouide that we be not found fruitlesse lest

we that haue the honour to be grafted in their steed that are broken off for like sinne be subiect to the like doome both of losse and paine

end with saint ambrose words
christ came and could find no fruit in the iewes would hee might find some in vs
let vs pray the good

husbandman that he would mediate for vs that space and grace may be bestowed vpon vs that the sentence may be respired and we againe manured lest we also proue fruitlesse and be vsed as vnfruitfull trees

lord who only canst correct our nature and dispose our hearts let the diew of thy grace so inable vs and thy assistance so stili guide vs that we may so fructifie in this paradise of grace that we may be transplanted into the paradise of glorie there to beare the fruit of holinesse and reape the fruit of happinesse for euer
amen

verse

and shall not god auenge his owne elect which crie day and night vnto him though he beare long with them
tell you that he will auenge them speedily neuerthelesse when the sonne of man commeth shall he find faith on earth

this scripture doth apply a storie which is reported immediatly before
the storie setteth before vs the proceeding of an vniust iudge as a glasse wherein wee are to behold the dealing of our most righteous god
the iudge though hee had no conscience was ouercome by importunitie and at length relieued a poore widdow against her oppressor only that he might rid himselfe of a suitor which would not be said nay so god though he forbeare long will in due time repay the persecutors of his suppliant church if her deuotion neuer giue him ouer
this wee are taught in the words that now haue read vnto you
more distinctly to breake vp this application will obserue therein argumentum and argumentationem what is affirmed and how it is inferred
that which is affirmed is in a word this the religious deuotion of the militant church is very powerfull but is not very lasting
the church is here called the elect of god but we haue to doe with no more of them then are on earth that limitation is in the end of my text wherefore no more of the church is here mentioned then that which is militant

the church being militant is made deuout by the crosse the elect therein are undefined span alphabet being conscious to themselues of their owne weaknesse they call for helpe against their aduersaries
the text telleth vs to whom and how they call vnto him that is best able and most willing vnto god and to him they call earnestly for they crie and constantly for they cry day and night
such is the religious deuotion of the church militant

and such deuotion is powerfull marke with whom and to what effect
it is powerfull with him to whom the church prayeth it preuailes with god
and the effect to which it preuaileth is vindicatio cum vindictà the deliuerance of the church to the vtter confusion of her foes
god will auenge his elect
but yet in this auenging festinat lentè god maketh no more haste then good speed for he forbeareth long and yet he stayeth not so long as to come too late hee will auenge speedily
the deuotion is powerfull
but it is not very lasting the rest of the text will teach that neuerthelesse though deuotion steed vs so much yet become wee most lither when we should ply our helpe most
and here marke first how the word is changed
before our deuotion was called crying here it is called faith
there is good reason for the change for prayer if it be religious is oratio fidei it is endited by and vttered from our saith
this crying faith or faithfull crie hath a wayning the nearer the world is to an end the older it groweth and becommeth weaker
the end of the world is here meant by the comming of the sonne of man at that time the dotage shall call it or rather death of this deuotion shall appeare for it shall be sought for then but it will not then bee found there will bee then found no such praying as is powerfully deuout
these things shall you find in that which is affirmed
after that you must see how they are inferred and we shall find that the inference is made strangely but strongly
strangly for whereas god should be a patterne to the best of men here one of the worst of men is made a paterne vnto god
and that is strange
but yet the conclusion is strong for if there be any sparkle of compassion in stonie hearted man how tender are the bowels of our most gracious father whatsoeuer good the best of men will doe god will doe the same insinitely much more
you haue the contents of my text what remayneth but that wee beseech god that may cleere them so plainly and you so religiously entertaine them that whereas the ends of the world are hastening vpon vs our languishing deuotion may so be quickned that we may come with boldnesse to the throne of grace obtaine mercie and find grace to helpe in all our time of need

the first particular which pointed out was the title that is here giuen to the church it is here called gods owne elect which is all one

in the originall tongue with ecclesia the things as well as the words haue a neere cognation
and if you looke vpon them well they are though a short yet a full definition of the church for the church doth consist of a number of persons exempt from the common condition of men and none can so exempt them but only god

more plainly
men by the common condition of their nature since the fall are children of wrath a masse of perdition they are without god without christ without the spirit without the couenant without hope without all true life
to be elected is to be taken not only out of the number but out of the condition of such wretched men to be made vessels of mercie a new lumpe vnto the lord to be admitted into gods house to bee incorporated into christs bodie to be possessed of the holy ghost to be made parties to gods couenant partakers of the communion of saints and heires of euerlasting life
this is the exemption or election here remembred
and such an exemption such an election none can make but god
god only can forgiue sinnes release punishments giue grace adopt for sonnes finally doe whatsoeuer was before exprest in the exemption euerie branch is a royall prerogatiue of the king of heauen

but must not omit to obserue vnto you that if gods election speake not of the eternall decree but the manifestation thereof in the church militant there are two acts
the first is the admission of persons into the outward congregation and vnto the sacramentall obsignation which is nothing else but the outward profession of man that he is a partie to the couenant of god

and so moses telleth the israelites that god hath chosen them to be his peculiar people which is no more then that god hath giuen them his law which he had not done to euery nation

saint paul addeth more particulars of this kind and in this respect giueth the name of elect to whole churches of the gentiles
but besides this outward there is an inward act of election and that is the operation of the holy ghost giuing vnto vs spirituall wisdome and holinesse making vs gods children and members of the mysticall bodie of christ
and that church which wee beleeue in the creed is partaker of both these acts of election aswell the inward as the outward and these latter are electi ex electis whom christ doth designe when he saith in the gospel many are called but few are chosen
because there are none in this world actually of the church inuisible but those that are in the visible and men cannot distinguish betweene the persons that partake either only one or both of the acts of election therefore in my text we will take the definition of a church in the widest sense according to the rule of charitie which the scripture obserues although the power of denotion doth properly concerne the whole visible bodie by reason of the better part thereof those which are aswell inwardly as outwardly of the church

the vse that wee must make of this definition of the church is by the first word to be remembred of our prerogatiue if we doe partake

only the outward act of election how much are we better then the heathen that know not the true god nor the sauiour of the world iesus christ and are destitute of all those meanes by which they may be saued but if looking into our heart wee find sauing grace there for gods spirit doth witnesse vnto our spirit that wee are the children of god when we contemplate in our selues this second act of election we haue reason to thinke our prerogatiue much more improued by how much an inward is better then an outward iew the circumcision of the spirit better then the circumcision of the flesh to be baptized with the spirit better then to be baptized with water to eate panem dominum eate the flesh and drinke the bloud of christ better then to eate only and drinke only sacramentall bread and wine finally to be a doer is better then to be a hearer of gods word the farther christians goe beyond christians in these gifts the better must they thinke their state and these spirituall differences betweene man and man better then whatsoeuer other differences there may be found betweene them
although the world vseth to bee little sensible of this greater good but most sensible of the lesser wealth honour wherein euerie man thinketh it a great matter to bee aduanced aboue his neighbours

when wee looke vpon the second word in the definition of the church that is god wee see to whom wee are beholding for our aduancement and to whom wee must giue the glorie of it the glory of the first act of election dauid concludes the remembrance thereof with prayse yee the lord

and of the second act also the glorie must be giuen vnto him for so doe the angels the beasts the elders after they haue mentioned it

reuel

if the question be moued quit te discreuit who hath differenced thee our best answere will bee thanke god through iesus christ our lord and let him that glorieth glorie in the lord

told you haue not to doe with the whole church but with that part which is militant for such are the elect which are on the earth heauen is the place for our crowne earth for our crosse where michael and the dragon stroue there must their angels striue also and the heele of the womans seed must bee bruised in the same place where it must breake the serpents head
the fathers doe wittily obserue that the church came out of christs side when he died as eue out of adam when he slept now out of christs side when it was pierced issued water and bloud monuments of our two sacraments which remember vs that we must drinke of the same cup whereof christ dranke and be partakers of the same baptisme wherewith he was baptized euery one must take vp his owne crosse and follow his crucified sauiour
saint austine is resolute

si ecclesia vera est ipsa est quae persecutionem patitur we are bastards and no sonnes if wee suffer not for christ and suffer we cannot but on earth for when wee part from the earth wee part from our enemies the flesh the world and the deuill flesh and bloud cannot enter into heauen satan is cast out thence and

the world shall then bee vnto vs as if it were not therefore the church peregrinam agit in terris she is here a pilgrim here she is like the desolate widdow here shee grieueth for the wickednesse of the world and because she is not alike wicked with them therefore doth the world implacably worke her woe
read this dayes epistle

in this militancie of the church the elect of god become undefined span alphabet they find that they need and they seeke for helpe the word implieth asmuch the church is compared vnto a doue for her simplicitie and for her meeknesse shee is compared vnto a lambe as a doue she is nothing suspicious for vt quisque est vir optimus ita difficillimè credit alios esse improbos good men looke to find plaine dealing as themselues deale plainly
as a lambe the church is as apt to be a prey as shee is not apt to prey vpon any shee is a fit subiect for the shearer and the slaughterer though it selfe be harmelesse and vsefull
looke vpon the enemies of the church they are the serpent and the lion
the serpent is full of fraud fraud which circumuenteth our wits with sophistrie and transporteth our affections with vanitie coloured and blanched with a shew of truth and good
the lion is full of crueltie and delighteth in bloud watchfull vpon all opportunities and neuer giuing ouer the least aduantage
and the instruments of the serpent and the lion meane wicked men are serpentine and deceitfully compassing their owne end and spending their power only in crueltie
this hath beene the cariage of the enemies of the church euer since god put enmitie betweene the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent
but it was neuer more remarkable then in popish equiuocation and that which they call their holy inquisition the very markes of the beast and by them they make their nearest approaches to that father of ls and that ancient murderer sure am they haue cut the heart strings of all both ciuill and ecclesiasticall true policie

the church being thus besteed when from her enemies she reflects her eyes vpon her selfe findeth her owne inabilite her need of succour and as the apostles in their perill so she in hers cals for helpe helpe lord or else we perish so said they so saith shee
and my text telleth vs that she hath recourse vnto god

lift mine eyes vnto the hils saith dauid from whence commeth my helpe our helpe standeth in the name of the lord who hath made heauen and earth

and god is our refuge and strength a very present helpe in trouble and see how full the helpe is he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high

shall abide vnder the shadow of the almightie the whole psalme is an excellent commendation of the churches choice but specially that verse

thou shalt tread vpon the lion and the adder the yong lion and the dragon shalt thou trample vnder feet though we be as simple as doues yet god is able to make vs as wise as serpents and hee will make vs confident as lions though of our selues wee be as meeke as lambes
and why we haue a serpent to oppose vnto a serpent euen him that was figured by the serpent whom moses lifted vp christ the wisdome of god

him we haue to oppose to the groueling serpent that feedeth vpon earth and earthly men
if you be stung by this latter serpent doe but looke to the former and you shall presently bee healed for hee is able to take that craftie one in his owne wilinesse
wee haue a lion to oppose vnto a lion the lion of the tribe of iuda to the roaring lion and out of the eater he can draw meate by death he ouercame him that had the power of death and being the stronger rifled that strong mans house so that we may well say if god bee with vs who can bee against vs if we relie vpon his wisdome wee shall neuer be circumuented neither shall we be opprest if we relie vpon his power therefore the church doth well to make her prayer vnto him

but how doth she pray first feruently for she cries
in the ceremoniall law incensio went before ascensio the sacrifice was set on fire before it yeilded an odour of sweet smell ascending vnto god besides the siluer trumpets sounded aloud with varietie of other musicke while the sacrifice was burning
these were but types whereof the morall was that we must not be lither in deuotion but expresse a feruencie therein
and we haue a good precedent in our sauiour christ who prayed with strong cries

king dauid doth expresse his earnestnesse by many sit similies of parched ground that gapes wide for the showres of raine

of a chased hart that breatheth and brayeth after the water brookes

of the passions of louers which are very violent and god liketh such deuotion for sitit sitiri he longeth to be longed after

but we must remember that there is clamor cordis oris a crying of the heart and the mouth and as god is specially inspector so is he also auditor cordis as his eyes are specially vpon our hearts so are his eares open thereunto

non vox sed votum non cordula musica sed cor non clamans sed amans cantat in aure dei

god doth best vnderstand and accept the sighes and groanes of our spirit which cannot be exprest
and yet ex abundantia cordis os loquitur the sire that is in the heart will not be supprest a vehement passion will make a vehement

but when we crie we doe it to manifest the earnestnesse of our affections and extremitie of our distresse not to rowse god as if he could not otherwise heare that were a conceit fit for the worshippers of baal

whom elias scoffes for it for quibus arterijs opus si pro sono audiamur if the crie of the voice were the measure of deuotion he that hath the most stentorean voice should be most deuout but we must know that no crie of the lips can ascend higher towards god then it is carried vp by the feruencie of the heart though the seruencie of the heart can ascend vnto god though the tongue bee mute for god said to moses why cryest thou when hee spake neuer a word
whether wee pray only with the heart or also with the voice we must be remembred by this practice of the church

to be earneest therein earnest in our soliloquies when wee enter into our closet much more when we are mustered in the holy assemblies must our deuotion offer a gratefull violence vnto god according to that good paterne which we haue psal

the church prayeth earnestly not only so shee prayeth constantly also she cryeth day and night
the foure beasts in the reuelation day and night cease not saying holy holy holy lord god almightie which is the practice of the triumphant church
moses was willed to make all things according to the patterne that was she wed him in the mount therefore he instituted that the sacrifices should burne day and night of the day there is no question and it is put out of all question concerning the night also by those words in the psalme behold

blesse yee the lord all yee seruants of the lord which by night stand in the house of the lord

and that phrase which we meete withall often in the scripture of keeping gods watches
the new testament should herein answere the old and wee are willed therein to pray continually

the diuines haue a rule precepta affirmatiua tenent semper sed non ad semper the habits of vertue must euer bee in vs but wee must performe the acts when we haue iust occasion certaine times we must appoint our selues for prayer not only in the day but also in the night so did dauid he remembreth it often and no doubt but others did it aswell as he for the church speaketh thus in esay

with my soule haue desired thee in the night with my spirit within me will seeke thee early
christ spent nights in prayer

and paul and silas prayed and sang prayses vnto god at midnight
and the canonicall houres which are mentioned in the old liturgies were distributed aswell through the night as through the day
to say nothing of the vigils at solemne times
but so much of the publike old deuotion which was vsed in the night long since degenerated and is out of vse euen in the church of rome as bellarmine confesseth though priuately men may pray at all houres and no doubt but many doe aswell in the night as in the day

some not contented with that limitation of affirmatiue precepts to congruous time do mingle our meditations with our actions so saint ambrose clamant opera tua clamat sides clamat affectus

clamat passiones clamat sanguis whatsoeuer good wee doe or crosse wee suffer patiently that is a reall prayer

but to let passe these obseruations which may haue their good vse as may that also which vnderstandeth prosperitie by day and aduersitie by night and telleth vs that we must pray in whatsoeuer state wee are will obserue vnto you that which is more proper and profitable and which will shew you that indeed the church militant doth crie day and night take the words as strictly as you can

obserue then that a man prayeth many wayes
first in his owne person as dauid did who professeth of himselfe that in his aduersitie he gaue himselfe vnto prayer wee haue his practice in the psalmes and we haue christs not only practice but precept watch and pray yea

and direction too when thou prayest enter into thy chamber finally

this dutie is made a part of our catechisme no man therefore should be ignorant of it no man should neglect it

secondly we pray when any member of the church doth pray for christ hath taught euery man to say our father so to include others aswell as himselfe euen all that are members of the same bodie so singuli orant pro omnibus

omnes orant pro singulis euerie man prayeth for all the church and all the church doth pray for euery man
and this is no small part of the communion of saints which wee beleeue in our creed for god will that oratio bee insigne charitatis that out prayer be a perpetuall badge of our mutuall charitie

thirdly euery man prayeth when the minister serueth god he doth not only pray for vs but we also pray in him marke the forme of his words they are all plurall we confesse wee beseech wee pray he is the minister of the church and it is the whole churches deuotion that he presenteth vnto god

fourthly whether we pray or other members of the church or the minister wee must obserue that in all these prayers there is something transient and something permanent the act is transient the memoriall is permanent

learne this out of salomons dedicatorie let these my words wherewith haue made supplication before the lord be nigh vnto the lord our god day and night but you will say this is but a wish reade the beginning of the next chapter and you shall see that there god granted it

and the angell told cornelius that his prayers were come vp for a memoriall before the lord

fiftly the church triumphant prayeth for the militant in generall as not ignorant of the condition out of which it selfe is come and out of which it wisheth the militant freed as appeares by that voice of the soules vnder the altar their crying loud voice which saith

how long lord holy and true doest thou not iudge and auenge our bloud on them that dwell in the earth this is piè credibile wee may defend it without any offence to pietie
but that which the church of rome buildeth hereon the innocation of saints because they make intercession we may not admit it trencheth too much vpon diuine attributes and hath too much cognation with their doctrine of transubstantiation therein they giue as it were an vbiquitie vnto christs bodie and here to the soules of the saints
but will not trouble you with controuersies neither is that point so naturall to this text only take this item that out of the generall intercession of the saints for vs wee can neuer gather our particuar inuocation of them no nor generall neither

finally our sauiour christ doth only put sweete odours into our prayers that they may come acceptable vnto god

but also himselfe maketh perpetuall intercession for vs vnto him his bloud cryeth better things then doth the bloud of abel

put now all these together christ the head his bodie the church that part which is triumphant that which is militant all the members all the ministers thereof you cannot doubt but the elect do pray day and night

but euery man in his owne case must remember a good obseruation of saint chrysostomes that oratio propria our owne prayers make all the other prayers vsefull vnto vs they auaile for vs by way of impetration but if wee desire to be accepted of god wee must contribute our owne deuotion with theirs for they doe not pray to make vs idle but to supply the interrupting of our prayers which is occasioned by our honest vocation or necessarie refreshing during which time we need not doubt but that we are remembred aswell to god as of god

this constancie of prayer fauoureth not the euchites who turned all pietie into prayer as if there were nothing else to bee done the church hath long since branded them and many of the friers may goe for their cousin germans

neither doth it fauour the heathenish battologie which christ condemneth

saint austin helpeth vs out with a distincton absit ab oratione multa locutio sed non desit multa precatio si fernens perseuerat intensio christ forbiddeh bare but hee doth not condemne pray as long as you will so your heart pray as well as your tongue

put now together the persons and the deuotion and then wee see the elect must pray or else they shall not haue what god doth purpose them for as christ saith aske and you shall haue so saint iames saith you haue not because you aske not
how absurd then are they that make this prophane collection am elected therefore it skilleth not whether serue god thou vaine man he that electeth to the end electeth to the meanes yea the election mentioned in my text is vnto this seruice for when thou art elected into the church thou art elected to be a priest thy person is elected to be a temple and prayer is that sacrifice which euery man must offer in that house of prayer
can any man bee more elect then christ was and yet the gospel teacheth that hee sought for all things vnto god by prayer yea in our owne case when he was in an agonie he prayed most earnestly most constantly

but how can wee doubt of this that the elect must pray whereas it is most true that no prayers are acceptable vnto god but those that come from the elect

for god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doth his will him hee heareth the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord saith salomon but the prayer of the righteous is his delight
there is a quarrell betweene vs and the church of rome

whether undefined span alphabet those things which god offereth vnto vs doe worke ex opere operato produce their effects out of their inherent or adherent efficacies but wee are both agreed that undefined span alphabet those things which we tender vnto god are accepted of god ex opere operantis according as the person is religiously disposed in acting them wherefore we must wash our hands in innocencie and so compasse the altar of god and pray as beseemeth the elect in faith

hope and charitie

haue dwelt long enough vpon the nature of deuotion let vs come at length vnto the power thereof told you that the religious deuotion of gods elect is very powerfull saint iames telleth vs that it is undefined span alphabet

very effectuall a little before my text wee reade that it will undefined span alphabet bring vnder those things which it hath to doe withall
in law it is figured in isha

that is ignitio or a fierie thing which you know is piercing and so preualent
chrysostome saith it is undefined span alphabet it is defensiue it is offensiue it hath in it all power requisite for preseruation of our selues and confusion of our enemies hee that can doe nothing if hee can pray can doe all things neither can any thing conquer him that can be vigilant and feruent in prayer

but to come closer to my text that sheweth vs with whom it preuayleth euen with him to whom the church doth pray that is with god
we reade that iacobs name was changed into israel to signifie a prince with god or as the angell himselfe openeth it one that hath preuailed with god and so by gods power shall preuaile with men but marke the reason of this was because of his importunitie in prayer for the text saith

he wrastled with the angell and though the angell desired yet hee would not let him goe till that the angell gaue him a blessing and the blessing was this name israel a monument of the efficacie of prayer

god in his iust indignation was readie to destroy all israel

formaking and worshipping the golden calfe moses set vpon him with prayer god said to him let me alone moses would not god was saine to yeild and pardon his people

aaron made the like experiment wrath was gone out from god aaron made haste with his censor and stood betweene the liuing and the dead and presently gods wrath was quenched

and did not god command the punishing angell to sheath his sword so soone as dauid sacrificed in the threshing flowre of areunah and for a perpetuall monument of that preualent prayer consecrated that place for the seat of his temple which was to bee according to gods promise made to salomons dedicatorie a house of prayer
that wee haue not a second floud to drowne this world that is as sinfull as the former that the seasons of the yeare haue continued so long

winter summer haruest wee owe it vnto the powerfulnesse of prayer for noah sacrificed vnto god and god promised it should bee so
but beyond all goeth the efficacie of christs sacrifice vpon the crosse intercession at the right hand of god which wrought the redemption of man and doth continually preserue and propagate the church if there were nothing else this sheweth abundantly how powerfull prayer is with god and the power which our prayers haue with him we are beholding for it vnto this they preuaile with god only through iosus christ our lord

but wee must not mistake this preualencie of our prayer is not physicall but morall god is not forced by vs against his will but out of his good will he yeildeth vnto vs as parents vse to be ouercome by the petitions of their children

therefore is the sacrifice of god in the law said to be ratzon a thing that pleaseth him well to be his delight a sauour of a sweet smell a sauour of rest it is grata violentia hee that ruleth all is well pleased to bee by prayer
wherefore seeing

we know what will preuaile most with him if we meane to speed of our desires let vs vse that most which wee are sure will please him best let vs not be lither therein but feruent in spirit

but whereto serueth this powerfulnesse of prayer the text saith ad vindicationem vindictam god vpon their prayer will auenge his elect
and indeed in the law god saith vengeance is mine

and will repay the apostle repeateth it to the romanes the psalmist saith asmuch god to whom vengeance belongeth thou to whom vengeance belongeth shew thy selfe

nahum doth amplifie this propertie of god very emphatically the chapter is worth your reading

the first thing obserue here is that when in our distresses and while we are vnder crosses we seeke for succour vnto men we find that for the most part they haue blind eyes they will not see our case deafe eares they will not heare our groanes fast hands they cannot open them for vs and feeble knees that will not stirre towards vs finally they haue hard hearts they haue no of our misery but here is our comfort there lyeth an appeale from man to god and they shall preuaile with god which cannot preuaile with man he will not shut out our petitions though no bodie else careth for our soule
therefore we must in commend our case to him that iudgeth righteously assured that as saluation belongeth vnto him so his blessing is vpon his people he is nigh to them that call vpon him to all that call vpon him faithfully

the word in my text doth signifie vindicationem and vindictam the deliuerance of the church and the destruction of her enemies which commonly goe together as appeares in all the principall deliuerances recorded in the scripture when noah was saued the whole world was drowned lot was deliuered when sodome was burnt when god freed the israelites the egyptians perished so did the babylonians when the iewes were set free finally the iust shall goe to heauen when the wicked goe to hell
the reason why these are coupled together is because the enemies of the church are like sauage beasts which when they haue a prey in their power will not let it goe by faire meanes they must be forced to doe it which dauid insinuateth in those words in the psalme thou hast smitten all mine enemies vpon the cheeke bone

thou hast broken all the teeth of the vngodly or if you will the vngodly is made the ransome of the iust and commeth in his place when hee is deliuered as teacheth salomon

but yet this rule must we obserue for guiding of our piety that although vindicatio vindicta our own deliuerance and the confusion of our foes vsually go together yet in our prayer we must desire vindicatione propter se vindictam propter aliud our own deliuerance with a full and with a direct affection we may we must desire but we may not we must not desire the confusion of our foes otherwise then if it stand not with gods pleasure to conuert them nor to make way to our deliuerance but by their destruction
yea and then too it standeth with the charitie of the gospel to be compassionate to them and to pray vnto god for them

finally obserue that whereas the wicked in sinning offend god and wrong vs god seemeth more sensible of our wrong then of his owne offence in that christ saith he will auenge his elect he seemeth to hold himselfe wronged in them

and indeed he that said touch not mine anointed said also hee that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye he auengeth them as if he suffered in them

god doth so but yet in auenging festinat lentè
first lentè hee maketh no more haste then good speed for he forbeareth long
you shall find in the scripture a double undefined span alphabet or of god one towards the sinnes the other towards the woe of his elect and wee must be contented aswel with the one as the other we must be contented aswell to stay during gods pleasure as hee stayeth our leisure vntill wee repent of our sinne he is vnworthy to haue the benefit of the latter that is discontented with the former
the rather because it hath so manifold a vse and is so beneficiall both to our selues and others
to our selues first ad probationem to make proofe that wee are that which we would seeme to be to be gods owne elect
the arke saith saint austine was made of square timber which which way soeuer it turned stood firmely euen so doth the church consist of saints that alwayes are the same and like themselues

secondly ad preseruationem warre is more expedient for the church then peace for peace maketh vs effeminate and cowardly but warres put strength and courage into vs this the author of the tripartite storie obserueth well speaking of the persecution of the church
and indeed

in pace amaritudo amarissima we are neuer worse to godward then when we are most at ease in the world free from tyrants and free from heretickes

neither haue we only the benefit of gods patience others haue it also facit ad propagationem it maketh for the increase of the word
lactantius handleth this point very elegantly

amongst those that are spectators of the martyrs sufferings saith hee some wondring at their patience aske what that good thing is for the obtayning whereof they indure such losses and paines and so come to bee informed of the gospel
othersome inquire what euill that is the forbearing whereof maketh them to be handled so oruelly and they come thereby to learne the vanitie of idols
both wayes sanguis martyrum fit semen euangelij by martyrdome the gospel getteth ground and idolatrie doth lose it
neither only doth this patience propagate the gospel it confirmes also the professors thereof

many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speake the word without feare wauering consciences are setled when they see confessours and martyrs indure so much for gods truth and seale it with their bloud

finally christ will haue that appeare in the members which hath beene alreadie approued in the head that they can breake the serpents head and that they are built vpon the rocke so that the gates of hell cannot preuaile against them no winds or waues though they beate and

blow can beat or beare downe their house because it is built vpon a rocke sic deferre inagnae est clementiae

christ doth his church a fauour in so delaying
these are important reasons of gods suffering long

and yet god stayeth not so long as to come too late for gods permissiue prouidence is alwayes followed with an effectiue he suffereth not the enemies of the church to passe their bounds hee alwayes holdeth the bridle that is fastened vpon their nostrils

no temptation befalleth vs which is not undefined span alphabet sufferable by man and with the lord are alwayes the issues of death when the wicked haue filled vp the measure of their sinne when the number of the elect is fulfilled then is it seasonable for god to auenge

then behold he commeth quickly
that is no speed that preuenteth this season and wee must hold that quicke enough which god holdeth quicke with whom a thousand yeares are but as one day

and this the rather we must thinke because the time which we suffer is nothing to the time wherein we shall raigne for our light afflictions which are but for a moment are rewarded with an exceeding eternall waight of glorie
the time in which the wicked reuell and riot is as nothing in comparison of the time wherein they shall suffer for they shall be bound in euerlasting chaines of darknesse fed vpon by a worme which neuer dieth and burning in a fire which neuer goeth out
adde hereunto that when god beginneth hee will quickly make an end he hath laneos pedes but ferreas manus tarditatem vindictae grauitate compensat though god come slowly to it yet hee payeth home and the wicked goe downe in a moment into hell

and yet see our weaknesse

because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily therefore the hearts of the sonnes of men is fully set in them to doe euill yea

dauid himselfe said in his haste that all men are liars so languishing was his deuotion and so much did his gods season
but we must learne to possesse our soules in patience if god tarrie wait for him

for he will surely come and will not tarrie behold his soule which is lifted vp is not vpright in him
for the iust must liue by his faith which is a vertue not very lasting as you must now heare in the next point

neuerthelesse though religious deuotion be very powerfull yet it is strange to see how short liued it is had we a friend vpon whom our welfare depended how diligently would wee attend him how often would we remember him of our case how earnestly would wee importune him for his helpe and yet the best men are not alwayes alike kindly affected neither are they alwayes alike able to steed vs god is alwayes like himselfe almightie and yet who plyeth him for his eternall defence so much as we vsually plie men for their temporall

but marke here how the word is changed for before it was crying

here it is faith the reason of the change is very good for our crying must be endited by and vttered from our faith
and indeed how shall they call on him in whom they haue not belieued that asketh any thing of god saith saint iames must aske in faith nothing wauering and let not a wauering man thinke that he shall receiue any thing from the lord

but faith is here vnderstood not as it is scientiall but as it is conscientiall not as it entertaineth gods truth but as it putteth it in practice and turneth a sermon into a prayer such faith doth christ meane often in the gospel when being sued vnto to worke a miracle hee answereth one

goe in peace thy faith hath made thee whole saith vnto another

woman great is thy faith and of another haue not found such faith no not in israel
of this faith the rule is true si fides deficit oratio our deuotion and this faith will liue and die together
and the point which my text teacheth is that this faith and so deuoion is not

but here obserue two things first that it faileth secondly when it sayleth
first that it saileth
we should all hold out but few doe being vnder gods permissiue prouidence we should expect his effectiue but aduersitie maketh wisemen mad and in time of aduersitie many fall away men doe undefined span alphabet shrinke in the conflict like cowards both in soule and bodie
there is not a more sensible decay in the great then in the little world in our bodies then in our soules there are periods of pietie aswell as of policie and conuersions of churches aswell as of states witnesse arrianisme mahumetisme papisme yea and atheisme too which haue brought practicke faith and religious deuotion vnto an irrecouerable consumption
the papists will needs bee an exception to this decay of faith but whether you take faith for scientiall or conscientiall they are spectacles to the world of a dying faith their errors cannot be excused and their superstitions are intollerable
whether wee be in our declination or no it is worth our enquirie
an old friar preaching to his brethren spake these words fratres in principio religionis nostrae brethren when our order first began we were full of conscience in processe of time we lost a syllable and then retained nothing but science we haue now lost one syllable more and wee are nothing but entia certaine flow belites good for nothing
am sure we haue lost one syllable if wee haue lost no more for conscience to godward and towards the world are rare things

but what talke of christian faith we haue ouerliued ciuill faith

am pridem fugêre pudor verumque fidesque in quorum subiere locum fraudesque dolique

though cases of conscience bee not so corruptly deliuered by vs as by iesuits

who teach men artificially to lie and to murder meritoriously yet in practice we are gone very farre and if god should looke downe from

heauen to see if there were any that would seeke after god

he should find that all are gone aside wee may reade a picture of our selues in ieremie if we doe not exceed it
what may wee conceiue but that the sonne of man is comming

for towards his comming this degeneration will be most manifest
not at his first comming for then the birth of his wombe was like the morning deaw it suddenly the earth the kingdome of heauen suffered violence and the violent tooke it
christs second comming shall bee like the dayes of noah as then so at christs comming men will be eating and drinking marrying and giuing in marriage then the floud came and then shall come the fire

neither shall faith be only latens lurking as in time of persecution but languens giuing vp the ghost for want of grace

but let vs weigh the phrase shall he find when he commeth then hee commeth to seeke this faith and so indeed bee doth
for as all iudgement is giuen to him as hee is the sonne of man and hee shall come to iudge in the glorie of his father so his first enquirie is not only what his church suffereth but how it is disposed neither must we looke for his relieuing hand except he find vs busie at our faithfull cries
when god sent moses to deliuer israel marke what he saith vnto him

haue seene the affliction of my people and haue heard their crie and saint paul telleth vs that they that haue the of the spirit sigh in themselues while they looke for the redemption of their bodies saint peter

seeing all these things shall be dissolued what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conuersation and godlinesse looking for and hastening to the comming of the day of god
christ before both

watch and pray alwayes that you may be accounted worthy to escape all those things that shall come to passe and to stand before the sonne of man
if god giue vs sighes and groanes which cannot be exprest it is a good prognostication of our deliuerie if we be senslesse and stupid it is a signe of our destruction either in terra nostra when he bringeth troubles vpon our state and the clouds gather apace and threaten a storme

or cum orbe terrarum at the genetall day of iudgement which cannot bee farre off as appeares by the generall defect of faith at which time there will be very few left to bee saued

finally obserue the phrase christ doth not doubt but foretell what shall be yea and deplore also those wretched times because he is the sonne of man that is hath giuen vs so great an interest in him and himselfe beareth so great an affection to vs so that the manner of the speech doth terrorem incutere and should torporem excutere it serueth to strike a terrour into vs and to rowse vs out of our lethargie

haue done with the argument haue shewed you what is affirmed come now to the argumentation and in few words will shew you how it is inferred
it is inferred first very strangely for god in good things should be a patterne vnto man but man is here made a patterne for god a wicked man for a good god but it is not in wickednesse

but in goodnesse and christs meaning is to teach vs that we may imitate not only the good but the bad also in that which they doe well christ himselfe did so he compares his second comming to the stealing on of a thiefe in the night et quod decuit christum cur mihi turpe putem
yea hee biddeth vs doe so imitate not only the bad steward in his prouidence but the serpent also in his wisdome
saint paul borroweth sentences out of the heathen poets saint austine borrowed a rule of interpreting the scripture from tichonius the donatist
truth and goodnessse in whomsoeuer they are they are gods and therefore whether the point be speculatiue or practicke if it bee of this kind in whomsoeuer wee find it wee may follow it and in following it we follow not but god god say in that of his which we find in men for virtus vel in hoste landatur and this imitation is one of the profits wee may make of our most deadly enemies
therefore it is too much to dislike some things in our church because therein wee follow the church of rome as if all principles of reason and religion were dead in them as it is too much malice in the romanists to dislike many things because they come from vs though otherwise they cannot denie them to be reasonable
christs inference teacheth vs more indifferencie of iudgement

though the inference may seeme strange yet is it very strong for wee may strongly conclude minus probabili ad maius if a corrupt iudge will bee moued with importunitie how much more a iust god if a poore widow preuaile so with man how shall gods owne elect preuaile with him if the cries of nature worke so much how shall the cries of grace worke the proceeding of the wicked iudge may well resolue vs of that which wee may expect from god
this parable represents a strong motiue

if you that are wicked know how to giue good things to your children when they aske you how much more your father which is in heauen
therefore christ doth not only moue the question as if it were a probleme but turnes it into a direct affirmation tell you hee will and christs tell you is a seale of certaintie for hee is amen the faithfull and true witnesse yea it is hee himselfe that shall doe what hee saith as appeares esay
who is hee which commeth from edom and the undefined span alphabet or thankesgiuing in the reuelation

but draw to an end
the conclusion of all my text is this if at any time wee bee distressed and not relieued the fault is not in god it is in vs for our deuotion is tired wee are all modicae fidei men of little faith and though the spirit be willing yet the flesh is weake and the weaknesse of the flesh preuaileth more then the willingnesse of the spirit
wherefore we must all pray vnto god to giue vs the spirit of grace and prayer

and lord we beseech thee helpe our vnbeliefe and increase our faith yea lord pray thou that our faith faile not and the more thou doest exercise our patience the more earnest let vs be for thy deliuerance deliuerance from our corporall deliuerance from our spirituall foes that well ouercomming our militancie here on earth we may bee triumphant with the saints in heauen where wee shall turne our prayers into prayses and sing day and night honour prayse strength and power bee vnto him that sitteth vpon the throne and to the lambe for euermore
amen

eight sermons on the ninth chapter of the prophecie of isaiah
epigraph

isaiah
vers
for vnto vs a childe is borne vnto vs a sonne is giuen and the gouernment shall be vpon his shoulders and his name shall bee called the wonderfull counsellour the mighty god the euerlasting father the prince of peace
of the increase of his gouernment and peace there shall bee no end vpon the throne of dauid and vpon his kingdome to order it and to establish it with iudgement and iustice from henceforth euen for euer the zeale of the lord of hosts shall performe this

this is the first lesson appointed for this morning prayer and appointed fitly for the argument well fits the time
we are now met to praise god for the morning of the church
zacharie luke
doth so call the birth of christ saying the day spring that is the morning from on high hath visited vs yea christ himselfe reuel the last vers doth call himselfe the bright morning starre
and verily his birth was the most blessed morning that euer the church saw whether you respect the night that went before or the day that followed after it was the blessedest morning that euer the church saw
the night was long and darke a night of want of warre so wee reade in the last of the former and the first verse of this chapter but the day that followed was a cleare and lasting day a day of haruest a triumph day so we are taught in the foure verses that goe immediately before my text

a great alteration who could worke it who could turne that night into this day what sunne shone forth in so great strength in such a case man was like to moue such a doubt therefore the holy ghost hath

resolued it and his resolution of that doubt is my text
loe here is one that can vndertake that work who he is how excellent he is we are taught here and that in regard of his person and of his state
for of his person here are the natures wherein it subsisteth here is the people to whom it belongs

it subsists in two natures
the nature of man hee is a childe
the nature of god hee is the sonne
the person subsisting in these two natures belongeth vnto whom to vs was hee borne he was giuen to vs saith the prophet esay and esay was a iew christ then belongeth to the iewes though the iewes must not bee vnderstood according to the flesh but the spirit
to these iewes was he vouchsafed by taking and giuing
natus he tooke his nature from them and datus what he tooke he with aduantage bestowed vpon them
but of what degree was he amongst them here commeth in his state he was a king the gouernment shall be vpon his shoulders
the gouernement that was royall for verse
it is called the throne the kingdome of dauid
he shall sit vpon that and that is the gouernment that shall bee layd vpon his shoulders
and happy are the people that haue such a king
you will confesse it if you consider his excellencie
the excellencie both of his person and of his state
of his person that appeares in his endowments of his state that appeares in his managing thereof
the endowments of his person are royall reade his titles he shall bee called and what he is called that he certainely is hee shall be called by those names that expresse such vertues as most beseeme a king our king
for a king ouer and aboue the vertues which are common to him with his subiects must haue more than ordinary wisedome and power
and see this king is called for his wisedome the wonderfull counsellour for his power the mighty god
but mistake not his kingdome it is not of this world
he that is our king is the father of eternity that is of the world to come
and as his kingdome is not of this world so is not the condition of his people worldly it is peace and peace is not the portion of this world but of that which is to come
our king is the prince of this peace
you see how the person is endowed and thereby how excellent the person is
there is an excellencie in his state also it appeares in the effect in the cause
the effect for of this kingdome there are no bounds and the felicitie of the subiects is also boundlesse
so saith the text of the increase of his gouernment and peace there shall be no end
such an effect must haue an answerable cause it hath iustice and iudgement are the pollicie of this state
with these as a wonderfull counsellour he doth order as a mighty god he doth support his state
and he doth it vncessantly from henceforth and for euer
as the effect so the cause this is eternall therefore that

these truthes concerning christs person and state are not onely affirmed in the body of the text but also assured in the close thereof
much you haue heard and yet no more than shall bee he that hath promised can doe it such is his power hee is the lord of hosts
nay hee

cannot but doe it such is his loue for his loue is zeale
so concludes the prophet the zeale of the lord of hosts shall performe this

you haue heard the summe of this whole text and therein see a most exquisite picture of our sauiour christ certainely it is the fullest the liueliest that euer the holy ghost in so few words exprest in any part of the old testament
for here christ is not only drawne from top to toe but drawn also with those varieties that befell him from eternity to eternitie from the eternity that was before the world beganne for it looketh as farre backe as his eternall generation vnto the eternity that shall be after this world shall cease to be for it looketh as farre forward as his glorification
yea whereas christus is either naturalis or mysticus considered alone in himselfe or ioyntly with his church lo here are both both are clearely reuealed vnto vs so that what is there that you would desire to see in christ that you may not see in this text see it no doubt you doe but yet not so fully as wish
wherefore let me point more distinctly at the meaning of my text and follow mee beseech you with a religious eye and a diligent view thereof
the whole text doth breake it selfe into two parts a doctrine and a warrant thereof
the doctrine openeth the person and the state of christ and of both these it deliuereth the substance and the eminencie
begin at the substance of the person
wherein first wee are to see the natures wherein this person subsisteth the nature of man noted by the childe the nature of god noted by the sonne
though the later iewes in hatred of christ whom they will not haue to bee their messias these words to ezechias who was indeed a type of christ esay
yet not the truth it selfe notwithstanding the ancienter iewes not only the christian fathers refer them to the messias as may bee gathered out of the septuagint and caldee paraphrase

the child then and the sonne are plaine but they are solemne words
the holy ghost is not curious in paraphrasing them or setting limitations to them such as happely might make his meaning more apparant and let vs know what child what sonne he meaneth because these words were more frequent in the mouthes of the iewes by them did they ordinarily note their messias from the fall of adam were they vsed to these phrases
in paradise christ was called the seed of the woman which is but the periphrasis of a child
iacob speakes of shilo which should come from iuda and come when the scepter and were both gone
acts
this appeares to be meant of christ who as st iames obserues out of amos came to repaire the tabernacle of dauid which was quite fallen downe
touching the sonne most liuely is the prophecie made to king dauid sam

concerning this seed of whom god said he shall be my sonne and will be his father
st paul heb
applies this vnto christ it must bee vnderstood of him as likewise that place psal
thou art my sonne this day haue begotten thee
st luke chap
fetcheth his pedigree from adam from god the gospell calleth him the sonne of dauid and the sonne of the highest
need adde

no more places
this you must obserue that by the child by the sonne the old testament the new testament warrant vs to vnderstand christ who was vsually called the child the sonne
these are solemne words

as they are solemne so are they necessary also the child was not enough neyther was the sonne enough in our case
supposing gods decree wee must haue a person apt and able the child was apt but hee was not able the sonne able but not apt put them both together and then you haue ability and aptnesse to worke the redemption of man
there is aptnesse in the child to obey to suffer to vndergoe whatsoeuer cannot beseeme the sonne but that he may do and suffer meritoriously acceptably the child must be inabled by the sonne from the sonne must the child receiue both strength and worth therefore wee haue both a child and a sonne and if not both none no sauiour for neyther could alone suffice
as the words are solemne and necessary so are they strange
it is strange the sonne of such infinitencsse the child of such finitenesse the sonne of such glory the child of such meanenesse the sonne of such power the child of such weakenesse should come so neere together as to make one person a deified man
and because strange therefore many haue stumbled at them some at the sonne some at the child seuerally considered some at them both considered ioyntly
the arrians they set vpon the sonne the godhead of christ and would haue him a creatitious god or at the best but undefined span alphabet
against them the first councell of nice was assembled and defined that christ was undefined span alphabet truly god undefined span alphabet of the same substance with his father god of god as it is in the creed light of light very god of very god begotten of his father before all worlds
when they were quelled the apollinarists set vpon the child and pared away the best part of the manhood of christ they granted christs godhead and so much of his manhood as concerned a body but a reasonable soule they would not grant him they thought that his godhead supplyed that
the vnderstanding and the will of man is not requisite say they seeing both are found in god
against them was assembled the councell of constantinople which defined that christ was not only perfect god but perfect man undefined span alphabet of a reasonable soule and humane flesh subsisting as it is in athanasius creed
and miserable were our case if their definition were not true
damascene his rule might strike a terrour into vs quod non est assumptum non est curatum and what shall become of man if the better part of man nay that which onely maketh a man for forma dat nomen esse be not saued by christ

when these heresies were stopped which set vpon the parts of christs person seuerally then began those which set vpon them ioyntly
nestorius hee acknowledged the truth of the godhead and fulnesse of the manhood but he brooked not that vnion of these two in one person without which christ could be no redeemer
a friendly and louing association and cohabitation he would haue of two persons the child of marie and the sonne of god but hee would not endure that both should be accounted but one person or that the virgin marie should bee called

undefined span alphabet the mother of god expresly crossing the saying of the angel that holy thing that shall be borne of thee shall be called the sonne of god yea razing the comfort of many passages of scripture which by a undefined span alphabet as the fathers call it not reall but verball whereof there is no other foundation but this personall vnion doe attribute to the child in concreto that which springeth from the sonne and to the son in concreto that which springeth from the child
as for example no man saith christ ascendeth into heauen but hee which descendeth from heauen euen the sonne of man which is in heauen take away the personall vnion this speech cannot be true
for the sonne of man was not in heauen undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet not in the nature of man but in the nature of god hypostatically vnited vnto man
in the twentieth of the acts god is said with his owne blood to redeeme his church
an impossible thing were it not for the personall vnion which maketh that to be ascribed vnto god in concreto which indeed belongs vnto man
but the reason of the phrase is god is one with man
yea all the nature of merit is founded in this vnion loose the vnion and ouerthrow the merit
for the ability of the sonne closeth not with that aptnesse which before you heard of in the child to performe the blessed act of redemption but by this meanes of personall vnion
against so pestilent an heresie was assembled the councell of ephesus that defined that god and man made but one christ undefined span alphabet and that the nature of man assumed by the son of god was undefined span alphabet it had no personality but that which before was in the sonne
and the reason of it is very cleare for seeing christ came to saue not any one person but the seed of abraham as the apostle speaketh heb
he was to assume not a person but the nature of man that so he might be the common sauiour of mankinde

nestorius being put downe vp starteth eutyches and he in stead of a personall vnion of the natures forged a confusion of them he would so ioyne them that two should become one not person but nature and so of god and man wee shall neyther haue god nor man one shall be swallowed vp in the other at the least the manhood in the godhead
and this ouerthrowes not only the apparant texts of scripture which speaking of christ after the incarnation call him sometimes god and sometimes man and particularly as rom
phil

and elsewhere reckon vp eyther nature but it abolisheth all the comfort of those sweete texts which affirme that the law was fulfilled in our flesh that wee were crucified with christ that wee rose with him and that with him wee sit in heauenly places but especially that text to the hebrewes which biddeth vs come with boldnesse vnto the throne of grace because wee haue not such an high priest as cannot be touched with our infirmities seeing he is like vnto vs in all things sinne only excepted
against eutyches was assembled the councell of calcedon which prouided for the sincerity of our faith in this article and hath defined against this confusion of natures the compounding of the nature of god and man undefined span alphabet
and the learned writings of leo the first vigilins and others are excellent commentaries vpon that councell

but to what end haue opened all this surely that you might see the riches of this first branch of my text teaching vs what christians must beleeue maugre all hereticks guided by those famous generall councels namely foure things there are to be considered therin
the truth of the godhead

the fulnesse of the manhood

the personall vnion of both

and yet without abolition of eyther
so that wee may in these words reade the whole mysterie of the incarnation

but one caution must giue you and not but the fathers generally and that is you must acknowledge these mysteries but you must not pry too farre into them lest that befall you which is in the prouerbe qui scrutator est maiestatis opprimetur gloria while you will know more than is permitted you mistake that which is reuealed
in euery article of our creede especially in this that of moses holds the secret things are for the lord but the reuealed things are for vs that these things are so is the reuealed part of the article but how they come to bee so is the secret part thereof
let vs bee contented with that which is ours and leaue gods vnto himselfe licet scire quòd natus sit christus non licet discutere quomodo natus sit illud negare mihi non licet hoc quaerere metus est
nam generationem eius quis enarrabit saith st ambrose
and it was this quomodo that was the bane of all the heretickes and pray god their harms may make vs to beware
let vs be wise vnto sobriety the seedes that they sowed are not yet all dead they fructifie too much in other parts and something haue they shewed themselues of late in our country lest they possesse vs this caueat must be marked by vs
the last thing which will note on these words is they are most sweet words
the name of child and sonne make christ most louely in the eares in the eyes both of god and man
if man were put to his choyce what nature hee would wish to bee vsed in his redemption is there any that he could desire rather than his owne and what nature can better content god in the redemption than his owne looke vpon the childe man hath what he would and looke vpon the sonne god hath what hee would both cannot be but well pleased

you heare not all the sweetnesse of it looke againe vpon the childe
the physicians and diuines druide the life of man into many ages some after one fashion and some after another but the very first is that which most properly is noted by this word it signifieth that age which begins vpon the conception that moment wherein the nature of man taketh beginning
no sooner is the child quickned but it is jeled it is that which is noted by this child and the english word seems to come thence
the loue of christ to children appeared many waies when he rebuked his disciples that would not suffer them to be brought vnto him when he accepted hosanna out of their mouthes when he vouchsafed them to bee martyrs at his death but neuer did hee expresse so much loue vnto them as he did in being like vnto them euen the yongest and tendrest of them lodging in his mothers wombe borne in his mothers armes sucking at his mothers breast and learning to speak from his mothers mouth could christ euer haue taken a more gracious course to sanctifie their simplicity

plicitie their infirmity and shew how deare they were vnto him wonder not now at those other words of christ the childrens angels continually behold their fathers face in heauen and to them belongs the kingdome of heauen yea they that will enter into the kingdome of heauen must be like vnto them
and who would disdain to be like vnto them to whom christ was pleased to be so like

and is not the child then a sweet word haue not parents therein a great comfort children oftentimes dye in their mothers wombe and often so soone as they come out of the wombe dispise them not despaire not of them they cannot be so yongue but christ was as yongue and what he was he sanctified they are holy vnto him and by him to god their father
the name of child is sweet then sweet in regard of the nature of man and yet more sweet in respect of the first beginning as it were and infancie of mans nature
the name of sonne also hath in it a sweetnesse and why the sonne is in nature nearest and dearest in affection to his parents especially if he be vnigenitus then is he vnicè dilectus the only begotten is the only beloued
this word then shewes that christ can bring vs most neare and make vs most deare vnto god
most neare for the sonne is of the same nature most deare for hee would bee one with vs that hee might make vs one with god
this word then lookes most cheerfully vpon the case of man
wee had been sonnes but by reason of the fall we were not and bee againe that which once we were we could not but by the sonne
the recouery then of our state our former state but in a more excellent manner is promised in this word
the sonne by nature comes to make vs sons by adoption
this title of the person putteth vs in hope of that recouerie
when we heare this can we but exclaime lord what is man that thou art so mindefull of him and the sonne of man that thou so regardest him we cannot we must not no we must roote our faith in this substantiall mediation as the diuines call it and comfort our selues therewith if euer we meane to haue comfort of the actuall mediation

therefore was the sacrament prouided as a looking glasse wherein wee might see and partake that spirituall manna that bread of god that came down from heauen to giue life vnto the world
theodoret in one of his dialogues hath an excellent parallel betweene the incarnation of christ and the condition of the sacrament which withall shewes how vnsound the doctrine of the church of rome is concerning transubstantiation neither indeed can there be a more liuely representation of the one than by the other
as in christ there are two natures of god and man so in the sacrament are there two substances the heauenly and the earthly
as in christ these two natures are truly and intirely so are those substances in the sacrament
as after the vnion the two natures make but one person so after the consecration the two substances make but one sacrament
finally as the two natures are vnited without confusion or abolition of eyther in christ so in the sacrament are the substances heauenly and earthly knit so that each

continueth what it was and worketh answerably on vs these things we should obserue when wee come to the sacrament and so shall wee reape the greater benefit thereby the rather if wee not only behold the one mysterie in the other but possesse our selues also of the one by the other as indeed we ought
for if we feed vpon the sacrament aright wee become thereby what christ is bone of his bone and flesh of hu flesh yea wee are made partakers of the diuine nature as st peter speaketh
and what more can be wished of a mortall man

but must conclude
lord cherish in vs this faith lord let vs as wee ought acknowledge the child acknowledge the sonne our own nature in thy sonne and thy sonne in our nature
let vs neuer seuer that which thou hast let vs neuer confound that which thou hast distinguished let vs beleeue without disputing
so shall our faith bee free from errour and our soules be full of comfort comfort in hearing of comfort in receiuing that child that sonne which hath so made vs children that wee are the beloued sonnes of god
amen

the second sermon
epigraph for vnto vs a child is borne vnto vs a sonne is giuen

in handling the substance of christs person we were to consider the natures wherein it subsists and the people to whom it belongs
beganne the vnfolding of the natures and shewed you that they are two and that betweene these two there is some odds

the two natures are the nature of man and the nature of god noted by the childe and the sonne solemne necessary strange sweet words
solemne because receiued amongst the iewes to signifie their messias
necessary because they import the aptnesse and ability which is requisite in a sauiour
strange if they be throughly considered the foure mysteries obseruable in christs incarnation appeare in them
the truth of his godhead
the fulnesse of his manhood
the vnion of two natures in one person
and yet the distinction of these natures in the person
sweet because they giue contentment vnto god and man
that these things are so it is plaine by the text
how it is so faith must not enquire it must onely entertaine the vnion as a great honour done to the meannesse of man

which is assumed by the maiestie of god for which we must giue glory vnto him
thus far came and farther the time would not suffer me to goe

let vs now see the people to whom hee is vouchsafed
hee belongeth to vs saith the prophet
but who are wee whom meaneth the prophet by vs of what nation of what condition were we by nation iewes for it is esay that speaketh and esay was a iew
when hee saith he is borne to vs he is giuen to vs it is as if he should say he was borne to the iewes giuen to the iewes
and indeed so it is god conditioned to be their god and that they should be his people he entred into a couenant with them and placed the seales of his couenant in them they had the tabernacle and the visible presence of god with them all the types of christ personall reall were amongst them yea from them was christ to take his nature
st paul rom
sheweth what prerogatiues god vouchsafed them yea and in the
chapter goeth so far as to call christ the minister of circumcision
christ himselfe in the gospell seemeth to appropriate himselfe to the iewes when he saith to the woman of canaan was not but to the lost sheepe of israel
but this notwithstanding the prophesies must hold true whereof a briefe is deliuered by old simeon christ was to be the light of the gentiles not only the glory of israel
christ was borne and giuen not only to the iew but also to the gentile
the
psalme is excellent to this purpose shewing vs the christ was borne not only amongst the iewes but among the gentiles also

but we must marke that the gentiles haue no other interest in christ than if they become iewes the law is to goe out from sion esay
and so to come to them the forecited psalme imports as much
esay sheweth

that they must become sonnes and daughters of ierusalem that they must submit themselues to her they must all speake the language of canaan as it is esay
but st paul is most plaine who to the romanes sheweth that the true oliue is the iew and if the gentile partake of the fatnesse thereof he must be grafted thereinto and become a branch of that oliue
to the ephesians more plainly more fully he maketh the receiuing of the gentiles into the church to bee an admission into the couenant into the of israel
ephes

a becomming one body with them

but as the gentile becommeth a iew so is it not a iew according to the flesh but according to the spirit
a sonne of abraham he is but a spirituall sonne the partition wall is taken downe yea the arke it selfe is remoued ieremy
and the ceremonies which cloath the religion of the iewes cease they are not imposed vpon the gentiles
yea the iew himselfe becommeth a gentile the iew say becommeth a gentile carnally as the gentile becommeth a iew spiritually
of the ten tribes it is most cleare that after their captiuity they neuer returned and there is no such nation to be heard of in the world they are mingled with other nations and become gentiles according to the flesh
and as for the other two tribes that made vp the kingdome of iuda many thousands

of them were conuerted to the christian faith in the daies of the apostles and yet there is not extant any nationall church of them neither was there long extant any they also are become gentiles according to the flesh
and god that buried the bodie of moses so that it could not be found lest the iewes should commit idolatry with that body whereby god had wrought so great miracles seemes also to haue as it were buried so many iewes as became christians by mingling them with the gentiles lest that superstition which hath besotted the gentiles to goe a pilgrimage to the holy land should haue wrought more strongly in making them dote vpon that holy people
but god hath turned all the world into a canaan hath of all nations compounded the israel of god
of a truth saith st peter see there is no respect of persons with god but in euery nation whosoeuer beleeueth and feareth god is accepted of him there is neyther iew nor gentile graecian nor barbarian bond nor free but all are one in christ all are contained vnder this name vs
in the prophet vpon this ground israel seemes to note the gentiles

when both iuda and israel are remembred to bee conuerted to god and the whole house of iacob

you see of what nation the people is now see of what condition
borne to vs giuen to vs
and who are we for whom god hath done this gifts are bestowed vpon persons eyther for their worth or for their need for their worth and so they are munera honoraria they are presented in dutifull acknowledgement of their worth whether it be worth of vertue or worth of degree for their need and so they are munera eleemosynaria conferred out of a pitifull compassion of others wants
this gift is not of the first kinde it cannot be honorarium there was no worth in vs which god should honour with this gift bestowed vpon vs our degree was of no regard our vertue of much iesse the former was none in comparison and the later was none at all
it must then be munus eleemosynarium and indeed so it was the scripture so speaketh of it
through the tender mercy of our god the from on high hath visited vs so saith zacharie
and st paul tit
after the kindnesse and loue of our sauiour towards man appeared not by workes of righteousnesse which we haue done but of his mercy he saued vs

and indeed it was a worke of great mercy
for whereas there is but duplex malum malum poenae and malum culpae a double euill of sinne and woe we were plunged deepe in both deep in sin deepe in woe
to pity him that is deep in woe is not strange it seemeth to be the proper act of mercy but pity towards malefactors the philosophers acknowledge none
no man say they pitieth a thiefe when he goeth to the gallowes or a murderer feeling the stroke of iustice how much lesse would they pity them if the sinne were against themselues and that committed by a vassall against his lord a vassall that had receiued much fauour against his lord from whom he receiued it
in such a case they acknowledge no pity
yet this is our case and we haue found pity so great pity that christ was borne for vs and christ was giuen vnto vs so that of this pity as well causa undefined span alphabet as undefined span alphabet not onely the

cause but the occasion must be found in god
it is cleare that the proper cause is the goodnesse of god and it is as cleare that the occasion also must bee fetched from him
were there onely malum poenae in vs there might bee found in vs an occasion of mercie but seeing there is also malum culpae there cannot but bee an occasion of iustice
our double euill worketh a double occasion and so maketh mercie and iustice as it were to striue in god

and indeed both take their occasions
natus satisfied iustice for a person came forth that was able to giue full satisfaction vnto iustice but datus satisfied mercy because this person was freely bestowed vpon vs so that if we put borne for vs and giuen to vs together we see the sweet harmony that is in the quire of gods attributes
none singeth alone they concent together yet so that some one doth most loudly speak the praise of god and in our case mercy reioyceth ouer iudgement
for though our sinnes haue occasioned iustice and therefore christ was borne for vs that he might satisfie that iustice that was too heauie for vs yet our woe occasioned mercy which gaue christ vnto vs that in our own person we might enioy the blessings of god
we are borne for our selues that we may liue and haue all the comfort of our life present to come blessings which we wanted and by which when we receiue them our state is the better
it is not so with christ he was borne for others not for himselfe and giuen to others not to himselfe for what wanted he whereof he needed a supply hee was in the forme of god and what good is there that is not in the nature of god which is the ouerflowing fountaine of all good looke vpon the state of christ this point will appeare clearly
no man will doubt but his birth was for the good of others that considereth that his glory is not his owne but ours
he sitteth indeed at the right hand of god and is lifted vp aboue all angels and and euery name that is named in heauen and earth in this world and that which is to come but what gaineth he by it who was from eternity most high in the glory of his father christ himselfe affirmeth it iohn
glorifie mee father with that glory which enioyed with thee before the foundations of the world were
himselfe then receiued nothing which hee had not for euer but in him wee receiue the honour to be loyned in one person with god

in that person to conquer sinne death and hell after the conquest to receiue all power both in heauen and earth and possessed of this power to sit vpon the throne of god
it is not the godhead but the manhood in christ and so it is wee that haue receiued these blessings
so that we must begin the obseruation of gods fauour vnto vs at that dignitie which our nature hath attained in christ

these different words natus and datus borne and giuen imply that they were not both of one time the manhood beganne when christ was incarnate but the godhead was long before
it was though it were not manifested vntill the time of his birth
so that being and being manifest make the difference for that the manhood receiued then his beeing but the godhead only his beeing manifest

and yet wee must not make such a difference without taking heed of nestorius his errour for if the words be soundly vnderstood if they bee vnderstood of the person not of the natures we may apply natus and datus to eyther of them the godhead may be said to be borne and the manhood may bee said to bee giuen
that the godhead or rather god may be said to be borne it is cleare luke
the holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the sonne of god and the virgine mary by the fathers is as you heard called undefined span alphabet
st bernards obseruation is true speaking to the virgine mary as it were in the person of the angell quod natum est ex ipso deo erit tuus quod ex te nascetur erit eius vt tamen non sint duo filij sed vnus licet aliud ex te aliud ex illo sit ita tamen non cuius{que suus sed vnus vtrius{que filius
so that vnderstand it of the person and natus will agree with filius vnderstand it also of the person and datus will agree with puerulus for the childe was giuen also and had a being before euen as ancient as the sonne of god to whom he is inseparably vnited
whatsoeuer attribute of god may be verified of man so long as we meane no more but the person
but if our meaning doe once point at the natures then natus is peculiar to the childe which beganne in time and datus to the sonne which was before all time so the diuines ancient and later doe vsually distinguish these words

thirdly note that natus goeth before datus christ is before hee is bestowed
and the holy ghost would haue vs to consider two distinct acts of god
the constitution of our sauiours person
and then the donation thereof vnto vs and it is requisite that our meditations confound not gods workes
wee must multiply our meditations as gods works are multiplied the constitution of the person is as a means which god prouideth and prouideth for an end which was his donation
so that christs incarnation is not to be taken as a speculatiue but a practick thing god therein did not onely reueale his wisedome and his power which wee may speculate with our wits but thereby doth giue vs a taste of his goodnesse also to affect our hearts
so that wee may not separate datus from natus lest we proue ignorant how vsefull this incarnation is and so depriue our selues of the comfort thereof
lastly if datus be the end of natus and he that is borne is giuen vnto vs we must make st paules conclusion god that spared not his onely sonne but gaue him for vs what is there that he will not bestow vpon vs he hath nothing nearer and dearer he that is vouchsafed this may presume to speed of whatsoeuer else
we cannot haue a better encouragement to pray nor of our prayer nay we cannot learne better how to demeane our selues towards god than by imitating gods dealing herein with vs
let natus or rather renatus goe before datus in vs let vs first bee before wee giue our selues to god
except we be prouided of this gift we are not fit to make a present and if wee be prouided and vnfainedly make this present vnto god what haue wee that shall not be deuoted vnto him our honour our wealth our friends hee will neuer deny ought vnto god that first giueth himselfe to him
and thus much for the odds betweene the two natures implied in the words borne and giuen

moreouer we must obserue that the childe borne and the sonne giuen if they be separated from vs they make an article admiràble but comfortable it is not except you adde vnto it vs
when this clause is put vnto that our faith is faith indeed and taketh place as well in our heart as in our head and we listen diligently vnto the annunciation which the angel made vnto the shepheards behold bring you glad tidings of great ioy that shall be to all the people for vnto you is borne a sauiour which is the lord christ
in a word you haue the true description of immanuell god with vs which then proued true when this childe was borne vnto vs and to vs this sonne was giuen

finally marke the tense of these words natus datus it is the praetertense they speake of christ as if hee were already borne
christ was not borne in sixe hundred yeares after
the reason is the stile is propheticall the prophets speake of things to come as if they were present or past they speake of the workes of god answerably to the nature of god
in the nature of god there is no time because it is eternall
when moses asked after gods name he receiued this answer am that am
in the reuelation that name is resolued into all the parts of time undefined span alphabet and it imports that all parts of time are together in god they are all present in him
as it is with his nature so it is with his workes
nothing falleth out in time that was not decreed before all time and whatsoeuer is in the decree is euer present to god
and because present in the decree therefore as concluded god may speake of it as a thing past because the conclusion is before his eyes he may speake of it as a thing present and as his hand shall produce it he may speake of it as a thing to come
and the holy ghost vseth libertie to speake of such things so diuersly
but for their speaking of christs birth as if it were passed when it was yet to come there are moreouer two speciall reasons the one is for that the efficacie of his birth began immediately vpon the fall
as in paradise adam was stung by the serpent so in paradise was hee cured by the seed of the woman
the patriarchs in their order heb
not onely knew but felt the vertue of this childe this sonne
st paul comprehends it in a short rule iesus christ yesterday and to day and the same for euer
hee was a lambe slaine not onely borne from the beginning of world
neither onely did the efficacie of his person worke but in a sort his presence also was vouchsafed vnto the world
it is an ancient opinion of many of the fathers and not a few of the worthiest late diuines approue it that all apparitions of god in the old testament were of the second person
in the eighth of the prouerbs himselfe saith that his delight was to be amongst the sonnes of men
yea and to say nothing of other shapes how often did hee appeare in the shape of a man which apparition the fathers call praeludium incarnationis it was a faire intimation of that which in time hee should bee for euer after hee had once taken vpon him the nature of man which death it selfe should neuer seuer from him

lord that wouldest not only become man but also bee gods gift to man thou which wert before all time wouldest be bestowed in time bestowed vpon iewes bestowed vpon gentiles and make them both one israel of god notwithstanding there was nothing in them to demerit thee much in them to prouoke thee yet hast thou out of thine own goodnesse so tendered man as to satisfie thy iustice that it might bee no hinderance vnto thy mercy but that thy mercy might remedy both our woe and sinne we beseech thee that wee may all be new borne by vertue of thy sonnes birth and giue our selues to thee as he is giuen to vs that so we may be in the number of those which with the prophet may say tovs a childe is borne to vs a sonne is giuen
which grace he vouchsafe vs that is giuen vnto vs to whom with the father and the holy ghost be giuen all honour and glory now and for euer
amen

the third sermon
epigraph the gouernment shall be vpon his shoulders

the doctrine of this scripture containes the truth and excellencie of christs person and state of the truth of christs person haue already spoken and shewed you both the natures wherein it subsisteth and the people to which it belongs
the natures wherein it subsists are two the nature of god and of man
which haue a most streight vnion in one person and yet without the least diminution of eyther nature
this person belongs vnto the iewes not according to the flesh but according to the spirit euen to the whole israel of god which consists of beleeuing naturall both iewes and gentiles
to this people doth christ belong

but of what degree is hee amongst them for euery companie that consists of many persons if they bee incorporate hath men of sundry degrees by the ordinance of god and the common rules of discretion there are superiours there are inferiours some which command some which are commanded
of which ranke is our sauiour christ of the highest it appeares in his state the gouernment shall be vpon his shoulders
although then the scripture affirm that christ appeared in the forme of a seruant and himself said that he came not to be ministred vnto but to minister

et must we not mistake his ministery was not of the foote but of the head it was not an obeying but a commanding ministeric
the head ministers and so doth the foote in our body naturall but they minister not both alike the head ministreth to the foote by way of commanding the foote ministreth to the head by way of obeying
christs ministery was of the former not of the later kinde his foes and his friends in the gospell both salute him by the name of rabbi or rabboni which is by interpretation master
and our sauiour christ telleth his disciples in st iohn you call me master and lord and you say well for so am
and elsewhere he calleth himselfe the heire of the vineyard the lord of the sabaoth
the name of christ or messias is a most cleare proofe hereof for none were anointed but to be superiours and the acts which christ did exercise beare witnesse hereunto
which were all of them eyther propheticall when hee taught or priestly when hee sacrificed or kingly when hee wrought miracles
these bee the things which were done by him and the gospell relates no other kinde of acts or at least none in comparison
and all these are commanding acts they are acts of a superiour exercised in the dayes of his flesh in the dayes of his greatest humiliation
so that the forme of a seruant and the ministring of christ shew that he had not the attendance for worldly respect that was due to such a superiour hee had not so much as a house to hide his head in much lesse had hee any princely pompe
but they deny him not to haue been a superiour they deny him not that which was giuen him in my text and my text giueth him the state of a superiour

to come then vnto it
there are two things to bee obserued in the words
of what sort the gouernment was
and wherewith christ did sustaine it
the gouernment was of the best sort it was regall it appeares in the next verse where christ is said to sit vpon the throne of dauid and this gouernment he sustaines by his owne carefull power for it is layd vpon his shoulders
these two points we must at this time looke into briefly and in their order beginne with the gouernment
if wee looke backe to the story of genesis we shall finde that when god promised isaac which was a type of christ he changed both his fathers and his mothers name shee was called sarai but god new named her sarah which is a princesse and abram was new named abraham a father of many nations
and me thinks when reade these words here in the prophet and those that follow wherein christ is described see the application of those names to this person see the principality see the posterity see in christ the truth of sarah and of abrahams name
and surely the word which here signifieth gouernment hath great affinity with the name of sarah

but of gouernments some are subordinate some are absolute some so command as the centurion in the gospell am a man set vnder authority though haue diuers vnder mee and say to one come and hee commeth and to another go and he goeth but some so command as salomon speaketh of a king against whom there is no rising vp whose lawes must not bee disputed on earth and his commandements bee obeyed by all that

are his subiects
christs gouernment is not of the subordinate but the absolute sort it appeares by the throne by the kingdome vpon which he sitteth places of absolute power especially if they be natiue and not electiue they must needs haue a most free absolute power
and such christs is natus rex it is the expresse letter of my text and the wisemen that came to present him matth

asked for him that was borne king of the iewes
nay christ himselfe when pilate asked him whether he were a king replyed for this cause was borne
and pilate set vp this stile ouer his crosse iesus of nazareth king of the iewes which he would not alter though he were much importuned by the scribes and pharisees
the places of the prophets are very cleare esay
ier
but specially dan

all of them beare witnesse to the kingdome of christ
so that wee must acknowledge in christ a kingly power such a power as none must dare to dispute the verity of his word as curious and scoffing atheists and epicures doe or resist his authority as proud pharaohs and senacheribs christ can brooke neyther

but as christ is called a king so here is an addition vnto his title his throne and kingdome are termed the throne and kingdome of dauid
and indeed christs pedegree is by st matthew and st luke fetched from king dauid
himselfe calleth himselfe in the reuelation the roote and generation of dauid
the apostle telleth vs that be was of the seed of dauid according to the flesh and how often in the gospell is he called the sonne of dauid in the prophets euen dauid himselfe sometimes and sometimes the branch of dauid
finally the angell in the first of luke telleth the virgin mary that christ shall sit vpon the throne of his father dauid

but how can that bee seeing that which dauid had christ had not and what dauid had not christ had christ had not the temporall state of dauid that was fallen into the hands of herod the great and the spirituall state of christ dauid had not his kingdome was temporall
how then could christ be said to sit vpon his kingdome although it were granted that by succession christ was the right heire to the crowne of israel yet seeing the scepter was departed and the gone the tabernacle of dauid was downe we cannot finde a truth of these words we cannot if wee vnderstand them literally but if mystically wee may
and st pauls rule is our guide all things yea and persons too if they were eminent came to the israelites in types

they had shadowes of good things to come
st bernards rule is true this throne of dauid which christ sate on was not sedes typica but vera not corporalis but spiritualis not temporalis but aeterna yet so that illa was huius imago the temporall of the eternall the corporall of the spirituall the typicall of the true throne dauids state of the state of the church
and indeed there is an excellent analogie betweene the person of dauid and christ as both were kings dauid was anointed to be a king long before hee was possessed of his kingdome and so was our sauiour christ anointed with the holy ghost long before he entred into his glory
for though he did many acts of a gouernour propheticall and priestly yet few regall acts

before his resurrection and those which hee did hee did them rather with the efficacie than in the maiestie of a king for his outward man represented nothing lesse
but after his resurrection and ascension efficacie and maiestie conioyned and he sate him downe at the right hand of god and now doth he gouerne in the glory of his father

secondly as there was a distance betweene dauids vnction too and possession of the crowne so was that a troublesome time few quiet dayes had he being persecuted both abroad and at home by saul by his seruants
euen so our sauiour christ entred not into his glory but by many afflictions all kinde of enemies pursue him with all kinde of malice so that his life was a continuall crosse
and as dauid so christ the nearer he drew to his crowne the sharper was his crosse
thirdly as king dauid first possessed only the tribe of iuda and after some yeares the ten tribes euen so our sauiour christ at first possessed only the iewes and after some time inlarged his church vnto the gentiles
fourthly dauid being possessed of his kingdome spent many years in repressing the foes of his kingdome philistines amonites syrians and at length fate downe in peace and ruled with iustice and iudgement in much prosperity euen so our sauiour christ though ascended into heauen and reigning there yet shall he be vntill the generall resurrection subduing his enemies vnder his feete and freeing his church from troubles and calamities
when that is done then shall he rule and reigne with his church in much peace and ioy
these and such like analogies are obseruable in comparing of christ and dauid which are the cause why the kingdome of christ is called the kingdome of dauid

but yet in the letter of the storie which is the ground of this comparison you shall finde many hyperboles reade the
psalme the
psalm the to say nothing of diuers places of the prophets which seeme to exceede the truth if they be applyed to king dauid whereby the holy ghost giueth vs to vnderstand that they must bee applyed to a greater than dauid
and indeed the phrases that are in these reall allegories or types must be vnderstood of the corporall part but quodammodo in a measure answerable vnto them the fulnesse of their truth appeares in the spirituall
and some diuines obserue

that the throne of dauid is not that which dauid possessed but that which was promised to dauid for his sonne and indeed in sam

the promise though it be made vnto dauid yet is it made for his sonne his sonne is christ
it was not meant of his immediate sonne otherwise than in a type but it was meant of his sonne undefined span alphabet the messias or sauiour of the world as also the promise made to abraham was made for his sonne which in appearance seemed to be isaac but st paul to the galathians telleth vs that that seed is christ

well then this kingdome is the church and therein christ sitteth as in his throne it is the gouernment thereof that is committed vnto him
and here wee may not dreame of a corporall kingdome and turne the truth into a type
st paul hath told vs that the kingdome of god is neyther

meat nor drinke but righteousnesse and peace and ioy of the holy ghost and christ in the gospell the kingdome of god is within you
the parables of the kingdome if you looke to their morall imply as much all sound things and persons spirituall
grosse then is the vsurpation of the bishop of rome who in christs name contrary to christs rules combines both swords the spirituall and the corporall
and they that vnderstand the kingdome of christ carnally as if all temporall iurisdiction should be swallowed vp in the ecclesiastical state sauour not of the things of god but of the things of this world yea they sow dangerous seeds of discord betweene princes and pastors and seeke to breed iealousies vpon which what will follow but that the one will seeke to ruinate the other

christs kingdome then is of his church and it is a spirituall gouernment of his church
notwithstanding these words must not bee vnderstood exclusiuely as if christ were so confined to his church as that he had nothing to doe with those that were without the church
as king dauid ruled in israel but so that the philistines moabites and all the bordering countries were subiect vnto his scepter and hee layd tribute vpon them and commanded them at his pleasure euen so our sauiour christ not only ruleth in his church but commandeth them also that are without it not onely men but euen the powers of hell also he hath the keyes both of death and hell and euery knee boweth to him at of things in heauen and of things in earth so euen of things vnder the earth also
and it is our comfort that hee which is our king hath so great a power ouer our foes the more power hee hath ouer them the lesse wee neede to stand in feare of them the more securely may wee obey him
and so haue you heard of what sort christs gouernment is
the next point is wherewith he sustaines this gouernment it is here said that it shall be vpon his shoulders
morall princes vnburden themselues vpon the shoulders of others the wits the power of their officers in peace and warre doe beare vp the greatest part of their state
it is not so with our king he beareth all himselfe euen when hee vseth meanes those meanes are but instruments whose abilitie and efficacie are both from him
the minister speaketh words and dispenseth elements but in vaine doth he both except christ bee with him and his spirit make effectuall that which is done by him if there bee not undefined span alphabet it will be indeed undefined span alphabet
and what likelihood was there that a few fishermen and those vnlearned should euer haue subiected the crownes of princes the wits of philosophers the stomacks of the mighty the desires of the ambitious finally all kinde of dispositions vnto the scepter of christ had not christs spirit wrought with them

a second thing that is to bee obserued in this word is that as christ is highest in degree so is hee deepest in care and so should kings bee
the great world the little world both preach this lesson vnto temporal kings
the great world hath many parts whereof it doth consist and of them one is placed aboue another
the higher any part is placed the more it laboureth for the rest by motion and influence
witnesse the sun

the moone the starres compared to the inferiour bodies all which labour for the earth the basest of all
in the little world of our body is not our head set aboue our hands and our feete and how painefully doth the eye watch the eare heare and euery sense employ it selfe for the direction and preseruation of the hands and feete if it bee so in the creatures that are destitute of reason betweene reasonable creatures it should bee much more so
the gouernour must lesse take his ease and lesse be idle than those which are gouerned nay his care his paine must farre exceede theirs he must partake of euery one of theirs
doe wee not see it so in our body the hand hath his peculiar worke so hath the foote and euery other in feriour part employes it selfe about some particular function but the directiue and commanding parts in man are architectonicall they resemble the master of the works in a building whose presence and guidance runneth through all the seuerall kinde of labourers appointing what they must doe and caring that they doe it well whether they hew stones or lay them square timber or it whatsoeuer other worke is to bee done the master hath though not his hand yet his head working with them
no otherwise should the magistrate carry himselfe in his charge nor be lesse prouident in the the influence of his care must quicken must order must further whatsouer functions of the people and make them tend to the common good

the
psalme compares our gouernour meane christ of whom this text speaketh vnto a showre of raine and wee see that a showre of raine waters carefully all the plants of the fields the rose the lilly the violet the cedar and the pine all of them do fare the better for the watering of the raine
and the grace of christs spirit is no otherwise showred downe vpon euery member of the church euery one is nourished therewith
malachie compares him to the sunne he calleth him the sun of righteousnesse and who knoweth not how common the warmth of the sunne is and how effectuall it is also
the raine yeelds matter to the earth but that it may become prouing matter the earth is beholding to the sunne which workes the moisture and distributeth it through the whole body of the herbs and plants
christs grace supplyeth both rain and sunne from him wee haue both posse and velle nay the apostle saith he worketh in vs both to will and to doe euen of his own good pleasure
so that we may well say the gouernment lyeth vpon his shoulders

vpon his shoulders princes on earth beare the ensignes of their gouernment some in their hands as scepters some on their heads as crownes but christ weareth his on his shoulders
the fathers generally vnderstand this of christs crosse some looking to the history related in the gospell that christ was made to bear his own crosse vpon his shoulders when he went vnto his death which they say was prophesied of in the
psalme dicite in gentibus quia dominus regnauit ligno so saith st austin it was anciently read though it be not found so read now ordinarily in the septuagint
the iewes in malice razed it out as hee thinkes
but because the hebrew text hath it not wee neede not stand vpon so vncertaine a ground wee may take a better eyther from the

type of aaron bearing the twelue tribes ingrauen vpon his shoulders when he went into the temple or from eliakim esay
vpon whose shoulders the key of the house of dauid was layd or from the shepheard bearing the lost sheepe vpon his shoulders or if you will haue it of the crosse take it from christ himselfe speaking to the disciples that went to emmaus ought not christ to haue suffered these things and so to enter into his glory or from st paul also christ triumphed ouer powers and principalities in his person but then when this person suffered vpon the crosse
so that christ reigned in his passion and because in his passion therefore had he his gouernment vpon his shouldeas

and indeede our faith in him must begin at that which was endured by him and therein must wee imitate him and write cedendo vincimus
the church neuer triumphed so much ouer the world as when it did most resolutely sustaine the bloudy malice of the world
the last thing that is to be noted on these words is the exchanging of the yoke mentioned before and rod of the oppressor which lay vpon the shoulders of the people into this royalty and gouernment which lyeth vpon the shoulders of the king
great odds there was betweene the people and the king the enemies had to do with the people they imposed their persecutions as a yoke vpon them but when they come to deale with the king this yoke is turned into a gouernment
the same god that commanded light to shine out of darkenesse so altered the crosse of christ that it became to him the chaire of triumph
and this is the cause why princes weare it in their crownes in token that they are subiect to it and why it was of old set vp where triumphall arches were wont to stand that the world might haue so many witnesses as it were of the triumph of it
which superstition at length abused and therefore haue they in many places iustly been abolished though the originall of the erection of those crosses deserued rather praise than blame

but we may not omit to obserue the seeming contradiction that is in the prophets words at first it is said the gouernment shall be vpon his shoulders as if hee did beare it afterward it is said that hee shall sit vpon the throne and the kingdome as if it did beare him
the reconciliation is easie
the body politicke is like the body naturall the foundation of it stands vppermost the head stands aboue the feete and a man would thinke that the feet did beare the head but indeede the head beareth the feete
for were it not for the influence of sense and motion which the head deriues vnto the feete the feete could not sustaine themselues much lesse could they beare the body wee see it in a dead palsie that intercepts the intercourse of the spirits betweene the head and feet
we haue another simile also of our soules and our bodies
we would think that our body did containe our soule but indeed it is the soule that containes the body
for no sooner doth the soule part from the body but the heterogeneous parts fall asunder and this goodly frame commeth to nothing euen so fareth it betweene the prince and the people he seemeth to rest vpon the people as the head vpon the body but indeed the people doe rest vpon him and therefore in greek a king is called undefined span alphabet

quasi undefined span alphabet a phrase borrowed from a building whereunto the is compared and whereof the king is said to be the foundation
for a wise king as it is wisd
is the vpholding of the people and king dauid psal
the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolued beare vp the pillars thereof

and indeede the parts of euery state were they not vnited and supported by the soueraignty of the prince would sooner moulder and come to nought than doe the parts of our naturall body when it wants a soule for there is not so much nor so eager naturall ambition and coueteousnesse in the elements whereof our bodies consist whereby they striue to gaine the one vpon the other and to tyrannize the one ouer the other vntill the one hath wrought the others bane as there is ciuill both ambition and coueteousnesse in the members of euery state whereby the one striueth to get the vpperhand of the other and each man would denour his brother ephraim against manasses and manasses against ephraim and both against iuda as the prophet speaketh in this chapter vntill the kindome of israel be layd waste
whereas then in euery state there are rich and poore that the rich doe not deuoure the poore crafty and simple that the crafty doe not circumuent the simple strong and weak that the strong doe not offer violence to the weake the reason is there is a king rege incolumimens omnibus vna the king maintaines the concord
by him it commeth to passe that euery man sitteth quietly vnder his own vine and dwelleth safely vnder his owne roofe
mutiners and murmurers are therefore iustly to be abhorred who speake euill of authority and would withdraw their necks from obedience vpon this ground that superiours liue by the sweat of the inferiours browes being themselues deuoyd of care
their quarrell is like that which in menius agrippaes apologue the outward members of the body had against the stomacke they complained of his lazinesse and their owne painfulnesse and therfore conspired to starue him and ease themselues
they euen discouered their folly for soone after the hands began to faint and the leggs to faulter and the whole body to pine
then they perceiued that the stomacke which they condemned as lazie laboured for them and that they were beholding to the labour of the stomacke that themselues had any strength to labour so is it in the body politicke though the state of the prince is supported by the commons yet the spring of the commons wealth is the prouidence of the prince and soone would these streames dye if that fountaine were dammed vp
it is so in a ciuill state but in the spirituall state it is much more so
if a mortall prince bee so beneficiall vnto a temporall state much more is the immortall king of heauen and earth beneficiall to the state of his church sustaining and supporting the same
that which you haue heard of mortall princes sheweth rather what they should doe than what vsually they doe but this immortall king doth what he should hee is not so much aduanced aboue his people as his people are eased by him
he beareth them vp on his wings as an eagle doth her yongue ones as it is deut
but more amply esay
his care his prouidence and the efficacie thereof

are most aptly most significantly set downe there

but because of this we shall speake more hereafter when wee come to entreate of his excellent managing of his state wee will pursue that point no further nor trouble you further at this time
lord who art high in place and great in care in thy person and by vertue of thy bitter passion exercising thy prouidence which guides and supports the whole frame of and euery member in thy church lord wee beseech thee to guide vs that wee bee not and that wee faile not to sustaine vs so shall we neuer repine at thy sitting vpon vs thy kingdome seeing wee rest more vpon thee that art our king
and euer good lord so rule vs from heauen that wee may rest on thee in earth so shall wee beeing translated from earth vnto heauen fully rest and reigne with thee for euer
amen

the fovrth sermon
epigraph and his name shall be called the wonderfull counsellour the mighty god

the nature and excellencie of christs person are those two points of doctrine which haue beene obserued in this text the first haue ended you haue beene taught what christs person is what is his state come now to the excellencie of both
each hath an excellency there is an excellencie of the person and an excellencie of the state
the excellencte of christs person is to be seen in the endowments thereof which are contained in his stile but the excellencie of his state appeares in his managing thereof
beginne at the excellencie of the person which consists in the endowments and the endowments are exprest in the style
as mortall kings so this immortall hath his style proclaimed and his name shall be called his style expresseth indowments which are regall but spirituall regall they are
two vertues are peculiar vnto kings ouer and aboue those which they must haue in common with their subiects they are wisdome and power wisedome to prouide for and power to sustaine their estate
this king hath both he hath wisedome for hee is the wonderfull counsellour and he hath power for he is the mighty god

but as his indowments are regall so are they spirituall for they must be proportionable to the kingdome
his kingdome is not of this world for he is the father of eternity neyther is the condition of his people

worldly it is peace it is an heauenly not an earthly portion
hee is prince of this peace
these be the endowments of his person and of these we are to speake distinctly and in their order

and first they are giuen him in his style herein hee answereth mortall kings in that he proclaimeth his style lest his people should faile in their respect
for the greatnesse of respect ariseth with the greatnesse of the style we vse to looke vpon them with a more awfull eye in whom there are more grounds of awe
this hath made monarches in all ages to straine their titles to the vttermost as hee that reades the story of the assyrian the persian the romane monarches of old and the moderne histories both of barbarous and christian kings may easily perceiue
but here is the odds that their styles doe commonly shew rather what they should be than what they are
they are giuen them propter spem in hope they will proue as their titles import or else they shew what they would seeme to haue done rather than what they haue done indeed
and here flattery amplifieth beyond truth and maketh mountaines of molehils yea substituteth fables in stead of verities as might easily be proued if we would insist vpon their particular styles
you may reade the title of augustus giuen vnto such emperours as did not enlarge but diminish the empire of pater patriae to those that were so far from being fathers that they were plaine tyrants of pontifex maximus giuen to them which were so farre from seruing the gods that they did sacrilegiously canonize themselues for gods and yet propter spem the senate gaue them these titles and by flattery they did amplifie in the rest
he that had but a small conquest encreased his style as if he had conquered a whole kingdome as appeares in the styles of germanicus illiricus brytannicus
to omit the fabulous styles of the easterne monarches he that will may read them in their stories and see how ridiculous they are in claiming kindred of the gods of the starres and of what not which might amplifie their maiestie in a word hope and flattery are the best ground wherupon all mens worldly titles are built especially great mens and kings most of all
but it is not so with our king the truth in him is answerable to the titles that are giuen him
they are not giuen him propter spem but propter rem hee is that which he is called neyther is there in them any flattery yea his titles do come short of they do not exceed those perfections that are in him
so that we may not measure the style of christ as we doe the styles of mortall kings but conceiue rather more than lesse when we heare his style

marke also another difference between the style of christ and the style of mortall princes
mortall princes amongst other amplifications of their style are spoken vnto in abstracto you seldome heare of any salutations giuen to them but they are so conceiued maiestie dominion celsitude grace and the like as if they were framed of plato's idea vpon which diogenes played wittily scyathum video scythietatem non video and another applying it to princes obserues that before this style began vertues were in concreto the persons and the vertues met in one subiect but since they haue been separated and as we heare the vertue abstracted

from the subiect so doe we commonly see the subiect voyd of the vertue
but it is not so with christ but whereas he may iustly and doth sometimes not only to note the eminency of his vertue but also to note his godhead call himselfe by abstract names wisedome truth righteousnesse life yet doth hee vsually receiue his style in concreto to note that his manhood is endowed with these qualities from his godhead and that the subiect and the vertues goe in him both together

lastly wee must not beginne christs being this which he is called at the time when he is first called and so with seruetus question the godhead of christ as if it were no more ancient than this solemne proclamation of his style
for though then his endowments began to be manifested and communicated to his manhood yet as god hee had them from euerlasting from euerlasting was he the wonderfull counsellour the mighty god the father of eternity
but to leaue the preface and come to the indowments to the regall indowments
the first imports his wisedome hee is called the wonderfull counsellour
some seuer these words and make two titles of that which reade but as one one title of wonderfull and another of counsellour and so it may bee
wonderfull may well bee a title of christ nay a transcendent title which goeth through all his titles for not one of them is there in which we must not conceiue him to be wonderfull and wee cannot haue a better preparation to those meditations which we haue on the eminencie of christ than if we begin at wonderfull
admiration is but broken knowledge but it is the seed of perfect knowledge so perfect as we are capable of
it maketh vs when we study vpon the nature of god and of christ and the excellencies of both to conceiue a good rule which is that though god speakes undefined span alphabet yet we must vnderstand him undefined span alphabet and euer rise higher in our thoughts than we are led by the signification of the words
we must adde a degree of eminencie wherin they exceede all creatures such eminencie as we must adore because wee cannot comprehend it for they are wonderfull
euen the name of wonderfull be longs vnto them as appeares by the answer that was giuen to manoah in the booke of iudges when hee enquired after the name of the angell which appeared why askest thou after my name seeing it is wonderfull it were easie to shew how this title fits christ by running through the whole story of the gospell which to euery part setteth a marke of wonder to his birth to his life to his death to his resurrection to his ascention
will instance only in his birth because we now solemnize the memory thereof
in that appeare three great wonders
that natures so farre distant as god and man should bee ioyned in one person
that the nature of man should be conceiued in a virgins wombe that neuer knew man
that she should being her selfe conceiued in sinne conceiue a sonne without sinne
were there no other wonder these were enow to style christ wonderfull and to make it one of his peculiar titles

but because the fathers following the septuagint and the caldee haue coupled these words wonderfull and counsellour together and made of

them but one title and their opinion is made probable by the hebrew text and the other titles which are all compounded almighty god father of eternity prince of peace will so ioyne them and handle them as one title whereof there are two parts counsellour and wonderfull

christ is a counsellour
and here also marke the odds betweene mortall princes and this our king mortall princes and their counsell are distinct persons the weakenesse and the idlenesse or both of mortall princes wits maketh them to vse the counsell of others as it is euident in all states whereupon is grounded that prouerbe of salomon in the alundance of counsellours there is welfare
but here our king is the counsellour also hee is both king and counsell and that which the apostle hath out of the prophet who euer was his counsellour may well be applied to him
his vnderstanding is so large so cleare that it reacheth to all things and pierceth into the depth of all as st paul describeth it

and by it hee meaneth christ as it appeares by the close of his speech the word of god is sharper than any two edged sword and entreth in to the diuiding of the ioynts and the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts all things are naked before his eyes
and dauid sheweth that the night and the day to him are all one and the darkenesse is as cleare as the light

and as such is his ability so is his care answerable his wits are not idle he that keepeth israel doth slumber nor sleepe as it is psalm
his eyes are vpon his charge from the beginning of the yeare till the end thereof as it is deut
not a sparrow lights vpon the ground without his prouidence
so that he needes no counsell besides his owne he well deserues the name of undefined span alphabet of whom aristotle alledgeth that verse out of the greeke poet undefined span alphabet

but let vs come nearer the point
you haue heard that he is a counsellour but whereof cannot expresse better than by two of his vsuall titles the wisedome the word of god
he is consiliarius ad intra and ad extra beeing undefined span alphabet both undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet st iohn comprehendeth both in that sentence the son which is in the bosome of the father and so is undefined span alphabet hath declared himself vnto vs so is become undefined span alphabet
and our sauiour christ those things which haue heard of my father being consiliarius ad intra haue opened vnto you as consiliarius ad extra and so prouerbs
wisedome describeth her selfe as a counsellour both ad intra and ad extra with god and to the world

but what is the matter of this counsell surely the principall is the conenant betweene god and his church which st paul heb
calleth the vnchangeable counsell of god and god in the prophets speaking of the kingdome of christ calleth it his counsell not excluding all other secrets of god for christ is priuy to them all he is the lambe mentioned in the reuclation that only can open the sealed booke of gods hidden mysteries especially those that concerne his church
now christ as the wisedome of god was of counsell when this mysterie was resolued on before all time he was of counsell with god and when god was pleased

to reueale it then christ also became the counsellour vnto men as he was the word of god
these two things are comprehended in his counsellourship and in regard of both these may hee bee called wonderfull
it was a wonderfull course that this wisedome of god found out to worke the redemption of man by coupling of these natures and satisfying mercy and iudgement and that by man without sinfull man

and as the course is wonderfull so likewise is the communicating thereof seeing the power of god vseth such weake instruments
when wee behold the meanes wee cannot but wonder at the effects when wee see such heauenly treasures in earthen vessels and see such efficacie of the one shine through the infirmity of the other and behold the euidence of the spirit in the foolishnesse of preaching and see it casting downe of strong holds and captiuating vnto christ euery thought this must needs make it wonderfull
and wonderfull certainly will we acknowledge him to be if we consider these things for that is wonderfull which is aboue the reach of the vnderstanding
wee see the first royall title and christs first royall vertue which is his wisedome

the second followeth which is his power
primò opus est consulto deinde cum consulueris maturè opus est facto said the heathen orator for as it is true that vis consilij expers mole ruit sua so is it no lesse true that if wisedome not strength to execute her designes it is fruitlesse
therefore our king is as well armed with power as furnished with wisedome so that he is able to execute whatsoeuer he doth resolue
therefore his second style is the mighty god
el of it selfe signifieth mighty but it is communicated to others besides the true god to angels to men that are lieutenants of god or vsurpe the state of god all these haue a power but it is but a weake power in comparison and it is often times checked and curbed limited and stinted
the angels that are great in power are no farther powerfull than to doe gods will much more are men at gods controll hee refraineth the spirit of princes and maketh the stoutest of them to know that they are but men
the story of nebuchadnezzar in daniel who was for seuen yeares cast out of his pallace to liue amongst beasts and vpon his acknowledgement of the lord of heauen and earth was restored againe maketh this cleare
canutus a king of this land when flatterers magnified his power and did almost deifie him to confute them caused his chaire to bee set by the sea shore at the time of the floud and sitting in his maiestie commanded the waues that they should not approach his throne but when the tyde kept his course and wet his garments lo saith hee what a mighty king am by sea and land whose command euery waue dareth resist
though then they are mighty yet there is much weakenesse ioyned with their might not so christ
it appeares in the epithite that is added vnto el which is gibbor importing that he is a god of preuailing might in daniel he is called el elim the mighty of mighties whereupon moses magnifying his might saith who is like vnto thee

lord amongst the gods which words abbreuiated the maccabees in their wars against their enemies did bear in their standard

and therehence as the learned obserue did take their name of maccabees certainely this epithite is a lust ground of that which king dauid perswades psalme
ascribe vnto the lord yee mighty ascribe vnto the lord glory and strength

but there are two eminences in christs might by which hee is aduanced aboue all creatures
the first is that he is undefined span alphabet mighty of himselfe the second is that he is undefined span alphabet almighty undefined span alphabet other creatures haue their power from him and therefore their power depends vpon him so that he can at his pleasure intend or remit theirs but his owne continueth euer the same
secondly they can doe but euery one so much as is permitted him and neuer was there any creature to whom god imparted all his power speake not of the degree but the parts thereof some things he committeth to angels which men cannot doe and some things to men which angels cannot doe the earth hath not the power of the heauens nor the heauens of the earth but god is the fountaine of all power there is nothing done by any of these which without these he cannot doe ier
nothing is hard vnto him and the angel luke
nothing is impossible vnto god
therefore hee hath wrought the same effects without these creatures
what he doth by his angels ordinarily he extraordinarily hath done by himselfe and what doth hee by man which without man hee hath not done and as for the sunne and the starres he hath illightned the ayre without them and without the earth hath he prouided both bread and flesh yea at his pleasure he hath stript all those of their power in an instant in a word he doth whatsoeuer he will both in heauen and earth he cannot will that which he cannot doe nothing resisteth his will but all things readily do serue him

if this title be carried through the gospell euery point of the gospel will witnesse the truth thereof in christ it will witnesse that hee hath a preuailing power and that he is therefore worthily called a mighty god
when god promised him hee promised him in these words haue layd helpe vpon one that is mighty psalme
when god exhibits him

zacharie proclaimes him thus god hath raised vp a mighty saluation vnto vs in the house of his seruant dauid christ himselfe

all power is giuen to mee both in heauen earth
to say nothing of like titles that are remembred in the reuelation
but chuse rather to obserue vnto you out of both christs regall titles how well they fit vs what comfort they doe yeeld vnto vs our enemie the diuell is compared to a serpent to a roaring lion hee is full of craft and of great strength and so are his instruments the wicked subtill and violent but wee are silly and we are feeble
if we compare our selues to them how can we but feare to be deceiued to bee opprest see how god hath prouided for vs see how hee hath furnished christ whom hee sendeth vnto vs hee is a counsellour and it was a counsellour that wee needed that discouer vnto vs the serpents policie in his end and sophistrie in his meanes wherewith he setteth vpon vs he pretends that we shall be like vnto gods when he meaneth to make vs diuels and by setting an edge on our desire of the tree of the knowledge of

good and euill he would depriue vs of the tree of life but christ is at hand to discouer his purposes and to giue vs timely caueats that we bee not abused by them

secondly he still compasseth the world seeking whom he may deuour and is mighty to destroy
and certainely none should escape him were it not that we haue on our side a mighty god the seed of the woman that shewed himselfe so much mightier than the seed of the serpent by how much breaking of the head is more than bruising of the heele
wee haue a dauid for that goliah and a stronger man that hath entred that strong mans house bound him rifled him and diuided his spoyle
so that if now it be doubtingly asked shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawfull captiue bee deliuered we may answer with the prophet esay
thus saith the lord euen the captiues of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall bee deliuered for will contend with him that contendeth with thee and will faue thy children and all flesh shall know that the lord am thy sauiour and thy redeemer the mighty one of iacob
wherefore seeing christ is become our counsellour let vs not leane vnto our owne wisedome but be counselled by him
it is the second degree of wisedome when wee cannot aduise our selues to bee aduised by others if we faile herein the philosopher himselfe will censure vs for fooles
and remember withall that of the sonne of syracke bee in peace with many neuerthelesse haue but one counsellour of a thousand cap

hee giues the reason at large cap

and well may we rely vpon the iudgement of this counsellour who much better than elizeus can detect vnto vs the plots of the king of aram of all our enemies that we may prouide against them yea he can take them all in their owne wilinesse and infatuate their counsels as he did achitophels
reade esay

so did christ deale with the old serpent and with the broode of the serpent in all ages our age our country hath had proofe thereof
as this must encourage vs to rely vpon his counsell so must the other title encourage vs to rely vpon his power his preuailing power
we walk in the middest of our enemies and they vse the vttermost of their strength to ruine vs yet though we are in the middest of the valley of the shadow of death let vs feare none euill for they that trust in the lord are like vnto mount sion which shall neuer be remoued
lord guide vs by thy counsell support vs by thy power that wee be neyther circumuented nor quelled but by thy direction and protection we may escape both the craft and the force of all our enemies
so shall we euer glorifie thee as our admirable counsellour and our most mighty god

the fifth sermon
epigraph the euerlasting father the prince of peace

the excellencie of christs person consists in the indowments thereof which are regall but spirituall
that they are regall appeares in his two first titles whereof haue already spoken and that they are spirituall it will appeare by the other two whereof am now to speake
whereof the first sheweth that christs kingdome is not of this world he is the father of eternity the second sheweth that the condition of his people is not worldly christ is prince of peace
to begin with the first
in the originall the first of these two titles is so exprest as haue read it the father of eternity
and the words beare a double sense for either aeternity is made the attribute of the father and so by an hebraisme the father of eternity is no more than the eternall or euerlasting father so some translations reade it or aeternity may note that which is subiect to the father and so the title imports that he is a father of eternall things and so some translations reade the father of the world to come
we need not to bee troubled with this variety for the words will beare eyther translation and both these things concurre in the same person he that is the euerlasting father is a father of euerlasting things
we will therefore handle both and first shew you that christ is an euerlasting father
the phrase doth distinguish betweene our father and our father the father of our flesh and the father of our spirits
of whom st paul speaketh heb
of these two the first is temporall the other is aeternall that the first is but temporall wee may gather out of the fift of genesis where are reckoned vp the longest liued fathers that euer were in the world but of them all it is said that they begat children and then they dyed they left their children to the world
and as they so their posterity come within the compasse of that of iob man that is borne of a woman is but of a short time or as dauid speakes his dayes are but a spanne long
when he hath serued his course he goeth the way of all flesh and sleepes in his graue

neyther is he temporall only in regard that he must dye but also in regard that his affection is mutable
some parents destitute their children inforced by death but not a few put off the affection of fathers euen in their life and they in that respect also may be termed but temporall fathers
our sauiour christ speaking of the later times telleth vs that the father shall rise against the sonne as the sonne against the father
saint paul speaking of former times rom
amongst other wicked ones reckoneth

vp persons that were without naturall affection and it were an easie matter out of histories to report that many haue many haue murdered many haue deuoured their own children so farre vnnaturall haue they beene

in opposition vnto these two cases which apparantly conclude that the parents of our flesh are temporall temporall in regard that they are mortall in their nature and temporall in that they are mutable in their affections our sauiour christ is termed an euerlasting father death cannot take him from vs for euen in his death wherein notwithstanding his abode was so little that hee saw no corruption the hypostaticall vnion which made him a father did not cease
and as for his affection it is immutable whom he loueth hee loueth vnto the end of the perpetuitie of his being excellent is that place esay
doubtlesse thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of vs and israel acknowledge vs not thou lord art our father and our redeemer thy name is from euerlasting
and touching the perpetuity of his louing the church there speaketh also looke downe from heauen and behold from the habitation of thy holinesse and of thy glory where is thy zeale and thy strength the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercy towards me

are they restrained no they cannot bee restrained
for as god in this prophet speaketh elsewhere can a mother forget her child if she can yet will not forget thee saith the lord and king dauid when my father and my mother forsooke me the lord tooke me vp
this is the reason why our sauiour christ in the gospell biddeth vs call none father vpon earth for that we haue but one father which is in heauen hee liueth when the other dye and when the other hateth he continueth his loue and therefore is deseruedly called the euerlasting father

two good lessons are implyed herein the one teaching piety the other charity
we are taught piety when we are taught that he whom we obey is our father for if be a father saith the lord where is mine honour mal
and moses to israel deut
doest thou so reward the lord thou foolish people and vnwise is not he thy father that made thee
and as the very name of father teacheth piety so doth the name of euerlasting teach it much more
st paul argueth so heb
if so bee wee honoured the fathers of our flesh which are mortall as is our flesh how much more should we honour the father of our spirits which is immortall as is our spirits great reason haue we to reuerence this father that neuer ceaseth to be our father that hath prouided that euen when we lose our fathers we should yet stil haue our father haue him for our father which is the father of orphanes
it is no small comfort nor weake pillar of our faith that we neuer want a father yea our double birth readeth vs this lecture
for as we come out of our mothers wombe by the help of our mortall parents so to signifie that we haue immortall parents we are then borne againe in the churches wombe

neither doth this title teach vs only piety but charity also charity one towards another
for whereas our mortall parents extend their consanguinity and affinity but to a few this euerlasing father extends his vnto all

malachy worketh vpon this haue we not all one father

wherefore then do you iniury one to another the blood should neuer be cold seeing wee are all kinne in the first degree all brethren sonnes of one father euen of him that is here called the euerlasting father

but how commeth christ to be called father who otherwise is called our brother he being the sonne of god and god being his father as hee is ours if you respect the communion of those things whereof we both partake he is our brother but if the communication or deriuation of them he is our father for he is the second adam as the church is the second eue and as we are termed the sons of the church or of hierusalem the spouse so are we also of christ the bridegroome who begetteth vs in and by his church
wee beare the image of this second adam as wee doe of the first and his children are we whose image we beare therefore christ that saith will declare thy name vnto my brethren rom
saith esay
behold here am and the children which thou hast giuen vnto me
as hee is so he calleth himselfe sometimes brother sometimes father
and so haue you heard how he is the euerlasting father

but the words beare also another interpretation which is that hee is the father of euerlasting things
as hee is so are those things that are subiect vnto him both euerlasting
and this distinguisheth betweene this world and that which is to come making christ king of the later
st paul telleth vs heb
that god hath subiected vnto him the world to come
that temporall and eternall doe distinguish betweene these two worlds it is cleare in st paul teaching that those things which are seene are temporall but those which are not seene are eternall
and touching the things which are seene the preacher hath pronounced peremptorily vanity of vanities all is but vanity one generation passeth and another commeth and nothing abideth stedfast in the world

st paul biddeth vs vse the world as if we vsed it not because the fashion of this world passeth away
st iohn biddeth vs not to loue the world nor the things that are in the world

for this world passeth away and the lusts thereof
the psalmist telleth vs that they all waxe old like vnto a garment and st peter

that the heauens shall melt with heate and the earth with the workes thereof shall be burnt vp they shal be dissolued
for all are subiect vnto vanitie
but in the very same places where the temporalty of this present world is set down there is mention made of the eternity of that world which is to come you heard it out of the place to the corinths and the words in the psalme are very cleare

the children of thy seruants shall continue and their seed shall stand fast in thy sight and st iohn hee that fulfilleth the will of god abideth for euer
st peter intimateth as much and so doth salomon in the preacher
this our prophet that in the fortieth is willed to cry all flesh is grasse and the glory thereof is as the flower of the field the grasse withereth the flower fadeth is willed also to cry that the word of the lord endureth for euer

and this word is the incorruptible seede by which wee are it is the food by which wee are nourished which endureth for euer it is the riches which ney ther rust can corrupt nor theeues spoyle vs of

it setteth vpon our heads an immarcessible crowne and placeth vs in a kingdome

that cannot be shaken
all the graces wherein stands the life of christianity they are eternall graces they possesse vs of that which is eternall and make vs eternall possessours thereof
therefore well doth christ in this respect also receiue this title of the father of eternity

but eternity must be vnderstood parte post not parte ante
the eternity parte ante is gods prerogatiue to be so eternall is to bee without beginning
a creature hath his beginning and so farre is temporall but he may be continued for euer and so be eternall
and in this sense doth the prophet in this place speake of eternity and maketh christ the father thereof
and well may hee be called the father that was the author and is the disposer thereof for in his owne person hee first gaue being vnto this both grace and glory and from his person doth it streame vnto vs wee no otherwise enioy it than as wee haue vnion with him
and these three interests of christ in these things doe make him to be termed the father of this eternity
but now this title must looke back vnto the two formertitles and then wee shall see the sweetnesse that is in it
in the regall titles wee heard of that wisedome and power which wee may admire and adore but when heare that the wonderfull counsellour the almighty god is my father this sweetens these two glorious titles and maketh them the more comfortable to mee
for whom doth the wisedome of a father prouide but for his childe and for whom so readily as for his childe doth a father vse his power presume then of christs of christs supportance because christ is my father
hee that is the king is my father and what might not presume of a king of a father dare presume yea and presume it constantly for he is vnchangeable
my immortall father is not like my mortall that his wisedome or his power should steed me but for a time they will sticke to me for euer no death can take them from mee neither will they bee estranged vpon any dislike
can there bee greater comfort for a feeble for a sinfull soule than this assurance of such an euerlasting father

the comfort is great that appeares in the person but in the inheritance there appeares much greater for wherein hath or doth this my euerlasting father spend his euerlasting wonderfull wisedome and mighty power hath he spent them to prouide me a momentany estate is his inheritance like that which is left by my mortall parents such as may lose or must leaue no it is like himselfe his workes be are the image of his person they are eternall like himselfe
let then the world faile me let all earthly things be taken from me let them be vnto me as my parents naturall parents were but temporall yet shall not want
can as little be poor as bee an orphan my father neuer dyeth and the portion he giues mee endureth for euer
when reade of what stuffe moses made the tabercle salomon the temple much more when reade st iohns description of the heauenly ierusalem now perceiue gods meaning it is to let me vnderstand so farre as earth can shadow heauen how much more stable my inheritance of heauen is than the best inheritance can get here on earth

if it be of earth though on earth may haue euery childe of god hath the earnest the first fruits of that which wee exspect in heauen
and so haue you the first of these two titles which teach that christs royall endowments are also spirituall

come now to the second which sheweth that as christs kingdome is not of this world because it is as hee is not temporall but eternall so likewise the condition of it is not worldly it is peace
divus nerua saith tacitus duas res olim insociabiles coniunxit imperium libertatem
hee spake with the most that ascribed so much vnto nerua but of christ is may be most truly affirmed that where he raignes there is peace and free liberty for euery subiect
it is too vsuall with men the wiser they are the more to bee turbulent and disquieters of states the more power they haue the more to tyrannize it is not so with our king but hee that is wonderfull for counsell mighty for power bends both his counsell and his power to worke peace that peace which is the portion of his church and which none partake beside the members thereof
this prophet hath peremptorily pronounced there is no peace vnto the wicked saith my god

hee compares them to the sea still raging and foming casting out their owne shame salomon vnto vanity adds vexation of spirit
you may see it in the particular case of all wicked men that sure they haue no rest
they haue no rest ab intra they neuer can light vpon that which doth sistere appetitum which maketh them range in their desires in their endeauours neuer finding where to settle and ab extra too they are vnquiet for the of god driueth them like chaffe and like a floud it driueth them downe the streame
and indeed how should they bee quiet that are compared vnto the sea which when there is no storme cannot stand still but hath his flux and reflux and no wonder for it is the subiect of the moone than which nothing is more changeable
a fit embleme of the world vpon which whosoeuer dependeth cannot be stable when the world it selfe is so vnstedfast

but no greater argument can be brought for their want of quiet than that which is taken from the nature of peace and the nature thereof is insinuated in the word wherewith the holy ghost in the hebrew tongue expresseth it no tongue doth so vsually fit words to things and giue vs a notion of the things by the words
now the word shalom which signifieth peace doth in the roote containe two significations the one of perfection the other of retribution and these two comprehend the full nature of peace
wherein there is first perfection

what perfection is will shew you corporally that you may the better conceiue it spiritually
god hath made the eye to see and the eare to hear the eye seeth colours the eare heareth sounds that betweene those obiects and these senses there may be quiet the sense must be in good temper and the obiect such as will giue content if the sense bee sound and the obiect pleasing there groweth peace betweene them but if eyther the obiect bee not proportioned to the eye to please it and so likewise the sound to the eare or if the eare and the eye be vnsound so that it cannot endure the obiect then groweth vnquietnesse
as it is thus bodily so

spiritually there is an obiect that must be entertained by vs and wee must be fit to entertaine it gods word and his workes
if our senses be so sanctified that we can behold them and they doe so testifie gods will to vs that we receiue comfort by them then there is peace

apply this vnto the godly and you shall finde that the things of god doe alwayes giue them content and they delight to solace themselues in them yea though the crosse goe withall and they are exposed to worldly troubles yet euery good man is medijs tranquillus in vndis et si fractus illabatur orbis impauidum ferient rumae
as for the wicked it is not so with them for eyther they want those senses whereby they should entertain gods gracious countenance when it is present with them and so peace faileth in them for want of that wherewith they should receiue it or else if god giue them senses to see him they see nothing but iustice and wrath in him and so in regard of the obiect they haue no peace stupidity and senslesnesse of gods iudgements which sometimes doth befall them especially in prosperity maketh a shew of peace but indeed it is nothing lesse for if so bee the parts of our body and powers of our soule doe not worke vpon their proper obiects and in working finde content there is not the nature of peace peace so farre as it consists in perfection which vnderstood spiritually is nothing else but grace grace is the first kinde of peace which belongs vnto the church
besides this peace of perfection there is a peace of retribution
euery commandement as it hath his precept so it hath his sanction also and as we are commanded in the one so wee haue a promise in the other glory is promised for grace and the seruant to whom the master saith well done shall enter into his masters ioy he shall haue peace for peace yea peace vpon peace the peace of heauen heaped vpon that peace which he had in earth which is nothing else but the reward of godlinesse

you see the two branches of peace perfection and retribution of both these christ is prince hee is the author both of grace and glory the true king of salem

the true salomon the true noah whom st paul calleth our peace

at whose birth the angels sung in earth peace whose first sermon that he commanded his apostles to preach was peace be to this house who taking leaue of his disciples

gaue them peace when he went to his death

when he rose from the dead finally as the apostle saith slew hatred and set at one all things both in heauen and earth
the prophets euery where speak of his kingdome as of a kingdome of peace
read psalm
esay


that the inheritance wee shall haue is eternall you heard before but the inheritance of the wicked is eternall also goe ye cursed shall the iudge say into euerlasting fire and they haue a worme that neuer dyeth but theirs is a miserable eternity an vnquiet inheritance hunger and thirst nakednesse and paine chaines and vtter darkenesse weeping and gnashing of teeth are their portion and where these are what trouble is there not but ours is a better eternity it is a peaceable one as wee shall euer bee so shall we euer be at quiet at quiet passiuely nothing shall disquiet vs at quiet actiuely we shall disquiet none
wee shall be pacati and pacifici sit

at rest our selues and disturbe none
it shall be so in heauen fully in earth it should be so in a good measure for gods will should be done in earth as it is in heauen and we should begin our heauen here vpon earth
we should beginne to exercise the peace of perfection and foretaste the peace of retribution that so we might haue a good experiment and giue the world a good testimonie that we are the subiects of the prince of peace

will set god before mine eyes and will try how mine eyes can behold god and if finde that mine eye delights to behold him that his countenance puts gladnesse into my heart when doe behold him am sure we are at peace
for were wee not eyther haue no eyes and doe not see him or when doe shall be confounded with the sight of him
will open mine eares and will heare god in his word and if when heare him the law of his mouth is sweeter vnto mee than hony and the hony combe know we are at peace were we not must needs be like adam heare and fly
and if in the dayes of my mortality can attaine this peace of perfection doubt not but in the dayes of my immortality shall attaine vnto that higher peace the peace of retribution all teares shall be wiped from mine eyes all sickenesse from my body all blindnesse from my vnderstanding all vntowardlinesse from my will
this ciuill discord of the flesh and the spirit and that greater betweene my conscience and god how much more these lesser discords that are between me and other men shall fully cease and be abolished for euer the prince of peace shall consummate my peace
and so haue you those two titles of christ which shew that we must vnderstand spiritually those two former titles which you heard before doe royally belong vnto him
should now farther shew you that the scripture giues christ many names because one or few cannot fully expresse him or at least we cannot fully sound the depth of that name when it is giuen vnto him
the name of iesus is a rich name and so is the name of christ the vsuall names by which our sauiour was called but the riches of those names are vnfoulded vnto vs in these particular titles and wee must take these as commentaries vpon those for as it is in the eleuenth of this prophecie the spirit which rested vpon christ was manifold how manifold the holy ghost doth there describe in abstracto but here to like purpose he speaketh of christ in concreto
the time will not suffer me to parallel these and the like places this is our rule that as our nature delights in variety so there is a variety in christ to giue full content vnto our nature and wee must not lightly passe by any one of his titles seeing euery one of them promiseth so much good vnto vs

lord that being my lord art pleased to be my father such a father as that neede not feare that shall euer be an orphan and hast prouided me an inheritance that shalbe as lasting as my selfe that when all other fayle mee shall bee enioyed by mee an inheritance most comfortable because therein consists my perfection and thy retribution the retribution

of glory wherewith thou dost crowne the perfection of grace grant that neuer want that piety which owe vnto my father that charity which owe vnto my brethren
let my heart goe where my best treasure is and let that peace which passeth all vnderstanding haue the vpper hand in me let me feele it let me practise it so in heart that may haue the fulnesse of both sense and practice of it in the kingdome of heauen
amen

the sixth sermon
epigraph of the increase of his gouernment and peace there shall bee no end vpon the throne of dauid and vpon his kingdome to order it and to establish it

in christ whom the prophet describeth here vnto vs obserued a double excellencie one of his person and another of his state the first haue already handled come now to the second the excellencie of the state
which stands in a boundlesse growth of the kingdome and a constant policie of the king that is the effect wherof this is the cause
but more particularly in the effect obserue that there is a growth the prophet calleth it an increase a growth of the gouernment and a growth of the peace both partake of the same increase
and the increase of both is boundlesse there is no end of it no bounds of place it ouerspreadeth all no bounds of time it endureth for euer the word beareth both
of this effect or boundlesse growth of the kingdome the cause is the constant policie of the king
which consisteth in the exercise of his two roy all indowments of his wisedome hee shall order and to order is nothing else but to employ that wisedome which christ hath as a wonderfull counsellour of his power he shall support and to support what is it but to employ his power the power that he hath as he is a mighty god hee employeth them both his wisedome his power
but they may bee employed eyther well or ill according as the rule is by which they proceed christ employeth them well his rule is good it is iudgement and iustice he cals all to an account and measures to all as they are found vpon their triall
this is the policie
and herein he is constant he continueth it without ceasing from henceforth euen for euer so that of the euerlasting effect there is an euerlasting cause

you see what is the summe or substance of this second excellencie but that you may see it better let vs runne ouer the parts briefly and in their order

and first we are to obserue how answerable the excellencie of the state is to the excellencie of the person one goeth not without the other
christus naturalis will haue christum mysticum conformable vnto him the body to the head where he vouchsafeth an vnion of persons he vouchsafeth a communion also in the dignity of the persons

it appeares in the name he is called christ which is annoynted with oyle of gladnesse and we are called christians we partake of the same oyle
his name is but an oyntment poured out as it is in the canticles

poured out like that precious oyle vpon aarons head which ranne downe to the skirts of his garment

all christs garments and the church in esay is compared to a garment smell of myrrhe aloes and cassia as it is psalme
this is taught by diuers similies of the wiues communicating in her husbands honour and wealth the branches partaking of the fatnesse and sweetnesse of the roote the members deriuing of sense and motion from the head so that our king is not like the bramble that receiueth all good and yeelds none to the state but hee is like the the vine the oliue they that pertaine to him are all the better for him they are conformable to him if he haue an excellencie they shall haue one also
a good patterne for mortall kings and gouernours who should herein imitate the king of heauen that as when a man seeth an excellent work he ghesseth that the worke man was excellent though he see him not so the eminency of the gouernour may be seene when hee is not seene it may be seene in the eminencie of his people
surely the corporall heauen doth not more declare the glory of god

nor the corporall firmament his handy worke than the mysticall heauen and the firmament of the church doe set forth vnto the world the glory of christ

but enough of the correspondencie of one excellencie to another let vs descend now to the particulars of the later and speake first of the growth

and here we see how christus mysticus doth answer christum naturalem also
in describing of the king the prophet beganne at his childhood of which st luke saith that christ grew in wisedome in stature and in fanour both with god and man
and what doth the word increase intimate but a childhood as it were of the church from which it groweth forward certainely the scripture doth follow the simile and fetcheth as christ out of his mothers wombe so the children of god out of the churches wombe by a new birth
and as christ sucked his mothers breast so doe these children liue at first by reasonable milke as saint peter speaketh suckt from the churches two breasts the old

and the new testament
as he so they come at length to stronger meat and both come to the age of a perfect man christ naturally the church mystically

and this doctrine is taught by other similies also
in the prophets wee reade of which grew and spread farre

of the little stone in daniel cut without hands which grew into a great mountaine
in the gospell

the kingdome of heauen is compared to mustard seed the least of seeds but not of the least growth it becommeth a tree and it is compared to leauen and who knoweth not how that disperseth it selfe throughout the whole lumpe

but this is plain in the story crescite multiplicamini was a blessing that concerned as well the spirituall as the naturall propagation of man both had a like small beginning
before the floud one adam and one eue from whom sprang all the children of god after the floud there was but one family to people all the world and but a piece of that to people the church
abraham had but one isaac whose was to become a mighty nation hee that marketh how it encreased in egypt will say that it encreased indeed
come to the new testament what a small beginning had the church thereof but what an increment doe we find of it and when the gospel was in this later age new planted how few were they from whom it spread it were no great matter to weary you with relating out of the prophets texts that handle this increase
but it needeth not the matter is plaine
and this is the vse euen the comfort of the church that when we see but a cloud no bigger than that of elias wee may prognosticate that the whole heauens shall bee ouercast there will follow more as truly as when a few graines are sowen there will arise many eares and each loaden with many graines
god somewhere in the prophet vseth that simile and speaking of the church hee promiseth that hee will sow it with the seed of men so that wee may vse those words of zachary

who hath despised the day of small things for they shall reioyce and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seuen they are the eyes of the lord which runne to and fro through the earth
for there is an increase and this increase is boundlesse

but before come to the measure of the increase must a little obserue what that is which doth increase it is here specified to be the gouernment and the peace thereof
what the gouernment and what the peace is you heard before at this time am onely to obserue that both of them increase for it is remarkeable that they both increase
when mortall princes inlarge their dominions they are faine withall to encrease their garrisons
witnesse the romane empire which neuer kept so many armies as when they had most prouinces
and no maruell for what they conquered by the sword they were faine to hold by the sword
for but for feare they were not obeyed by them whom they held by force
quem metuunt oderunt et quem quisque odit periisse expetit are too euident and too much experienced rules
all nations haue had the triall of it in their conquests

but it is not so with the kingdome of christ where hee enlargeth his dominions he bringeth peace the inseparable companion of his dominions and why he maketh all his subiects naturall
the romanes in the end found that to be the best policie to denizen whole countreyes whom they conquered and giue them the same immunities with the citizens of rome
and sure this was a better prouision for their peace than the sword could bee
but this was but a morall perswafion vnto peace

it could not worke the heart and alter it that was still indisposed thereunto as appeares by many rebellions and warres of those that had these immunities when fit occasion was offered them

but our sauiour christ changeth the heart
in the eleuenth of this prophesie it is excellently figured by the cohabitation of the wolfe and the lambe the leopard and the kid haue men neuer so saluage dispositions yet when they come vnder the gouernment of christ they put them off and become as meeke as tame as the lambes and kids in the flocke of christ
he that readeth the stories how barbarous other countries yea our own countrey was before it was christianed will acknowledge the truth hereof
will only instance in two well knowne persons
st paul and st austine what they were before they haue each of them registred with their own pennes st paul in his epistles st augustine in his confessions what they became who knoweth not that hath read the writings of them both the ground of all is none commeth vnder christs gouernment but hee is not so much naturalized as indeed made a naturall subiect and we see in our own country how true the affection is as of a naturall prince to his subiects so of naturall subiects to their prince
this city lodgeth no garrison neyther doth any other except the frontier towne that is armed against the forraigne enemie and yet we all readily obey euen so is it and much more so in the kingdome of christ where the gouernment commeth peace commeth with it they both goe together they both increase

but how farre surely without stint of time or place of the encrease saith our prophet there is no end
where the prophets doe speake of the increase of the gouernment they ioyne withall the increase of the peace
psalme
esay
micah

the increase is as termed it boundlesse it hath neyther limits of place nor period of time
the hebrew word beareth both and so doth the syriacke which luke
is vsed in the same argument
in the hebrew text the word marbe hath contrary to the vsuall orthography mem clausum for mem apertum some impute it to the errour of the scribes but the vniformity of all copies disproues that seeing it is not like that all should commit the same errour especially seeing they wrote not all out of one copy
whereupon the diuines suppose that there is some mystery therein what the mystery is they are not agreed some would haue it to be but a circumstance a circumstance of the time when christ should bee borne mem vnderstood numerally signifieth
and about
yeares after this prophesie christ was borne othersome not content with this circumstance seeke for a mystery in the substance of the description of christ and here their iudgements vary also for some respect christum naturalem and some christum mysticum
they that respect christum naturalem suppose that the strangenesse of the character signifieth the strangenesse of christs birth which was not to be after the ordinary course of man they that respect christum mysticum obserue that the squarenesse of mem pointeth out the foure quarters of the world and the closenesse of mem the perpetuity of time for that you cannot see in the letter where it ends
and if there

bee any mysterie this is the likeliest for seeing this letter falleth out to be in those words wherein the prophet speaketh de christo mystico it is like the mysterie concerneth christum mysticum and noteth the boundlesse increase thereof in place and time

but to leaue this mysterie
the phrase doth plainly obserue a difference between the church in the old testament and the church in the new that had bounds this hath none
the bounds of the old church were the limits of the holy land which you may reade in moses and in iosuah the like difference is obserued in the old and in the new ierusalem the old ierusalem had wals but zachary cap

saith that the new should bee inhabited without wals
and indeed here wee see the truth of the promise made to abraham he is a father of many nations
as in sarahs name we saw the royalty of the king so in abrahams the amplitude of the kingdome
we may likewise apply hereunto the story of iacobs two sonnes iuda a type of the king and ioseph of the kingdome his very name soundeth the increase thereof and iacob describeth in his blessing this blessing of increaso
but to come to the plaine cuidences in thy seed said god to abraham shall all nations of the earth be blessed and psalme
aske of mee saith god to christ and will giue vnto thee all nations for thine inheritance and the vttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
omit the rest of the prophets the psalmes haue texts enow all nations shall remember themselues and be turned to the lord reade psalm
come to the new testament many shall come from the east and from the west from the north and from the south saith christ and shall sit downe with abraham isaac and iacob in the kingdome of heauen matth


he maketh the whole world the field wherein god soweth his seed and speaking of the end of the world he giueth vs the meaning of that parable saying that the gospell must be preached to all nations
but most excellent is that acts
where when the holy ghost descended it pleased god that there should be of all nations vnder heauen some that should hear undefined span alphabet the wonderfull workes of god euery one in his owne languagne
so that the gospel was preached to all nations before the apostles stirred from ierusalem
and who can tell whether they were not harbingers vnto the apostles to prepare a people for christ against their comming thither the place also in the reuelation cap

is very cleare where after the sealing of those that were israelites iohn saw a multitude of all nations which none could number triumphing as members of this kingdome
finally st paul compares the circuit of the sunne of righteousnesse rom
vnto the circuit of our corporall sunne both compasse the world no place is hid from the light or heat of eyther of them

you see it hath no bounds of place neyther hath it any bounds of time
as it is the largest monarchie that euer was for none of these foure notable ones euer tooke vp halfe so much ground so is it the most lasting also iesus christ yesterday to day and the same for euer
you haue it in the type of dauid and saul whereof the kingdome of the one was temporall but of the other eternall as it is sam

the angel repeateth the

same promise luke
the psalmes doe often vrge it psalme
so doe the prophets esay especially they all concurre in this that the kingdome shall haue no end
christs words are short but they are full the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile against it

and behold here another excellent difference between mortall kingdomes and this heauenly
mortall kingdomes are not lasting and while they last they continue not vniform they haue their clymactericall years and commonly determine within certaine periods
the politicians write of it bodin by name and he out of others and the stories are cleare that it is so
iustin hath calculated the three first but slèidan all foure and wee see their beginning and their ending
and as they are not lasting so while they last they continue not vniforme
the planters of great states are commonly heroicall men but the prouerb is heroum filij noxae the parents were neuer so beneficiall as the children are mischieuous oppressing by tyrannie or wasting by vanity worldly peace breedeth plenty plenty breedeth luxury and luxurie breedeth warre wherewith commeth ruine
this being the condition of mortall kingdomes how blessed is this kingdome that is boundlesse in place and time both for gouernment and for peace
if a man would choose himselfe an habitation would he not pitch there where he might haue the most commerce and the safest harbour see then our vanity that for the most part wrong our selues herein and preferre the world before the church desire to bee of that corporation rather than this where wee haue lesse scope and more trouble doe wee rather choose to make our abode than where the bounds are wider and the peace is neuer interrupted say there is more scope in the church than in the world not only more lasting peace because though there bee few that shall bee saued yet those few are all at one but of those that perish it is true quot capita tot sensus there are as many factions almost as persons they iarre as much between themselues as they doe with the godly and in that respect the godly may be said to be most in number

but there are two cautions to be obserued in this boundlesnesse of the church one concerning the bound lesnesse thereof in regard of place another concerning the boundlesnesse thereof in regard of time
touching the former whereas the church is said to spread it selfe ouer the whole world we must not only vnderstand it de generibus singulorum not de singulis generum in all nations but also obserue that christ which hath ius ad omnem terram hath not at the same time ius in omni terra the proprietie of all is his but he taketh possession of it successiuely and by parts
as the scope of the sunne is all the world and yet at one time the sunne doth not shine in all parts thereof it beginneth in the east and passeth to the south and so to the west and as it passeth forward bringing light to one place withdraweth it from another so is it in regard of the sunne of righteousnesse the easterne countries the foutherne haue had his light which now are in darknesse for the most part and we that were more northerly doe now enioy the clearest but the sunne beginneth to rise to them in the west and it is too plaine

that our light beginneth to grow dimme it is to bee feared that it hasteneth to their meridian and whether after their noone it will then set god knoweth
the cause hereof is not lest we mistake in the sunne of righteousnesse as the cause why all haue not light at one time is in the corporall sunne the corporall sunne cannot at one time illighten all the sunne of righteousnesse can but for the sinnes of the people the candlesticke is remoued and giuen to a nation that will beare more fruit
we interpose our earthlinesse between our selues and the sun and so exclude our selues from the beames thereof

a second caution concerneth the time
the peace and the gouernement are said to be euerlasting but they may bee considered in fieri or in facto when they are once consummated they shall bee continued for euer but while they are in fieri the rebellion of the flesh against the spirit interrupts the gouernment and the conscience of sinne within and the crosse without interrupt the peace
yet both are lasting pro modo viatoris in the roote though not in the fruite the principles of obedience which are repentance and faith by which wee recall our selues and the principles of peace which are faith and hope by which we pacifie our selues inwardly and patiently sustaine what befals vs outwardly continue for euer yea and disobedience repented of maketh vs more obedient and the interruption of peace breedeth vs more peace more peace inwardly we haue the lesse we haue outwardly and after our reconciliation with god we do more comfortably enioy the light of his countenance but when wee are comprehensores then our obedience shall bee entire and our peace be full and both without end

the last note is that which is the life of all to wit the vse that wee must make of it
although we cannot say of a body consisting of heterogeneous parts that eadem est ratio vnius omnium yet when it consists of homogeneous parts wee may say it truly cannot say that my hand is my head or my head is my hand or that in the one see the nature of the other but whereas of flesh euery part is flesh in the least part see the condition of the whole
the church hath a double consideration so farre as these children are subiects of the kindome they are all homogeneous parts but as they haue seuerall functions so they are heterogeneous parts
we haue not all the same graces of edification but the same graces of adoption we should all haue though we be not all prophets all apostles all workers of miracles all pastors yet are wee all children of god seruants in his house subiects in his kingdome euery man so farre is a little catholicke church at least should bee
and wee should all try our selues by the rules of my text whether we find in our selues the gouernment of christ in our voluntary subiection to him the peace of christ in his comfortable influence into our consciences
wee must try how these things increase in vs how we daily profit in both and we should profit so farre as that no part of our body norpower of our soule should be withdrawne from christs gouernment there should bee no part or power of eyther that doth not partake of the sweetnesse of his peace
they should doe so and euery day should they doe it as they

must exclude christ from no place so must they exclude him at no time

but alas many of vs are no subiects at all wee are sonnes of belial few of vs growing subiects but catholickesubiects there are none on earth for how many holds hath sathan in vs in our bodies and in our soules out of which we keep christ the lawfull owner of them and for time it were well if we paid a tenth part therof vnto christ but we afford him not so many houres as we do yeares vnto the diuell
we are like vnto the image in daniel which had a golden head siluer shoulders brazen thighes feet of clay and iron the lower the worser and we the longer we liue commonly the worse wee are the first time wee come to christ we are at the best
how it is with particular persons let euery man aske his own conscience
certainly it is so with whole churches what zeale what charity was there in the dayes of the apostles but it was of no long continuance
the fathers that write of the persecutions say that god sent euery one of them to correct in his church the decay both of zeale and charity
when the gospell reuiued with vs those that are old may remember how religious this kingdome was both within the church and without and what a friendly conspiracie there was between true deuotion and honest conuerfation
but may not christ say now to vs as he said to the church of ephesus haue somewhat against thee

because thou hast left thy first loue
nay rather may not he repeat the words which hee sent vnto the church of sardis know thy workes

thou hast a name that thou liuest but art dead
certainely true piety true charity is dead amongst vs
conclude all with christs exhortation

let vs remember from whence wee are fallen and repent and doe our first workes lest he come vpon vs quickely and remoue our candlesticke out of his place because we doe not repent

lord that hast vouchsafed to place thy gouernement amongst vs and with this gouernment to giue thy peace we beseech thee that hast planted them so to water them that both may grow in vs and let vs set no bounds to that which thou wouldst haue boundlesse let not our whole church let not any member thereof withhold ought that should be subiect vnto thee eyther in soule or body
and let our whole soule our whole body bee comforted with thy peace finally let them last as they grow both gouernment and peace in all in euery one of vs and that world without end
let neyther end in this world where they are subiect to danger so shall both last for euer in that world that is to come where they shall be free from all danger
amen

the seventh sermon
epigraph to order and to establish it with iustice and with iudgement for euer

the excellencie of christs state standeth in a boundlesse growth of the kingdome and a constant policie of the king
of the boundlesse growth haue already spoken come now to the constant policie
this is the cause whereof that was the effect and as the effect is answerable to the cause so the cause is not inferiour to the effect it must bee such as is likely to produce it and so is this
let vs consider it
the policie is the exercise of the royall endowments of the kings wisedome and of his power of his wisedome for hee doth order and to order what is it but to shew himselfe the wonderfull counsellour of his power for he doth support and what is it to support but to shew himselfe the mighty god but both these may be done ill or well christs are well done for in doing both he followeth a good rule his rule is iudgement and iustice
hee calleth all to an account and hee deales with all vnpartially
and this hee doth constantly from henceforth and for euer
for of an endlesse effect the cause must also be endlesse
these be the particulars which now we must handle
beginne at the first

and the first thing that obserue herein is that as christ hath endowments so hee vseth them to that end for which hee receiued them
no creature though destitute of reason but keepeth his course they let vs see in their working wherefore they were ordained the sunne giueth his light the fire his heat the water moistnesse the earth beareth fruit in all creatures you may reade this lesson deus natura nihil faciunt frustra
and if creatures voyde of reason deale so much more should those that are indued with reason they should not be like the vuprofitable seruant that wrapped his talent vp in a napkin and hid it but as st peter aduiseth euery one as he hath receiued the gift

so must hee dispose it as a good steward of the manifold graces of god
certainly christ doth so and hee is a good precedent vnto euery one of vs especially vnto those of place and authority bee it in church or their gifts must not be idle seeing there was an end for which they were bestowed vpon them

as they must not be idle so must each be applyed vnto his proper end for praestat otiosum esse quam nihil agere to busie our gifts and not intend that whereat euery one must ayme is an vnprofitable businesse
and

much businesse of this nature there is in the world which is the cause why st paul doth blame certaine persons whom he calleth busie bodies tim

mark then that our sauiour doth employ his endowments and employ them fitly
wisedome is appointed to order and hee doth order by his wisedome power is appointed to support and he doth support by his power

but let vs looke further into eyther of these
christ doth order order his kingdome therefore it was out of order
the physitians medicine doth intimate the patients disease and wee doe not vse to set in order that which was not out of order
and indeed this kingdome of israel was out of order in the temporall state it was when christ came as it was when dauid came to the crowne
when dauid came to the crown he professed all the land is dissolued beare vp the pillars thereof
it was much more so when christ came in the dayes of herod as hee that readeth flauius iosephus writing of the life of herod may easily perceiue
at what time iacobs prophesie appeared true the scepter was gone

the ceased whereupon ensued that which amos foretold the tabernacle of dauid fell to the ground it was so with the temporall state
but christ meddled not with that hee left vnto caesar that which was caesars his endeauour was that god might haue what was due to god

as the temporall state was out of order so was the ecclesiasticall much more it appeares in the gospel where christ layeth open the abuses of the priests and of the scribes of the pharisees and of the saducees it was their abuses that he came to reforme to set in order
secondly this word remembreth vs of the apostles rule cor
god is not the god of confusion but of order
confusion is from the diuell but order is from god especially in the church which st paul resembleth to our body wherein the parts are fitly disposed and euery one keepeth his place the eye the head the hand the feete one vsurpeth not the function of the other in answerablenesse whereunto the apostle telleth vs that all are not prophets all are not apostles cor
and cap

exhorts all men as god hath called them so to walke
a good rule for these dayes wherein the hands yea and the feete too take vp the roome of the head and euery man thinketh himselfe fit to bee a teacher both by his penne and tongue whose place notwithstanding is amongst the learners christ came to reforme such disorders
but the order that christ setteth in his kingdome must bee learned from that order which wise kings set in their temporall kingdomes they doe order their subiects two wayes inter se and ad bonum commune they take care that there shall be a variety of professions and that all those shall bend themselues to procure the common good euen so should it be in the church christ bestoweth diuers gifts but all for the edification of his church
and as in the a man doth not liue orderly if he only follow a trade except the be the better for it no more doth he liue orderly in a church that doth ought by which the whole church is not benefited

the last thing that is to bee obserued in this order and which indeede

is the chiefest of all is the ordering of each man in himselfe

in the creation god set in man an excellent order subiecting as the whole man to himselfe so in man the body to the soule the appetite to reason whatsoeuer inferiour faculties to their superiours but time put all these things out of order and man which from his better part should be denominated spirituall is from his worser part called carnall and more vsually doth the scripture call him sensuall than rationall
the holy ghost meaneth thereby to intimate the disorder that is grown by sinne and the order that we are to expect from christ who commeth to set vs in frame and to vse the apostles words ephes
to set vs in ioynt that euery part of man should keepe his order and none in working exceed his measure
it is one of the curses that god in esay threatneth to the kingdome of israel that the vile person shall set himselfe against the honourable
and it is no small curse in euery one of vs to haue the worser part command the better and command it will except christ doe order except he doe vse his first royall endowment
but as he vseth the first so must he vse the second also for as the kingdome is out of order so is it weake also and the establishing presupposeth this weakenesse yea indeed weakenesse is the cause of disorder men fall to disorder through weaknesse
the weakenesse of the ciuill state of israel is cleare in the storie for the israelites were become enthralled to the romanes and had no power to relieue themselues though they were exposed to all kinde of ignominie and cruelty as he that readeth flauius iosephus will confesse
it was bad with them in the assyrian captiuity but in the romane much worse and it was this weakenesse that the iewes thought their messias should support who reiected christ because hee came not into the world as a likely person to doe this to crush their enemies and to make them a mighty nation according to the prophecies which not only affirme they should be so but set it out in diuers similies as you may reade in esay in zacharie and in others that they should thresh all nations as a heauy stone should grinde them should bee as a soporiforous cup and as fire working vpon stubble
these places they vnderstood literally which indeed should haue been vnderstood spiritually

another weakenesse for they had another kinde of weakenesse was disability to doe well whereby they were carried captiues vnto sinne as st paul speaketh rom
and that was it which enfeebled them as god had threatned deut
and gaue their enemies power ouer them christ came to remedy this weaknesse

to strengthen these weake hands and feeble knees as you may perceiue in that excellent description thereof which zacharie hath cap

where god promiseth power to all the house of israel and sheweth that the feeblest of them shall be like vnto dauid and the house of dauid like vnto the angels
st paul ephes

describeth the armour wherewith wee are strengthened and telleth vs that it is the power of the lord and cap

he telleth vs that therewith we are strengthned in the inward man and to the hebrewes cap

telleth vs that by faith many of weake became strong euen so strong that st paul saith of himselfe phil

hee could doe all things through him that strengthned him

which is christ
finally this is the strength for which he so often prayeth when he prayeth for the church it is the strength whereby we may be able to encounter our chiefe enemies which are ghostly and to performe the duties which concerne a christian life
the substance of our faculties was not abolished by sinne but the sinewes were enfeebled as wee hold in the question of
try it in the particulars and you may perceiue it our vnderstanding had proportionable strength to the obiect thereof the truth of god to apprehend it and the will to the obiect thereof our soueraigne good to embrace it so had all the affections the strength that was expedient for such attendance vpon the will to further our possession of the obiect thereof but now euery one of these is disabled by sinne and it is christs grace that enableth them againe giuing vs such wisedome such holinesse such courage and desires as are expedient for a childe of god to bring him vnto and keepe him in enioying of his finall end
and this power is that power by which wee must ouerthrow our enemies if they be irreconcileable as the diuell and his angels are we foile them when they can fasten no sinne vpon vs then we break the serpents head when his craft cannot delude vs and his taile too when we continue starres in the firmament notwithstanding his violent striking at vs and though he roare like a lion yet we continue stedfast in the faith whether both these be vsed immediately by himselfe or mediately by his instruments
and if the enemies be reconcileable then the conquest of them by this power is not the foyling of their bodies or spoyling of their goods but the casting downe in them of all imaginations

and euery high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of god and bringing into captiuity euery thought to the obedience of christ and in this manner did the apostles conquer and the christians in the primitiue church all these holds that were possessed by sathan and imposing the easie yoke of christ vpon the wits and wils of all nations
and in this sense should the iewes haue vnderstood the prophets and made dauids kingdome a type not of historicall correspondencie but of mysticall presignificancy for other power they meant none none that should appeare in this world
and the popes of rome are iewish that herein stand for a temporall power ouer kings direct or indirect whereby they may the scepters and dispose of the crownes of princes
christ left vnto his church no other sword than that which commeth out of his mouth which elsewhere is called the breath of his mouth

and the word of god which is sharper than any sword and workes in it by no other power as it is a church though hee hath not abolished the ciuill sword nor rebated the edge thereof in peace or warre but strengthned it rather in proceeding vpon lawfull and legall grounds
but the ciuill power is not to bee confounded with the power of the gospell the power of the church and the power of the distant in toto genere and it is the power of the church that is meant here that is the power which christ established

and marke it is not enough for christ to order except he establish
it was the case of adam hee was well ordered but hee was not established

and thereupon the good order became mutable and all the gifts of god be they not well rooted and founded in vs will come to nought and fall to disorder
so that stability signifieth the preseruation of that good order which wisedome sets and is the principall blessing of the gospell wherein standeth the prerogatiue of adam regenerated aboue adam created and it is that which christ promiseth in the gospell and for which the apostles doe pray in their epistles namely for prescruation and stedfastnesse in the truth and christ in his prayer before his passion doth specifie it expresly
if we consider the mutability of our nature which comming of nothing is still prone to returne to nothing especially being wrought vpon by the diuell and the world you will not so much wonder that the children of israels garments did not cleane weare out in their forty yeares passage through the wildernesse as that the garment of regeneration which we receiue in baptisme weareth not out all the daies of our pilgrimage in this world

but we must not mistake stability doth not exempt vs from stormes yea stormes that may shake our house and peraduenture vntile some part thereof and breake some boughes off from our tree but the foundation the roote are immoueable the house the tree shall neuer fall
and this is the vttermost of that stability which we must expect in this world the gates of hell shall not preuaile valere poterunt non poterunt praeualere
we shall experience that they had might but not might enough to ruine vs they may giue vs wounds but none that are vncurable they may bruise our heele but shall not be able to breake our head we are so farre established in this world and in the world to come wee shall be established farther euen so farre as to be free from all stormes and all wounds we shall not be at all moued
you heare how christ doth stablish how he doth order
but these things may bee done eyther well or ill
many make orders which are not good and support their people in doing euill it is not so with this king in doing both hee followeth a good rule iudgement and iustice
will not trouble you with the diuers significations of much lesse with the manifold commentaries vpon these words suppose the fairest to bee that which points out the two especiall acts of a king which are the calling of his people to an account of their liues that is iudgement and to proceede in their trials by an euen rule that is iustice
euery man is required to haue a care of his life and to be respectiue of the society wherein hee liues
a romane emperour in the preface of his institutions makes this abridgement of ciuill conuersation a man must honestè viuere not doe ought disgracefull to his owne person that is not enough hee must bee carefull of others also alterum non laedere that he worst not another mans state while he would better his own yea he must suum cuique tribuere so liue that euery man be the better for him
this is the duty of a subiect and the king looks that he shall performe it to this end he keepes an assizes and executeth iudgement

it fareth with the body politicke as it doth with the body naturall in the body naturall if the humours keepe their proportion wee shall haue

our health no sooner doe they swarue from it but they begin a disease which maketh way to putrefaction and so to dissolution wherefore we apply physicke to reduce them againe into a due temper euen so while good lawes sway our carriage towards our selues towards our neighbours each man doth well the doth prosper but no sooner doth the subiect breake these bands but a ciuill putrefaction entreth which maketh way to the ruine of a state wherein euery particular mans is hazzarded with the whole the remedy whereof is the worke of iudgement
iudgement then is a fit remedy but it must bee attended with iustice also not the kings affections but his lawes must moderate his iudgement and the medicine must bee fitted to the disease otherwise if the scales of iustice doe not first weigh the merits of the cause the iudgement will as much disquiet the state as discontent the parties iudged

if you put these words together to order and to stablish with iudgement and iustice each requires both ordering is not perfect without iudgment and iustice nor stablishing perfect except both concurre for stablishing is nothing but a perpetuating of good order
therefore to set the subiects right the king must vse iudgement guided by iustice and that he may keepe them in that state he must perseuere in so doing
these words as you see haue an euident truth in a and from thence are they borrowed but to note a higher truth which concernes the church whereof christ is king
and here we must obserue an improuement of the vertues vpon which christ will passe his iudgement honestè viuere is not only to liue as beseemes ciuill men but as beseemeth saints children of god expressing his image members of christ leading his life and temples of the holy ghost bearing in our foreheads holinesse to the lord
and as for alterum non laedere it is not enough for vs not to defraud others we must loue our very enemies blesse them that curse vs doe good to them that hate and persecute vs finally our suum cuique tribuere must be to deny our selues our friends our life when we will testifie our duty to god yea to lay down our liues also for the brethren after the example of christ so dear must their welfare be vnto vs
as that which comes into iudgement is so improued so is the iudgement it selfe also for christs iudgement is without preiudice without partiality nothing can be concealed no person can be exempted he will bring all both persons and things secret and open before his iudgement seate all bookes shall then bee opened and the secrets of all hearts reuealed he will iudge them all
but his iudgement is ordered by iustice and this iustice is of a higher straine than ciuill iustice can be for the iustice is euangelicall wherein god through christ doth so question vs as that he tenders withall a pardon vnto vs and is as ready to forgiue as to discouer our faults

not only to forgiue them but also to amend vs it sufficeth not christ graciously to clense vs from the guilt of sinne hee also giueth vs a new heart and createth an ingenuous spirit within vs by which wee may bee

held in from sinning with such iudgement and with such iustice doth christ order and stablish his church

and here must wee marke a notable difference betweene this king of heauen and kings on earth earthly kings neyther giue minds vnto their subiects to obserue their lawes neyther is it lawfull for them in all cases to exempt their subiects from the stroke of iustice when they haue offended but our king can doe both hee can rectifie our conuersation and when we haue sinned he can comfort our distressed consciences
last of all in vsing this rule whereby he directs and supports his state this king is constant he doth it incessantly from henceforth and for euer
as the growth hath an eternity so must the cause thereof which is the kings policie haue an eternity also
for there could be no eternity in the effect were there not an eternity in the cause especially in effects which are alwaies in fieri and not in facto such as is this
it is in the mystical body as it is in the naturall sense there is in the body but it is from the head intercept the insluence of the head and you extinguish the sense of the body and as it fareth with the body in regard of sense so doth it in regard of motion also
the like appeares in the spirits that haue their original from the heart in the bloud that streameth from the veines
in the great world you haue many like spectacles the sun and the light the streames and the fountaine the rootes and the trees euery one of these you may perceiue endure not if the effect be seuered from the cause how much lesse may wee expect any enduring in those spirituall effects did they not receiue continuance from this spirituall cause it is our comfort that considering there is a mutability in vs this mutability preuaileth not because of the kings constant influence vpon vs wee sinne and recouer we are in danger and escape neyther our inward weakenesse nor our enemies outward mightinesse destroy gods gifts in vs or so hinder their increase but that they become catholick for all which we are beholding to the constant policie of the king who neuer faileth to support vs but continueth ours vnto the end
but the prophet speaketh of this policie as if it began when hee spake these words christ was not borne till some hundreds of yeares after
the answer is easie you had it before
the efficacie of christs birth wrought long before he was borne not only in the time of this prophet but euen from the time of adams fall

a scruple there ariseth how these words can be true that our king shall so rule for euer seeing a time shall come as the apostle teacheth cor when he shall giue vp his kingdome to his father
the answer is if wee respect the kingdome of grace that as the effect shall not cease increasing till it become boundlesse that is haue attained all his parts and degrees so the cause shall worke till the consummation of that effect till all enemies be put downe and wee are throughly perfected
and in this sense both cause and effect are termed endlesse because they shall continue till the worlds end
if you extend it to the kingdome of glory it hath an eternity also though not of restauration but of conseruation though

he shall cease restoring of vs further when we are fully restored yet shall hee neuer cease preseruing vs because wee can no longer be than wee are preserued

you haue heard the constant policie of the king wherein standeth the second branch of the excellency of the state what remaineth but that if wee were affected with the growth and desired to bee partakers of it wee submit our selues vnto the cause thereof the policie of the king that we yeeld our disorderly selues to be set in order by him and repose our weake selues to be supported on him who will prescribe no lawes of order but those that spring from iustice that spirituall iustice which will abide the tryall at gods barre and worke the highest kinde of righteousnesse in our liues neyther doth he only prescribe it but possesse vs of it also and lest it should faile he supports it in vs his iudgements are as watchfull ouer vs as his iustice they rectifie vs when wee breake order and bridle vs that wee doe not breake it
and this he doth vncessantly by bringing vs from growth to growth in the state of grace and prescruing vs in this growth in the state of glory hee will bee vnto vs a lasting blessed cause that there may be in vs no end of that blessed effect
lord am out of order and am very weake thon art that counsellour that knowest how to set mee right againe and that almighty god which onely canst sustaine me lord rule me by thy lustice and by thy iudgements bridle me that may bee conformable to the holy members of thy church and euer continue conformable vnto them let thy worke neuer cease in mee so shall neuer cease to bee thy subiect if thy policie faile me not shall euery day grow on to the fulnesse ef grace and shall therehence proceede to the eternity of glory
which beseech thee to grant vnto mee that art the fountaine both of grace and glory

the eighth sermon
epigraph the zeale of the lord of hosts shall performe this

the&se are the last words of that text whereof you haue heard often but haue not yet heard all
the whole text was diuided into a doctrine and a warrant
the doctrine deliuered the substance and excellency of christs person and state both which haue at sundry times so far vnfolded as the time would giue leaue it were tedious now to repeat were it onely the heads whereof haue distinctly spoken
in stead of that repetition only recommend vnto you the laying together the parts and therehence the gathering of a description of the catholicke church
which what is it but a kingdome such as haue described growing in grace without stint of place or term of time vnder and by meanes of such a person as being god and man is called to be the king thereof royally endowed with wisedome and power eternall to worke an eternall good both which he employes ordering and stablishing by iustice and iudgement the disorderly and feeble members of his church and that without intermission vntill he hath brought them to the fulnesse both of grace and glory
more than this in the nature of that catholicke church which we beleeue in the creede there is not neyther is there any thing more that we would desire to bee therein
so that we may take this text as a full commentary thereupon and to our comfort vnderstand the riches that are treasured vp in that article
but to leaue the doctrine and come to the warrant
the doctrine containeth a large promise the warrant sheweth that it shall be performed and sheweth this by renewing those impediments that may crosse the performance thereof
the impediments that stay a man from being as good as his word are of two sorts they proceede ab extra or ab intra from without or from within
from without wee may bee from within wee may change our minde
neyther of these can hinder god hee cannot bee for he is the lord of hosts hee cannot vary in himselfe because of the greatnesse of his loue which is termed zeale
so that the remouall of these two impediments from god are the principall argument of these words let vs looke into them

that gods word shall stand that his counsell is immutable yea that heauen and earth shall passe and yet his word neuer passe are maximes in the scripture and therfore haue undefined span alphabet credibility enough in themselues but yet so farre doth the holy ghost condescend to the

weakenesse of our faith as to point vnto these grounds which will content euen reason it selfe
reason when it questioneth the word of any man it bethinketh it selfe whether hee can if he would or whether hee would if he can if it can cleare these two then it resteth secure but if it cannot bee satisfied in eyther or both it doubts and distrusts
now in both these doth the holy ghost here satisfie vs touching gods word in that it maketh god of a mighty power so that none can resist his will he is the lord of hosts and of a stedfast will which is inseparable from so high a degree of loue as is zeale

touching the first of these pillars that support gods word obserue vpon this phrase the lord of hosts that there is in god a double power an internall noted by iehouah and an externall noted by the hosts
the first is coessentiall to the nature of god and is as infinite as god is
but though this power be yet it is not apparant and it is that which is apparant that must satisfie vs therefore god hath manifested his power as it were in his creatures which come within our reach and whereof wee haue daily experience these are all termed gods host
we look vpon them and consider nothing farther in them than what they are according to their kind the sun we take to be a star that ruleth the day and the moone a starre which ruleth the night wee thinke the aire was made for our breath and the earth to beare vs fruits finally what creature is there from which wee expect not some such seruice the seruice they doe vs wee take notice of and our eye is vpon it but it is not vpon that seruice which they doe vnto god though it should be vpon that principally and it is that which is intimated by this word hosts
so that as christ is set forth to be a king so also that he wanteth not an armie all the world is his armie there is no creature in heauen and earth that fighteth not vnder his banner
and this title is very ancient for euen in the second of genesis when the world was made the whole receiued this name it was called an host and god did before hand giue man to vnderstand that it was good for him to obserue his allegeance otherwise there was no possibility of escaping seeing he was enuironed with the souldiers of god as likewise that he need not feare if he did well because he had so great a guard
these two lessons should we reade in in this title of the creatures which may also be applyed to correct their errour that suppose a confusion in the affaires of this world
gods prouidence so ordereth all things that they neuer cease to be a well martialled armie
true it is we cannot perceiue it as long as we stand in the leuell of the world but if we ascend into gods mount and from out of his sanctuary behold the occurrents of this life we shall see how euery creature marcheth vnder his colours and euery one keepeth his ranke

another thing that wee must marke is that at first there was but one armie for we reade tzebaam genesis
but after the fall then we read tzeboath that one is become two euer since god pronounced ponam inimicitias michael and his angels haue contended with the dragon and his angels and two armies haue beene on foote in the field
but though they be two and two so opposite yet is their generall but one

for my text maketh but one lord of hosts
the reason is cleare the wicked may subducere se felicitati but they cannot subducere se potestati diuinae though like rebels they march against their generall yet doth this generall not only retaine his right vnto them but also his power and authority ouer them he hath his bridle in their nostrils and but when he will and no farther than he will can they stirre or preuaile
and this hand wherewith god so ordereth and stinteth their malice is a iust ground why he is termed the lord of hosts

and fitly in this place doth he receiue this title because mention is before made of difficulties which sprang from the enemies of the church by which it might seeme vnlikely that the church being brought so low should euer recouer it selfe so well but all of them are not to be regarded seeing he that promiseth is the lord of hosts
the word hosts may also be referred only to the church which though it be but one catholicke one yet hath it many particulars parts of that whole one
so that as all the romane souldiers of the empire were but one army in relation to one emperour whose they all were and by whom they were alike commanded though in regard of the particular generals by whom they were conducted in seuerall parts of the world they were named seuerall armies euen so doth the scripture speake of the church sometimes as of one sometimes as of more armies as of one reuel

as of many psalme
or psalme
in the leuiticall seruice it vseth the very word tzaba and the apostles continue that metaphor speaking of the spirituall seruice of god
and if you so restraine the word hosts then is this branch of the warrant very apt also for it implies a reason of the churches growth and of christs employing his royall endowments in ordering and stablishing thereof
and why euery church is his host and what doth a generall more delight in than the perfection of his armie the double perfection as it is both militant and triumphant by grace and glory
you haue heard the first branch of the warrant the second branch is the remouall of the second impediment to wit the changeablenesse of gods will he can no more vary in himselfe than he can be resisted from without and why this lord of hosts hath zeale and zeale is the height of loue which loue if once it possesse the will it maketh it an vnchangeable will

zeale is an affection proper vnto men who ouer and aboue their will whose obiect good is and to which belongeth the choyce thereof haue two attendants thereon the concupiscible and the irascible part whereof the first is that which moueth towards the obiect the other encountreth whatsoeuer difficulties hinder our attaining or enioying of it when these two come to a height they become zeale for zeale is compounded of them both
the nature of it seemes to be described in the eighth of the canticles where the church desireth to be set as a seale set mee as a seale vpon thy heart as a seale vpon thine arme for loue is strong as death iealousie is cruell as the graue the coales thereof are coales of fire which hath a most vehement flame
many waters cannot quench loue neyther can the flouds

drowne it if a man would giue all the substance of his house for loue it would vtterly contemned
this affection being properly in man is by the holy ghost ascribed vnto god but not ratione affectus but effectus and in reference to that coniugall couenant that is betweene god and man god hath promised to be our god and we haue promised to be his people but eyther side promiseth to the other exclusiuely god promiseth to be our god and the god of none as he is ours and wee promise to be his people and to be the people of no other god as we are his
this appropriation of our selnes vnto god is that which the apostle speakes of cor
though there be that are called gods whether in heauen or in earth as there be gods many and lords many yet vnto vs there is but one god god the father and one lord iesus christ
this made dauid to say

whom haue lin heauen but thee

and there is none in earth that desire in comparison of thee
yea doe not hate them that hate thee hate them with a perfect hatred as if they were mine enemies

but all my delight is in thy saints which are on the earth

as man in his zeale doth so proceede exclusiuely towards god so doth god towards man for god taketh the church for his peculiar exod
therupon promiseth abraham will blesse them that blesse thee and curse them curse thee
this is true coniugall loue of each side and vpon this knot commeth in zeale which is otherwise called iealousie and is nothing but the affection of eyther part whereby it so desires to enioy the other as that none other either haue it or wrong it for if eyther the wife communicate her selfe to any other or be by any other wronged the iealousie of the husband is stirred vp against his wiues enemies or against his wife
against his wife so speakes god ezekiel
and will iudge thee as women that breake wedlocke and shed blood are iudged and will giue thee bloud in sury and iealousie
and as hee proceedeth in iealousie against his adulterous wife so doth he against enemies that wrong her thereupon the prophets expresse his anger against them by iealousie and the church esay
desiring reuenge saith lord where is thy zeale in this place the zeale respects reuenge vpon the enemies not vpon the spouse you may perceiue it by the coherence of this text with that which goeth before where mention is made of a deliuerance and christ is here brought in as the deliuerer the ground of the worke is zeale
finally marke that whereas gods glory doth as well appeare in our deliuerance as our owne good yet in working thereof god seemeth to be moued rather with his loue to vs than care for his owne glory
and giueth a good patterne vnto vs that we likewise in seruing of god must respect not so much our owne saluation as his glory

and so haue you heard the warrant of this doctrine what remaines but that vse vnto you the words of the psalmist be yee lifted vp yee gates be yee lifted vp euerlasting doores and the king of glory shall come in
who is the king of glory euen the lord of hosts hee is the king of glory
you haue heard him described and haue heard the substance and excellencie of his person and state behold god is our saluation let vs trust and not bee affraid the lord iohouah is our strength and song he also is become

our saluation therefore with ioy let vs draw waters out of this well of saluation

lord that art able and willing let me feele the efficacie both of thy power and will in making me partaker both of the person and state of christ and the excellencie of both so shall all my power be set on worke by all my will to make me wholly thine as thou art pleased to be mine
grant this mutuall knot may bee so knit that neuer breake it so shall be sure that thou wilt euer hold it

sixe sermons vpon the second of haggai
epigraph

hag
vers
for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and will shake the heauens and the earth and the sea and the dry land
and will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and will fill this house with glory saith the lord of hosts
the siluer is mine and the gold is mine saith the lord of hosts
the glory of this latter house shall bee greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and in this place will giue peace saith the lord of hosts

although the fruits of seruing god be not his

but our owne welfare yet if it were not more furthered by him than it is endeauoured by vs wee should neuer fare well because wee should neuer serue him
our impediments are two and they are two extreames carelessenesse and curiositie carelessenesse keepes vs backe when we should beginne and when we should goe forward curiosity slakes our zeale
sometimes we doe not serue god because we doe not care for him and sometimes we grow cold in pietie because we thinke our best endeauours are not worthy of gods maiestie
thus the euill angell whether hee appeare in his darkenesse or in his counterfeit light both waies gaines vpon vs

this prophecie of haggai doth little else but propose an example of eyther impediment and the remedie that is applied thereunto the iewes yeelde the example but the remedy is from god

the iewes in acknowledgement of gods great goodnesse should vpon their returne out of the babylonian captiuity haue made their first work the of gods house but they were otherwise minded and busied themselues about their owne houses
that memorable speech king dauids religious meditation neuer came into their hearts which is recorded sam

lo saith hee dwell in a house of cedar but the arke

of god lodgeth vnder curtaines therefore will build him an house
but these iewes could finde in their hearts to dwell in sieled houses and let the temple lye in its
wherefore god corrects and reformes this their carelessenesse corrects it with rebukes and stripes reformes it by his word and spirit
by these meanes were they brought at length to begin the worke

they beganne but were quickely wearied and it was curiosity that wearied them they were contented indeede to build a temple vnto god but not except it might be so goodly a one as was that of and because their ability would not reach so farre many of them gaue ouer working and fell to weeping
behold a wicked curiosity which vnder colour of gods honour would not honour him at all
well god must remedie this impediment also and he doth it by teaching the iewes two excellent rules in religion

the first is wee must not iudge of gods workes as wee doe of mens
in mens workes by the beginning wee make coniecture of the ending and a iudicious man when hee seeth a foundation will easily ghesse what pile of building will be raised thereon
it is not so in gods workes christ told st paul that his strength was made perfect in weakenesse

st paul taught the corinthians that the weakenesse of god is stronger than men
for proofe hereof god in this prophet referres himselfe vnto the israelites deliuerance out of egypt and willeth the iewes by his proceeding in that worke to measure all his proiects
the first encouragement then of the iewes is a consideration that god is the architect of their building and where he is the chiefe workemaster seeme the beginnings neuer so small the worke cannot faile to proue glorious
this is the first rule

the second rule is that they must not set the estimate of the glory according to the charge spent in the building but according to his worth that shall inhabit it for non domus dominum sed dominus domum it is not the house that maketh the master but the master that maketh the house honourable
therefore the iewes eyes were to be fixed rather vpon the grace which god would doe their temple than on the expence which they were able to bestow in building thereof
this is their second encouragement exprest in a second rule and it is the argument of those words that now haue read vnto you
the summe is christ will assuredly make a remarkeable a comfortable entrance into that temple seeme it neuer so meane a temple which was now a building by zorobabel iosua and the rest of the iewes
the chiefe points therein to be considered are two christs presence in the temple and the assurance thereof giuen to the iewes
the presence is maiesticall whether you respect the preparation thereunto or the description thereof
this time will not suffer me to passe beyond the preparation for this though the last sunday of aduent is but a preparation against christmas day and therefore it may suffice if prepare you for that feast the rest of the matter shall be reserued for its due time

in the preparation we will obserue the manner and the time
the manner will shew vs what is prepared and how· what both the worlds the

great and the little the great is set downe in these words heauen earth and of earth the sea and the dry land the little world is noted by all nations all not onely contradistinct to the iewes but including them also
both the worlds shall be prepared but how they shall bee extraordinarily rowsed and as it were summoned to attend and intend the presence of christ this is meant by the shaking of them
besides this manner there is a time here also set downe that doth belong vnto this shaking
for hearing of so strange a thing a man may demand how often how soone shall this shaking bee if the demand be how often the holy ghost answers yet once once more and no more but once for those two notes are included in these two words yet once
if the demand bee how soone the holy ghost answers very soone it is but a little while this shaking is very neare it is at hand
you haue the particulars which god willing meane to vnfold at this time pray god may so doe it that we all thereby may be prepared as wee ought to commemorate the birth of christ

first then of the two worlds that shall bee prepared the greater offers it selfe vnto vs
it is here broken into its parts heauen earth heauen is in the scripture threefold first that which is called the throne of god and is inhabited by the angels and saints which are departed
the second is that which is called the firmament wherein moue the sunne the moone the stars they are the host of that heauen
the third is the aire wherein flye the birds for they are called coeli the fowle of heauen
heauen in my text must not bee limited it extends to all three
the second part of the world is called earth that containes all the inferiour globe and is here as elsewhere in genesis resolued into its parts the sea and the dry land
also the word which wee translate dry land noteth a desolate place and may bee rendred a wildernesse and so therein and in the sea may bee intimated an allusiue parallel to the passage of israel from egypt into canaan
the little world is here exprest by the name of all nations
to vnderstand the phrase we must obserue that after god had chosen a peculiar people the rest of people were called gentiles that is nations and so properly they signifie in the language of the old testament all people and kindreds that are without the church
but in this place it must haue a larger extent because christ came to be knowne as well to the gentile as to the iew as in the next sermon you shall heare more at large
therefore by these words wee must vnderstand simply all people as well those that were within as those that were without the church

hauing thus shewed you what is to bee prepared must now shew you how god will shake them that is rowse them extraordinarily
though all creatures doe continually serue god yet while they keepe their ordinarie course they doe not so euidently serue him but that atheists question his prouidence
st peter shewes vs what is their ground all things continue alike from their beginning
to refute them

god doth sometime as it were vnioynt the frame of nature

and maketh the very magicians to say digitus dei est hic this miracle must needs be wrought

by the god of nature

he maketh the canaanites to confesse the lord your god is the god of heauen aboue and of earth below as rahab told the spies

the proud king of babylon when he saw that the lions could not touch the body of daniel nor the fire singe the three children was faine to giue glory to the true and euerliuing god
it is none of the worst arguments wherewith we may stoppe the mouthes of atheists and make them acknowledge the lord of nature if wee presse them with those many stories found in vndoubted records for which in nature there can be no reason yea there is euident reason for their contraries
such a kinde of change or dealing with the creatures and putting them out of their vsuall course is here meant by shaking
but let vs apply it to the two worlds and you will see it more euidently

beginne with the heauen

the vppermost heauen that was apparently shaken at the first comming of christ
god the father more than once vttered his voyce so audibly at the first comming of christ that it was plainely heard by men on earth

god the holy ghost hee came downe in the doue came downe in fiery tongues he became as tertullian speakes the vicar of christ vnto the church

as for the angels they ascended and descended vpon him when god brought his first begotten into the world

that was done which he commanded let all the angels worship him

and what did the saints moses and elias came to him in the mount and conferred with him about his death many also rose out of their graues and appeared in the holy city
there remaines onely the place where god dwels and those blessed spirits that also was shaken more than once for more than once did it open as we reade in the gospell and in the acts
you doe not doubt by this time but that the vppermost heauen was shaken which was shaken so many waies
onely that shaking was answerable to the subiect it was without all corruption

come we now to the second heauen that also had a shaking a double shaking

there appeared a starre that was neuer seene before at christs birth which drew the to seeke out him that was borne king of the iewes
and at his death the goodliest starre in the firmament meane the sunne lost his light when the moone was at full
which sight was so strange to the philosophers at athens that as the story saith it drew from denys the areopagite· that memorable saying aut deus naturae patitur aut mundi machina dissoluetur either the god of nature is ouercharged or is disposed to end the world
tertullian obserues that the romanes did register this eclypse in their chronicle
say nothing of the renting of that heauen too

for the vppermost could not be opened without opening the second also that the doue might descend that st stephens sight might ascend and see christ standing at the right hand of god

the third heauen remaines that also was shaken for christ commanded the windes and they were calme hee suffered not the ayre to transmit the species but was inuisible yea hee commanded it not to giue breath and to giue breath to men as pleased him you finde it in the storie of those that came to apprehend him

enough of the heauens

the first part of the great world
onely obserue

that that which out of ioel st peter obserues was in part performed in this shaking of heauen

the second part of the great world is the earth
the earth in the beginning was one confused globe of water and dry land vpon gods commandement these two elements were separated and each appeared by it selfe as wee reade genesis
as then they first were and as they now are so are they here mentioned and so wee must vnderstand them
touching their shaking might in few wordes referre you to the psalme let the sea roare and the fulnesse thereof

let the flouds clap their hands let the hils bee ioyfull together before the lord for he commeth to iudge the earth
but will shew you some particulars out of the new testament there shall you reade the that were when christ was in the flesh the cleauing of rockes

the opening of graues which made the iewes returne from his crosse knocking their breasts made the centurion say of a truth this was the son of god put the scribes and pharisees and high priests to their briberie

lest the souldiers should bewray what they could not deny
as for the sea that apparently tooke notice of christ when he wanted he commanded the sea to supply him and it did by a fish when peter iames and iohn had laboured all night at sea and caught nothing he commanded them to cast out their net and the fish came readily and filled it to their great astonishment at another time when their ship was ready to be drowned christ did but rebuke the waues

and presently there followed a great calme
thus apparently did the sea acknowledge christ come into the world

but because the word that wee render dry land doth properly signifie a desert or wildernesse it is not vnlikely but that these two words doe imply a parallel of that which fell out while christ conuersed on earth and that which was wrought at the deliuerance of israel out of egypt the sea then diuided and gaue passage to the children of israel vpon dry land it did more to christ it became it selfe as dry land he walked vpon it and made st feter to doe so also
and as for the wildernesse it was to israel no wildernesse no more was it to christ they were amongst wilde beasts there and so was hee and neyther was annoyed the wildernesse yeelded them plenty of food and in the wildernesse did christ multiply the loaues and the fishes so that after many thousands were fedde the remainder was much more than was the first prouision
there remaines one part of the earth which haue not yet touched and that is hell
hell holdeth fast all that come thereinto but it could not hold him when hee descended thither and while hee liued vpon earth how did the fiends confesse him obey him come and goe at his pleasure
it is cleare then fully cleare that seeing shaking doth signifie an extraordinary manifestation of the deity working by or on the creature contrary to their vsuall course the great world and the parts thereof were shaken at the first comming of christ

let vs see now how true this is of the little world the world of mankind here called all nations which are distinguished into iewes and gentiles both had their shaking
the iewes their whole policie was dissolued meane that which was peculiar to them whether ecclesiasticall or ciuill as daniel foretold

so st paul affirmes both receiued an end by the comming of christ
iacobs prophecie was then fulfilled the scepter departed from iuda and the from between his seete that state was not only shaken but shiuered all to pieces

as for other nations they had their shaking a double shaking a spirituall and a corporall spiritually their heads were shaken their iudgements were illightened and amazed that euer they should be so sottish as to worship stockes and stones

the workes of mens hands yea the diuels themselues vpon this they threw away their idols and cursed their forged gods
this abrenunciation doth gregorie nazianzene orat
and austin de ciuit
dei vnderstand by this shaking

to this shaking of their head wee must adde a shaking of their heart a contagious aire is not purged but by thundering and lightening and a corrupt conscience must feele the terrour of mount sinai before it can haue the comfort of mount sion
the voyce wherein god spake to elias was a soft voyce

but there went before it fire winde the peace which you shall heare of hereafter comes not to the spirituall temple of god without some terrour going before
the iewes were pricked at the heart when st peter preached vnto them

and as perplexed in conscience cried out men and brethren what shall we doe before they receiued the comfort of the gospell
saint paul was stricken downe to the ground from heauen before he was conuerted the goaler came trembling to him and silas

before he was baptized
it is a broken and contrite heart that must make vs capable of grace neyther will the filiall feare enter except way bee made by the seruile
this may bee the reason why the holy ghost by whose power the apostles were to conuert the world

came vpon them at first in fire and with a mighty winde and a second time with an which shaked all the house wherein they were
it shewes how their ministry should shake the hearts and consciences of the world for in omnes terras exiuit sonus eorum

besides this spirituall

the nations had a corporall shaking
came saith christ to send a sword into the world no sooner had he begunne the gospel but wee see how the herodians the sadducees the pharisees bestirre themselues against him and against all the apostles
the apostles intimate as much when in their prayer they repeat those words of the psalme

why doe the heathen so furiously rage together and the people imagine a vaine thing the kings of the earth stand vp and the rulers take counsell against the lord and against his anointed
and how furious was the dragon against the woman

because shee had borne a man childe will not trouble you to reckon vp the heathenish or hereticall persecutions of the primitiue church

ponam inimicitias will put enmity betweene the woman and the serpent and betweene their seedes is the true ground of this shaking and it holdeth in all ages no sooner is the

vanity of oracles of idols and of false worship discouered and deserted but the diuell in reuenge of his quarrell will set nation against nation family against family kindred against kindred and a mans enemies shall be those of his owne houshold
wee haue wofull proofe of it in this age the bloody warres which haue beene and are in these westerne parts whence haue they sprung

but from christs comming amongst vs in the truth of his gospell which st paul to the the galathians termeth a second forming of christ in vs and as it were a crucifying of him before vs
but the enuious man that sowed tares cannot bee contented that hee should bee so with good eares of corne therefore there will follow a shaking

haue sufficiently shewed you that both worlds were shaken but may not forget a difference which is between their shaking though both are rowsed and giue their attendance at the first comming of christ yet the great world doth it only effectu it serues to the honour thereof but not knowing what it doth
but the little world attends also affectu it is sensible of that which it doth
and indeed the shaking of the great world is only to worke a sensible shaking in the little world
which as it is wont to be wrought in other cases as when vpon the sight of eclypses and blazing starres men are affrighted and prognosticate vnto themselues famines pestilences confusion of states which is likewise done by them vpon the sight of so god would haue it also in this case he would that men should be obseruant and feeling of his extraordinary workes wrought vpon the heauens and the earth in honour and testimony of his comming into the world who is the sauiour of the world

haue done with the shaking will onely giue you an obseruation or two vpon it and so passe on to the time
the first is st chrysostomes

god when hee doth any great worke in the world non solet subrepere stealeth not vpon the world but giueth signification before hand
so did he before he brought on the floud before hee deliuered his people out of egypt before he gaue the iewes ouer vnto the babylonian captiuity we cannot reade those stories but we must needes finde in them gods palpable harbingers
so that if men be surprised it is not because men are not forewarned but because they will take no warning
the old world though the arke was building before their face yet were they eating and drinking marrying and giuing in marriage till the floud came though moses told pharaoh what euill god would bring vpon him yet did pharaoh still harden his heart and the iewes mocked the prophets that early and late told them of their captiuity neyther would they beleeue it vntill they were past recouery

if our gospell be hid saith st paul it is hid vnto those whose eyes the god of this world hath blinded that they should not beleeue

for as hee told agrippa the things which they preached were not done in a corner
as the corporall sunne doth not rise without a dawning of the day so christ came not into the world without some prognostication thereof iewes and gentiles that doe not beleeue are without all excuse because god hath so plainely shaken both

the worlds
neyther shall we haue ought to pleade for our selues if we neglect or forsake the truth which god hath brought vnto vs because he hath accompanied it with so wonderfull deliuerances and comforts vs in honour of it with so many diuers blessings god hath vouchsafed many wayes to premonish vs let vs take heede that wee him not

the second obseruation is this

no creature can hinder the performance of gods will heauen and earth shall passe rather than one iot of his word shall be vndone
wee neede not feare any opposition on the worlds part notwithstanding it is the common feare of worldly men because all the world is in gods power hee can shake and shiuer it at his pleasure
of this god doth often put his people in minde by the prophets and biddeth them bee bold thereupon and wee may say si deus nobiscum quis

yea and quid too contra nos quid is it the great world god can shake heauen and earth the sea and the dry land
quis is it man god can shake him also hee can shake all nations therefore we neede not feare what eyther world can doe vnto vs

and thus much of the manner of the preparation come now briefly to shew you the time thereof
when a man heares of such great matters hee will be inquisitiue after this circumstance he will desire to know how often how soone and the holy ghost doth here resolue both those questions

how often

if you aske he answers yet once
which word told you imports two things that the shaking hath beene once before for both worlds were shaken at the giuing of the law st paul taketh notice of it heb
and you may reade it in the story deliuered by moses
the gospell as st paul cor proues at large beeing much more glorious than the law was not to come short of it in solemnitie when it was to be promulged therefore because the worlds were shaken then they were to be shaken now once more
some gather out of st pauls words heb
not onely the earth but also the heauen that the later was much the greater shaking

but though once more yet no more but this once for there is no more new doctrine to bee broached in the world no second messias to come
we must obserue this not only against the iewes but also against the heretickes
the montanists thought that as there were three persons in god so euery one should haue his time the father vnder the law the son during the gospell and then the holy ghost montanus sending the paraclete into the world
the alcaron was built vpon the same ground whose author though hee giue honourable testimonie vnto christ as being a great prophet yet he would make the world beleeue that god was to send a greater after him

and that was mahomet
but we keepe our selues to st iudes fides semel tradita the one faith that was once deliuered to the saints

we obey st iohn who biddeth vs if any man bring vs any other doctrine we should not so much as bid him god speed wee follow st pauls counsell

if an angel from heauen bring any other doctrine wee hold him anathema
the church of rome chargeth vs

with nouelty but we may rather charge them with many additions to the truth they call to vs for miracles to confirme our doctrine but miracles would argue another shaking of the world wee hold there shall bee no more and what need there any more seeing wee hold no other doctrine than that which was confirmed by the shaking of the two worlds in the dayes of christ and his apostles they haue patcht their fancies thereunto therefore are they driuen to abuse the world with their forged miracles and to counterfeit a second shaking

when say there shall be no more shakings meane during the militancy of the church for immediately before the triumph thereof there shall precede another shaking christ hath opened it at large in st matthew

will not insist vpon it it is not to my purpose you may there see how both the worlds shall be shaken against that time

but then we shall haue regnum immobile
and of this last shaking the world is now too full of prophesies and resolutions but be ready for it not rash in determining it

come to the holy ghosts answer to the second question how soone and we finde here that it shall be very soone it is but a little while to the time of the shaking

but that little time must bee vnderstood according to a theologicall not according to a mathematicall measure
theologie measureth our time in proportion to eternity but the mathematicks according to our mortall life
in regard of eternity st peters rule holds

a thousand yeares are but as one day
but in regard of our mortall life omnis mora properantilonga est patienti verò longissima the deferring of our hope is the languishing of our soule
to support our selues wee must passe from mathematicall commensurations to theologicall and then we shall finde that modicum and longum may stand together and iacobs saying be true

that euill dayes are but few
from haggai's prophesying vntill the comming of christ past better than foure hundred yeares the holy ghost cals that but a little while
and wee must inure our selues to this diuine chronologie when wee thinke of the second comming of christ the apostle tels vs that vpon them that liue in the time of the gospell the end of the world is come and these are the last dayes yea the last boure

the iudge is at hand he is at the doore yet there haue passed
yeares but let vs not thinke it long let vs remember that of habakkuk

the iust must liue by his faith patient faith and if any man make haste saith the lord my soule shall haue no pleasure in him
wherefore if at any time our impatient heart wearied with the tediousnesse of this life shall breake out into these words tu autem domine vsque quo how long lord dost thou cease to put an end to this miserable world

let vs rest satisfied with christs answer behold come quickly and congratulating the abridgement of our momentany afflictions and desiring that according to his promise the cloud thereof may speedily bee dissolued let vs put this clause into our daily prayer euen so lord iesu come quickly

god so prepare vs that we may haue the comfort of the person that is to come comfort of his first and second comming
amen

the second sermon
epigraph and the desire of all nations shall come

the summe of this scripture as not long since obserued vnto you is the exceeding grace which the first comming of christ should assuredly doe vnto that temple at hierusalem which in haggai's daies was building by zorobabel the prince iosuah the high priest and the rest of the iewes
the generall parts which pointed out were
the presence of christ in that temple
the assurance thereof giuen to the builders
the presence was to be extraordinary gathered it partly from the preparation thereunto whereof then spake and partly from the description thereof which remaines to be spoken of
the description is of the person that was to come and the good that bee should doe
of the good that he should doe shall speake god willing hereafter at this time my purpose is to speake onely of the person that was to come
the person then here meant is in plaine termes our sauiour christ
but he is set forth here in most comfortable words words most comfortable to all the world for he is stiled the desire of all nations and what is that but the soueraigne good of all that which all desire the philosopher could say is undefined span alphabet the chiefe good
and againe if it be desired of all then is it common to all for appetitus non est frustra there was neuer any desire engrafted in the nature of man but the good whereunto that desire doth bend doth certainly belong vnto it
if it bee so in nature it is much more so in grace the holy ghost doth neuer inspire into vs any longing but it doth destinate vnto vs that good which he inclines our hearts to long for
according to these principles the points which wee are to consider in this description are the soueraignity and community of that good which we must seek and shall find in christ in christ as he was incarnate or first came into the world
but before come to these particulars must cleare my text from some interpretations that haue fastned thereon
for whereas in christs first comming two things are to be obserued
the principall and
the accessories his person and those things that did attend him many passe ouer the principal and apply these words only to the accessories
the prophets doe speake of two remarkeable accessories the one is the munificencie of the gentiles the other is the obedience of their persons both were to be of the best sort

the psalme touching the munificencie

saith that the kings of tharsis and of the iles should bring presents the kings of seba and sheba should

giue gifts
the prophet esay cap


doth particularize the gold the siluer the iewels the plants the beasts all kindes of choyce things that were to bee tendred vnto christ and the story of the church shewes that this was accomplished not only mystically but euen literally
we commemorate on this

day the oblation of gold of myrrhe of frankincense which was made by the wise men vnto christ
in the acts cap

verse
we reade that those christians which had possessions sold them brought the price and layd it at the apostles feete
the first christian emperours how open handed were they in erecting and prouiding for places and persons dedicated vnto christs seruice and as of other countries so the christian kings and people of this iland haue left honourable memorials of this kinde in their magnificent foundations and munificent endowments thereof
all these followed the rule of gods law whatsoeuer they offered vnto him it was euer of the best
but by the way let me obserue vnto you that the floud of our ancestours liberality rose not so high but their posterities sacriledge hath taken it downe to as low an ebbe and the saying of a great but no good king of this iland pleaseth too many that liue on the spoyles of the church

christs bread is sweete
they are farre from offering undefined span alphabet as the septaugint doe render my text the choyce treasure of the nations the first of those accessories which was to attend the comming of christ

a second accessorie foretold by the prophet are the persons that should honour him euen the choysest of persons for although saint paules rule be brethren you see your calling not many wise not many noble not many mighty yet that negatiue doth containe an affirmatiue and implyes that some euen of the best ranke should submit themselues and be homagers vnto christ bee nursing fathers

and nursing mothers of his church where the prophets speake of the wealth they speake also of persons reade the places and take notice withall of a difference in this kinde that god was pleased should be before the comming of christ and after
before the comming of christ many of the persian kings as likewise of the grecians gaue their goods but not themselues vnto god they prouided sacrifices for the temple at ierusalem but themselues went on in their idolatry
after the comming of christ it was otherwise great personages gaue themselues first and then their goods vnto christ the wise men vpon this day first prostrated their bodies and worshipped then they opened their treasures and offered vnto christ nicodemus and ioseph of arimathea great and rich men first beleeued then bestowed a funerall vpon christ the like may we say of all christian emperours kings potentates
and indeed christ seeketh not ours but vs and careth not for our goods

if wee dedicate not our selues vnto him both will doe well and wee shall doe well if wee deserue the macedonians commendation of whom st paul saith that they gaue themselues first and then were bountifull to the saints

these were accessories where with god was pleased christs first comming should be honoured but these doe not containe the true at least the full meaning of my text for surely these were not the cause of shaking

the great and little world neither were these either persons or goods improuements of the glory of zorobabels temple for little of this prophecie was accomplished while that temple stood

malachie cap

therefore giues vs a better interpretation and more agreeable to the words of my text the lord whom you seeke shall suddenly come to his temple the angell of the couenant whom yee delight in or desire behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts
and indeed christs person was the true attractiue of all other persons of their goods also they had neuer come except hee had come first
therefore the iewish rabbins

though they doe not beleeue that iesus is the christ yet doe they vnderstand this text of the messias
and st hierome renders the phrase desideratus omnium gentium the person that is desired of all nations purposing in those words to point out our sauiour christ
finally st paul heb
if you marke well his drift fauours this interpretation
wherefore take it for a plaine truth that if not solely yet principally christs person is meant by this phrase the desire of all nations
let vs come then at length to the points which obserued in it

the first is the soueraignity of good that cannot be lesse which is the desire of all nations
and marke that the word is abstract not concrete the text calleth him not the person desired but the desire
now these abstract titles when they are giuen to god or christ import two things the first is that all his nature or whatsoeuer is in him is that which he is called and secondly that all whatsoeuer is comprehended vnder that title is in him and cannot be had but by participation of him
in this sense is god and christ called truth righteousnesse holinesse these attributes are his nature and are not imparted to any but those that haue communion with him
to our present purpose christ is called desire it followeth by vertue of the word that he is totus desiderabilis altogether and in euery part desirable and totum desiderabile whatsoeuer the heart of a man can desire
and if he be these two then certainely hee is the soueraigne good

take them asunder
and first see how he is totus desiderabilis
might send you to the song of salomon where the spouse limmeth out his amiablenesse from top to toe or to the marriage psalme which in few words tels vs

that he is fairer than the sonnes of men or to those words of saint iohn

the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst vs and wee saw his glory as the glory of the only begotten sonne of god full of grace and truth
but beyond all is the testimonie of god the father whether deliuered by the prophet psay

behold my seruant whom vphold mine elect in whom my soule delighteth or vttered by a voyce from heauen this is my welbeloued son in whom am well pleased

for can he be lesse than altogether desirable that is gods delight

but passing by all these will insist vpon three titles of his which haue speciall reference to our good the first is immanuel the name of his person for it signifieth god with vs and how desireable is hee that hath knit that knot hypostatically in himselfe which is the ground of that mysticall knot which is to bee betweene god and vs wherein stands our

eaerlasting blisse certainely in regard of this name hee is most desirable the name that so linketh together heauen and earth a mortall wretch with the immortall god especially if you obserue that he is vnited totus toti the whole person of god to the whole nature of man that we may be wholly ioyned and so doth he become wholly desireable of vs

his second name is iesus that maketh him as desireable
st bernard hath vp the pleasurablenesse thereof in few but very sweet words nomen iesuest mel in ore melos in aure iubilum in corde all our reasonable acts are diuided into speaking hearing and thinking and loe we cannot speake of him but he is as honey in our mouthes and if wee heare of him the talke doth make the best melody in our eares finally the greatest ioy of our heart and the truest also springeth from our meditation vpon him
the reason of all which is this name soundeth nothing but saluation and saluation is the most wished most welcome thing to a childe of wrath to him whose sinnes can promise no better than a worme and an euer burning fire
well may we terme thee sweet iesu that deliuerest vs from these plagues especially seeing there is no part of thee that hath not borne a part in sauing vs

his third name is christ a most desireable name and why it signifieth a person anointed with no other than that which the psalmist calleth the oyle of gladnesse
this precious oyle poured vpon his head

ranne downe to vs the skirts of his garments insomuch as we now smell of myrrhe aloes and cassia and are now through him become a sweete sauour to god who in the corruption of our nature were loathsome vnto him
hee that was christ that is anointed that hee might so perfume vs with the sweetnesse of his graces must needes bee to vs as hee beares that title wholly desireable

but for your further insight into the louelinesse of this name resolue it into those three offices whereunto he was anointed and being anointed or consecrated vnto them was called christ
first hee was christ a prophet such a prophet as wee cannot desire a better hee was the very wisedome the word of god grace was poured into his lips and they that heard him wondred at the gracious words that came from him and well they might for that which he vttered was euangelium glad tidings of good things
his priesthood was more desirable than his prophecie for hee offered the sacrifice of sweet sauour vnto god which expiated all our sinnes and propitiated all his wrath and vpon his crosse he prepared that delicate feast that esay speakes of cap

fat meate full of marrow and pleasant wines throughly refined from the lees his flesh and his bloud were made such a feast for vs though in dressing of them he endured much paine
finally hee was a king and in regard thereof hee is most desireable for his kingdome is righteousnesse peace

and ioy in the boly ghost hee is such a king as maketh all his subiects kings and that of the same kingdome which he himselfe hath euen the kingdome of heauen
need say no more to proue that hee is totus desiderabilis altogether desireable

but he is more for he is also totum desiderabile all that can be desired

which is not granted to any creature
the scripture labours to make vs vnderstand that all that we seeke out of him is to be found only in him
happy saith salomon is the man that findeth wisedome and the man that getteth vnderstanding

for the merchandise thereof is better than the merchandise of siluer and her gaine than fine gold hee goeth on and parallels it with all that worldly men desire
in esay cap

you haue the same parallel ho yee that thirst come vnto the waters
christ himselfe to the church of laodicea presseth the same point

thou thinkest that thou art rich and wantest nothing whereas thou art poore blinde miserable come to me and buy
when st paul phil

had reckoned vp all his prerogatiues he concludes vers
accompt all these but dung and losse in comparison of the excellent knowledge that is in christ iesus but most full is that place of st paul cor
christ of god is made vnto vs wisedome righteousnesse sanctification and redemption
where obserue how he fitteth vs with supply from christ as well for the church militant as triumphant
in the church triumphant we must haue vnderstanding heads and pure hearts that we may see god and enioy him and christ giueth vs such heads such hearts for hee is made vnto vs wisedome and sanctification
as for the church militant we neede therein discharge from our sinnes and deliuerance from woe and christ is made vnto vs righteousnesse that wee may come with boldnesse before the iudgement seate of god and redemption from the curse which is due to the transgressors of the law

so that what the wise man saith of manna is certainely true of christ he is vnto euery man what he can reasonably desire hee serues to the appetite of euery eater and is tempered to euery mans liking
the septuagint as if they had intended to teach vs that all things desireable are in him haue vsed the plurall number undefined span alphabet wherefore we conclude that christ is totum desiderabile and wee may all say with king dauid what haue in heauen but thee and what is there in earth that desire with thee

to end this point two things we must learne from this soueraignty of good which are concluded in this one rule primum in vnoquo{que genere est mensura reliquorum seeing christ is the soueraigne good he must season and stint all our desires
fire is the originall of heate and the sunne of light and we see that other things haue neyther heat nor light but as they doe partake of fire or the sunne and their measure of both is answerable to the participation of those originals so should it be with our desires they should looke to the prime desire the desire of all nations take their rellish from him and rellish nothing without him whatsoeuer doth not partake of him is no reasonable is no comfortable desire
if by this we try our selues we shall finde that for the most part they are but vaine they haue little communion with that from whence they should flow and which should set right bounds vnto them
and let this suffice for the soueraignty of that good which is in christ
come now to the community hee that is the soueraigne good about all is also the common good vnto all

but here appeares a paradoxe for all nations whose desire christ is

said to be were diuided into iewes and gentiles and st paul in one sentence tels vs that the manner of christs first comming was a stumbling blocke to the iew and foolishnesse to the gentiles
touching the st cap

saith christ came amongst his owne and his owne

not and st paul tels vs of the gentiles

the naturall man perceiueth not the things of god and it is a true rule ignotinulla cupido no man desires that which he doth not know

esay speaketh close to my text concerning christs first comming he shall grow vp before him as a tender plant and as a roote out of dry he hath no forme nor comlinesse and when wee shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him
this made st

austine thinke that this prophecie should not bee accomplished vntill the second comming of christ
but the text will not beare his commentary wherefore wee must helpe our selues with a distinction propositidiuini and propensionis humanae
it is certaine that in regard of gods purpose christ was the desire of all nations for gods pleasure was that the church should be enlarged vnto all the world and that euen of the choycest persons in the world many should slock vnto the church
tertullian hath a witty obseruation

that christ was therefore called alpha and omega because he brought all things in the end of the world to that state which they were at in the beginning so that gods fauour is as generall to mankinde at christs the second adams birth as it was in paradise when hee made the first adam
christ himselfe insinuates as much for whereas the iewes called him the sonne of abraham the son of dauid he delighteth vsually in the gospell to call himselfe the sonne of man as if hee did not belong to this or that familie but were common to all mankinde
therefore the apostle saith gal

that in christ iesus there is neyther iew nor gentile grecian nor barbarian bond nor free male nor female
the holy ghost came downe in the languages of all nations the stone in daniel cut out without hands did bring vnder all the kingdomes of the earth
will not trouble you with the generall prophecies deliuered to adam noah abraham nor with those which were deliuered by dauid salomon esay the rest let old symeon speake for all christ was prepared to be a light to the gentiles and the glory of the people israel
so that after the birth of christ it is euident that according to gods purpose the church is to be catholicke

but what shall we say to the propension of men for that also is a requisite vnto this desire
for he that is lord ouer all is rich vnto all that is to all that call vpon him so saith st paul rom
and when st peter saith that there is no respect of persons with god acts
hee addeth that in euery nation hee that feareth god and worketh righteousnesse is accepted of him wherefore though in the tenor of the gospell god excludes none yet the enquiry must be whether none exclude themselues

to make good my text wee will search how truly and how farre all nations may be said to desire christ
which that we may the better doe wee must learne that there is appetitus implicitus and elicitus wee are taught the distinction by the prophet esay cap


god there speaketh thus am sought of them that asked not after mee the words cannot

bee true except you vnderstand that there is a silent and a speaking desire

a silent desire is that which is vttered by our state the ground when it is dry is said to thirst for raine a wound in our body to call for a physician not that they speake but that their state sheweth that if they could speake they would vtter such a desire
the philosophers call it appetitum naturalem a desire that euery thing hath of its perfection and preferuation wch languisheth vntill it doth attaine it
there is no man so gracelesse but in this sense christ is his desire yea the more christ is his desire the more gracelesse hee is for where sinne most aboundeth there is grace most behoofefull
there is a second kinde of this silent desire which is not altogether so mute
may call it desiderium semivocale an desire in the hearts of men there is a naturall desire of soueraigne good
adam when he was stripped was made naked but he had so much left him that he saw he was naked and thereupon bestirred himselfe to seeke a couering and a simple one hee lighted vpon it was but figge leaues
his posteritie haue euery one of them reuealed the same consciousnesse of want and carefulnesse to supply their want
the very heathen epicures stoickes couetous prodigals men of all sects and all dispositions haue sought after a soueraigne good though in the nature thereof they haue erred
whence it followeth necessarily that as in their many they worshipped ignotum deum so did they amongst their diuers opinions of the soueraigne good tacitly confesse and affect ignotum benum
hitherto you haue heard onely of implicitus affectus the dumbe or at most the but affection wee must not rest here for this will not reach home wee must therefore finde another desire which is affectus elicitus and this also is
indefinite of which you reade in stories sacred and prophane and definite which the prophet seemes specially to meane in this place

touching the indefinite might insist vpon the sacrifices the vse wherof amongst the heathens what is it but a perpetuation of the first memoriall that god instituted of christ to come and no question but noahs sonnes did spread that tradition
some thinke that the wise men which as vpon this day repaired to christ were stirred vp by the prophecie of balaam who in his traunce said there shall come a starre out of iacob and a scepter shall rise out of israel
it may be that some knowledge of christ was spread in the time of the egyptian captiuity
whence trismegists workes if those bee his workes which we haue sauour of so great mysteries for he was an egyptian and from the egyptian priests had the platonists their more than heathenish theologie
but when the tenne tribes were carried into assyria and after them the iewes into babylon this mysterie was spread much more by the dispersed of the twelue tribes whereof there were some dwehing in all nations vnder heauen as you may gather by comparing st lukes words acts
with the entrance to the epistles of st iames and peter
it could not bee but that by these the world should haue some notice of a messias to come

especially after the bible was translated into greeke
surely the sybils wrote so plainely hereof that not onely the fathers alledge them against the heathens to proue the comming of christ but the latine poets also relate what they finde in them though they it witnesse that verse iam noua progenies coelo demittitur alto
yea they so misapplyed it

that sundry did affect a kingdome in the of rome onely working vpon the common opinion that was in the hearts of men that a great king about that time should be borne into the world
thus farre wee finde in histories that there was an indefinite report of a messias to come whom the world therefore had an indefinite desire to see

but this will not yet satisfie our prophet and indeede his words are a prophecie rather of that which should be vpon the comming of christ than a report of that which should be before
and not he only but other prophets testifie that christ should bee no sooner reuealed vnto but hee should be receiued by the world that the nations should flocke to him as if they had formerly longed for him

the nations say in opposition to the iewes

not but that many of the iewes did looke for him and entertaine him but few in comparison of the gentiles themselues therefore he was rather the expectation of the gentiles the gentiles entertained what the iewes refused as appeares acts
rom
and it was foretold deut
matth

the propagation of the gospell amongst the gentiles was strangely sudden the psalme compares it vnto the dew

the fruit of thy wombe is like the morning dew
malachie to the rising of the sunne and you know

that both of them as it were in an instant couer the face of the earth
esay's similies are of a woman that is deliuered before she is in trauell and of the flocking of doues vnto their house
zachary tels vs that they should come so fast that the city could not containe them
christ that the kingdome of heauen should suffer violence

tertullian reckons vp the nations which in his daies beleeued and shewes that christianity had the romane empire which was the more to be maruelled because the conquest was made by so meane men and that not ouer the bodies

but ouer the soules of them with whom they dealt they subdued the soules of the greatest potentates and brought them vnder christ and made the simple pesants that followed the plow to sing hymnes and psalmes vnto his praise

and no maruell for the apostles were inabled to speake to euery nation in their owne language and their tongues were tipt with the fire of heauen which suddenly illightned their vnderstandings to whom they preached and filled their hearts with a deuout zeale by this efficacie christ became the desire of all nations
and vntill wee come thus farre we haue not the full meaning of our prophet though haue brought you hereto by many degrees all comprehended vnder common desire
a common desire there could not bee except god had purposed that christ should be a common good neyther could it be that this common

good should take place except there were a propension thereunto in men
and this propension is euident in the miserie of mans state without christ more euident in the feeling that man hath thereof the euidence increased when men discouered but an indefinite hearkning after him but it is made compleate when they distinctly discerne him and their affections desire ardently to be partakers of him

there is one point more which may not omit and that is the strange construction of the words in my text they are desiderium venient the desire they shall come a nowne singular and a verbe plurall
there is a mysterie in it as the articles of our faith are beyond the strength of nature so doth the holy ghost often times in vttering them vary from the prescript of grammar rules
will shew it you in the two first articles of our creed
the first is of the trinity of persons wherein there is an vnitie of nature to note this in the beginning of the bible you haue a plurall nowne ioyned with a verbe singular bara
the second article is this is christs incarnation wherein though there bee but one person yet are there two natures and to note these two natures in one person doth the holy ghost vse this phrase desiderium venient
a significant phrase and puts vs in minde that eyther nature in christ will not satisfie our desire if hee come only as god his maiestie will be too great for vs to endure if onely as man his infirmity will bee too weake for to relieue vs he that comes must bee both god and man
againe though the natures that come bee two yet is our desire but one because it apprehends them both in one person and it is the vnitie of the person whereupon our desire doth finally rest it selfe

but will conclude this text doth checke our cold zeale and should make vs blush when we try our selues by it or by them that in the primitiue times did iustifie the truth of it their early flocking to pray and to heare their long perseuerance at it and often returnes to it shewed that they delighted to sit vnder the tree of life and that the fruit thereof was sweet vnto their soule they were euen with the spouse and their thirstie soules did with king dauids

like the chased hart breathe as it were and bray after the water brookes
euen in our fathers daies vpon the reuiuing of gods truth amongst vs some of this heauenly fire burned in the hearts of our people but it is long since quenched and our liues manifest the difference betweene factus

and natus christianus when a man first becomes a christian hee is at the best and then if euer his soule will poure out those passionate speeches in the way of thy iudgements lord haue watted for thee

the desire of my soule is to thy name and the remembrance of thee with my soule haue desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will seeke thee early
yee heauens aboue drop downe the dew and yee clouds raine righteousnesse let the earth open let instice and saluation grow forth let them both grow forth together
but the longer we liue commonly the worse we are aetas parentum peior auis and our children will be worse than wee are as wee are worse than were our fathers
the scripture witnesseth that christs desire is vnto vs his delight is to bee with the sonnes of men yea he spreads his loue as a banner ouer his church to make himselfe

more desirable to her
and how kinde hearted was he who being to eate the paschall lambe a type of his bitter passion and that immediately before his death could say desiderio desideraui haue earnestly desired to eate this passcouer with you undefined span alphabet this indeed argued vnspeakeable loue of christ to man
and should it not bee answered with the like affection of man towards christ it should yea and indeed it would be if we did know what want we haue of him if we did feele the burden of our sinne if wee did see how little wee haue of heauenly grace
this sense this sight would set an edge vpon our dull appetite and christ which is here stiled the desire of all nations would be to euery one of vs our desire

but let vs take heede who when we may haue him doe not desire him lest the time come when wee shall desire him but may not haue him
christ may remoue our candlesticke and his kingdome and then the iewes doome may be ours and wee may desire to see one of the dayes of the sonne of man and shall not see it
this god forbid and that he may forbid it hee poure the grace of his holy spirit into our soules that may so illighten our mindes and warme our hearts that discerning clearly and ardently affecting that soueraigne good which god is pleased should be common to vs all we may not only during this feast but euer congratulating our happinesse sing hosanna blessed is hee that commeth in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest

the third sermon
epigraph and will fill this house with glory

the description of christs presence in that temple which was built by zorobabel iosua and others doth set before vs first his person then his workes
of his person spake last it followeth that now come on to his workes
they are two bounty and security the bounty is set forth first absolutely then comparatiuely
of the comparison hereafter if god will my purpose is now god assisting me to open so much of the text as sets forth christs bounty absolutely it is comprehended in these words will fill this house with glory
wherein obserue what is conferred and on whom
the gift is glory the receiuer the house both are amplified the house by the meannesse this house the gift by the greatnesse will fill it with glory
out of both is made manifest the exceeding grace of christ who honoured that so much that had so little to make it honourable

that god who is pleased that we all should bee his houses may so honour vs let vs listen attentiuely that wee may entertaine affectionately the honour which he vouchsafeth to vs

come wee then to the particulars the first is the thing conferred glorie

glorie if it be true glory is a resplendencie of some good solid and eminent the foundation of glory must bee that which is good for where there is no true good there can be no glory shame there may bee according to that of the apostle rom
what fruit had yee then in those things whereof yee are now ashamed and st iude the wicked fome out their owne shame
but of good things some are transitorie and vaine some heauenly and eternall not the former but the later kinde is the foundation of glory

the hebrew mother of tongues which speaketh of things most properly by one word noteth waightinesse and glory as likewise with them one word signifieth things vile and light the apostle seemes to allude hereunto cor
our momentanie affliction doth worke vnto vs an exceeding eternall waight of glory
waight of glory that is waighty glory glory that hath some substance or solidnesse in it whereunto he opposeth light afflictions though they seeme grieuous yet doe they consist of no enduring substance nubecula sunt they quickely passe and vanish away

and indeed of such shadowes or dreames rather are all worldly things made all flesh is grasse withering grasse the glory thereof is as a flower

a fading flower the sonnes of men are vanity the sons of noble men are but a lye if they were put in the scales together they would weigh lighter than vanitie it selfe
but of faith hope and charitie the apostle speaketh better

he giues them the title of undefined span alphabet of substance and he telleth vs that wee are made partakers of christ if wee hold fast the substance finally the wise man tels vs that righteousnesse is full of immortality
so that in those lasting not these fleeting things must we seek the foundation of true glorie

the apostles rule is we may not glory in the flesh not in the flesh as it is the good creature of god

meane in the mortall state thereof the strong man may not glory in his strength the wise man in his wisedome the rich man in his riches how much lesse may we glory in the lusts of the flesh sinfull lusts which are the workmanship of the diuell no such boasting can be good

as st paul tels the corinthians in his censure of the incestuous person

and dauid checketh doeg in those words why boastest thou thy selfe thou tyrant that thou canst doe mischiefe

but yet if we looke vpon the face of the world we shall finde that not onely transitory things but also wicked lusts are the foundation of most mens glory and wee may renew the apostles words mourning words there bee many which walke

of whom haue told you often and now tell you weeping whose god is their belly whose glory is their shame which minde earthly things
but our glory must haue a better foundation it must be a solid good

neyther is it enough vnto glory that the good be solid it must be also eminent an ordinary good may bee laudible it cannot bee honourable

it may make a man accepted but not admired no man is thought worthy of glory that is not more than an ordinary man
for glory is an attendant vpon heroicall vertue and that is vertue in the highest degree such as was the chastitie of ioseph the patience of iob the fortitude of iosua the pictie of dauid and the wisedome of salomon
a man must partake of the diuine nature and draw as neare as may be to gods image before he can deserue to be glorious

the last thing required vnto glory is that the solid and eminent good be also resplendent a worthy man must be as a picture set in bono neyther will bee regarded except they bee placed there where their worth may be discerned
for in regard of glorie idem est non esse non apparere a hidden treasure and wisedoine concealed are both alike saith salomon ecclus

they lose their praise and glory the kinsmen of christ out of this principle set vpon him there is no man that doth any thing in secret and himselfe seeketh to be knowne openly
the greekes call honestie undefined span alphabet because it calleth all men to it the hebrewes call it tab because it is beautifull and pleasant and maketh all in loue with it most languages call worthy personages lights because the lustre of their vertue is the pleasing obiect of euery mans eye
wherefore our sauiour biddeth vs matth

let our light so shine before men that they may see our good workes and glorifie our father which is in heauen

haue hitherto opened vnto you the nature of glorie haue shewed you what and how many things are requisite thereunto but where shall we finde it what is the first or rather proper subiect of it surely god

wee learne it in exodus moses desired to see gods glory god made his goodnesse to passe before him as if his goodnesse and glory were synonyma's certainely they are inseparable
his goodnesse is solid it is his very nature who is called iohoua and is that which he is
secondly his goodnesse is eminent for whatsoeuer is good is predicated of him in abstracto wisedome truth righteousnesse holinesse

and abstract names note absolute perfections
finally his goodnesse is most resplendent therefore st iames calleth him the father of lights dauid hath made many psalmes in acknowledgement hereof
for this cause doth the scripture often times vse the name of glory when it meaneth god the iewes in the old testament are blamed by the prophets for neglecting for forsaking their glory that is god and st peter in the new testament

speaking of the testimonie which god the father gaue vnto our sauiour christ in the mount saith hee heard a voyce from the magnificent glory

glory then is originally in god but by deriuation it is communicated from him vnto others angels princes

both are called undefined span alphabet in the scripture
but to none doth this title so truely belong as vnto christ
st paul heb
cals him undefined span alphabet the brightnesse of his fathers glory when he was to come into the world esay saith cap

the glory of the lord should be reuealed and biddeth ierusalem bee bright because her glory is risen and in the person of eliakim speaking of christ

he shall bee a glorious throne saith he vnto them and they shall hang vpon

him all the glory of his fathers house

behold saith zacharie the man whose name is the branch

he shall come out of his place he shall build a temple and he shall beare the glory
finally seeing our sauiour is god manifest in the flesh hee deserues well that praise which is giuen him in the churches hymne thou art the king of glory christ

but whereas gods glory doth shine vnto vs in the face of christ we must enquire what manner of glory it is for in god there is a glory as you may gather out of the place of exod cap

compared with cap

a glory of his iustice and a glory of his mercy the solemne and publicke manifesting of eyther of them meane his iustice or his mercie is manifesting of his glory
touching his iustice we haue an excellent place in esay in a vision god shewed himselfe in the temple

enuironed with the saraphims who cryed holy holy holy lord god of hosts heauen and earth are full of thy glory this was the glory of his iustice for verse
he denounceth the sentence of induration against the iewes the like manifestation wee finde in moses numb
as liue saith the lord all the earth shall bee filled with the glory of the lord but it is the glory of his iustice for immediately hee doth doome all those israelites that had not hearkned to his voyce saying surely they shall not see that land which sware vnto their fathers to giue them

there is another branch of gods glory called it the glory of his mercie it was figured partly by the cloud and partly by the arke the cloud was a type of gods milde appearance for it was seated not betweene seraphims fiery angels messengers and instruments of wrath but betweene the cherubims which had the shape of men louely and meeke men
adde hereunto that it rested vpon the arke the couering whereof was called the mercie seate
eyther of these was called the glory of the lord the cloud often in moses the arke in that known storie of the destruction of elie's sonnes at what time the arke being taken by the philistines

elie's daughter called her childe ichabod the glory is gone
for attending vpon these two were the cherubims called cherubims of glorie and for containing them the temple was called the habitation and throne of gods glory
but all these were types the truth of them was christ
hee was the truth of the cloud in his flesh did god so appeare that he might be endured by the sight of men and he appeared for those vses whereunto the cloud was designed for direction and protection you may gather it out of esay cap

and st paul speaketh plainely cer
that christ came into the world as the wisedome and the power of god
as christ was the truth of the cloud so was hee of the mercieseate
st paul rom
cals him by the very name of it undefined span alphabet god accepteth vs in him by him we come with boldnesse to the throne of grace and finde mercy in the time of neede heb
the angels that attended him were not seraphims but cherubims they appeared in the shape of men and whensoeuer they appeared they came to bring comfort christ then did in his person manifest gods mercifull glory which is the glorie meant in this text
wherefore will conclude this point with the words of the euangelist iohn
the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst vs

and we saw his glory as the glory of the only begotten son of god full of grace and ll of truth

haue sufficiently opened vnto you that which is conferred wee must now see whereon
the text saith it was the house the prophet meaneth the temple then building by zorobabel
some haue thought that the temple which was standing when christ was incarnate was not the temple built by zorobabel but another which herod built
but we must take heede of that opinion for it hath two euils in it

it giueth the holy ghost the lye in this place
and it cherisheth the iewes vaine of their messias
it is true that herod enlarged that temple and added many buildings to it but he did not demolish the old neither indeed could he and this prophecie continue true for god promised that christ should come euen into this temple that now was building
and seeing that temple with all the additions of herod hath many hundied yeares since according to christs prophecie beene so destroyed that there remaineth not one stone vpon another the iewes doe more than vainely yet looke for a messias especially seeing god hath manifested to the world that it was not only totally but sinally also destroyed
the iewes had good proofe hereof in the daies of iulian the apostata when

notwithstanding that wicked emperour encouraged and furthered them to it fearefull tempests from heauen destroyed in the night what they did in the day god then making good against iacob what in malachie hee spake against esau thus saith the lord of hosts

they shall build but will cast downe they shall call them the border of wickednesse the people against whom the lord hath indignation for euer
but will leaue them to god whom god hath left to the world as a spectacle of stupiditie and a bridle to hold vs in from like contempt

it is plaine the place here meant was zorobabels temple vpon that place was the glory conferred
malachie cap

said it should bee so hee said that the lord should come into his temple and he should sit downe there and refine the sonnes of leui and rectifie the diuine worship
the gospel teacheth vs that it was so for hee was not onely presented in that temple when he was a babe and when hee was twelue yeares old a disputant there with the doctors but also when he was solemnely inaugurated he first purged the temple of buyers and sellers then he reformed the doctrine and the discipline at seuerall times when he resorted thither at solemne feasts there he made his sermons and wrought his miracles so that he might truly say to the high priests when he was arraigned before them sate daily with you teaching in the temple

will adde one text more which may serue in stead of all when his parents that had lost found him in the temple they expostulated with him in these words sonne why hast thou serued vs thus

thy father and haue sought wee sorrowing christ replyes vnto them why sought yee me did you not know undefined span alphabet wee render it wist yee not that must goe about my fathers businesse but the words may well beare another sense also wist yee not that it was sit for mee to bee in my fathers house for so he calleth the temple elsewhere and so speaketh st paul heb

christ as a sonne was ouer his owne house
some referre hither that speech of christ touching the paying of tribute

the sonnes are free because that money is thought to haue beene originally a taxation for the temple and by the romanes conuerted to other vses when they collected it

but enough of the place only take this note out of the coniunction of the place and the gift that christs comming to be the glorie of the temple giueth vs to vnderstand that his kingdome was not temporall but spirituall he came not to raise an earthly monarchie but to gather a people vnto god

the next point that obserued is the amplification both of the place and the gift of the place in regard of the meannes which is noted in the word this house
the iewes had two temples one built by salomon a glorious one this built by zorobabel a poore one
the iewes wept when they saw the foundations of it and god testifieth that it was as nothing in their eyes and this nothing as it were moued herod to make those additions before specified that it might become like something
marke christ came not vnto salomons temple but vnto zorobabels so that the temple which had most of earthly cost had nothing in it but the type of christ and that temple that had least of earthly glory had most of heauenly it had the truth christ came thither in person
god regardeth not outward pompe neyther doth he tye his presence thereunto as if he would not be where there is no worldly state nay commonly where there is least of the world

god is there most and they haue greatest familiarity with him who haue worst entertainement in the world
did not our sauiour christ giue vs an excellent representation hereof in his own person

the godhead dwelt bodily in him but that body bare the shape of a seruant the apostles carried about the world heauenly treasures but they carried them in earthen vessels
an ancient father obserues wittily that when the church was so poore that it had but wooden chalices it had golden priests wee may adde people too and when the ornaments of the church became golden then the priests and people became wooden gods word was heard more reuerently hee was serued more deuoutly when the church met in caues in woods in deserts than euer he was in townes and cities and these most stately fabricks

this must be obserued in the question of the visibility of the church or rather conspicuity
the aduocates of rome seeme to triumph much against the reformed churches as if the obscurity wherein sometimes they lay hidden

did preiudice the truth which they profest they forget st hilaries admonition male nos cepit parietum amor
we are ill aduised to measure faith by multitude of professors

or by goodly temples where the profession is made
st austine will tell vs ecclesia aliquando obscuratur aliquando obnubilatur multitudine scandalorum the glory of the church is subiect to eclypses it was so in the old testament as appeares by elia's complaint reg
they haue slaine all thy prophets and throwne downe thine altars

and am left alone
it hath beene no better vnder the new testament witnesse st hierome ingemuit totus mundus

se arianum factum miratus est arianisme so got the vpper hand that the orthodoxe faith scarce durst be known in the whole catholick church
in the old testament god promised by zephanie cap

will leaue in the middest of thee an humble and poore people and they shall trust in me christ in the gospell feare not little flocke it is your fathers pleasure to giue you a kingdome luke

as the text doth amplifie the place from the meanenesse

so doth it the gift from the greatnesse thereof will fill fill this house with that glory
the phrase is allusiue to gods typicall presence in the former temple for therein rested the cloud and it filled all the house all that part of the house which was called the holy place
when the second temple was built there was no such thing god was pleased to reserue it for the truth that he that is the fulnesse of all should fill that temple
and indeede god was neuer more there than when hee was there in christ if euer hee was then an oracle to his church
adde out of ezechiel cap

that by his presence omnis circuitus templi was made sanctum sanctorum

for ought we reade christ neuer came into that place of the temple which was called sanctum or sanctum sanctorum the holy place or holiest of holies but this he did being borne that holy thing

and anointed the most holy he made all places of the temple where he came holy yea and most holy he filled them with the glory of his person and the glory of his function
the truth say filled euen the worst part of the temple which the type did not
but shall meete with this point in the next sermon wherefore will dwell no longer now vpon it

this historicall sense which haue hitherto opened doth present vnto vs a mysticall which may not neglect god doth not delight in materiall houses built with timber and stone the temple was but a type of the church
christs house are you saith st paul to the hebrewes cap

and to the ephesians cap

he tels vs of the foundation the corner stone
saint peter epist

sheweth vs that we as liuing stones comming vnto the precious stone christ make vp a house vnto god
so that whatsoeuer blessing is contained in this text belongeth vnto vs and vnto the temple but in reference vnto vs
a thing to be obserued because the world hath alwaies beene in looking into these intentions of god they haue rested on the types without due reflection vpon themselues whereas god therein would only helpe our memorie and condescend to our infirmitie and that vpon a principle which preuaileth much with vs which is this sense is the best informer of our reason and solliciter of our will
and did wee make as good vse of it in things belonging to god and our soule as wee doe in things pertaining to the world and concerning our naturall life christ should not haue beene occasioned to vtter that sentence the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light
well then let vs gather some few such morals as this text will yeelde

the first is that where christ commeth hee bringeth a blessing iacob

did so to laban ioseph to pharaoh daniel to nebuchadnezzar
there is not a good man that maketh not the place whither he commeth the better for him how much more the chiefe of saints our sauiour christ the very type of him

meane the arke made obed edoms house to prosper
if the shadow wrought so much what good may we expect from the substance it selfe

the second morall is that god in christ taketh vpon him to bee the glorie of the house so that where christ is there the glorie is
the church of rome is plentifull in earthly ornaments of their church and wee are carefull that the word of god should dwell richly in ours it were well if both were ioyned together wish we had more of their ornaments and they had more of christs truth
but if they must bee kept asunder through the malice of the diuell our case is better that haue fewer ornaments and more truth than theirs that haue lesse truth and more ornament
for christ is properly the glory of a church where hee is though it bee in the wildernesse there is glory and there is no glory where he is not though the temple be as goodly as salomons
the third is the particle this this house containes the comfort of poor soules for though in the sense of our meanenesse we haue all reason to say lord am not worthy that thou shouldest come vnder the roofe of my house yet saith the lord esay
heauen is my throne and the earth is my footestoole where is the house that yee build vnto me and where is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things saith the lord but to this man will looke euen to him that is poore and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word
and it was the very life of kings dauids penitentiall prayer psal
a broken and contrite heart lord wilt not thou despise
wherefore conclude this point with the exhortation of st iames let the brother of low degree reioyce in that he is exalted bee hee neuer so meane a house christ will not disdaine euen in his glory to come vnto him he will come and bring his glory with him
the fourth is that hee will not only bring his glory but fill that house
but it is as the soule filleth the body euery part according to his proportion some part is filled as the head some as the hand some as the feete so that euery house may bee full and yet one house containe more than another
as it is most behoofefull for vs so doth christ dispence his grace vnto vs

but this filling may be vnderstood eyther inhaerenter or immanenter in christ or transeunter and redundanter to vs that is eyther that he which commeth into the house is full of glory or else that the house whereinto hee commeth is by him transformed into glory
take a simile from the sunne the beames of the sunne doe fill the ayre and the firmament but you easily perceiue that they doe it in a different fashion they fill the ayre but so that the ayre altereth not in nature but continueth the same onely it is the place wherein the beames of the sun do appeare but as for the firmament the sunne sendeth his beames into that so that it maketh many

a light body of it many a starre and st paul telleth vs

that they differ each from the other in glory
christ doth fill our house both waies if you looke to our iustification he brings glory to vs as the sunne doth the light vnto the aire the brightnesse whereof doth grace the ayre yet it remaines inherently still in the beames and is not transfused into the substance of the ayre euen so christs righteousnesse passeth not out of his person and yet it is the ornament of our person it is inherent in him it is imputed to vs and in the eyes of god doth grace and commend vs as if it were ours
but if you looke to sanctification that redounds from christ vnto vs it maketh vs starres in the spirituall firmament though of vnequall magnitude and vnequall glory
st paul is cleare for it cor
wee with open face behold the glorie of god and are transformed into the same image from glorie vnto glory euen by the powerfull spirit of christ
when the apostles did but see christs transformation in the mount though themselues were not transfigured yet they thought it so happy a sight that they cryed out bonum est esse hìc let vs pitch our tabernacles here
and what would they haue thought if themselues also might haue been partakers of the same glorie if themselues might haue appeared like vnto him if they might haue beene as he was yet such is our condition in christ

the last morall shall be that whereas other things that fill vs proportion themselues vnto and take vp whatsoeuer capacity they finde it is not so with christ whatsoeuer he filleth that he enlargeth

and the more we haue of him the more capacity we haue the more capacity of glory for that is that wherewith he filleth all other things deale worse with vs they straighten our capacitie or fill vs with vanitie
wherefore were we as wise as we should be wee would suffer no bodie to take vp any roome in vs but only christ wee would leaue no corner for the diuell or the world or our corrupt lusts
and indeede who would any part from him to continue a straight a darke a filthy dungeon that by his presence may bee made a large a light a glorious habitation and yet so it is some of vs steale our heads from him and entertaine errour some steale their hearts from him and therein lodge sinnefull lusts there is no man that doth not some part and keep that part the worse for it
but this should bee to euery one of vs his votiue prayer to thee christ consecrate totum me and totum mei my whole selfe and all that is in me humbly desiring that nothing may inhabit me but thy selfe and that which commeth from thee

this is that whereunto aduise my selfe as aduise you and that aduise not in vaine let vs lay this text to the former there we heard of a desire here of a filling
salomon hath a good rule a desire accomplished delighteth the soule so that if we profited so much by the last sermon as to make christ our desire we may be comforted by this which assures vs that our desire shall be filled
yea whereas desire is sinus cordis the bosome or lappe as it were of the heart if we doe enlarge it god will replenish it
but let vs bee sure that this sermon doth little concerne vs if the former tooke no place in vs dauid no sooner heard that obed edoms

house prospered by hauing the arke but hee was stirred vp with a godly zeale to bring it vnto sion to bring it to his owne citie
what shall wish vnto you but that hauing heard the blessing that christs presence brought to zorobabels temple euery one of you would striue to lodge him in your temples the temples of your bodies the temples of your soules so may he fill these mysticall as he did that typicall temple so fill them here with the glory of his grace that they may bee hereafter filled with the grace of his glorie

wherefore lift vp your heads yee gates and bee yee lift vp yee euerlasting doores and the king of glorie shall come in

saluation is near them that feare him that glory may dwell in their land

let thy worke lord be seene towards thy seruants and thy glorie vpon their children that in the sensible sweet comfort thereof wee may all now and euer sing glory bee to thee lord most high
blessing honour glory and power bee vnto him that sitteth vpon the throne and vnto the lambe for euer and euer
amen

the fovrth sermon
epigraph

the siluer is mine and the gold is mine
the glorie of this later house shall bee greater than the glory of the former

the bountie which christ vouchsafed that temple which was built by zorobabel is by this our porphet set forth absolutely and comparatiuely
of the absolute consideration thereof spake last will passe now on to the comparatiue exprest in those words which now haue read vnto you
of this comparison we must obserue the preface and the contents
the preface will teach vs what christ can the contents what hee will doe christ can in point of bountie doe as much as he will so much the words of the preface import the siluer is mine the gold is mine
and he will doe more than the iewes doe desire for they would haue beene contented if they might haue had a temple but as goodly as that of salomon christ will doe more for them the glory of the later house shall be greater than the glorie of the former
but more distinctly
these points of christs power and his will must be opened first seuerally then ioyntly

if wee looke into them seuerally then wee shall finde that the preface which sets forth christs power doth in the outside of the words entitle him to these earthly mettals gold and siluer but the inside will informe

vs that he is owner of much more precious mettals of gold and siluer that are heauenly

as for the contents the comparison therein presented vnto vs may be conceiued eyther of fabricke to fabricke or furniture to furniture
will touch at both that so you may the better see of whether and how far my text may be iustified
hauing thus opened the points seuerally will ioyne them together and shew you that first christs power is set downe before his will that the iewes should not thinke he doth promise more than hee can performe secondly that his will beareth correspondencie to his power and he giueth gifts not sutable to the narrownesse of our desire but to the widenesse of his owne store
of these particulars shall now god willing speake briefly and in their order
god grant we may so listen to and profit by that which shall be said concerning christs power and will that it may bee his gracious will alwaies to sustaine and blesse vs according to his all sufficient power

come we then to the preface and first to the outside of the words the siluer is mine the gold is mine if so we reade the preface it doth entitle christ to these earthly mettals gold siluer and his title is iust and clear
he that made all is owner of all now all things were made by christ and without him nothing was made that was made iohn
therefore wee may conclude with the psalmist psal
the earth is the lords and the fulnesse thereof the round world and they that dwell therein
it is true that the diuell shamed not to christs owne face to say all the kingdomes of the earth are mine and theirs to whom will giue them luke
but that was but the vaunt of the father of lies
nabals speech was a speech beseeming a nabal sam

shall take my flesh and my bread and giue it vnto men whom know not the diuell experienced christs right and so did nabal too christ stripped them both of that which they had and he threatneth no lesse vnto the iewes and israelites

when they became so gracelesse as to deriue his title to others to their louers as the prophet cals them be they idols or men

will open this point a little more fully
there is ius ad rem and ius in re propertie and possession right to a thing and power ouer that thing these are many times seuered in men many a man hath right to that ouer which he hath no power he is kept out with a strong hand

and many a man hath power ouer that whereunto hee hath no right his strength is the law of all his righteousnesse
it is not so with christ property and possession meete both in him and hee hath power ouer whatsoeuer hee hath right vnto both right and power extend vnto all things
his right

for hee is the onely begotten of the father therefore heire of all things in the second psalme he that said thou art my sonne this day haue begotten thee said also aske of mee and will giue vnto thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the vttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
neyther is christ an inheritor only but a purchaser also

he therefore dyed and rose againe that he might be lord of quicke and dead that he might be king of kings and lord of lords
a double right then hath christ vnto all by birth by purchase

and his power is as wide as his right

by hee is an god and by purchase all power is giuen vnto him both in heauen and earth therefore iob saith cap

the lord giueth and the lord taketh the psalmist promotion commeth neyther from the east nor from the west

but the lord setteth vp one

and taketh downe another
daniel blessed be the name of the lord for euer and euer for wisedome and might are his hee changeth times and seasons he remoueth kings and setteth them vp he doth whatsoeuer hee will both in heauen and in earth

out of this which haue told you concerning christs right you may learne many good lessons first from the propertie
if he haue right to all in whosoeuers hand it is then no man should come vniustly by his goods for he that defraudes his brother defraudeth not man but god euen as a master that putteth his goods into his seruants hand is the principall partie that is wronged if his seruant be eyther deceiued or oppressed and as the master will pursue his right against the wrong doer so will god also take vengeance vpon all vniust persons hee will in the world to come nay he doth in this world for what chronicle is there that doth not iustifie the prouerbe de malè quaesitis non gaudet tertius haeres will gotten goods neuer prosper as christs propertie in our goods teacheth vs not to get them vniustly so doth it teach vs also not to vse them vnreasonably
a tenant that holdeth land from a lord may not vse it otherwise than according to the couenants agreed vpon if hee doe hee forfeiteth euen so is it betweene god and vs the grant which he maketh vs of his creatures is but conditionall wee may take conuenient foode for our sustenance decent cloathing to shrowd vs from the iniuries of the weather and we may bestow our money to supply our own and other folkes necessaries
to these ends wee may vse gods creatures but wee may not riot with our meate and drinke we may not be fantasticall in our apparell neyther may we with our wealth grinde the faces of the poore we haue no couenant that warrants any of these and therefore the doing of any of these is a forfeit to him that is proprietarie
and how often might christ vpon our goods if he would take aduantage of our daily abuses yea he daily doth if wee had grace to see it for what goodly patrimonies daily come to nought by drunkennesse pride oppression would the world did take as much notice of it as euery place doth giue them iust occasion to doe for what countrey what shire what citie yea what village aboundeth not with examples hereof these lessons christs right to our goods doth yeeld vs

his power ouer our goods will yeeld vs as many for seeing our goods are not in our owne power but in christs wee may not trust in them but in him
it is the apostles rule tim

wee may not trust in vncertaine riches but in the liuing god
our wealth may be taken from vs as iobs was or we may betaken from our wealth

as the rich man in the gospell who while hee was inuiting his soule to eate and drinke because he had store laid vp for many yeares heard that vnpleasing message thou foole this night shall they take thy soule from thee

and then whose shall all these things

bee our selues are not in our owne power much lesse our goods therefore it is good trusting in neyther of them but in him that hath power ouer both

secondly this power of god ouer our wealth must remember vs that to our honest endeauours wee adde our deuout prayers for

for except the lord build the house they labour but in vaine that build it
wee may plant wee may water it is god that must giue the increase if hee bee closehanded euery thing will famish and he filleth euery liuing creature with his good gifts when hee openeth his hand it is his blessing as salomon teacheth pro that maketh men rich

ioyne christs right and his power together and gather what wretches they are that for wealth forsake him who hath right to it and power to bestow it and betake themselues vnto the diuel who is but a pretender of right and when by gods permission he hath done his best for them hee cannot keepe them in possession
and no wonder the gospell teacheth that christ with a word did cast him out how then should hee be able to keep others in

secondly when gods children are in want wee may not argue therehence that christ is vnable to relieue

can god prepare a table in the wildernesse was the voyce of infidelity for god is shaddai it is one of his essentiall attributes and it is not vnlikely that the names deus and diues come from thence
but it is not expedient that god alwaies bestow wealth vpon vs the fatnesse of the earth doth make vs lesse thinke vpon the dew of heauen the content wee take in things earthly doth make vs lesse minde those things that are heauenly wherefore god keepeth vs to a shorter diet in things corporal that we might rellish things spirituall the better

to passe here from the outside of the preface to the inside thereof wee must obserue that the holy ghost meaneth also by these words to correct a carnall conceit of the iewes they were much troubled for that they wanted gold and siluer wherewith to make a house for god as if he stood in need of or did primarily respect those things whereas it is not gold and siluer which god requires of men but that which was signified by these mettals
and who can tell whether god did not destitute them of these things corporall that their hearts might bee set more ardently vpon those things that were answerable vnto them vpon the things spirituall certainely christs purpose was so to raise their thoughts the phrase in the originall seemes to import it for whereas we reade the siluer is mine and the gold is mine the hebrew word forword is mihi est argentum mihi est aurum haue gold haue siluer the words giue the iewes to vnderstand that there are more kindes of gold and siluer than they dreamt of that there are heauenly mettals whereof gods house must consist learne it of st paul cor
other foundation can no man lay than that which is layd iesus christ vpon this if any man build gold or siluer his worke will abide
what gold or siluer doth he meane that which is digged out of the mine st peter pet

denieth that saying wee are not redeemed with corruptible things as gold and siluer but with the precious blood of

iesus christ
it must bee gold then sutable to the foundation and that is spirituall such as heauenly ierusalem is built of all whose streets are pure gold

and such as the children of god are made of who as the apostle
tim

tels vs are vessels of gold
in comparison of these heauenly those earthly mettals are but vile as iob
salomon pro

teach at large

and the wiseman hath comprehended it in few words did not compare vnto wisedome any stone of inestimable price because all gold in respect of her is as a little sand and all siluer shall be accompted as clay before her

what then doth the holy ghost mean by these phrases surely because wee cannot apprehend things heauenly but as they are represented in things earthly hee speaketh undefined span alphabet in a language familiar to men but would haue vs vnderstand him undefined span alphabet in a sense beseeming god
as then these mettals are things highly esteemed by men so must wee thinke that those are not of meane value which god bestoweth vpon vs in christ they are as gold and siluer there can bee no better
and see how gods prouidence hath disposed of words to worke in vs the deeper impression of things for whereas there is a double valuation of things the one as they are considered in se in themselues the other as they are considered ad nos as wee respect them here are both valuations
if a thing bee considered in it selfe so wee value it according to the puritie thereof and as it is freest from drosse and that purity is intimated by the hebrew name of gold zahabh which is as much as mundum and therefore it is applied to the northren winde that cleareth the skie and to oyle that is most bright and pure
ad nos if things bee considered so are they valued as they most affect vs and this affection is noted by the name of siluer which is ceseph and hath its name from desire because all men doe desire it
so that whether you consider christ in himselfe or vnto vs you see by these words that he is very valuable valuable for the purity of his nature as gold and for our affection towards him valuable also because desireable as siluer
finally to shut vp this note marke that mihi argentum mihi aurum haue siluer haue gold this phrase doth restraine these things vnto christ as if they were not to bee found in any other besides him
come to mee saith christ to the church of laodicea reuel

and buy gold tryed in the fire taxing whatsoeuer they had besides as beggerie and pouertie
to the same sense though vnder another resemblance speaketh christ in esay cap

wherefore doe yee spend your money for that which is not bread and your labour for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently vnto me and eate you that which is good and let your soule delight it selfe in fatnesse
as then god vnder the name of gold doth giue vs to vnderstand that he hath treasured vp all purity and perfection in christ so by the name of siluer doth he call for all our desires and command them to be placed vpon christ
and let this suffice touching the preface the outside and the infide thereof

come now to the comparison whereunto that preface is prefixt and

the contents hereof open christs will what he will doe as in the preface you had his power what he could doe

now the comparison may be eyther of fabricke to fabricke or furniture to furniture

if we compare the fabricks then certainely zorobabels temple came short of salomons you may gather it from these foure inequalities
the first is of the architects the plot of salomons temple was drawn by god himselfe he inspired it into dauid by the holy ghost

and hee committed it vnto salomon the wisest prince that euer was in the world and best able to conceiue it to say nothing of the instruments or workemen that were employed to execute it
the second temple had no other architect prescribing the forme but cyrus

who deliuered it by charter vnto zorobabel and it was performed by no extraordinary workemen

the second inequalitie is in the number of the labourers

salomon employed two hundred thousand which is more than three times as many as returned from the babylonian captiuity
adde hereunto that they laboured at least seuen yeares vncessantly about the building of salomons temple the second temple was not so long in building

if you except the intermissions which were caused by their aduersaries though there were fewer workemen vpon it

a third inequalitie appeares in the dimensions for cyrus scanted much the measure that was vsed by king salomon and vpon this ground it was that herod willing to get the good will of the iewes vndertooke the enlarging of the temple to equall it to the first as iosephus reports

the fourth and the last inequalitie stands in the materials vsed about the fabricke to say nothing of their qualities certainely those that were vsed about the first temple did in quantity farre exceede those that were vsed about the second
for what comparison could there be between the riches of poore captiue iewes and of king salomon that was the most glorious monarch in the world

adde hereunto the prouision that his father king dauid made in his time a hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of siluer and brasse and iron without weight besides what he gaue out of his owne peculium or priuate treasurie for the former were dedicated out of the spoyles of kingdomes which he conquered three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and seuen thousand talents of refined siluer besides great abundance of all sorts of precious stones
whereunto adde the offering of the fathers of israel fiue thousand talents and ten thousand drammes of gold and of siluer ten thousand talents of brasse eight thousand talents and a hundred thousand talents of iron besides precious stones
and put all this together and therewith increase salomons wealth the totall will bee a summe of infinite value farre exceeding that wherewith zorobabel was furnisht eyther by the persian kings or by his owne yea although you adde what afterward was bestowed eyther by alexander the great or his successours kings of syria and those of egypt neither will the additions of other benefactors no not that of herod make vp the summe
dare say boldly that if all the christian kings of

the west for so many yeares as the temple was a building by salomon should contribute their treasures they could not raise a summe answerable to that which was expended vpon the first temple and reserue to themselues their kingly ports as dauid and salomon did
neither neede wee out of the incredulitie of the summe as some learned doe question the signification of the word talent as if it signified a lesser summe than commonly it is taken for
for to say nothing that it is the same authour that wrote both the
and the
of the first of chronicles and that it is not likely he would vary the sense keeping himselfe to the same word they doe not marke that dauids offering was the spoyle of many kingdomes that god promised that salomon should bee the richest king in the world that the vessels of gold and siluer vsed in the temple were many thousands as appeares by iosephus and that there was great store of treasure layd vp there besides chro

neede say no more to proue that if we compare fabricke with fabricke we cannot finde therein the truth of these words of haggai

let vs come then to the furniture that is eyther typicall or spirituall such parts of the furniture as were figures of diuine things and that by gods owne ordinance were typicall
vpon diana's temple at ephesus apollo's at delphi the capitoline temple at rome and many other heathenish temples there was much gold and siluer bestowed yea and precious stones also but they wanted a typicall relation and therein did the temples of the iewes infinitely exceede them
in these types if we compare salomons temple with zorobabels

zorobabels commeth farre short of salomons
the iewes confesse that fiue eminent things were wanting in the later temple which were in the former
the cloud wherein god resided betweene the cherubims
the arke with the contents therein whereon the cloud rested
the fire kindled from heauen wherewith all their sacrifices were to be offered
the vrim and thummim on the breastplate of the high priest by which hee was inabled to giue out diuine oracles and ordinarily resolue the iewes perplexing doubts in peace and warre the fifth was the spirit of prophecie wherewith god furnished diuers other persons whom he sent as messengers vnto the kings and people of iuda and israel
now these fiue were the chiefe of all the typicall furniture if zorobabels temple came short in these fiue there can be no doubt but it was inferiour in types vnto that of salomons temple

what remaines then but that the greatnesse of the glorie here meant must consist in the spirituall and heauenly furniture of the later temple or else there was none at all
and indeede it is that which wee finde there we finde christ in person as in former sermons haue shewed you and hee is the truth of all those types
of the cloud for in him god dwelt visibly on earth

of the arke by him god shewed mercie vnto men of the fire for by his spirit all sacrifices must be offered that are acceptable vnto god of the vrim and thummim for hee is the word the wisedome of god finally of the spirit of prophecie for he is the prophet that was to come into the world and the reuelation of iesus christ is

the spirit of prophecie reuel

what shall say of the table of shewbread christ is the bread of life of the golden candlesticke

christ is the light of the world of the altar of incense it is christ that putteth sweet odours into the prayers of the saints of the altar of burnt offerings

sacrifice and offerings god did not desire but he opened christ eare and gaue him a body hee was the lambe of god that tooke away the sinnes of the world and his bloud cleanseth from all sinne
and what comparison betweene this truth and those types certainely no more than betweene earth and heauen therefore when the truth appeared the type vanished

it must needs follow then that the glorie of the later temple must needs be greater than the glorie of the former
greater if we insist only vpon christs apparition in the materiall temple of zorobabel

how much more if with the fathers st ambrose and st austine wee enlarge it to the christian church in whom christ abideth

and indeed zorobabels temple beeing voide of the types did represent the christian church as salomons full of them did represent the church of the iewes and then marke what st paul saith if these two churches be compared cor
euen that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which was done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious that whole chapter is a good commentarie vpon my text the epistle to the hebrewes is much fuller
so then wee must reade and consider this text as directed vnto vs it concernes vs for wee are partakers of that glory
and see how god dealeth both with the iewes and vs we haue enuious eyes and ambitious hearts we would not only be great but greatest we would not willingly that any should bee in better case than our selues
gods promise then goeth very farre which hee maketh to the iewes and in them to vs when hee saith that they shall not onely haue great glory but also great in comparison in comparison to that which was very glorious
so that if fertilior seges est and wee couet after the best gifts

the very phrase did put them and doth put vs in minde how deeply they were wee are bound to god for the honour that hee did them in christ

and doth to vs we should both ioy more therein than euer the israelites did at the dedication of salomons temple

but wee must not mistake and vnderstand the comparison made betweene the old and the new testament in an anabaptisticall sense as if they in the old testament had only corporall glorie and they in the new testament spirituall the glory of both is spirituall but theirs of the old testament was veiled with ceremonies ours in the new testament is vnueiled they had christ but they saw him not but through sacrifices and darke rites but we with open face doe behold the glory of the lord cor
therefore the apostle teacheth ephes

that of two we are made but one new man and rom
we are grafted into that from whence they sprang
secondly we must distinguish the meanes as they are offered of god and as they are receiued of men the glory of the new testament is greater in regard of the meanes offered of god blessed are the eyes that see that which you see saith our sauiour christ to his apostles

luke
and the eares that heare that which you heare for tell you many kings prophets and righteous men haue desired to see those things which you see and haue not seene them and to heare those things which you heare and haue not heard them
but in regard of entertainement of the meanes the glory of the patriarches faith vnder the old testament may well bee thought to haue equalled if not to haue gone beyond the glory of most of their faiths that liue vnder the new
and why the darker their meanes were the stronger was their faith that built vpon them and our faith though in worke equall is in worth vnequall because our meanes are clearer clearer than was afforded any of those worthies which are chronicled heb
whereupon will follow a third thing which is that seeing in heauen men shall fare not according to the meanes which god affordes them but according to their vse of the meanes we may not so aduance the glory of the new testament aboue that of the old as to thinke that in the life to come all that liue vnder the new testament shall haue precedencie of all those that liued vnder the old
well it will bee with many if not most of vs if wee may haue a place in abrahams bosome and sit down with him and with isaac and iacob in the kingdome of god

haue done with the points of my text as they were to be opened seuerally haue shewed you what christ can doe what he will doe it remaines that in very few words shew you what instructions they will yeelde vs if we ioyne them both together

obserue then that the prophet doth first set downe christs power and then his will in so doing the holy ghost doth helpe the infirmities of men
were we such as wee should bee wee would neuer question gods promise through doubt of his power but the best of gods children haue taken exception to gods promises and exprest their distrust
god promised abraham a childe in his old age

sarah laugheth at that and obiects her dead wombe and abrahams decrepit bodie
god promised moses that the children of israel should eate flesh a moneth together in the wildernesse

moses thus reasons against god the people amongst whom am are sixe hundred thousand footemen shall all the flocks and the heards be slaine to suffice them
you will not wonder to heare a prince of samaria the vnexpected plenty promised by elizeus

nor ahaz distrusting the despaired deliuerance of ierusalem from the armies of the king of israel and syria

it is not strange to see flesh and bloud so backeward in beleeuing god seeing they which are a good part spirit are not so forward as they should bee
it is not then without cause that the holy ghost prefixeth christs power before his will lest the ignorance of the power should make vs thinke that the prophet doth lauish in expressing his will
wherefore the holy ghost taking vs for no better than we are encourageth vs to hope well of christs promise out of the consideration of his sufficiencie and this is the reason why the first article in the creede is prefixt before all the rest it preuents the scruples that would rise in our distrustfull nature

a second instruction that the coupling of christs power and his will

will yeelde is that christ doth giue his gifts not according to the narrownesse of our desires but the width of his owne power
st paul ephes

telleth vs that christ is able to doe exceeding abundantly aboue all that wee aske or thinke and here the prophet telleth vs that he is willing to deale so
the iewes would haue had a temple glorious but they did not wish it more glorious than that of salomon
christ will haue the glory of the later house greater than that of the former
abrahams wish was oh that ismael might liue in thy sight god heard him and promised to multiply ismael exceedingly but he added a promise of an isaac too

in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed and whose should multiply as the sand of the sea and the starres in the firmament which are innumerable
salomon begged onely wisedome

god gaue him that in the highest degree but ouer and aboue and that in no low degree he heaped vpon him honour and wealth
how many came to christ for the helpe of their bodies and beyond their desire went away cured in their soules if wee in our prayers make the like triall of christ wee shall finde no worse successe

will conclude all with two good remembrances taught vs by king dauid

the first is grounded vpon the consideration of christs power
when wee cloathe the naked feede the hungry doe any good deede giue any thing to any good vse we must with that religious king confesse

omnia exmanu tua accepta offerimus tibi wee haue nothing which wee haue not receiued and we could not haue offered it to him except he had first bestowed it on vs for the siluer is his and the gold is his

the second remembrance is grounded vpon christs will and in sense hereof wee may learne of king dauid thankefull deuotion
when nathan brought him a message of more good than euer hee expected hee went vnto the tabernacle and first villifieth himselfe who am

lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto then he magnifieth gods mercie this was yet a small thing in thy sight lord god but thou hast spoken also of thy seruants house for a great while to come then he doth as we must all doe turne gods promise into a prayer and now lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy seruant and concerning his house establish it for euer and do as thou hast said
god did it for dauid he will do it for vs whereas they that are temples of grace haue a farther hope to be temples of glorie if we beleeue his power and desire the accomplishment of his will wee shall in due time experience a comparison which is beyond all comparison we shall be cloathed with a later house in heauen the glory whereof shall infinitely exceede the glorie of the former house of god which we are vouchsafed to be while we liue here on earth

which god grant vs for iesus christ his sake to whom with the holy ghost be rendred all honour and glorie
amen

the fift sermon
epigraph and in this place will giue peace

the exceeding grace that christ would vouchsafe to zorebabels temple reduced to his bountie in giuing and the securitie of his gift
of the bounty haue spoken it followeth that now come to the security that is exprest in those words that now haue read vnto you
wherein we will see first seuerally by what name the securitie is called it is peace secondly where is the resting place thereof in this place then ioyntly how the place commeth to bee possest of that peace
wherein wee shall consider that this worke is a whereof the only giuer is our sauiour christ will giue saith he peace in this place
these be the particulars whereof god willing shall now speake briefly and in their order
first then of the peace
peace is nothing else but a free enioying of whatsoeuer good we haue but the good which we haue may be eyther ordinate or inordinate full or scant and so the enioying thereof may bring vnto vs a peace true or false perfect or imperfect
if the good be ordinate the peace is true and if full then it is perfect but the peace is false if the good be inordinate and the peace cannot be perfect if the good be scant
will speake somewhat of the false and imperfect peace that thereby you may the better conceiue the true and perfect

wee must know that vnto flesh and bloud many things doe rellish as good which indeed are nothing so for the true character of good is a conformitie to gods will the warrant whereof is his word from which all sinfull lusts doe swarue and yet in them doe carnall mindes place their good and the enioying of them is the worlds peace
for what is carnall securitie but a plunging of a mans selfe into all kinde of wickednesse without remorse of conscience or feare of iudgement amos cap

doth describe such persons as stretcht themselues vpon iuorie beds dranke wine in bowles eate calues from the stall cheared vp their spirits with musicke this was their good a sensuall good yea and a senslesse too for they tooke not to heart the affliction of ioseph but approaching to the seate of iniquitie put farre from them the euill day this is a false peace grounded vpon an inordinate good
our sauiour christ maketh the like description of the old world matth

they were eating drinking marrying and giuing in marriage when the floud came and tooke away those vngodly ones
hee speaketh not of ordinary marriage

which is gods institution but alludes to the storie of the sonnes of god marrying with the daughters of men and as their marriage was irregular so was their eating and drinking too

for they were feasts congratulating their irregular wedlocke much like the feasting of the children of israel when they worshipped the golden calfe exodus
the wise man speaking of idolaters passeth this censure vpon them cap

liuing in the great warre of ignorance those so great plagues they called peace
but this is not gods it is the diuels peace qui undefined span alphabet dum vult cudere cudit undefined span alphabet he maketh men like bedlems who gashing themselues with kniues laugh in the beholders face risu sardonio they laugh and dye
by this security doth the diuell lull men asleepe in their sinnes that they may the better bee ouertaken with an vnexpected ruine for when they peace peace then as the apostle foretold thes
commeth sadden destruction in the middest of their pleasure they goe in a moment downe into hell

would wee had not too many spectacles of this peace that of the poet may be truly verified of vs

am patimur longae pacis mala saeuior armis luxuria incubuit

the peace which god hath granted vs from forraigne enemies what hath it wrought but this sinfull peace peace in sinne neuer did this land by prophanenesse by iniustice by riot more offend god and neuer was it more senslesse thereof and the church may well complaine in the words of the prophet esay
in pace meâ amaritudo amarissima this calme of ours is a very storme a storme of sinne that will bring a storme of woe
the prophet ieremie cap

hath an excellent resemblance of a vessell of wine which while it is settled vpon the lees hath a good taste and smell but stirre the lees you marre the wine it will then become muddy and vnsauourie
the wicked thinke they haue no lees nothing that can interrupt or alter their state but when god commeth to poure them from vessell to vessell they will finde the contrary they will finde that christs saying in the gospell is true matth

voluptuousnesse and couetousnesse are nothing but bryars and thornes and they will iustifie that saying of the preacher eccles

all is vanitie and vexation of spirit
gods heauie hand hath beene long off from vs but it vseth to come vpon irrepentant persons with redoubled strokes

seeing then non est pax improbo it is no peace which the wicked haue in their prosperitie and that which they haue they cannot long enioy will conclude with the admonition of moses deut
take heede lest there bee amongst you a roote that beareth gall and wormewood and it come to passe that when any man heareth the words of the curse denounced against the breakers of the law he blesse himselfe in his heart saying shall haue peace though walke in the imaginations of my heart the lord will not spare that man
you see then that an inordinate good bringeth no true peace

and it is as true that a perfect peace cannot spring from a scant good
by a scant good meane that good which belongs onely vnto a ciuill morall life
many keepe themselues within the bounds of naturall reason they exceede not in meates and drinkes neyther in thriuing nor aspiring are they scandalous or iniurious in their carriage towards men in so doing they doe well but they doe not well enough they haue a peace but it is onely humane and not diuine it might suffice were they onely men

but beeing called to bee christian men it should not content them religion must carry them farther than they can reach by reason
abraham isaac iacob were worthies of a higher pitch than socrates plato

could be
pecistinos domine irrequietum est cor nostrum donee quiescat in te the full rest of our soules cannot be attained by reason onely religion must bring vs to it
and yet when wee looke abroad in the world how many shall we find that thinke they haue done enough if they goe so farre as they are ledde by reason but care little for religion which is the life of a christian these forget the double communion which they must haue the one in things of this life the other in things of the life to come the first worketh peace on earth a ciuill peace but it is the later that worketh the heauenly peace which we should principally affect the good which will not reach so farre is a scant good therefore the peace that attends it must needs be imperfect peace

seeing then neyther the inordinate nor the scant good can worke that peace which our prophet speaketh of we must seeke out a good which is ordinate and full the enioying whereof is the peace here meant
now such a good both ordinate and full is onely god and the participation of him is the peace noted in my text
but this exposition is yet too short and too darke though neede speake no more of the good for that is the glory which before opened and the desire of all nations yet of the enioying thereof which is the peace must speake more

obserue then that as god is but one so did he make all at one and at one they were by communion with him that is but one
separate them from god and by and by they fall at odds they fall one from another yea and one vpon another vntill they are consumed
so that there is no coniunction lasting no comfortable vnion which is not consolldated and souldered with and in god
apply this in speciall to men gods image in vs is the ground of our vnion with him for where there is no similitude there can bee no vnion therefore the losse of gods image was the cause of our rent from him and as the prophet speaketh finne separateth betweene god and vs
and this separation interrupted the peace wherein wee were created by a foure fold warre
first it armes gods iustice against vs who prouoke him by sinne hee whets his sword he bends his bow prepares the instruments of death against such rebels he hath his full vials of wrath ready to bee poured out against the vngodly
vpon this followes a second warre a warre in our bosomes for seiudice nemo nocens absoluitur a mans conscience is a thousand witnesses against him yea and iudges also it vexeth him with accusation with condemnation yea and execution also caeco verbere pulsat it is a hell that goeth before hell a worme
besides this we haue another ciuill warre the law of our members rebels against the law of our mindes and carrieth vs captiues vnto sinne we are full of fleshly lusts that fight against our soule

yea that are such weapons of vnrighteousnesse as fight against god against our neighbours which is a fourth warre springing from this third
so st iames cap

teacheth from whence come warres and fightings amongst you come they not hence euen

of your lusts that warre in your members men that haue vnruly affections within them will suffer none to be at quiet that come neare them the couetous will dispoyle other men of their goods the malicious will bereaue them of their liues the ambitious will supplant them the crafty defraud them there is not an euill roote within vs from whence our neighbour shall not gather some cuill fruite

this warre sprang out of our first separation from god and our true and full peace must put an end vnto this warre
first it must take away the guilt of our sinne and propitiate god it must make an attonement for vs and free vs from the curse for if thou lord

marke what is done amisse lord who is able to abide it if hee enter into iudgement no flesh can be righteous in his sight

but the first degree of our peace is that which turneth our iudge into our father and maketh the eies wherewith hee beholdeth vs no lesse gracious than pure
the second degree of peace is that which killeth the worme and quieteth our conscience making it of an accuser to become an excuser of a condemner an absoluer and of a tormenter a comforter being no longer priuie to our selues of the guilt of sinne we feele not the horrours of hell in our soules
a blessing to bee highly esteemed because fearefull are the examples of those who hauing felt the sharpenesse of such horrours haue beene so disconsolate notwithstanding all worldly comfort that they haue beene driuen to seeke a release of their paine by butchering themselues
the third degree of peace is the purging of the corruption of our nature that the conflict betweene the worser and the better part may cease so that though sinne remaine yet it raigneth no longer in vs all our powers and parts are brought in subiection vnto christ and we yeeld vp our members as weapons of righteousnesse vnto holinesse

whereupon followeth the fourth degree of peace which abolisheth all dissention between men and men it maketh them all of one minde of one heart to loue together as brethren and as to haue a one of anothers state so likewise a louing disposition to aduance each the others good neither couetousnesse nor malice nor any other wicked affection shall disturbe the common good as much as lyeth in vs we will haue peace with all men
these bee the foure degrees of peace which must concurre to make vp shalom which is peace in the hebrew tongue but such peace as is intire and perfect and we vnderstand it too shallowly if we doe not comprehend these foure degrees in it

hauing found out what the peace is we must in the next place see where it shall rest the place is zorobabels temple
but that place must be considered not in its meanenesse as it was built by the iewes but as it was furnished with that glorie whereof heretofore you haue heard that house so adorned was to bee the place of peace
salomons temple was a place of peace but his peace was but a type it was a worldly peace zorobabels temple is also a place of peace but his peace is the truth that answered the former type the peace thereof is heauenly that temple which had but the type of the glorie had no more but the type of the peace and the truth of the peace rested there where the truth of the glorie was

so that there is an emphasis in the words this place the holy ghost giueth thereby the iewes to vnderstand that it was not the former but the later temple whereunto god intended the peace which he promised to dauid

and all the promises of peace in the prophets were to be referred thither this ierusalem was to answer vnto her name and to be indeed the vision of peace

but told you heretofore that zorobabels temple was to be vnderstood not only literally but mystically and so it signifieth not onely that materiall house but also the christian church peace is annext vnto this peace extra ecclesiam non est salus no saluation without the church and therefore no peace he shall neuer haue god for his father that hath not the church for his mother
in our creed wee place the holy catholicke church and communion of saints before the remission of sinnes and life euerlasting
as the soule doth not quicken other parts than those that are vnited to the body no more doth the spirit of god giue his blessing of peace to any that are distracted from the body of the church
this must be obserued against all schismaticks that doe excommunicate them selues and disorderly persons that are iustly excommunicated by the censure of the church all these while they continue in that state though they doe not lose ius ad pacem yet they doe lose ius in pace though they doe not lose their interest in yet they suspend the benefit of that peace and their state is vncomfortable though it be not irrecouerable
and they which follow negligently the assemblies of the church doe not a little defraud themselues of this peace for they must seeke it chiefly by prayer in gods house and there doth god dispence it by the mouth of his ministers
will giue you only two proofes the one our of the old testament when the sacrifices were ended which were typicall prayers

aaron is willed to dismisse the people with these words the lord blesse thee and keepe thee the lord make his face shine vpon thee and be gracious vnto thee the lord lift vp the light of his countenance vpon thee and giue thee peace
a second proofe wee haue in the new testament where the church doth solemnely vse those words of the apostle when after the liturgie it dismisseth the people the peace of god which passeth all vnder standing keep your hearts and mindes
and what better inuitation can wee haue to repaire often to the church than this blessing of peace which is there daily offered vnto vs and may bee receiued if we come and come prepared for it
say prepared before you heard that the peace commeth to the house but as it is furnished with the glorie where there is none of the glorie there can be none of the peace therefore wee must prepare these temples of our bodies and soules by entertainement of the glory that they may be made capable of the peace
the apostle speaketh plainely rom
wee must bee iustified by faith before we can haue peace with god

if iudgement dwell in the wildernesse and righteousnesse remaine in the fruitfull fielde the worke of righteousnesse shall bee peace

and the effect of righteousnesse quietnesse and assurance for euer
god doth annoint vs before he doth establish vs st austin hath a witty conceit vpon the words of the
psalme righteousnesse and peace haue kissed each

other duae sunt amicae iustitia pax righteousnesse and peace are two fast friends happely thou wouldest gladly enioy the one but thou wilt not bee perswaded to performe the other for there is no man that would not willingly haue peace but all are not willing to worke righteteousnesse yet be thou assured that if thou dost not loue peace's friend which is righteousnesse peace will neuer loue thee for righteousnesse and peace doe kisse each the other

you know what iehu answered the king of israel when he asked him is it peace iehu what peace can there bee so long as the whoredomes and witchcrafts of thy mother are so many so may we reply to euery soule vnquiet soule that enquireth after peace looke for none where there is sinne well may there bee the enemie assaulting and daily sounding alarums but this securing peace which is gods garrison cannot bee there
so long as the iewes serued god their enemies could not inuade their borders

but then the temple was exposed to the enemie when the prophets could not reclaime them from sin
it is a good conscience that is a continuall feast

you haue heard seuerally of the peace and the place you must now heare ioyntly of their knitting together who knits them and how

he that knitteth them is god in christ god is the god of peace so the apostle calleth him phil

and the prophet tels vs that he creates light as well as darkenesse and elihu is so bold as to say

that if god giue peace none can hinder it
but as god giueth it so hee giueth it in christ for it is his worke to make peace the prophet esay cap

vers
calleth him the prince of peace his true members are sonnes of peace his apostles messengers of peace and his doctrine is the gospell of peace all the foure specified degrees of peace were wrought by him
first he tooke away the guilt of our sinne
esay
the chastisement of our peace was layd vpon him for he that knew no sinne was made sinne for vs that wee might be made the righteousnesse of god in him cor
secondly hee hath kild the worme for being iustified by faith in him our heart condemnes vs not and we haue confidence towards god so that we can come with boldnesse vnto the throne of grace
thirdly the law of the spirit of life that is in iesus christ doth free vs from the law of sinne and death rom
it mortifieth it subdueth the old man and maketh vs walke not according to the flesh but according to the spirit
finally he putteth an end to that discord that is betweene man and man
the prophets foretold that when hee came the nations should beat their swords into

and their speares into pruning hookes nation shall not lift vp sword against nation neyther shall they learne warre any more

the same prophet by an allegorie doth elsewhere teach that where christ commeth and is entertained he doth ciuilize the most barbarous nations the wolfe shall dwell with the lambe the leopard lye downe with the kid the sucking childe shall play on the hole of the aspe and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice denne they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountaine for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters couer the sea
worthily therfore doth the apostle call christ our peace whose kingdome is righteousnes

peace and ioy in the holy ghost

moreouer obserue that to whom we owe our glorie to him wee owe our peace the blessings of god doe much affect vs as being good but except we haue securitie in the possession of them wee lose most of our content for it is a great accession to miserie once to haue been happy and plus refert vndè quàm quò cadas he that taketh a from an high place is more sensible of that which he hath lost than of that which he suffers
therefore the addition of peace vnto glory doth import no small comfort which esay also foretold cap

vpon all the glory shall be a defence
the apostle speaketh significantly phil

the peace of god undefined span alphabet shall bee as a court of guard to keep our hearts and mindes in the state of grace whereunto we are brought by christ
they that are rich and are to conuey their goods by sea or land haunted with theeues pyrants doe thinke themselues to be so much more or lesse bound to those that will secure their passage as their goods are more or lesse precious
goods of greater price than is the glorie of the house before specified there cannot be how great then is our debt vnto christ who safe conducts vs with our glorie through the wildernesse of this world maugre the might and malice of the serpent and the lion of all our deadly foes

you haue heard who settleth the peace in the place you must now heare how
hee giueth it
and it is truly tearmed a gift for whereas there are two kindes of peace one made betweene parties whereof each is able to make good his quarrell against the other yet they are contented to auoyde trouble to agree vpon reasonable conditions the other kinde of peace is that which a conqueror out of his goodnesse vouchsafeth to persons subdued which are at his mercie and whom by the law of armes he might make slaues
our peace is of this later sort we all deserued to bee captiues to the diuell for wee were all become children of wrath by adams sinne ephes

when we lay thus weltring in our bloud no other eye pitying vs then god said vnto man thou shalt liue ezech

hee gaue him this peace therefore is peace a free gift
neyther a free gift onely but a stable also they are not induciae but pax not a cessation from armes for a time that admitteth a returne to warre againe but a reconciliation for euer a couenant of salt gods mercie shall not depart and this couenant shall not be remoued esay

you haue heard what the peace is the place where it resteth by whom and how they are ioyned together what remaineth but that euery man enquire whether he haue this peace or not in this enquirie we must proceede ascendendo not descendendo the lower must assure vs of the vpper degree
the abolishing of the guilt of our sinne is the darkest branch of our peace which wee know onely by faith but for the triall of this point of faith we must haue recourse to our conscience and inquire what peace we find there
for the peace of our conscience is the looking glasse of that peace which we haue with god if we finde none there we haue none with god and we may be sure we haue it with god if we finde it truly there
truely say for a man may be deceiued in the triall of his conscience many haue quiet consciences but it is because they are seared

wherefore we must looke one steppe lower and iudge of the second degree of our peace by that which we finde in the third we must see it in our mortification and subiection of the flesh to the spirit for iustification which doth quiet the conscience is inseparable from sanctification which doth reforme our nature
finally to remoue all doubt concerning sanctification we must looke to the effects thereof for a good tree bringeth forth good fruit and our conuersation will testifie our sanctification if our deeds be seasoned with charitie the spirit of god doth rest in our soules
this inquirie is most behoofe full in these daies wherein more talke of peace than doe partake thereof partake say of that true and full peace which here is meant by haggai

yet lest men stumble by ouer great curiosity and themselues for the diuell is apt to make men as well despaire that they haue not peace when they haue it as to presume that they haue it when they haue it not wee must distinguish inter pacem viatoris and comprehensoris the peace of the church militant and that of the church triumphant
touching the church militant it hath outward crosses and inward conflicts
we doe not alwaies apprehend the light of gods countenance it is often ouercast and hee is despleased with vs but it is as a father with his childe of whom the poet

sit licet in natos facies austera parentum aequa tamen semper mens est amica voluntas

therefore the cloud will dissolue and the light will cheere vs againe
the worme is not so dead but if we sinne it will giue vs a remembrance a happy remembrance for it awakeneth vs to repent and beleeue which so soone as we doe the smart is at an end
the law of our members will often times rebell against the law of our mindes and carrying vs captiue vnto sin will make vs cry out with st paul rom
wretch that am who shall deliuer mee front this body of death but the conclusion is comfortable thanks be to god through iesus christ our lord
finally very often when we speak vnto men of peace they will prepare themselues to war for except we will riot communicate with them in their sin they will hate vs so that we must redeeme our inward peace with an outward war
in this case let it be our comfort that much happier is the war that keeps vs close to god than that peace which will separate vs from him

though walke in the middest of the valley of the shadow of death yet will feare no euill if thou lord art with me thy rod and thy staffe shall comfort me
in all assaults of our peace wee shall at last bee conquerors
and this is enough ad pacem viatoris to the peace of the church militant that wee shall neuer so be deiected but we shall haue strength enough to rouse our selues with king dauid and say as psalme
why art thou cast downe my soule and why art thou disquieted within mee hope in god for shall yet prayse him who is the health of my countenance and my god and be as resolute as st paul rom
who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it is god that iustifieth who shall condemne it is christ that is dead with the temptation god will make a way for vs to escape that wee may be able to beare it cor
wee may expect no more than this in the

church militant because as christ came to preach peace so hee came also to send a sword and if the worke of the house prosper in the hand of zorobabel and iosua tobia and sanballet will impugne it no sooner doth christ rest gloriously in his church but there wil be many that will professe enmity against it

but the time commeth when all enmitie shall cease all enemies shall be put downe wee shall be fitted for and admitted vnto the sight of god when our glorie shall be consummated and withall our peace bee made perfect so perfect as that it shall be euerlasting

what shall we say then to these things

when the romanes by conquest might haue giuen law to the grecians at corinth in the solemne time of the istmian games their generall by an herauld vnexpectedly proclaimed freedome to all the cities of greece the proclamation did at first so amaze the grecians that they did not beleeue it to bee true but when it was proclaimed the second time they gaue such a shout that the very birds flying in the ayre were astonished therewith and fell dead to the ground

or if you will haue a better storie take that of the iewes who when at first they heard of cyrus proclamation and that the lord thereby had turned the captiuitie of sion they confesse that at first hearing they were like men that dreamt but afterward their mouth was filled with laughter and their tongue with singing
now the peace that the grecians and the iewes had was but a temporall a corporall peace how much more reason is there that our affections should bee strained to the highest pitch of ioy and thankes when wee heare the proclamation of our peace which is so true so perfect peace the peace not of our bodies but of our soules a peace not of our earthly but of our heauenly state a peace that shall so be begun here that it shall endure for euer
wherefore let vs acquaint our selues with god

that he may giue vs peace christs peace

which maketh god at peace with vs reconciles vs to our selues and maketh vs at concord with all the world so may we lay our selues downe in peace and take our rest and god which onely can will make vs dwell in safety psalme

now the lord of peace himselfe giue you peace alwaies

by all meanes
amen

the sixt sermon
epigraph thus saith the lord of hostes

the&se words thus saith or saith the lord of hosts haue often come in my way since first beganne the vnfolding of this text and still past by them you may thinke did forget or neglect them but it is not so they are of greater moment than that should doe the one or the other reserued them to the last because then thought might handle them best
for they are the warrant of gods vndoubted truth and a warrant is then seasonably opened when that whereunto it is annext hath beene fully declared
you haue heard of the blessed presence of christ in zorobabels temple of the preparation thereunto of the description thereof the description of the person that should come of the good that he should doe his bountie in giuing set forth first absolutely then comparatiuely the security of his gift consisting in a peace
these be many they be great blessings lest we should feare that they are too good to bee true our eye must bee vpon the warrant that will ascertaine vs that nothing is promised which shall not be performed
in opening of this warrant shall informe you of two things what it is and why it is reiterated so often
it is the signature of a most powerfull person there is a double power internall externall this person is mighty in regard of both in regard of the internall for he is the lord in regard of the externall for he is the lord of hostes
as for his signature it is such as beseemes so great a person plaine and peremptorie thus he saith
and these words taken ioyntly are the full warrant of the preachers message and the peoples faith he saith enough to assure and command if he say only thus saith the lord of hosts and they must neither nor disobey if hee say no more
the reason why the words are reiterated so often is the weightinesse of the matter expressed in the reiteration
the holy ghost hereby would worke in vs a regard answerable to the matter which hee hath declared to vs and cause vs to ponder it as it deserues
let vs then in the feare of god listen to the vnfolding of those particulars which haue pointed at whereof the first is the power of the person

the first branch of his power is his internall power it is noted by the name lord
in the originall it is iehouah and iehouah is that name which signifieth the first moment of gods nature for it noteth his being and being goeth before liuing as likewise doe the attributes of being goe before

the attributes of liuing the later doe necessarily suppose the former
mistake mee not meane not that gods nature is compounded but wee cannot conceiue the onenesse of all his perfections therefore wee helpe our selues in our contemplations by distinguishing them as they are in the creatures which are a shadow of the creator a shadow like a body which receiues distinct beames from the sunne all which in the sunne are but one for so those perfections are but one in god which grow manifold as they come from him to vs

but to our purpose
when moses was desirous to know gods name the first that he exprest vnto him was this am or am that am the meaning is all one with the title of iehouah which is here rendred lord and giueth vs to vnderstand that all other things in comparison vnto god indeed are not though they seeme to be for they haue not the two characters which are stampt vpon true being the one is undefined span alphabet the other is undefined span alphabet is a being from it selfe and so is being it selfe undefined span alphabet is a being all that which hath being and so stands in neede of nothing besides it selfe
all creatures as they are from god so are they no longer nor no otherwise than it pleaseth him and it pleaseth not him that any one creature should haue all the parts much lesse the degrees of all his perfections
the king of heauen deales as kings on earth kings on the earth reserue in themselues the fulnesse of regall powe whereof they doe impart but some branches and those limited to their subordinate officers after the same manner doth the lord dispence of his infinite power to angels to men to other creatures
therefore the name iehouah is by the wise man truly called gods incommunicable name it noteth that internall power in god which is found in no other and which giueth whatsoeuer power any other haue
for from this inward proceeds an outward and hee that is lord is also lord of hostes
it is not gods pleasure that we should pry too farre into his inward power and if we would we cannot he directeth vs therefore to his outward which is more fitting to our capacitie and may sufficiently resolue vs that he is very powerfull though he were no more powerfull than as hee appeares in his creatures in regard of whom he is termed the lord of hostes
let vs leaue then his inward and come to his outward power

in the second of genesis

where the creation is recapitulated we finde mention but of one host of god the text is plaine god made heauen and earth and all the host thereof and yet it is vsuall in the scripture to call god the lord of hostes as if there were many
surely it is cleare that god made but one but apostasie of that one hath made many
first apostasie in heauen hath made two hostes of spirits

michael and his angels the dragon and his then an apostasie in paradise beganne the distinction of the seede of the woman

and the seede of the serpent and of mankinde part is fallen to the dragon and part is preserued and cleaueth to michael the truth whereof appeared presently in abel and cain and although cain by murder of abel killed and destroyed one of the hostes yet god renewed it againe in seth and the armies went on again

in the children of god and the children of men

a man would haue thought the stoud had swept away all the seed of the serpent but it reuiued againe in cursed cham and the citie of god and the citie of babel will bee and be opposite vntill the end of the world
but touching these apostasies the first of angels the second of men we must hold this true rule summonere se potuêrunt saeliettuti non potuêrunt se porestati diuinae they might defraud themselues of their blessed communion with god but free themselues from his power they could not god hath set his hooke in their nostrils and his bit in their mouthes so that they cannot stirre without nor beyond his
it is plaine in the story of iob cap

and of ahab reg

but there is an effectiue and a permissiue power of god god is lord of both hostes but he worketh in them differently his worke in michaels host and the seede of the woman is properly effectiue
for though sometimes to make them sensible of their frailtie and to make them cleaue faster vnto him he leaueth them for a time vnto themselues yet ordinarily the influence of his grace doth direct and support them vnto and in good workes and they sight his battels
but as for the dragons host and host of the serpents broode gods power in them is properly permissiue he leaueth them to their owne corrupt iudgements and affections to follow and to execute them but he doth not communicate in their corruptions eyther as author or abettor of the roote or fruite thereof
yet this soueraignty
god hath ouer the most wicked that they cannot breake out according to their owne disposition but where and when god will and when they breake out by his leaue they stop when he checketh and giue ouer when he saith it is enough
so that gods permissiue power is alwaies accompanied with his effectiue which doth stint the wicked in their workes maugre their gracelessenesse and without their priuitie directs their endeauours to his ends so that euen then they fulfill his will when transgressing his commandements they seeme to be most contrary to his will
and this is no small comfort to michaels host and the host of the womans seede that the host of the dragon and the broode of the serpent must not be feared according to their own malice but according to gods leaue
and this is the reason why christ taught vs to pray daily lead vs not into temptation but deliuer vs from euill and this we doe or should meane when wee speake these or the like words our enemies cannot assaile vs except thou lord permit them and if thou lord assist vs they shall assault in vaine

seeing all the world is compared vnto hostes howsoeuer wee apprehend confusion in the world yet may wee not thinke but that all things are well disposed because these hostes are the lords he is the common generall and he directs the conflicts neyther are any put to try masteries but by his speciall appointment and for the accomplishment of his ends
but it befalleth vs as it doth them which stand in the same leuell wherein two huge armies are pitched they conceiue them to be a disordered multitude whom notwithstanding if they behold from a high hill they will discerne that they are artificially ranged they will see how

euery one serueth vnder his owne colours euen so wee which behold the state of the world with the eyes of flesh and bloud dimme by reason of the weakenesse of our iudgement and wickednesse of our affections thinke all things are out of tune bonis malè malis benè that the worse men are the better they fare and they fare the worse the better they are
but we must ascend into the sanctuarie of god and iudge of occurrents by heauenly principles if we do so then we will confesse that no armie on earth can bee better marshalled than is the great armie of all creatures of heauen and earth yea and hell also and notwithstanding all apparencies to the contrarie queniam bonus mundum rector temperat rectè fieri ne dubites doubt not but that all is well and shall end well because god is lord of hostes

againe seeing god is lord of hostes wee must make no worse conclusion than the centurion did in the gospell when christ promised to come to his house and cure his feruant hee desired christ not to take so much paines marke what reason he giueth my selfe am a man set vnder authoritie and haue souldiers vnder me and say vnto one come and he commeth and to another goe and hee goeth and if a petty captaine that haue but a handfull of men vnder mee can so easily command them what mayst thou doe that art generall of heauen and earth thou mayst doe whatsoeuer thou wilt for all things are thy host wherefore only speake the word and my seruant shall be whole

where by the way and yet fitly to our purpose we may obserue that he reputeth sicknesse one of christs souldiers before made the armies consist only of persons must now enlarge it also vnto things for indeed no lesse things than persons are christs souldiers the sunne shineth and scorcheth the earth whereupon followeth a drought accompanied with those noisome creatures which are engendred in a drought these are souldiers of christ and ioel setteth them forth like an armie the raine fals and glutteth the earth from whence spring weedes the offspring of raine and vndigested moystures whereupon followeth the diseases of fruit and corne
these are souldiers of christ
the pestilence wasteth the citie the sword cateth vp the people these are souldiers they come to execute christs wrath as truly as the good angels do pitch their tents about vs for to guard vs or any other good meanes is bestowed vpon vs to doe vs good
wherefore wee must not consider the creatures only as they are in their owne nature but according to that employment also which they haue vnder god for they are all souldiers of the lord of hostes

there is one thing more which may not forget the whole world is called gods host but the church is it in a speciall sort
salomon calleth it en armie with banners cant
moses speaking of the church vnder the old testament calleth it the entring into the leuiticall ministrie in militiam
st paul of the new testament bids timothie doe what himselfe had done fight a good fight tim

and cap

the whole body is called a church militant
when we assemble together then dauid will tell vs psalme
thy people lord will come willingly at the

time mastering thine armie in holy beauty the lords day is his muster day all that are enrolled should then appeare before him

partly to furh hemselues out of his armorie and partly to be directed how to carly themselues in their seuerall stations for euery man must walke as hee is called cor
which they should obserue that little frequent the church and take as little notice why these church meetings were instituted no wonder if they be vnarmed no wonder if they offend were we carefull to appeare at the musters we would be more resolute when we are gone thence because we should be compleately armed and more vigilent against the enemie because we should be better instructed

as the church is an armie so it is but one armie though diuided into seuerall bands though there be particular congregations yet there is but one holy catholicke church and seeing the host is but one there should be no mutinie against the generall that disloyall speech nolumus hunc regnare super nos wee will not haue this man raigne ouer vs

receiued in the gospel a iust reward of treacherie
as we must not mutinie against the generall so must not the souldiers side betweene themselues we should not sheathe our swords one in another corporally much lesse spiritually there should be no ciuill there should be no ecclesiasticall rents between the parts of christendome for so michaels host doth degenerate into the host of the dragon that of the womans feede into the opposite which is the host of the serpents brood
to weaken them god is pleased that his enemies should be as the madianites by his prouidence one of them doth ruine the other but hee would haue his children alwaies one man and be alwaies of one minde not to hazzard their owne liues nor the liues of others but in his quarrell and against his enemies
this religious this honourable disposition of a christian that is a souldier in gods host is much to bee wisht though little to be hoped for in these vncharitable and bloudy daies

haue spoken enough of the power of the person come now vnto his signature which told you is plaine and peremptorie
it is plaine for here are no logicall demonstrations nor rhetoricall declamations but a plaine expression of gods minde
this is the best eloquence of kings or generals they are not bound to yeelde a reason of their commands or to vse insinuations into their peoples affections it is enough for them to expresse their pleasure in those things that are of their absolute command and if they do more they do it out of their goodnesse shew that they do as much desire to leade their subiects by reason as to require their obedience much more may the lord of heauen and earth do thus whose wisedome is vndeceiueable and his power most absolute though he be pleased sometimes to giue vs a reason of his command yet may we not expect it farther than he is pleased to vouchsafe it

the signature is plaine but it is peremptorie for hee that speaketh so plainely speaketh as one that hath authoritie we may not dispute much lesse resist such commands because they are the commands of the lord of hostes
this is to be noted both by pastor and people for thus saith the lord of hostes is the pastors warrant for his message he must bring nothing

to the people without this signature speake of things necessary to saluation
for otherwise as in the so in the church there be many indifferent things which are left vnto the disposition of those that are in authoritie who are referred only vnto the generall rules cor
let all things be done to edification let them bee done decently and in order cor
but in matters necessary to saluation it is with the church as it is with the wee must distinguish betweene the and the executioners thereof
they that are the executioners of lawes may not take vpon them to make new lawes
iudges and iustices in their assizes and sessions informe the people what is the law already established and by vertue of their commissions they doome euery mans cause according to such law euen so god the king of kings hath decreed the lawes of christian faith and life and these lawes hath hee committed to the pastors of the church hee hath committed vnto them the promulgation application of his lawes and more he hath not committed
the church of rome agreeth with vs in the generall rule that thus saith the lord of hostes must be the warrant of the pastors proceeding the councell of trent layeth it for a ground in the entrance to their decrees
but when we come to enquire where the lord saith so here we differ we differ about the register of gods word wee acknowledge none but verbum scriptum the written word they adde vnto it verbum non scriptum vnwritten traditions but when we presse them with where is that to be found here they iarre between themselues
to omit smaller differences this is a maine one that they cannot tell in whom the infallibilitie of relating these traditions is placed as likewise of interpreting the written word
the councell of constance and basil placed it in the generall councell to whom they gaue power euen ouer the pope to him and giue lawes vnto him and to this doth the french church sticke though otherwise it hold the romish faith
but the italian faction and specially iesuites place it in the pope and giue him authority ouer the councell to controule it to giue lawes vnto it and without it to make lawes that shall binde the whole catholicke church and besides the pope they hold that there is infallibilitie in none no not in a generall councell
some place it ioyntly in both in a generall councell that hath its approbation from the pope wherein he presides by himselfe or his delegates and whose canons he confirmes
but while the aduocates of the pope strongly ouerthrow the reasons brought for the councels infallibilitie and the aduocates of the councels ouerthrow the reasons brought for the infallibility of the pope we may fairely collect from both that the infallibilitie is in neyther and if in neyther then not in both
for as a cipher added to a cipher maketh but a cipher it maketh no significant figure so if the pope may erre as the one side holdes and the councell as the other side holds the fallibilitie of eyther added to the fallibilitie of the other cannot amount to the summe of an infallibilitie
but we hold that which they confesse that the word written in the canonicall bookes is vndoubtedly signed with thus saith the lord of hostes as for the apocryphall scriptures not

onely the fathers but their owne men haue branded them for bastards before euer wee challenged them therefore doe not wee recommend them to the people further than they agree with the bookes canonicall
neither doe we burden the peoples consciences with their vnwritten word whereupon themselues are not yet resolued eyther where or what it is
wherefore thus saith the lord must limit the pastors message and the peoples faith must not desire any thing beyond it for it is a sure foundation the best of men speake but in veritate mentis without simulation or dissimulation without equiuocation or mentall reseruation but god speaketh in certitudine veritatis no myst of errour can ouercast his wisdome or his holinesse his word is tried to the vttermost

as siluer tried seuen times in the fire there is stablenesse in his promise immutablenesse in his counsaile
what should change him within him nothing can for he is the lord neyther can he be changed by any thing that is without him for he is the lord of hosts therefore he speaketh thus in the prophet

ego deus non mutor immutability is reciprocall with gods nature

with god there is no variablenesse or shadow of change god is not as man that hee should lye neither as the sonne of man that he should repent hath he said it

and shall he not doe it yea he spake the word and it was done hee commanded and it stood fast the lord breaketh the counsell of the heathen and bringeth to naught the deuices of the people

but the counsell of the lord shall stand for euer and the thoughts of his heart throughout all ages
what neede we then feare iulians scoffe who derided the christians for that they had nothing to say for their faith but thus saith the lord

nazianzene replieth well vnto him you that allow ipse dixit in the schollars of pythagoras and though suidas thinke that god was meant by ipse yet cicero saith ipse erat pythagoras may not except against undefined span alphabet beleeue in the followers of christ
it is more lawfull to captiuate our iudgement vnto the authority of god than of man and if they might doe it in the principles of philosophy which are examinable by reason much more may we doe it in the articles of faith vnto the secrets whereof no approach can bee made by the wit of man
wherefore thus saith the lord may well passe for an indemonstrable principle of our faith and an irrefragable rule of life if there were no more in the signature but thus saith the lord this were enough to secure the faith of a christian man

but thus saith the lord of hosts is enough to stoppe the mouth of an atheist let iulian himselfe teach them hee derided thus saith the lord but hee had a wofull experience of the lord of hosts for being mortally wounded by christs hand as himselfe confessed he breathed forth his impure soule with those words vicisti galilaec galilaean thou hast ouermastered mee
secondly if thus saith the lord of hosts bee the signature we are hence to learne that the function of the ministry is not onely for promulgation to instruct you in gods will and in so doing to open vnto you the riches of our knowledge but it is for application also we thereby binde or loose the soules of men and remit or retaine their sinnes which the world little thinketh vpon
for whereas there are two things considerable in a minister his sufficiency and his authority the people listen

much to his sufficiency but take little heed to his authority and therefore come they to church rather to iudge than to be iudged forgetting that many may bee as skilfull but none can be as powerfull in this kinde as is a minister
a iudge or iustice of peace may haue lesse law in him than a priuate man but he hath much more power and they that appeare before him regard his acts according to his power so should it be in the church
but men feare the magistrates that are vnder earthly kings because the paines which they inflict are corporeall our hands our feete feele their manicles and their fetters
and did our soules as truly feele as indeede they should the pastors binding and loosing of them wee would make more account of these officers of god than we doe
and it were good we did so for they so binde as that they can loose againe but if we neglect them when our lord and master commeth he will command all contemners so to be bound hand and foote that they shall neuer be loosed againe
wherefore let the power of the keyes work more vpon your soules and consciences than vsually it doth speake in regard of your religious submission to them
if any be otherwise minded will they nil they they shall one day finde that they haue no exemption from them thus saith the lord is our warrant regard not our persons regard that lord whose embassadors wee are receiue the words wee speake so long as we speake his words not as the words of men but as the word of god

finally couple thus saith with the lord of hosts the lord of hosts noteth gods power thus he saith noteth his will our soules shall finde little rest on gods power if it be not sure of his will for god can doe many things which he will not doe though he cannot will any thing which he cannot doe

god could raise vp children vnto abraham of stones but hee would not but the many miracles which he hath wrought shew that hee can doe what he will
the coupling then of these words thus saith the lord of hosts imports gods willing power and powerfull will which amount vnto an authority fit to build our faith vpon and to giue law vnto our conuersation

haue sufficiently shewed you what the warrant is wee must now in few words see why it is repeated so often
for dare say you shall not finde any passage in the scripture where thus saith the lord is so often read in so few lines the reason is the weightinesse of the matter whereunto it is annext

mortall princes vse not to signe bils the contents whereof are triuiall matters many things are done by vertue of their authority whereunto their signature is not vsed euen so ordinary matters passe in the word of god without nay speciall vrging of his authority when that is prefixt the point is of great regard and if it be often ingeminated it giueth vs to vnderstand that we must take speciall notice of euery clause of it
what must wee gather here then but the weightinesse of euery branch of this text and indeede if you haue not forgotten what hath been obserued on euery part thereof you will easily confesse that there is not one of them which is not so weighty as to deserue thus saith the

lord of hosts
was not the shaking of heauen and earth the shaking of all nations a weighty point and therefore deserued it not to be signed with thus saith the lord of hosts if the shaking did deserue this signature much more did the comming of the desire of all nations especially seeing he came to fill the temple with glory and as it deserued so it was signed with thus saith the lord of hosts
if the giuing of glory were a matter of great moment what shall wee say of the degree of glory surely it required a great ability so great as we would hardly haue beleeued had we not bin heartened by thus saith the lord of hosts and it must proceed from so great bounty as may be testified by the same thus saith the lord of hosts
finally the peace wherein we possesse whatsoeuer good is contained in christs presence doth so passe mans vnderstanding that to establish his heart in the beliefe thereof he needes this signature thus saith the lord of hosts

at length to conclude
you haue heard in the former sermons what in this whom you must beleeue you must not separate whom from what that which we must beleeue doth no doubt most pleasantly affect vs because it is our good but he whom we must beleeue doth most firmely secure vs because he is the author of that good
as then when wee gather fruit from a tree we doe not fixe our eyes onely vpon the boughes from whence we immediately gather it but also thinke vpon the roote which feeds those boughes and maketh them to bee fruitfull so in our religious meditations we must couple the author with the matter of blessings that god may be glorified as well as our soules are benefited
if we say with saint paul know whom haue beleeued then we shall be secure that he will safekeepe whatsoeuer any of vs committeth vnto him hee will keepe our soules keep our bodies and all that which himselfe hath bestowed vpon them grace and peace
christ will keepe them vntill his day his second day the day wherein the great and the little world shall receiue their last shaking
then shall the desire of all nations which at first came in humility returne againe in glory hee shall returne to fill his house his church with glory conformable to his owne glory
then hee will open vnto vs all his treasures of siluer and gold and therewith adorne his spouse which being triumphant shall infinitely exceed her selfe as she was militant
then shall our peace come to the full and none shall be able to take our blessednesse from vs because none shall be able to separate betweene vs and christ
they shall not if we build our faith vpon gods reuealed will vpon his almighty power vpon my text thus saith the lord of hosts
now let vs that are a handfull of his host while we are militant so giue glory vnto the lord of hosts that we may hereafter bee triumphant and hauing palmes in our hands and crownes on our heads with harpes and tongues wee may sound and sing ioyntly and cheerfully halleluiah praise ye the lord and with the whole host of the kingdome of heauen saying holy holy holy lord god of hosts heauen and earth are full of thy glory
amen

a sermon preached vpon the annvntiation day
epigraph

lvke
haile thou that art highly fauoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women

this is a part of the gospell appointed for this day and this day goeth commonly for the annuntiation day whether the day haue his right place in the calender leaue to be disputed by chronologers what is meant by the annuntiation is an argument fitter for diuines certainly for the pulpit the third part of this chapter treats thereof and it is conceiued in forme of a dialogue
in the dialogue there are two speakers the angell gabriel the virgin mary and each of them maketh two speeches the angell to the virgin and the virgin to the angell
the angell in his first congratulates the virgin whom hee informeth from god that she shall bee the mother of iesus christ
good newes but strange strange that a virgin should be a mother this virgin the mother of that childe
the virgin thought so nay she said so whereupon the angell addeth his second speech importing that though the thing be wonderfull yet the meanes are powerfull these must be thought vpon as well as that and she must resolue that nothing shall hinder it because it is the holy spirit that will doe it
so spake the angell
the virgin replies vnto him to his first speech shewing her willingnesse to vnderstand the message which hee brought that is gathered out of her question to his second shewing her readinesse to obey so soone as shee vnderstood it that appeares in her submission ecce

these foure speeches containe the whole doctrine of the annuntiation of which haud pitched onely vpon the first branch
it is enough for this time enough if onely vnfold the true meaning of the words

but if should moreouer encounter the false glosses made thereon then certainly you would say it were more than enough for there are no words in the scripture so few in number alwayes except the sacramentall words hoe est corpus meum whereupon idolatrous superstition hath so much fastened as it hath vpon these
but the full ripping vp thereof is a worke for the schooles here had rather edifie with truth than refute falsehood wherefore well may touch at the latter but will principally bend my selfe vnto the former not doubting but a dagon compounded of so many impieties will of it selfe fall downe and fall asunder at the presence of the arke and they which shal be but reasonably informed of the truth will neuer be perplexed with the opposite grosse errours
let vs come then to the words

they are gratulatory in them the angell sheweth how and why hee would haue the virgin affected hee would haue her affected comfortably hee signifieth so much in his first word haile or be of good cheare there is good cause why consider thy estate consider it in it selfe consider it in comparison both wayes considered it sheweth there is good cause why
thy state in it selfe is good first because thou standest in so good termes with god highly fauoured secondly because thou hast so good a pledge of that fauour the lord is with thee if thy state be such it is surely good good in it selfe
but good things the more peculiar they are the more are they precious and thy state is a prerogatiue it is good also in comparison for blessed art thou among women
this is the summe of the angels congratulation wherein you easily perceiue that must speake of two principall points the affection required in the virgin and the motiues working that affection they are two the nature and the measure of her state
that these motiues may worke in vs no lesse than they did on her that blessed affection which wish co~mon to vs god grant vs all her ears her heart in hearing though not the angell gabriel himselfe yet him whom god hath appointed to be vnto you as the angell gabriels voice
as my text then so doe begin at haile the affection which is required to be in the virgin

haile is a saxon salutation it was wont to be more full as the antiquaries obserue and to be pronounced corruptly wassaile a salutation answerable to the greeke undefined span alphabet or the latine salue that is health be vnto you the syriac paraphrase translates shelom leki that is peace be vnto you which was the iewes common salutation both translations may stand with the angels meaning because howsoeuer we varie phrases in saluting yet is our meaning still the same we wish all good to them whom we salute
but yet neither of the translations doth expresse the proper signification of the euangelists word for his word is undefined span alphabet that is be of good cheare the english cheare is plainly the greeke undefined span alphabet
wherefore we must note that of salutations some doe expresse the blessing that is conferred vpon vs and some the sense and feeling thereof that must be in vs he that saith haile wisheth health or good estate of our persons he that saith peace be vnto you wisheth a happy successe in all our affaires

but he that saith undefined span alphabet be of good cheere doth wish vnto vs the comfort of them both of our persons and of our affaires
this note the rather because my text doth plainly distinguish betweene the blessing bestowed on the virgin and the feeling that she was to haue thereof and it is her feeling that he calleth for in this first word
the feeling is ioy an affection sutable to the blessing for the blessing is a gospell so the fathers obserue that what goeth before these words is undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet begins here here begins the gospell
and where the gospell beginneth there must ioy begin also wee learne it of st paul who relates it out of the prophet rom
yea the word it selfe doth speake it the greeke word doth the english word doth the old word gospell which is nothing else but a good spel darke english because old but we make it plaine by an equiualent phrase and significant to our purpose when we translate it glad tidings

ioy then must attend the gospell
and if you reade the prophets hardly shall you finde where they mention the one

and do not call vpon vs for the other reioyce heauens and be glad earth let the sea roare and all the trees of the field reioyce for he commeth for he commeth saith the psalmist speaking of this first comming of christ and esay

thou hast made them reioyce as in the day of haruest and as they that diuide the spoiles for vnto vs a childe is borne vnto vs a sonne is giuen

but what need more places seeing our sauiour christ in the fourth of luke giues a plaine intimation that his first comming was the true yeare of iubile and that you know began with iubilation
this iubilation or ioy is common to all the church so wee learne of the angell speaking to the shepheards behold bring you glad tidings of great ioy that shall bee to all the people for vnto you is borne a sauiour
if required in all then specially in the virgin according to her interest in ought her ioy to be for this gospell her interest was the greatest as will appeare in her state therefore is this ioy so expresly commended vnto her

there is another reason also why it is commended and that is that the truth may be answerable to the type abraham saith christ saw my day and reioyced iohn
and when did abraham see it and reioyce if we looke into genesis we shall finde when euen then when hee receiued the promise that he should haue his sonne isaac then he laughed as the text obserues and for a memoriall that he did laugh god commanded him to giue vnto his sonne this name isaac which signifieth laughter
st paul heb
that pierced deeper into the secrets of the scripture than euery reader is able to doe doth obserue that abraham did undefined span alphabet

see this obiect a farre off and as being a farre off did with reuerent ioy giue entertainment thereunto he meaneth that he did not only apprehend isaac the patriarch who was to be born within some few moneths and so was at hand but our sauiour christ also figured by isaac
who was not to come but after many generations and so was a farre off
and if being a farre off his sight caused ioy being come so neare how much more ioy must the sight of him cause if the type wrought so

how must the truth it selfe worke and if the father of the type were so affected ought not the mother of the truth to be affected much more certainly she must needs haue ioy

but what is ioy ioy is a pleasing euidence of the loue which we beare to any thing which we acknowledge to be good so that ioy though it be but one thing yet it presupposeth two other things knowledge and loue as the rootes from whence it springs
the first roote is knowledge for where there is no knowledge there can be no ioy marke the great and the little world though each bee undefined span alphabet a goodly frame inriched with many markable indowments yet is not the great world priuie to the indowments it hath no not the eye thereof meane the summe of whom the poet long since spake truely

per quem videt omnia mundus et videt ipse nihil

so that the passage in the
psalme the heauens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handy worke is to bee vnderstood passiuely not actiuely or to speak it more plainly they do it as a scripture but not as a lecture they are a silent representation
but the little world is not only passiue but actiue hee can contemplate whatsoeuer perfection is in himselfe or others it is the very nature of his vnderstanding to become all things and to beare about it selfe which it can studie at all times in it selfe a mappe of all the world
whether therefore we consider the great or the little world we may call each of them a booke but such a booke as to the reading whereof none is admitted vnder the degree of a man
and herein consists the first excellency of the reasonable soule this is the first act wherein it ariseth higher than the vnreasonable man goeth beyond a beast in the knowledge of perfection and this knowledge is the first roote of ioy

from hence springeth a second which is loue
knowledge is not vnfitly compared vnto a seale which is grauen not for it selfe but to set a print vpon the waxe and our heart is as waxe and easily receiues the impression of our knowledge
now the print which the knowledge of perfection leaueth in the heart is loue according to the greeke prouerbe undefined span alphabet

knowne good cannot be long vnaffected because the heart is as transformable into all good as the vnderstanding into all truth the heart say that hath his right temper and is capable of his proper obiect that obiect discerned must needs breed loue loue which is virtus a vertue which maketh a match betweene our soule and perfection for as knowledge is the eye whereby the soule seeth it so is loue the hand whereby it closeth with it

so that loue is the second act of the reasonable soule an act which distinguisheth betweene good and bad men and is the second roote of ioy
when knowledge and loue haue done their part then commeth in the reasonable soules last worke and that is ioy which is nothing else but the euidence of loue for where there is no loue there is no ioy but we cannot but ioy in that which we loue for ioy is the naturall fruit of loue and we cannot loue any thing but the heart will haue a pleasant feeling thereof
this third act of the

reasonable soule putteth a difference between happy and vnhappy men for ioy is the vpshot of all our endeauours nothing can satisfie till wee come to it and he that hath it resteth therein we studie we loue both that we may ioy but beyond ioy we cannot goe
and this thinke is the reason why undefined span alphabet was so vsually receiued for the common salutation

but wee may not onely consider the nature but the power of ioy also great power for it is in the pleasure of ioy how much we shall be capable of whatsoeuer good wee either know or loue the enlarging of our heart more or lesse is the act of ioy and as much as wee ioy so much is our heart inlarged
marke then as is our knowledge so is our loue for we can loue no more than we know and as is our loue so is our ioy for ioy is an effect of loue but as is our ioy so is our portion of good wee can receiue no more than our vessell will containe and the measure thereof depends from ioy
to come now vnto the angels words he calleth vpon the virgin for this affection the affection of ioy what meaneth hee thereby out of that you haue heard you may gather this he would haue her most sensible most capable of that diuine obiect which in his following words he presents vnto her
and what the angell commended vnto the virgin giue me leaue fathers and brethren to commend vnto you ioy
when we receiue the message of grace certainly it is gods pleasure that we should reioyce in his blessings
lord saith dauid lift thou vp vpon vs the light of thy countenance psalme
and what followeth that shall put more ioy into our hearts than they whose corne and wine is increased
the want of this ioy cost the israelites deare

because saith moses thou seruest not the lord thy god with ioyfulnesse and a chearfull heart for the abundance of all things therefore thou shalt serue thine enemies in hunger and thirst and nakednesse and the need of all things
wherefore at all times let our garments be white and let not oyle be wanting to our beads eccles

whensoeuer the lord doth answer the desire of our hearts then be in the lord serue the lord with gladnesse and come before his tresence with a song for we forfeit gods fauour if it bee not vnto vs the very ioy of our heart
and no maruell for to want this affection in the midst of gods mercies what doth it argue but that either wee want the vnderstanding of men and discerne not our blessing or else want that loue that should be in good men wherewith to imbrace the same or at least wee make not so much vse of gods mercy as thereby to become happy men for happy men we are not without ioy that affection that is here commended by the angell
and thus much of the affection
as for that iowly obeyzance wherewith the romanists say the angell spake the word thinke the mention thereof more vnworthy your learned eares than their superstitious pens that haue so childishly obserued it vnto vs
and therefore passe from the affection to the motiues that must worke the same

in vaine should the angell call for the affection except he proposed the motiues for our affections stirre not but as they are raised thereby
the motiues are her state considered first in it selfe and that first in

what termes she standeth with god good termes highly fauoured

the word is undefined span alphabet the very word calleth for ioy undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet are as neare in nature as in name grace is the seed of ioy we learne it in the
and
psalmes light is sowne for the righteous and ioyfulnesse for them that are true hearted
but the rhemists interrupt vs and quarrell with our translation they would haue it full of grace
and doe wee deny it we doe not our liturgie refutes them in the gospell wee reade it haile full of grace wee confesse the syriac agreeth with it and that the fathers haue it so and did not they abuse it still might it goe so but the abuse is grosse and to shew that the aduantage thereof is not in the originall words the church not without cause hath recourse vnto the fountaines and therehence doth discouer how weake the hold fast is which they take vpon their translation
for full of grace are doubtfull words there is grace of acceptance and grace of inherence whether is here meant undefined span alphabet sheweth that the angell meant the former
neither doe wee onely say so but themselues also yea the very iesuites themselues most deuoted to the virgin mary confesse that the word so signifieth and must be so taken here the more inexcusable is the rhemists slander

but you will say they include grace of inherence also doe wee deny it god forbid we confesse st austins rule to be true vasa quae creatrix sapientia format vt sint adiutrix gratia implet ne vacua sint god that with the holy oile annointed the tabernacle before he entred to dwel within it did no doubt sanctifie the virgins person whom he did destinate to be his sacred temple
but the question is concerning the measure
in the measure we say that they exceed their church exceeds
if the councell of basil and the councell of trent deliuer the doctrine of their church they exceed in the measure both of her grace and glory
of her grace freeing her very conception from sinne contrary to the iudgement not onely of the fathers but also of their best schoolemen st bernard hath written a very learned epistle against it

ad canonicos ludgnnenses
neither doe they lauish onely in their doctrine of her grace but of her glory also and in this much more dangerously euen so much more dangerously as the danger of idolatry exceedes the danger of heresie especially this idolatry because it includes that heresie
they then hauing so farre aduanced the virgin in the opinion of her grace doethereupon proportion vnto her such a degree of glory as that seeing christ is head of the church she must be the necke and as no influence commeth from the head into the body but by the necke so no grace is communicated to the church but by the virgin mary
are you not amazed when you heare it certainly you would bee if you read the prayers which they make to her euident arguments that they doe beleeue it and foule idolatry staines all their prayers wherein they doe expresse it
would they would behold themselues in the collyridian heretickes and apply vnto themselues that doome which epiphanius passeth vpon them

but forget my promise said would rather edisie you with the truth than refute errour wherefore leauing them let vs come to better matter

ioy is an effect whereof the angell will haue the virgin to looke vnto the cause the cause may be looked for either in her selfe or in god or as spake before in grace of acceptance or inherence
it is plaine by the word undefined span alphabet that the angell guides her eyes to looke on the former not the later to looke vpon the fauour she findeth rather than the indowments which she hath angels fall and mans also was caused by their desire to ioy in themselues for bred their apostasie
and though since the fall man haue little cause to fall in loue with himselfe yet is hee not free from danger if in himselfe hee will finde the ground of ioy for he is through the sight of his imperfection as much in danger to despaire as through the sight of his perfection hee was to presume the perfections of the best though they be such as are not void of comfort yet because they haue intermingled many imperfections that comfort must needes haue a mixture of much discomfort entire and solide ioy cannot be found there
wherefore st anstins confession must be the confession of vs all beata vita est saith hee speaking vnto god gaudere ad te de te propter te if we will ioy wee must lift vp our soules as high as god and in our ioy couple nothing with god we must be induced vnto ioy by no other end but to expresse our thankfulnesse for the mercy of god this is the true motiue of entire and solide ioy

but a little farther to open it this word doth eleuate the ioy to that degree which beseemes a christian man there are other obiects which vsurpe falsly that which belongs vnto god
carnall pleasures are the first vsurpers and many rest vpon them they rellish nothing but their meates their drinkes and sensuall lusts whose ioy if it be any it is but gaudium animalis there is nothing that can giue content vnto a man in such a ioy because these pleasures are common to vs with beasts
rationall indowments eyther of the vnderstanding or of the will furnished with liberall arts or morall vertues are the second vsurpers indeed their title vnto ioy is much better than the former yet their plea is but weake salomon hath censured knowledge as vnfit to breed ioy in that short saying qui addit scientiae addit dolori
and as for morall vertues

destitute of grace what ioy can there be in them which the fathers haue iudiciously censured to be no better than splendid a peccata so that the ioy promised by this vsurper if it be any it is but gaudium hominis the ioy of a naturall man and therefore as imperfect as is his nature
the third vsurper goeth a degree higher and that is inherent grace whose plea is so probable that it perplexeth many a man and yet it is but an vsurpers plea because of the rebellion betweene the flesh and the spirit and the often ouerthrowes which the spirit receiues in vs from the flesh and what ioy can there be in the midst of so many foyles in him that daily receiueth so many wounds so that ioy if there be any it is but the pharisees ioy that thinkes of himselfe better than he should and so doteth vpon the little good he hath that he obserues not how much more there is which he should haue but wanteth
we must ascend then yet farther and whither but vnto god from the grace of inherence to his grace of acceptance to that reconciliation which we haue with him springing

from his owne free good will towards vs
and this breeds indeed gaudium christiani hominis and it is this that is meant when the angell saith to the virgin that she is undefined span alphabet he telleth her what is the true motiue of ioy the free loue the high fauour of god which are comprehended within the word grace
and indeed excellent are the properties of this motiue wherein it excelleth all the other first it is that which onely can make all the promises of god credible vnto vs the adoption the inheritance of a childe of god the incarnation the mediation of the son of god can they finde any credibility in any of the other motiues the sensuall the rationall the pharisaicall well may they breed distrust but faith of these things they can neuer make yea they are all clogged with manifold exceptions to be taken thereat but if wee come to so god loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten son iohn
in gods ioue free loue we finde ground for our faith and rest for our soules
as this motiue doth make all gods promises credible so it maketh them communicable vnto all for other blessings of god are dispensed in varietie some haue one some another some haue riches and no honour some haue honour and no riches some haue wisedome which haue neither of these two some haue extraordinary vertue whose wisedome is but ordinary
but the free loue of god is common vnto all to all the children of god they that are vnequall in graces of inherence are in grace of acceptance all equall the grace of adoption the grace of reconciliation is measured with as liberall a hand to the poorest publican in earth as to the most glorious saint in heauen though not in actiue yet in passiue righteousnesse all are matches
whereupon followeth a third property this motiue to ioy is most parable or easie to be had the poorest may keepe as great a gaudy day here as the richest and the simplest as the wisest he that is lowest as he that is highest for we neede none of those things wherein it pleaseth god to aduance others before vs to the keeping of this gaudy day which consideration should make this motiue most welcome to vs all in that it containes a prouision that may be had at all times
and as to be had at all times so it faileth at no time for which is the fourth property it is as stable as parable as it is easily had so is it best kept
all other motiues haue their waxings and their wanings their ebbes and their flouds onely gods free loue is that that stayeth by vs and recouereth againe his other gifts when they faile in vs look vpon king dauid look vpon st peter and see what instability there is euen in that which is most likely to be stable the grace of inherence and when that faileth how commeth it to passe that they failed not also we can finde no other ground but gods free loue expressed in his promise vnto dauid my mercy will neuer take from thee psal
and christs prayer for st peter his prayer that st peters faith might not faile luke
this is that that fetched them againe when they were gone and reuiued them when they were euen dead
how often doth errour ouercast the best mens knowledge how cold doth charity grow euen in the best and yet wee see how they recouer both their light and heate whereof there can be no other reason but that they are undefined span alphabet

such as god doth loue gods loue is only that which worketh this cure
whereupon followeth the last property and most naturall to my text that this motiue is most comfortable
a motiue that hath all these properties must needes be most apt to breed ioy
what fooles then are wee in the choice of the obiect of our ioy if forsaking this we pitch vpon any of the other of which you haue heard how vnapt they are to breed ioy nay how apt they are to breed sorrow so that what salomon said wee may say vnto all their ioy thou art mad what dost thou undefined span alphabet

saith nazianzene speaking of all corporall pleasures sufficient vnto the disquieting of the body is the concupiscence thereof
yea the imborne concupiscence is sufficient to disquiet both body and soule we neede not haue recourse vnto these obiects as fewell to kindle that fire nor pamper that beast which is so headstrong against reason and piety and doth so often dispossesse them of the soueraignty they should haue ouer vs certainly in the vpshot we shall finde that the more wee haue to doe with obiects the lesse true ioy shall wee finde
and if wee may not ioy in any of obiects whereof not one is able to reconcile vs vnto god nor assure vs of his loue the onely sure motiue vnto ioy how much lesse may wee ioy in that which setteth vs at oddes with god and argueth that there is no commerce betweene vs meane concupiscence and the sinfull fruits thereof
it is true that this is undefined span alphabet that sinne may take place with vs sathan doth cloath it with a seeming ioy euen the most vexing affections thereof as appeares in the very word undefined span alphabet and did it not promise ioy men would not be so transported by it but certainly this is plainly risus sardonius men laugh and dye the scripture elegantly compares it to the crackling of thornes in the fire whereof you see a blaze and heare a noyse but vpon a suddaine they are turned to ashes euen so wicked men as iob speaketh spend their time indeed in a seeming pleasure but in a moment goe downe to hell
wherefore to shut vp this point let vs be so farre from affecting our owne corruption that we doe not so much as foster that which is but the incourager thereof the incourager though for a time to tickle vs yet to sting vs in the close let grace bee vnto vs the onely motiue vnto ioy euen the free grace wherewith god vouch safeth to accept vs as it onely can be so let it be onely the ground of true ioy whensoeuer ioy is desired by vs
the angell did bid the virgin ioy because of that

but how could she be sure of it the angell addeth that she had a very good pledge of it the lord is with thee
marke how the angell placeth his words first undefined span alphabet then undefined span alphabet and thirdly undefined span alphabet
if he should haue said haile the lord is with thee the one would neuer haue followed well vpon the other for though before the fall gods presence was comfortable vnto man yet since the fall feare is inseparable from sinne and the very best abhorre gods presence being priuie to their losse of his resemblance adam is the first patterne and after adam we reade of manie others
so that highly fauoured or freely beloued must stand between haile and the lord is with thee otherwise they will neuer come together esay could not giue his woe is mee for am a man of polluted lips

and

dwell in the middest of a people of polluted lips mine eyes haue seene the lord of glory till that the seraphin was sent with a coale from the altar and touched his lips in token that his sinne was remoued and hee become undefined span alphabet

neither could daniel indure the presence of the angell till he was heartened by this message that hee was vir desideriorum one in whom god did take delight and the best of vs will say as st peter goe from mee lord for am a sinfull man luke
except the lord himselfe be pleased to hearten vs and say to vs as christ to st peter feare not or as god to moses and noah thou hast found grace in mine eyes

as we must obserue the order of the words so must wee also the distance of these persons the distance betweene the lord and his handmaiden and then the combination will seeme strange
strange it is that persons so distant should come together but most happy it is that they doe because the perfection of the one can yeeld so good supply to the imperfection of the other gods maiesty honoureth the basenesse of his handmaiden his might strengtheneth her weaknesse non sumita vel diuinae ignarus magnitudinis vel humanae fragilitatis vt non magnum putem undefined span alphabet saith nazianzene and the psalmist blessed is hee whom thou choosest to come neare thee he shall dwell in thy courts and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house euen of thy holy temple psal

but the angell saith not thou art with the lord but the lord is with thee it were much better you would thinke for vs to be with him than for him to bee with vs for man to ascend to heauen than for god to come downe to the earth
true it is that it maketh more for our happinesse to ascend to god but it doth more argue gods loue that he descendeth to vs to ascend is our aduancement but to descend is a debasement of god yea the psalmist saith that god doth humble himselfe whensoeuer being so high hee vouchsafeth from heauen but to behold the things on earth
adde hereunto that the lord must needes come to vs before wee can come to him because his comming to vs is the giuing of that ability by which wee doe afterward ascend to him so that the angell being to giue the virgin a proofe of gods loue towards her could giue her no better than these words containe

the lord is with thee
but deus aqualiter totus est per suam simplicem essentiam as st bernard speaketh and speaketh fully and truly of the presence of god
were there no other text of scripture that did testifie the immensity of gods essence as there are many iob
esay
psal
dominus tecum is strong enough to refute vorstius his erroneous conceit mistaking certaine passages of scripture and thereupon limiting gods essentiall presence within the circle of heauen and admitting onely an efficiency to proceed from him so low as the earth
but this dominus tecum will not indure that for you must vnderstand that whereas the name lord is common to all three persons in the trinity as we learne in athanasius creed the fathers vsually vnderstand here the second person which was to be incarnate in the virgins wombe her wombe was to bee the temple of the liuing god quem totus mundus capere non poterat acceptura erat quasi in angustum cubiculum vterisui so that the lord was necessarily to be euen in his essence

with her that was in his essence to come from her otherwise she could not be undefined span alphabet the mother of our lord as elizabeth doth call her luke
the lord is with thee they are words mysticall and import a maine article of faith euen the conception of our sauiour christ which could not be without the presence of his essence
and yet the presence of the essence alone sufficeth not to the conception because the essence is euery where that presence is necessary there must be acknowledged also an efficiency proceeding therefrom euen such an efficiency as is arbitrary for god worketh according as it pleaseth him
in the case of the conception the efficiency is singular and the virgins wombe is the only place where god did euer manifest it and so wee must acknowledge it
but the virgin did conceiue christ not onely corpore but etiam corde the first was singular but the second is common for st paul telleth vs that we may also conceiue christ though not in our wombe yet in our soule my little children of whom trauell againe till iesus christ be formed in you gal

and st peter telleth vs of the seed of this conception the immortall seed of the word of god
pet

and indeed we could not be called christians were it not that we partake of christ

know you not saith st paul that iesus christ is in you except you bee reprobates so that the lord is with thee may be spoken to euery one of vs though not in regard of christs incarnation in our bodies yet of his vnion vnto our soules
yea therefore was hee conceiued by the virgin corporally that spiritually he might be conceiued of euery one of vs and so become indeed immanuel the lord with vs
and what shall we say to these things surely with an ancient father gratia dei non potuit gratiùs co~mendari quàm vt ipse vnicùs dei filius in se incommunicabiliter manens indueret hominem spem dilectionis suae daret hominibus homine this is the most sweete comfort wherewith god anciently vsed to sustaine his children each in particular gen

and the whole church in generall esay
reuel

yea christ left this comfort for his farewell to his disciples lo am with you to the worlds end matth

and no maruell for as when god is angry he departs from vs so when out of fauour he commeth to vs it is the prognostication of some good that is then towards vs so followeth it in my text next to dominus tecum commeth benedicta

the presence of the arke brought a blessing vpon house how much more must a blessing follow wheresoeuer the truth of the type commeth meane the lord himselfe the spouse in the canticles confesseth that when her beloued knocked at the doore he left the sent of his sweet odours as a remembrance cant

but blessed is the virgin and in being blessed she is a patient shee becommeth not such but by meanes of some agent this agent may be either god or man and so the benediction bee either reall or verball
some vnderstand the reall the benediction of god some the verball the benediction of man the vse of the word undefined span alphabet reacheth the former but the signification thereof imports the latter both may stand together
and indeede the verball benediction is but an attendant vpon the

reall you may learne it of balaam num
vers
vers
how shall ieurse saith he where god hath not cursed how shall detest where the lord hath not detested behold haue receiued a commandement to blesse where he hath blessed and cannot alter it
two things there are which the verball benediction must take heed of and wherein it must guide it selfe by the reall it must bee sure that the person whom it blesseth doth partake of the reall and being sure thereof it must proportion the verball vnto the reall
the fathers did not without good cause pen many panegyricks in honour of the saints and they penned them with those two cautions and therefore might they without danger be pronounced euen in the church to the edification of the people
but the golden legend is too palpable an euidence of the latter churches neglect of suiting their verball benediction to the reall benediction of god for how many haue they blessed whom god hath cursed and calendred for saints such as it may bee feared are firebrands in hell and as for those which are saints indeede how lauish are they in reporting what god neuer did eyther for them or to them the whole legend being become nothing else but undefined span alphabet as epiphanius speaketh a fardell of forged dreames
not to goe from our present instance of the blessed virgin in whom if euer in any they haue disproportioned the verball and the reall benediction
we forget not epiphanius his good rule undefined span alphabet the virgin must from our mouths receiue no lesse nor no more than her due
the church of rome challengeth vs for giuing her lesse but they charge vs falsly for we most willingly goe as farre in our verball as we haue any faire euidence that god hath gone in his reall farther we doe not goe neyther indeede should we

st bernard hath taught vs well virgoregia falso non eget honore veris cumulata honorum titulis infulis dignitatum he giues a good reason nam non est hoc virginem honorare sed honori detrahere
atheists are incouraged to eleuate the credit of the whole if they can iustly challenge the truth of any part of such stories
iob saith well wee may not lye for god much lesse may wee lye for a saint and yet the legends of this blessed virgin how are they fraught with officious lyes

but will not trouble you with farther discouery thereof who cannot forget their excesse in the publique doctrine of her grace and glory whereof gaue you a taste on the second branch of my text

come then to the last point which meane to touch
the angell doth not onely say that the virgin is blessed but also blessed in comparison the phrase is comparatiue
amongst other words this is one wherewith the hebrewes which haue no formall comparatiue words vse to express the superlatiue degree blessed amongst women is as much as amost blessed woman as if the angell should say many daughters haue been blest but thou surmountest them all
and indeed it is no great prerogatiue to be blest aboue many wretches but aboue many blessed ones to be blest is a blessing indeed
the angell therefore biddeth her obserue not onely the nature but the measure also of her estate
sarah was blessed and so was rebecca rahel likewise with deborah iael and many others but their

blessing was nothing vnto hers for this phrase alludes to former prophesies moses speaketh of a woman gen
whose seed should bruise the serpents head but it was haisha a speciall woman that he pointed at and that woman was this virgin
esay speaketh of a virgin that shall conceiue and beare a sonne whose name shall be called immanuel esay
but it is hagnalma a speciall virgin and that virgin was this blessed mary
ieremie saith the lord will create a new thing in the earth and a woman shall compasse a man geber an heroicall man and no woman bare such a sonne but this blessed virgin
adde hereunto that which the fathers generally obserue and sedulius hath comprehended in two verses

gaudia matris habens cum virginit at is honore nec primam similem visa est nec habere secundam

neuer was the like woman before her neither euer shall the like come after her so true is it that she is and is to be acknowledged superlatiuely blessed

farther comparison than betweene her and women the holy ghost is not pleased to make
others haue gone farther and lifted her higher than all angels how truly will not dispute list not to be inquisitiue where the holy ghost is silent these things shall better be knowne when we meete in heauen

that which onely obserue vpon this point is that a comparison sheweth the eminency of a grace and is a most feeling motiue vnto ioy thereby we are not onely put in minde of our good but of the greatnesse thereof
were there no baser creatures whereunto a man might compare himselfe he should lose much of that ioy which ariseth out of the knowledge which hee hath that hee is a man were there not many out of the church which are men we should not know how much honour our being in the church addeth vnto vs in that wee are christian men king dauid maketh the
psalme out of his feeling of the first comparison and to put vs in minde of the second the
psalme concludes thus he hath not dealt so with euery nation neither haue the heathen knowledge of his lawes
finally in comparison of our selues let vs remember a good obseruation of st austins beatior maria percipiendo fidem

quàm concipiendo carnem christi his assertion is grounded vpon christs owne words luke
who when a certaine woman cryed out

blessed is the wombe that bare thee and the pappes that gaue thee sucke answered nay blessed are they that heare the word of god and keepe it
and those else where hee calleth his mother his brethren and his kinred matth

where hee had both carnall and also spirituall cognation hee did value the spirituall more than the carnall
the eminency of the blessed virgin was this that shee did partake of both and therein she hath an eminency aboue vs but if we doe as we ought value our spirituall state the eminency is very great which god vouchsafeth euery one of vs and that wee may ioy in it so much as we should this degree of gods blessing must bee weighed by vs

but will pursue this text no farther onely a generall vse there is that we must make of the whole and that is taught vs by this blessed virgin her selfe her magnificat is an excellent patterne thereof see therein

how her words are correspondent to the angels
the angell biddeth her haile that is be glad and what saith she my soule doth magnifie and my spirit doth reioyce
the angell telleth her that shee is highly beloued of god and she doth not magnifie her selfe she reioy ceth not in her selfe but my soule saith she doth magnifie the lord and my spirit reioyceth in god my sauiour
the angell goeth on the lord is with thee and she sings on the lord indeed hath regarded the lowe estate of his handmaid hee that is mighty hath magnified mee
finally she heareth that she is blessed amongst women and she gathers that because she is so graced of god not for her own worth that from thenceforth all generations shall call her blessed
a better patterne of meditating vpon gods mercies we cannot haue nor learne a better vse of the auemarie
would the church of rome that are so deuoted to the virgin would of her learne this good lesson if they will not let vs not neglect so good a patterne

but must end
the summe of all is as the blessed virgin so euery one of vs must haue a comfortable feeling especially of gods free loue that is the liuing spring of his gracious presence of that singular presence wherewith hee honoured the virgins wombe and that common which is vouchsafed to all beleeuing hearts the least whereof must bee deemed to be no small prerogatiue
lord it was thou that shewedst the virgin light wherefore with cords of deuotion we binde our sacrifice to the hornes of thy altar yea thou art a god to euery one of vs therefore we thanke thee thou onely art our god and therefore we praise thee and let vs euer set thee before vs that dost vouchsafe to come so neare vnto vs that our heart may be glad and our tongue reioyce in thee so long as we liue here and when we depart hence our flesh also will rest in hope till wee come both body and soule into thy presence where is the fulnesse of ioy and bee crowned with that right hand whereat there are pleasures for euermore

two sermons preached in the cathedrall church at wells

the first sermon

epigraph

matth

vers
what could ye not watch with me one houre watch and pray that yee enter not into temptation the spirit indeede is willing but the flesh is weake

the&se words were read vnto you out of this dayes gopell

therein you heard that they were vttered by christ to his disciples christ out of his owne foreknowledge and out of the prophet zachary gaue the disciples to vnderstand that no sooner should himselfe their captaine fall into the enemies hands but they would all shew themselues to bee but cowardly followers
st peter with the rest though more forward than the rest answered that they would bee so farre from flying in his danger that they would spend their liues in his iust defence
hereunto christ replyed that they would not be as good as their word nay that they would shamefully contradict their words by their deeds and it fell out euen so for scarce had an houre passed but they began to betray their weaknesse
christ taketh them in the very beginning of it and from it taketh an occasion first to reproue vers
then to aduise them vers
hee reproueth them for their present defect what could yee not watch with mee one houre and aduiseth them to preuent a future reuolt watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation

more distinctly in the reproofe wee must note the matter and the manner the matter is the disciples drowsinesse they did not watch that is amplified by the circumstance of time and of persons of time they

held not out for the space of one houre
and of persons the persons of disciples and the person of christ drowsinesse was intolerable in them because they had promised so much especially in christs company to whom they did owe more than to watch

as was the sinne so was the reproofe that foule this sharpe it is vttered in few words but they goe to the quicke for the first undefined span alphabet what is elleipticall and implies christs wondering at their vnanswerablenesse to their presumptuous vndertaking
the next words undefined span alphabet point out their ignorance of themselues could ye not this is more than you thought on so christ reproues
but he doth not leaue them so as he disliked what was past so would he haue them better prouided against that which is to come you may perceiue it in his aduise which is respectiue to their disease they presumed much but could doe little christ biddeth them therefore bee more carefull and lesse confident more carefull watch lesse confident pray do the vttermost of your endeauour but build onely vpon gods succour
but why need they be more carefull and lesse confident christ yeeldeth the reason of both where there is danger there is need of care they were in danger to enter into temptation watch lest yee enter into temptation
but if they be carefull why may they not be confident there is good reason their helpe standeth not in themselues the spirit indeed is willing but their flesh is weake therefore they must seeke to god and seeke by prayer pray
you see the contents of this scripture which wee must now farther open and apply vnto our selues begin with the reproofe whereof the matter is the drowsinesse of the apostles their drowsinesse is noted by not watching

it was night when christ spake this and so a time to sleep adde hereunto that they had newly supped and had heard the dolefull sermon of christs departure all which serue to increase the heauinesse as of their mindes so of their bodies
but it was the night wherein christ was to be betrayed and wherein themselues were to be exposed to danger and therefore it was a time to watch
the care of our duety sometimes and sometimes of our safety maketh vs forbeare many things which otherwise we might lawfully vse sometimes we fast from our ordinary fare sometimes we put off robes of state and cloath our selues with garments of heauinesse and eate the bread of mourning so is there a time when we should deny our eyes their beloued sleepe and then not to deny it is a sinne a great sinne as great as to fare deliciously when wee should fast and attire our selues gorgiously when wee should mourne the scripture condemneth all three the apparrell exod
the fare esay
both apparrell and fare in ioel

and in ionas the couch is added to them amos
we must then note that euery thing hath his appointed time eccles

and it is not a sinne to be drowsie for nature requireth refreshing but to bee drowsie at an vnseasonable time when grace doth not ouerrule nature and the body is not made seruiceable to the soule willing to do her duety

to god this is a sinnefull drowsinesse
and such was the drowsinesse of the apostles and it was extraordinarily in them for the text doth amplifie their sinne by two circumstances first of the time then of the persons the time the space of one houre
when god requireth that our bodies should attend our soules though he did require more time in that attendance than reason conceiueth can stand with the strength of nature we should not sticke at it because the same god that strengthened moses in the mount twice to fast forty dayes and forty nights and elias not onely to fast but also to walke so many dayes without eyther sleepe or meate can support vs employed in his seruice so long as therein hee is pleased to employ vs
but if he limit the time within the strength of our fraile nature what excuse haue we if we faile in our duety the time required of the apostles was but an houre and who doth not vpon all occasions of profit and pleasure put off his sleepe more than an houre the couetous man riseth early and goeth late to bed to increase his wealth the voluptuous man in gaming and rioting is well content to adde the night vnto the day and though it be a winter night the ambitious will be contented to trauaile in it rather than misse the preferment whereunto he doth aspire
and doth not then the naturall man condemn the spirituall when the one watcheth so long and the other cannot watch so short a time but why seeke so farre the apostles are condemned by their very enemies vt iugulent homines surgunt de nocte latrones vt teipsum serues non expergisceris the high priests sate vp all this night in consultation iudas and their seruants were busie all night about the execution of their wicked designes the apostles cannot watch no not an houre will not their enemies rise vp against them condemne their drowsinesse they will especially if this houre were the very first houre of the night which might best be spared for the farther the night goeth on the more weaknesse commeth on and lesse blameable is drowsinesse in the dead than in the beginning of the night now happily undefined span alphabet is an hebraisme and is put for undefined span alphabet as undefined span alphabet elsewhere so that it noteth not onely the space of an houre but also pointeth out which houre it was but howsoeuer wee vnderstand undefined span alphabet it is out of all question that the disciples drowsinesse ouertooke them the very first houre which addeth much to the aggrauating of their fault

as the circumstance of time so also of persons makes to the amplification of the sinne as well the persons who are drowsie as his person in whose company they were so

first of the drowsie persons they were the apostles all the apostles were drowsie but christ singled out three peter iames and iohn to accompany him vnto that place in the garden in which himselfe chose to pray wherein christ shewed that hee had more than an ordinary conceit of them and did expect more than ordinary seruice from them
and well might it be so for hee had shewed them more fauour than the rest they onely were with him when hee was transfigured in the mount and saw his glory
as he shewed them most fauour so they were most forward to offer their seruice st peter

though all the world be offended

with thee yet will not be offended
iames and iohn matth

wee drinke of the cup whereof thou shalt drinke and bee baptized with the baptisme wherewith thou shalt be baptised
had they been only disciples they were bound to doe what their master commanded but the more trust he reposed in them the lesse were they to faile him especially seeing they were so farre indebted for extraordinary fauour and had vowed their liues in his defence all these things are included in the drowsie persons necessary voluntary obligations but neither worke though there was so much reason why they should yet did not these apostles watch nothing is remarkeable in their persons that makes not their drowsinesse more inexcusable

and if their sinne bee amplified by their owne persons how much more by the person of christ it was a fault not to watch in danger a greater fault not to watch the space of one houre especially seeing they were apostles such apostles but what accesse is made to this sinne when they neglect to watch in the company of their sauiour had christ sent them alone to the place then because of vaesoli this fall had not been strange for it is not strange to see a man disheartened with danger and ouerwhelmed with woe but christ went with them his presence was enough to keepe them in heart
though walke saith dauid in the middest of the valley of death will feare no euill for thou art with mee lord thy rod and thy staffe shall comfort mee psal
and this good shepheard was now with the apostles why then were their hearts heauie nay he was not onely with them but he was watching and praying and was not his example a strong meanes to keep them from being drowsie as iron whetteth iron so doth the face of a friend quicken his friend
had he been onely a companion in the work their eyes should haue been on him they should haue blushed not to imitate him but hee was their captaine their master and what a shame for a seruant to sleepe when his master waketh and when his master watcheth to shew himselfe drowsie and yet this commeth not home enough for this companion yea this captaine did watch did pray for them it was for them that he stood out he presented himselfe to god and prepared himselfe for the crosse but he did both for them himselfe needed neither we wretched sinners needed both god layed our burthen vpon him our teares our sighes our groanes our stripes our death
it is a generall rule of piety that we should weepe with them that weepe how much more should we be affected with the like passion if any one bee distressed for vs it was a strange stupidity in ionas when god pursued him with a tempest to get vnder hatches and there sleepe securely while the poore mariners toyled out their bodies in rowing and brake their hearts in praying to their gods to free them from the tempest how much more stupid are these apostles who lay them downe to rest when god was reaching vnto christ that cup of vengeance whereof wee all should haue drunke for our sinne had not christ eased vs of that bitter draught the preparation for that potion which should haue bin our porion kept christ waking and praying it cast him into an agony and drew teares of bloud

from all parts of his body
while he is thus affected and afflicted for vs the apostles are at rest as if these things did nothing concerne them which their sinnes no lesse than the sinnes of others poured vpon christ
it might haue been some ease to christ if hee had seene them compassionately deuout certainly their senselesnesse added not a little to the bitternesse of his paine the more he suffered for them the greater impression should his suffering haue made in them and they should haue had the more the nearer they were vouchsafed to be to his person
you haue heard enough of the apostles drowsinesse their sinne and degrees thereof it well deserued a reproofe

and christ doth not spare them spare first to taxe their presumption that he doth in the first word undefined span alphabet what one word but wherein is implied that the apostles answered not that resolution which they pretended yea that they came so short that christ could not but wonder at their drowsinesse
both these are implied in undefined span alphabet what is all your boasting come to this is this the courage that you would shew in my defence did you conceiue so well of your selues and so liberally amplifie your seruice all proues but vanity all argues nothing but presumption
it is a naturall disease of all the sonnes of adam that if they haue but motes of vertue they thinke they are mountaines and presume that their actions goe hand in hand with their speculations
little children when they begin first to find their feet thinke they can goe as well and as far as those that are of riper age and this conceit maketh them take many a fall
the most of vs are but babes in christ and our iudgement erreth in nothing more than in taking an estimate of our ability wherein we come so short of performing what we promise to our selues that as we may blush so christ may wonder and breake into this question undefined span alphabet what is it so so great words so small deeds certainly man euen the best of men is altogether vanity psal
his vaunts are nothing but the sparkles of his pride and hee presumeth aboue his strength
for what is his strength surely very small the displaying of that is a second branch of christs reproofe undefined span alphabet could ye not your strength is very small you are much weaker than you suppose you thought not of it before you haue now giuen plaine proofe of it your drowsinesse represents it plainly before your eyes it telleth you how little you are able to performe
but we must not mistake for inability is to be vnderstood not physically but morally they were not simply disinabled to watch for the instances before giuen in couetous ambitious and voluptuous men shew that men can if they will breake their sleepe and what they can that they doe when the world setteth them on worke but when heauen enioynes them then how weake are they their affections haue no vigour they are soone tired and giue ouer at the first onset so that as the prophet speaketh of the iewes they were wise to doe euill but to doe good they had no vnderstanding at all so may we say of our affections they are strong to sinne but to doe good they haue no vigour at all
or rather men doe not put out their strength and they are conquered because they doe not resist
and indeed drowsinesse were not a sinne were it not a mixt action wherein our willing

eelding to our affections which we should represse makes vs to bee guilty and this christ meaneth when he deliuereth his checke with an interrogation could you not as if he should say you cannot well excuse your drowsinesse
behold then an example of humane frailty and wee must all behold our selues herein what christ said to them he may well say to vs not one but is more or lesse touched with presumption and hath infirmities whereof hee neede to bee remembred the best voweth more than he performeth and in the presence of christ discouereth his weaknesse let the time be neuer so short appointed for our deuotion our eares grow quickly heauie when they should heare god in his word and our eies drowsie when we should behold him in our prayers
and what wonder if we watch so little out of the church if wee sleepe so much in it wee must therefore euery man take vnto himselfe this reproofe which christ directeth vnto the apostles euen the best must take it vnto themselues seeing christ directs it vnto the best of his apostles

as we must take the reproofe so must we the aduice also which is the second maine point of my text come now to it
the aduice is sutable to the reproofe for they were reproued for too much confidence and too little care and they are aduised to be more carefull watch and lesse confident pray
but in ioyning of this point to the other wee must first obserue that though the apostles gaue good cause yet christ did not presently reiect them for vnto his reproofe he addes aduise giuing them to vnderstand that hee touched at their fault because hee would haue them take better heed
wherehence wee may learne how to deale with others wee must neither sooth them when they doe ill and we must try whether they may be brought for to doe well

let vs now come to the parts of the aduice they are two first aperit oculos then ministrat alas he rowseth them out of their sleepe and furnisheth them with helpe against their danger first hee doth rowse them
the syriac speaketh fully euigilate and indeed they were asleepe therefore they were to be awakened before they could watch to shake off their drowsinesse before they could take heed
as in naturall actions the impediment must bee remoued before the creature can moue according to his forme so in morall we must be freed from the opposite of vertue before we can haue or vse the habit thereof
but because watching is principally intended therefore the precept runneth vpon that
watching then is compounded of two things of waking and heeding waking is solutio sensuum the keeping open of the passage whereby sense may be informed of his proper obiect
heeding is the iudgement wee passe vpon the obiect considering what it doth prognosticate vnto vs whether good or euill and our senses stand sentinell to giue a timely alarum when there is any approach of danger
but as our senses are of two sorts inward and outward so is the watching also here is not onely a watch set in the outward man but in the inward man also
and good reason for there are many dangers which sense cannot apprehend as it is euident in this our present case iudas came now to betray christ and had many followers

which were men but sathan before had entred into iudas saith st iohn and when he came now commeth the prince of this world saith christ and in st luke he telleth st peter

that sathan had desired to winnow not only him but all the apostles euen as wheate
seeing then the obiect is bodily and ghostly the watch that wee keepe must be answerable thereto as the theefe is that will robbe our house as the enemies are that will besiege our city so must our care be lest scaping one we fall into the hands of another as vsually we doe our eies are busie enough to apprehend and decline our bodily danger but few intend their ghostly yea they receiue most wounds ghostly when they are most safe bodily wee watch as men but not as christian men but it is the christian mans watch that is required in this place
enough of watching

but watching is not enough to procure our safety no though the whole man watch both body and soule what we see may dismay if wee see no more than may be discerned by the body how much more if we see what may be discerned by the soule such a sight will make vs but like elizeus his man who when he saw the armie of the aramites cried alas master what shall wee doe to remedy his feare his master fell to his praiers and vpon elizeus his praiers his seruants eies were opened and he saw the armie of god readie to assist them

and indeed to the eyes of our care that is our watching wee must adde the wings of our hope that is our praying our eies must still bee fixt vpon the lord who can plucke our feete out of the snares psal
when we ioyne these eyes and wings together wee shall experience that in the prouerbes true

in vaine is the net spread before the eyes of euery thing that hath a wing

if christ had said onely watch hee might saith prosper seeme to haue fauoured but when hee addes pray hee sheweth in whom our strength is placed euen in god the keeper of israel which neither slumbereth nor sleepeth psal
to pray then is to acknowledge that we must needs be swallowed vp of danger corporall and spirituall except the lord support and defend vs we may not thinke our owne vigilancie sufficient but haue recourse to him for except the lord keepe the citie the watchman waketh but in vaine psal
our owne vigilancie is commendable if we make of it a right vse and the vse is to make vs runne to god
and indeed no men seeke lesse vnto god than they that lost thinke themselues in danger dreaming that they are secure they begge no helpe what wonder if then they become a prey let vs begin then with watching and thence proceed to praying
this method is most behoouefull because wee must fit our prayers to our need we must not pray at randome but as our wants are so must our praiers be wee discerne our wants by watching which by praying wee supply so did king dauid so must wee wee reade it in his psalmes and they must be our patternes cold is the deuotion that is not quickened by vigilancie and fruitlesse is the vigilancy that is not relieued by praier
if euery one of vs would reflect our eies vpon our selues we shall find that we seldome looke about vs before we pray and therfore our prayers are so dull or if we faile not in that care we place our refuge

in others rather than god whereupon it commeth to passe that our successe is accordingly
in a word praying and watching both must be vsed but praying is the casting off of our eies from our selues that we be not proud of our owne care whereby wee descry our enemies yea it teacheth vs to cast our eies off from our enemies also vpon god that wee be not deiected with their power so that though we begin below considering our enemies and our selues yet must wee end aboue entreating gods hand to entermeddle with both
you haue heard christs aduice

he is not contented onely to giue it but hee sets downe also reasons that must perswade vs to entertaine it watch we must lest we enter into temptation
and indeed where there is danger there care is needfull specially if the danger be our owne christs saying lest yee enter into temptation giueth them to vnderstand whose danger it is willing them that though they were not moued with his case yet they should not neglect themselues
but what is temptation it is a tryall made of vs how firmely wee will stand to christ how manfully wee will abide by his truth
now as the tempter is such is his temptation sometimes god tempts vs and sometimes the diuell
god tempteth vs onely by calling vpon vs to doe our duety though he is pleased sometimes to cloath that duetie with difficulties to see if we loue any thing in comparison of him that temptation is not here meant
the diuell he tempteth endeauouring to withdraw vs from doing our dueties and perswading vs not to hazzard our liues or our liuings by standing fast in the feare of god
this is the temptation that here is meant and this is temptatio ad malum culpae per malum poenae sollicitation vnto sinne by the terrours of troubles iudas came and sathan in him sathan aymed at malum culpae at the apostles reuolt from christ and to worke his will hee vsed iudas his malice to persecute them that tooke christs part
now then when christ bids them watch lest they should enter into temptation he biddeth them haue an eie as well to sathan as to iudas for now both were tempters and they might now enter into the temptation of both who would sleepe if he lay neare a corporall lyon or serpent shall wee sleepe that lye so neare the spirituall but the fathers greeke and latine obserue precisely the phrase of entering into temptation it is not our care that can put off temptations the diuell is a hunter and will alwaies be following his chase he is a fowler and will alwaies be setting his ginnes he will neuer neglect his care
our care must be not to put our selues into the lions mouth not to throw our selues into his snares daemoniacum est saith theophylact it is a diuellish thing to be so desperate we may not so much as desire to be tempted
in this very storie that wee haue in hand our sauiour christ prayeth more than once father if it be possible let this cup passe giuing a secret checke vnto the apostles pride who so rashly offered themselues vnto death which christ so earnestly did deprecate
and how foolish is it for vs to affect it as if the diuell and the world were not studious enough to ouercharge vs with it

and indeed they may easily ouercharge vs as appeareth in the next reason

the reason of our prayer the spirit is but the flesh is weake
will not trouble you with the diuers sense that is put vpon these words the best and the most agree that these two words note the two parts of a regenerate man the spirit noting the new and the flesh the old man and so this passage agreeth with the like rom
the phrases themselues doe giue vs to vnderstand that our willingnesse to serue god is not from nature but from grace and our backwardnesse is not from grace but from nature
if these two parts do not concurre the spirit the flesh the flesh may plucke backe as much as the spirit putteth forward yea and though they doe concurre yet the spirit is too quicke for the flesh and will venture farther than flesh dares to follow
tertullians rule is true that these words import quid eui subijci debeat whether of the parts should haue the command but all goeth not as it should because one part is inabled to will but the other is not inabled to obey therefore st hierome saith well quantum de ardore mentis confidimus tantum de fragilitate carnis metuamus we must not suppose we can doe all we would but we must pray that the spirit that is well disposed may also bee strong to subdue the flesh as by watching the flesh is to sinne so by praying is the spirit inabled to rule
but more distinctly

first touching the willingnesse of the spirit there is great difference betweene the habit of grace and the vse thereof though wee be well qualified with the habit yet except god excite and assist wee make little vse thereof
now the willingnesse of the spirit here meant is the ability of a regenerate man without the assistance of god and we must pray for the latter because without it the former will auaile but little

as for the weaknesse of the flesh it must be vnderstood with a restraint ad bonum for to resist it is strong enough strong enough to resist the spirit but weake to resist temptation
and why the tempter offereth to the flesh if it yeeld that which the flesh naturally desireth and if it yeeld not he threatneth what the flesh naturally abhorres corporall comfort is that whereafter the body doth long by nature as by nature it doth ioath the losse thereof
the tempter therefore hath an easie conquest vpon the flesh except gods hand goe with it in vaine is it countermanded by the spirit many wofull examples haue the primitiue churches of this frailty of our nature and euery day is too fertill in spectacles hereof if the tempter set vpon the flesh he will easily carry vs away though not without some contradiction of the spirit
and here we see the fountaine of all our sinnes of infirmity the roote of them is this oddes betweene the flesh and the spirit and this is the whetstone of prayer the best men if they be buffeted with the messenger of sathan as saint paul was their best remedy is that which saint paul vsed prayer vnto god whose grace onely can be sufficient for vs

and whose strength is made perfect in our weaknesse
if this lesson be necessary for those that haue some inward alacrity how much more for them that are altogether drowsie if the best must pray in conscience of their infirmity how feruent in prayer should they be that feele not in themselues that forwardnesse of grace

how earnestly should they pray god make speed to saue vs lord make haste to helpe vs

conclude all
this whole text is a lesson of modesty and calleth vpon vs to worke out our saluation in feare and trembling seeing it is god that worketh in vs both to will and to doe not that wee should wauer in our faith but that we should not presume vpon our owne strength remembring that it is an easie matter to vow much while we are on the shore whereof we will be little mindfull when wee be ouertaken at sea many faire flowers shoote forth when the sunne shineth which come to nought if they be nipt with a frost we may not presume that we will be more constant than the apostles let their weaknesse teach vs to be humble lest if wee promise more than we performe christ taxe our pride and vpbraid our weaknesse the tempter will euer set on vs therefore let vs neuer cease to watch
but the more wee finde out our danger by watching the more let vs flye to god in praying that the same god which hath giuen vs a willing spirit may also giue vs obedient flesh that both may hold out in the day of temptation so shall they both reioyce in the liuing god reioyce here while they sticke fast vnto christ notwithstanding the crosse and reioyce hereafter when both comming out of all tribulation shall from christ receiue an immarcescible crowne

the second sermon

epigraph

marke
and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the houre might passe from him
and hee said abba father all things are possible vnto thee take away this cup from mee neuerthelesse not that will but what thou wilt

in the history of christs crosse which wee commemorate this day there are two remarkable parts first a feeling representation thereof which christ made vnto himselfe and secondly a constant perpession thereof when it was imposed by others
the first may bee called propassio and the second passio there went a crosse before the crosse a before the a rationall before the sensitiue christ wrought a smart in himselfe before hee was stricken by others
this feeling representation this crosse this is the argument of those words that now haue read vnto you

the whole tract is conceiued in forme of a prayer and indeed it is an

offertory prayer christ by prayer sets the stampe of a sacrifice vpon his death and turneth his suffering into an offering

in this prayer wee are to obserue the circumstances that attend it and the substance of it
the circumstances are two when and where
when he prayed timely he prayed before he suffered he armed himselfe before he came vnto the conflict
but where in a priuate place that hee might more freely poure forth his soule to god he withdrew himselfe from all company of men
in the substance of the prayer wee must see first to whom it is directed and secondly what is expressed in it
it is directed vnto the father and there is reason it should be so directed by him was the crosse ordained therefore a prayer against the crosse must be directed vnto him
but as he to whom christ directed his prayer is his father so in directing of it he doth expresse the behauiour of a childe
the behauiour of a childe is reuerence reuerence is a vertue compounded ex timore amore of feare and loue it is eyther an awfull loue or a louing awe christ expresseth both these affections in his prayer feare in his humiliation for he did prostrate himselfe before his father loue in his compellation for the words are or childelikely affectionate wherein he speaketh to his father
but more distinctly you may obserue in them two excellent points of rhetoricke undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet a sweete insinuation in my father they are melting words and stealingly are able to alter the constancy of a resolute father and an importunate feruency in abba pater or as the syriac father father these are forcing words the redoubling sheweth that hee meant to make his way by spirituall force and breake into the eares and heart of his father by an acceptable violence
so doth hee direct his prayer
but what doth he expresse in it surely veleitatem naturae voluntatem gratiae a wish of nature and will of grace
the wish of nature is against the crosse but the will of grace is for it
more distinctly
the crosse is noted by two words hac hora hic calix this houre this cup which words import the same things onely the houre expresseth the time and vnderstandeth the crosse the cup expresseth the crosse and vnderstandeth the time both containe the determinate passion of christ
and against this determinate suffering is the wish of nature bent it appeareth in those words transeat aufer the cup hasteneth to me let it passe by or if that be not to be hoped because haue vndertaken as a surety yet aufer interpose between it and mee and suffer it not to stay vpon me
this is the wish of nature

but it is a modest wish therefore it commeth in with a si if it be possible
things are possible eyther to gods power or to his will to his power all things are possible that are not contrary to his nature but by his will many things are impossible which otherwise may bee done by his power
so that possible and impossible must be vnderstood in respect of gods will and therefore doth st luke in stead of if it be possible put in

if thou wilt so that christ doth not desire to speed if there be any impediment from gods will

this appeareth more plainly in the will of grace exprest in the last words not what will but what thou wilt wherein you must marke a distinction of wills and a submission of the one to the other
there is a will of god and a will of christ by gods will is meant his decree and by christs will is meant his desire these agree not and therefore there must be an yeelding and as it is meete christ doth here submit his desire vnto the will of god not my will but thine be done
finally compare the wish of nature and the will of grace and marke that the wish is conditionall but the will absolute wee may not presse our desires without this restraint if god will but wee must surrender our selues wholly vnto gods will without any limitation from our owne will
and so haue you such particulars as apprehend in this text will now god willing vnfold them more particularly pray god may doe it effectually also that we may so heare as to learne learne to follow those steps which christ hath trod out before vs
let vs come then to them and begin at the circumstances whereof the first is when christ prayed that circumstance is rather gathered out of the contexture of the chapter than exprest in the text yet may it not be omitted
we must obserue that christ prayed before he suffered and why it was the accomplishment of a ceremony and a prophesie
a ceremony for the leuiticall sacrifices were first consecrated by praier before they were burnt vpon the altar and christ comming to bee the truth of sacrifices did first deuote himselfe vnto god before hee was nailed vnto the crosse
as he did herein accomplish a ceremony so did hee a prophesie also oblatus est quia ipse voluit saith esay hee dyed not of constraint but willingly and this prayer doth testifie that his bloudy suffering was a offering
neither indeede could his death haue beene meritorious for vs if it had not willingly beene vndertaken by him

but the words that christ speaketh as they are a prayer so is that prayer a feeling representation of the crosse whereupon this circumstance will yeeld vs another lesson and that is of religious policie christ put himselfe into an agony before he was rackt vpon the crosse and suffered from himselfe before he suffered from others
why so such a preparation did him against his passion and he vndauntedly tooke downe the draught after he had sowred his mouth with this foretaste of the cup neyther doe we finde after this hee being taken by the iewes crucified by the gentiles that till immediately before he gaue vp the ghost hee shewed any signes of a perplexed man
what wonder if we be leether when calamities ouertake vs and faint in the day of affliction in prosperity we thinke not of aduersity neither doe we by mortification inable our selues to bee more patient of mortalitie
hee that resteth his bones daily vpon a and pampereth his flesh delicately

euery day hee that neuer pincheth his body with fasting nor afflicteth his soule with spirituall sorrow how should he beare hunger thirst nakednesse tortors anguish when god leaueth him to the will of his enemies euils feelingly premeditated doe lesse molest wherefore after the example of christ we must still be ready to meete them and then if they come we shall be lesse distressed with them

you haue heard when christ prayed you must now heare where
as he prayed timely so he prayed priuately in a retired place of the garden of gethsemane the place was a garden that garden was gethsemane and in gethsemane he chose out a retired place euery one of these hath something remarkable in it
the place was a garden there bee many things wherein we may parrallel the first and second adam amongst other things this may goe for one the first fell in a garden and it is in a garden that the second beginneth to suffer in a garden did adam lose gods image and incurre gods displeasure and in a garden christ did sorrow for the losse and tremble at the danger

the place was not only a garden but also the garden of gethsemane and gethsemane was a garden at the foote of mount oliuet set as it seemeth by the name with oliue trees yea and therein was torcular an oliue presse wherewith the oyle was strained out of the oliues for these reasons was it called gethsemane and that is by interpretation vallis pinguium a valley of fat things
behold an excellent embleme of our sauiour christ who is the true oliue spoken of by zacharie cap

by st paul rom
and he hath his name from oyle
yea and what was his crosse but the oliue presse of gethsemane that so strained him the true oliue that his name became oleum effusum cant
and the drops of oyle that streamed from christ haue anael'd many millions of men made christians

christ tooke delight to walke in this garden intimating thereby that it was his delight so to be pressed with the crosse

but there is a third thing which we must marke in this place in gethsemane he withdrew himselfe from his disciples when he gaue himselfe to prayer that he might more freely poure forth his soule vnto god hee retired himselfe from all company of men and indeed retirednesse is most fit for passionate and affectionate prayers
many things may beseeme vs in priuate which in publicke are not fit the teares of the eyes the sobs of our tongues the beating of our breasts the interruptions of our affections the prostration of our persons the villifying of our selues expostulations with god and such like many of these modesty will stifle in company or they may be abused to vaine glory but priuacie taketh away all hope of the one as it giueth vs scope to bee free in the other
therefore christ here by example teacheth that whereof in st matthew cap


he giueth a rule to pray in priuate to pray in our closet
and many holy men haue not only practised

but recorded also their soliloquies and priuate conferences that haue passed betweene god and their soules
but this is not to be abused to the preiudice of the communion of saints or publicke prayers they must be obserued st paul blameth them that neglected the assemblies these priuate deuotions must bee added ouer

and aboue the publicke christ that vsed these did not forbear the other no more must wee

the last thing that will note vpon this cricumstance is that christus separatus est in oratione qui separatus est in passione christ associated none with him in this offertory prayer more than he did in his propitiatory sacrifice or suffering vpon the crosse he bids the disciples pray for themselues he neuer bids them pray for him the glory of the redemption is so wholly his that hee suffered none to haue the least share therein with him
and so haue vnfolded the circumstances vnto you let vs now come to the substance of the prayer
wherein we must first see to whom it is directed

and we finde that the person is the father and indeed he ordained the crosse and therefore there is reason that a prayer concerning the crosse should be made vnto him
iewes and gentiles wicked men and angels had a hand in it but it was but a secondarie hand the primarie was gods they did no more than was determined by him
and god that determined it determined it as a father out of the heart of a father did hee ordaine it and hee did mannage it with a fathers hand
had god beene as bowellesse as adam was gracelesse the fall of man had beene as desperate as was the fall of angels but god forgat not to be a father when adam forgat to be a childe therefore out of his fatherly affection did he prouide this recouerie of his lost childe he prouided that his only begotten sonne should dye that his adopted sonnes might liue
neyther did he only ordaine it out of a fathers heart but mannaged it also with a fathers hand he included nothing in the ransome of the adopted sonnes that tended not to the glory of the onely begotten sonne neyther was christ euer so handled by god as that god did not shew himselfe a father vnto christ
we haue our afflictions and happely we acknowledge they come from god but that is not enough the heathen did so much as many as acknowledge diuine prouidence acknowledge that from it commeth light and darkenesse peace and warre prosperity and aduersity
but our afflictions haue this proper name of the crosse and when wee enquire after the authour of them we must behold god in the person of a father with this title must we sweeten his sowre prouidence
are wee left to the will of our enemies yet he that holdeth the bridle is a father and they can doe no more than he will permit yea to him belong the issues of death and he will suffer no child to be tempted aboue his strength
doth god chastise vs himselfe as what childe is there whom the father chastiseth not and by chastisement shewes that hee taketh him not for a bastard but for a sonne then paululum supplieij satis est patri his mercy will reioyce ouer his iudgement

he couenanted so with dauid in the old testament and in the new testament he warranteth as much by paul
wherefore whensoeuer wee pray against the crosse let vs not forget to pray vnto god as our father

as we must put vpon god the person of a father when we pray to him so must wee not come to him but with the behauiour of a childe certainly

christ did not
the behauiour of a childe is reuerence and reuerence is a vertue compounded ex timore amore of awe and loue christ expressed both these affections his awe in an humiliation and in a compellation his loue

his humiliation was the prostrating of his bodie he fell vpon the earth saith my text st luke he fell vpon his knees st matthew he fell vpon his face all agree that he was humble very humble humilitatem mentis habitu carnis ostendit the posture of his body made sensible the lowlinesse of his soule
the distance betweene the creatour and the creature is so great that it may well beseeme the most glorious angell in heauen to fall downe low before his footestoole certainely the

elders cast downe not onely their crownes but themselues also before his throne where they attend
and if the distance of a creature from his creatour call for such behauiour what behauiour must a sinner vse when he appeareth before his iudge what humiliation of body must true contrition of heart expresse must we not shew that we are vnworthy to looke to heauen most worthy to bee reputed no better than vilenesse the sonne of god in the forme of man had but sinne imputed and yet we see here how thereupon he is humbled and how then should we villifie our selues in whom sinne is inherent we alwaies owe lowlinesse but wee should striue to intend it most when wee haue most neede to deprecate gods wrath the greater need wee haue of mercie the more shew should wee make of our humilitie
how doth this checke the stiffenesse of our knees the loftinesse of our lookes the inflexiblenesse of our bodies if we be richer if we be greater than others we thinke we may be more familiar shall say nay more vnmannerly before god wee thinke wee should haue lesse sense of our sinne because we haue in worldly things outstript our neighbours
and yet if you obserue you shall finde that none are more ambitious after caps and knees and more moody if they bee disregarded than they that regard god least and are least respectiue of his maiestie
what shall say then to you imitemur ducem nostrum let vs thinke christs practice worth the imitation let not seruants sticke at that which is done by the sonne let vs not bee ashamed to doe for our selues that which christ hath done not onely before vs but for vs also when we pray let vs pray most humbly

the second part of reuerence is loue and that appeareth in the compellation my father abba father
but told you that we were therin distinctly to obserue undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet in my father so st matthew deliuereth christs words and they are a sweete insinuation they serue stealingly to melt the affection of a father
as a father pitieth his childe saith the psalmist psal
seuen so doth the lord pity them that feare him esay goeth farther cap

can a woman forget her sucking childe that shee should not haue compassion on the sonne of her wombe yea she may forget yet will not forget thee our sauiour christ enlargeth this comparison if you being euill know how to giue good gifts vnto your children how much more shall your heauenly father giue good gifts to them that aske him mat
so then where there is a father there are bowels on earth commonly

in heauen vndoubtedly

what then st ambrose spake of the like words vttered by isaac to his father abraham when abraham went about to sacrifice isaac a liuely type of this entercourse betweene god and christ in the matter of the crosse may well apply to this compellation of god pulsatur pietatis vocabulis these bee words that will try his bowels whether they be tender or no he giueth a good reason nomina vita solent operari gratiam non ministerium necis what stronger motiue to obtaine grace than for a childe by mentioning the word father to put him in minde that he was the author of his life for can he be so hard hearted as to further the abolishing thereof by death st chrysostome weighing the very same words as they were vttered by isaac pronounceth of them sufficiebat hoc verbum ad lancinanda iusti viscera abraham could not digest the words but hee must offer violence vnto his owne bowels
how powerfull then must christs words be with god if nature required that abraham should be so moued with them when they were spoken by isaac certainly if my father preuaile not know not what compellation will worke in the bowels of god
and yet here you must obserue that as isaacs my father remoued not abraham from his faithfull obedience no more did christs my father alter gods determinate course for the redemption of man his loue vnto vs made him seem to be bowellesse towards his owne sonne at so much the higher rate therefore are wee to value our redemption

as there is undefined span alphabet in the compellation so there is undefined span alphabet also besides the sweete insinuation christ expresseth a feruent importunity abba pater as the greeke as the syriac father father
the greeke expresseth the language of the iew and the language of the gentile to signifie that god by christs crosse was to become the father as well of the gentile as of the iew

but the syriac doubleth the same word while christ was in his agonie saith st luke he prayed undefined span alphabet more earnestly

st paul hebr
tels vs that christ offered vp prayers and supplications with strong crying and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death
and the passion psalmes how full of this zeale are they

and how do they as it were force a way by gods eares vnto his heart certainly god doth not loue cold prayers that biddeth vs aske seeke knocke in the parable of the vniust iudge christ teacheth vs this duty and the canaanitish woman is a good example of such acceptable importunity but beyond all this practice of our sauiour christ for what can bee added vnto his compellation surely nothing and yet it is little that so much religious rhetoricke doth worke
and what doe wee learne herehence euen this that though in praying we doe our best yet we must not looke to speede alwayes neither must it grieue vs seeing christ was contented to take a repulse god will haue vs entreate him with the best of our deuotion but the successe thereof he will haue vs leaue to his disposition wherein commend no more vnto you than find done by christ as now you are to heare in the following part of my text

hauing shewed you sufficiently to whom christ directeth his prayer

will now shew vnto you what he expresseth therein hee expresseth the wish of nature and the will of grace

the wish of nature is against the crosse the crosse is exprest by two words haec hora and hic calix this houre this cup the houre noteth the time prefixed for christs suffering as that which christ was to suffer is vnderstood by the cup yet so that the cup includeth the houre and the houre the cup
but to handle them distinctly haec hora is an ellipticall phrase you may supply it out of the third of the reuelation where it is called undefined span alphabet the houre of temptation
and indeede the crosse put christ to it it tryed him to the vttermost therefore well may it bee called haec hora more than an ordinary houre for it was a most wofull time
but this word hath two additions elsewhere for sometimes wee reade hora mea my houre luke
sometimes hora vestra your houre iohn
it was a time wherein christ was to be a patient in that respect doth he call it his houre and the wicked were to be agents in that respect hee calleth it their houre each of them were to act their parts and for that they had this time assigned them
but we must ascend aboue them both euen vnto god who as he is gouernour of the world keepeth times and seasons in his owne power so that nothing is either suffered or done but in the time which he hath prefixed
and if it be true of all times then specially of most remarkable times such as was the time of christs passion which being fixed neither himselfe did preuent neither could it be preuented by others christ doth more than once alledge for a reason why the malice and craft of his enemies tooke not place but that maugre all their endeauours he went on in his ministry hora mea nondum venit the houre of the crosse was not yet come
put houre and crosse together and then this word will yeeld another note which is that though the time of the crosse be bitter yet it is but short the story of the gospell shewes that it was quickly past ouer within the space of a day was all the bitternesse thereof ouercome
and as the crosse of christ so that of christians is not lasting st paul calleth them momentany afflictions
cor
king dauid telleth vs that heauinesse may endure for a night but ioy will come in the morning psal
and that the rod of the wicked shall not rest vpon the lot of the righteous psal
but enough of the time wee shall insist longer vpon the cup and therein behold the nature of the crosse

here then are two words calix and iste a cup and this cup
touching the cup will not trouble you with the diuers coniectures concerning the originall of this phrase will deliuer that which is fairely grounded on the scripture

obserue then that gods wrath is compared to a winepresse and the effects of that wrath vnto the wine strained out in the psalme it is called red wine elsewhere deadly wine wine that is able to make men drunke sicke mad not corporally but mentally it surchargeth their wits and bereaueth them of all heart that drinke it
this wine of gods wrath is meant by the cup
but it noteth withall that as calamities come from god so hee apportions to euery man his part hee giueth

him to drinke as much as hee thinketh fit
of this cup you may reade in the
of ieremy where the prophet is willed to send it from nation to nation and the contents of each of their cups or rather draughts out of the cup are foretold by that prophet and by others in whom wee read their seuerall desolations
but wee haue not now to doe with the cup in generall but with this cup the cup whereof christ was to drinke which was indeede an extraordinary cup you will confesse it if doe but touch at the quantity and quality of the liquor
touching the quantity the fathers obserue two kindes of ingredients the principall and the accessory
the principall are malum culpae and malum poenae sinne and woe the sinne of adam a ranke roote from whence haue sprung many branches all full laden with euill fruit and that of diuers kindes of diuers growths
these sinnes with their plenty and variety take vp a great roome in the cup
and what sinne doth not fill woe may for woe is the inseparable companion of sinne god is offended with it and if god be offended then must the sinner looke to bee afflicted the affliction due vnto vs is in one word called death death temporall death eternall the seuering of the soule from the body of both from god and if from god then no lesse from blisse than from grace
to say nothing of the harbingers of corporall death that set forward our mortality and the companions of spirituall death that aggrauate our misery
all these ingredients being put into the cup if yet any thing be wanting the accessories added vnto these principals will make full measure will mention onely two the treason of iudas and the vnnaturalnesse of the iewes
of iudas there is a passionate complaint in one of the psalmes where he is typed out in achitophel had it beene anenemy that had done me this wrong could haue borne it but it was thou mysamiliar friend with whom did eate of whom tooke counsell
it is a miserable thing to be betrayed but most miserable to bee betrayed by a friend a lord by his seruant a master by his disciple christ by an apostle
put this then into the cup
and besides this the vnnaturalnesse of the iewes

they were christs kindred according to the flesh and christ did vouchsafe to be the minister of the circumcision he preached his sermons to them and amongst them did he work his miracles he termed all the world but dogs in comparison of them and to seeke them whom hee compareth to lost sheepe hee was contonted to come downe from heauen
and see how they reward his kindnesse nothing will satisfie them but his bloud and that spilt in the most painfull in the most shamefull fashion
and as if that were not enough they make a blasphemous and desperate prayer that the guilt of it might cleaue to them and theirs certainly this addeth not a little to the cuppe
by this time thinke we haue measured out a very large draught neither is it possible to conceiue a larger

but as the draught is great in regard of the quantity so in regard of the qualitie it was very bitter we must then obserue that this wine of gods wrath is eyther merum or dilutum sheere or allayed
others that in this world haue had their cups haue had them more or lesse allayed neuer

was any mans crosse without some comfort if he were afflicted in soule hee had some ease in bodie if his honour failed yet his wealth abode or if both failed yet he found some friend to pitie him at lest he had some refreshing of meat or sleepe some way or other was his torture mitigated neuer did any man in this world drinke of this red wine vnmixt but our sauiour christ comfort from without hee had none for all forsooke him and he had as little in himselfe his body was tortured from top to toe by the iewes and his soule was exagitated by the fiends of hell as for his godhead though the hypostaticall vnion was not dissolued yet was the comfortable influence thereof into the manhood suspended for a time
by all this put together wee may conclude that it was vinum merum there was no allay of that bitternesse that was put into the cup though it were poured in in great abundance
adde hereunto that christ was not ignorant nor insensible of this great and bitter cup not to know what we are to doe not to haue sense to feele what we doe is such stupiditie as may not be moued with such a cup but if the eye of the vnderstanding be cleere to behold it and the heart be tender to feele it then will it moue with a witnesse
now none euer matched our sauiour christ in sapientia charitate in a piercing iudgement and a feeling nature and therefore the deeper impression did the apprehension of this cup make in him haue a baptisme saith he luke
wherewith must be baptized quomodo coarctor and how am grieued vntill it be past but the euangelists doe open his sense thereof more distinctly they shew how it affected his head vpon the foretaste he beganne undefined span alphabet to bee amazed how it affected his heart he began undefined span alphabet to droope to faint how it affected all his soule undefined span alphabet it was all ouercast with a heauinesse to death finally how it affected his body it made it sweat great drops of blood
put these together and you haue a faire commentary vpon that one word wherewith luke doth expresse christs sense calling it undefined span alphabet an agonie or a sharpe conflict

and indeed wee must confesse that there was much extraordinary in christs crosse and that it was such a draught as none could take but he
and by this wee must obserue in the cup and christs sense thereof first that god would haue copiosam redemptionem not onely in regard of the person suffering which was both god and man and therefore could to a little suffering adde an infinite worth but also in regard of the sufferings themselues which god would haue to be as great as the person of christ was capable of
and he would not haue it seeme strange vnto vs if we be put to a fiery tryall seeing god was pleased so farre to exercise the patience of his owne deare sonne after his example we must be contented to take not only calicem but calicem hune to drinke not only of a cup but of a very bitter cup also as many in the primitiue church and later ages haue done
secondly in the liuelinesse of christs sense wee are taught quanti steterit salus nostra with how great heauinesse and horror christ vndertooke and went through the redemption of our soules the more he felt of that the more are wee indebted to his loue and should detest our sinne yea wee must learne of christs sorrow to sorrow our

selues for our selues and by his heauinesse how to bee heauie when we haue offended god
but enough of the crosse

let vs come now to the wish of nature
it is exprest in two words transeat aufer let it passe take it away
the words import that the cup was making towards him and indeed the word houre sheweth that this was the time of taking it now death the reward of sinne temporall death fast clasped with eternall came to require due satisfaction to bee made to god
christ doth not denie that this is iust therefore let it goe on but yet transeat let it goe besides me let not me be the partie on whom it seizeth
but how can that bee seeing christ stood out as the surety of mankinde the execution must come out vpon him that hath vndertaken the debt if then god let his iudgements ire goe forth certainely they will not transire passe by the person of christ for they are right arming thunderbolts as the wiseman calleth them
therefore christ addeth a second word aufer though of themselues they would seize on me yet be thou pleased to take them from me let thy hand stay them which will not stay themselues

but to leaue the words and come to the things that are obseruable in the wish
it is an inborne principle of nature for euery liuing thing to desire his preseruation and abhor destruction but this principle should be more liuing in the sonnes of men who know that god made not death

and that it is the wages of sinne

because it is vnnaturall because it is penall it may bee feared it must bee deprecated we put off nature if our nature bee not so affected
especially if it be calix iste such a cup as christs an extraordinary cup wee may not only deprecate it but ingeminate our deprecation as christ three times prayed the same words and st paul did the like against the buffettings of sathan
but we must marke that though all things were foreseene by christ and resolued vpon yet it pleased god that hee should permit euery power of his soule to doe and suffer what was naturall vnto it

and thereby declare vnto the world that he was a true man

yea st ambrose and st bernard obserue that it was much more glorious for christ to doe so than to haue done the contrarie that not only the passion of his bodie but the affection of his heart also might make for vs that whom his death quickned them his trembling might confirme his heauinesse glad his drooping cheere and his disquiet set at rest
theophylact obserueth that christs wish is a good warning to vs that wee doe not cast our selues into temptation

st cyprian giueth the reason quis non timeat si timet ille quem omnia timent he prefaceth his words with a passionate meditation and they are foolishly hardy that presume of more than is exprest in the wish of christ
and the wish is not onely admonitory but consolatorie also
it is no small comfort that it is lawful for vs to expresse our wishes though they be contrary to gods will yea his knowne will for so was christs
the more rigid is their diuinity that are so zealous for grace that they abolish nature and will haue a christian man forget to be a man

but though this wish may be common to christ and vs yet is there as great difference betweene it as it riseth in vs and as it rose in him
it rose

in him neuer but according to the prescript of reason his reason was neuer preuented by his affection sicut quando voluit factus est homo as he was not incarnate but when hee was willing so onely when hee was willing did his affections stirre within him nihil coactum in christo

the obiects could not worke his affections but when he saw it fit therefore shall you reade in the gospell that christ troubled himselfe when he groaned in spirit iohn
but as for our affections they our discretion and wee are transported with them before we are aduised which maketh vs retract them with our after wits
secondly christs affections when they stirred neuer passed those bounds which were set them by reason but ours will not so be bridled seldome are we moued but we eyther ouer reach or come short of that which wee ought to doe
therefore our affections and christs are fitly resembled to two vials of cleane water whereof the one hath a muddy residence the other hath no residence at all stirre the water that is in the viall without residence and though you trouble it yet you shall not see any foulenesse in it but no sooner is that viall that had the residence stirred but the mudde mingleth with the water euen so our affections are tainted with concupiscence from which conception by the holy ghost did free our sauiour christ
you haue heard the wish of nature and heard how it is bent against the crosse

but there is one point which may not be omitted christs modesty in expressing this for it is but a conditionall wish christ limiteth it with if if it possible let this cup passe
things are possible eyther onely to gods power or also to his will
all things are possible to gods power that are not contrary to his nature for he is undefined span alphabet and all things are his host they subsist in him and therefore haue their strength from his influence
adde hereunto that in this very case god could absolutely forgiue all sinnes and abolish hell being an absolute lord
but gods power is moderated by his will and when the will hath set downe a resolution then the contrary is impossible not simply but because god cannot vary his iudgement
so that here commeth in a second distinction of possible and impossible in regard of gods will
now christ doth not put in the condition in regard of gods absolute power but in regard of his limitted therefore in st luke he saith if thou wilt as if he did not desire it if gods will were against it if his will made it impossible to his power
so then christ doubteth not gods power but acknowledgeth that it is gouerned by his will
this maxime if it were well heeded would determine many differences betweene vs and the church of rome who talke much of possible by gods power when we speake onely of possible according to gods will in the argument of transubstantiation
but will not fall into a controuersie
out of all that you haue heard putting the condition to the desire you may gather that the voyce of nature is but veleitas a wish though a reasonable wish for oratio est rationalis actio christ could not conceiue his wish in a prayer and not guide his prayer by reason the of the crosse did not so farre ouerwhelme him as that he knew not well what was vttered by him
though later diuines as well popish as our owne

so amplifie christs agonie that they seeme to conceiue otherwise yet seeing they doe absolutely free christ from sinne they may not in charity be thought to detract any thing from the reasonable aduisednesse of christ in speaking these words christ was free in vttering the lawfull voyce of nature but lower he did not goe yea when he came thither he soared higher and in the will of grace surmounted the wish of nature

god is pleased that christian men should be men but being men hee will haue them christians also he doth not deny vs the wishes of men but he will haue vs also haue the will of angells
the schooles distinguish between the superiour and inferiour reason not but that reason is one and the same but the obiects are not the same whereabouts reason is conuersant there are some that are called rationes humanae such motiues as are presented by the nature of man some are called rationes diuinae such motiues as are offered vnto vs from god
reason may bee an aduocate for both so that in fauour of the lesser it doe not preiudice the greater and in this discretion consists the will of grace

but more particularly wee must obserue here a distinction of wils and a submission of the inferiour to the superiour
first for the distinction
the will of god is his decree the will of man is his desire
gods decree must open a little farther as for mans desire neede not open it you haue heard enough in the wish of nature
gods decree then is in the acts called undefined span alphabet

a determinate will he doth nothing in time which before time he hath not determined especially in this great work of mans redemption hee decreed how sinne should bee expiated and himselfe pacified how the powers of darknesse should bee conquered and man restored how mercy and iustice should meete together all this commeth vnder the name of gods will
see then how hee doth cloath the crosse with this sweete word thy will not so much attentiue to his owne paine as to gods good pleasure

the wills being thus discerned wee must now see how christ doth submit his will vnto his fathers not my will but thine be done
wherein you must first obserue that christ doth not desire death propter se sed propter aliud not for it selfe as if there were any thing desirable in it but onely to obey his fathers will
secondly that to obey it he doth deny himselfe his owne life is not deare vnto him so hee may doe his fathers will
iohn
shall not drinke the cup saith he to peter which my father hath giuen mee and elsewhere iohn
father saue mee from this houre yet therefore did come came to do not mine own will but his that sent mee ioh
and indeed to haue a will subiect to none is the property of god men must imitate the planets that go not their own motions otherwise than they are permitted per primum mobile so should all the motions of our soule conforme themselues to the good pleasure of god
christ in the lords prayer teacheth this by rule but here hee teacheth it by example
we should be guided by the rule and our neglect is inexcusable if we doe not follow it but our contempt is intolerable if wee be not moued by the example si filius obediuit vt faceret voluntatem patris

quantò magis seruus

saith st cyprian it is intolerable insolencie for a seruant to be when a childe doth bend to the will of his father for man to bee headstrong when christ is so pliable
intolerable insolency did say nay grosse folly

for vel eo nobis bene optamus cum dicimus fiat voluntas tua quòd nihil sit melius voluntate diuinâ wee cannot wish better vnto our selues than to submit our selues vnto gods will for that there is no hurt that can be expected from his will no not when he doth correct vs or lay the crosse vpon vs for christs crosse on earth brought him to the throne of heauen and our afflictions are not worthy of the glory that shall be reuealed vpon vs
but from our owne will we can expect no good it can reach no farther than our vnderstanding which is but blinde and oftentimes it is ouerthwart when that seeth right
and therefore as it is happy for the children of men that being of weake iudgements and of weaker affections haue parents to whose direction and correction they are obedient for their owne good euen so should the children of god thinke themselues happy that they haue a father in heauen that ordereth them better than they can order themselues to whom if they submit themselues they are sure they shall not miscarry
but durus est hic sermo it is hard to worke this lesson into flesh and bloud into the voluptuous into the couetous into the ambitious into the prophane it is hard to make any wicked man to take this bridle christ had so reuerent a respect vnto the sacred will of god that he endured the sharpest of paines to fulfill gods commands but so insolent so foolish are the most of men that they will haue their owne wils satisfie their owne lusts and rather than faile thereof they will breake gods bonds and cast his cords from them
and what cup can be bitter enough to purge such peccant humours

the last note that gaue vpon the text is the comparison betweene the wish and the will whereof told you the one was conditionall the other absolute the one is but as it were a deliberation the other a resolution
and indeed that difference we must hold when our wishes and gods decrees are different neuer to present our desires but with a condition but to take heed of capitulating with god for that were to giue law vnto the which should not be attempted and will not be endured

but it is time to end

christ saith austin being in the forme of a seruant might haue conceiued this prayer in silence but it a se voluit patri exhibere peccatorem vt meminisset se nostrum esse doctorem he would so performe his deuotion as might make best for our instruction
and saint chrysostome noteth herein an extraordinary instruction sublimem admirabilis philosophiae virtutem docet etiam natur abhorrente renuente deum sequendum it is an high straine of christian vertue that is taught vs in this patterne of christ so farre to be masters of our naturall affections that will they nil they we will doe what god doth bid vs st cyprian telleth ys that we are not onely taught by christ what to doe but how namely to imitate christs offertory prayer prostrating our selues humbly inuocating our father reuerently and not presenting our desires otherwise

than conditionally if we take this course we shall conclude with an absolute submission vnto the will of god

certainly st bernard thought so for hee meditateth thus vpon my text noniam despero domine lord am not out of heart now be my case neuer so bad let my tribulation be irkesome vnto me and let me haue a comardly heart by nature let me be forward when petition with transeat let this cup passe take from mee haue learned of thee to betake my selfe not to a carnall but an heauenly comfort not my will but thy will be done will hold in all murmuring and hearten all fainting of my soule
these words then are exemplary words they informe vs what christ did to direct vs what we must doe christs example is without exception because hee was without sinne and is of good vse for vs because we may fall into the like case
the like say but not the same we may fall though not into a propitiatory yet into a probatory suffering
it is sacriledge to affect the one the other is common to the whole church
when we fall into it if we take christ for our patterne we shall finde him our patron also we shall finde that his draught hath left little bitternesse in ours and that which is left is much allayed
when christ made this prayer an angell from heauen comforted him and if wee conceiue the like prayers the spirit of christ will not faile to be a comforter to vs onely let vs ex non volito make volitum giue the vpper hand to grace aboue nature and we shall finde much ioy in affliction which will be vnto vs the pledge of a greater ioy which after our affliction wee shall enioy in the kingdome of heauen
this grace he giue vnto vs that in this practice hath gone before vs that as his so by his our patient obedience may open vs a way vnto a blessed inheritance

a sermon preached at st peters in oxford vpon easter day epigraph

cor
christ is risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept

and these words are a part of that first hymne wherewith wee solemnize this feast yea they containe a good and full commentary vpon this dayes employment
for this day is spent in historia prophetia we therein renue christs and foretaste our owne resurrection that in the seruice and this in the sacrament
these two resurrections are inseparable therefore st paul willing to assure vs of the later doth first establish the doctrine of the former and he doth it by witnesses and by reasons
by witnesses because a matter of fact and by reasons because this fact is an article of faith
for articles of faith are not only credenda but also credibilia though before they are reuealed we cannot diuine at them yet being reuealed we may argue fairely for them many times out of nature but out of scripture alwaies
the reasons here yeelded by the apostle are of two sorts the first collects the absurdities that presse all the second those conueniences that must bee acknowledged by true beleeuers
this scripture in the midst of these reasons and is compounded of the conclusion of the former and foundation of the later
the refutation of the absurdities warrants this truth christ is risen from the dead and the proofe of the conueniences relyes vpon this ground christ is become the first fruits of them that slept

the resurrection then from the dead is the maine point of this text and the text doth occasion vs to consider
what it is then how applyed
what it is we cannot be ignorant if we know the termes wherein it is exprest these two termes dead and resurrection
but when we haue found

them wee must discreetly apply them for they haue different subiects christ and those that slept they belong to both but vnto those by him for he is their first fruits

these be the contents of this scripture and of these shall by gods assistance and your christian audience now speake briefly and in their order

and first of the termes death and resurrection
these termes are opposite therefore by the one wee must bee led to know the other and because death is first in nature beginne at that
all death if it bee antecedent to the resurre&ion is eyther in sinne or for sinne death in sinne is undefined span alphabet

as nyssen defines it an inabilitie to doe good because we haue lost communion with god
but communion with god simply wee cannot lose and be for without him nothing can subsist
it is then communion in that which is his supreme perfection in wisedome and in holinesse the soule that is destitute of these that soule is dead for it can neyther taste nor see how good the lord is whom notwithstanding so to know is euerlasting life and if it be so senslesse it must needes be liuelesse it is dead in sinne

but as there is death in sinne so is there also for sinne and this is double eyther only the dissolution of soule and body or else a penall condition that followeth thereupon
touching the dissolution we must marke that as we exceed a proportion stinted vnto vs in the vse of the creatures so they disproportion the harmonie of our bodies that are guiltie of this abuse and god doth in the end separate vs from them because wee for them separated our selues from god
and this death we call the giuing vp of the ghost
but after these parts are dissolued there should seize on eyther of them a penall condition on the body for the graue is not only sheol but also shacath it doth not onely couetously swallow but digest it also verè undefined span alphabet therein death gnaweth vpon this undefined span alphabet this rotten mouldring house this earthly tabernacle of ours
the reason of it is because sinne is inherent and this leprous house cannot be purged except it be dissolued dust it is and to dust it must returne againe
this is the penall condition of our body
and as corruption seazeth on our body so should torments on the soule there is a worme to bite it a fire to scorch it vtter darkenesse to distresse it finally fiends that execute gods vengeance on it being exiled from the ioyes of heauen whereunto it was created and adiudged to the paines of hell which it hath deserued
this is the penall condition of the soule
of these two penall conditions consists the second death for sinne

by that which you haue heard concerning death you may easily ghesse what is resurrection it is nothing but a recouerie from death for this is an infallible principle what riseth that dyed
resurrection then is as manifold as death to the double death the scripture opposeth a double resurrection
the first resurrection is from death in sinne and it is undefined span alphabet

when grace quickens the soule and the soule is transformed

formed into the image of god the image of being and doing good which the scripture cals the life of god and the partakers thereof new men
the second resurrection is from death for sin whether it be the dissolution or the penall condition
whatsoeuer the heathen thought it is plaine that after the dissolution there is an habitude in the soule towards the body and a naturall desire againe to inhabit it yea it doth undefined span alphabet as it were trauaile with that appetite appetitus non est frustra

such a desire is an euidence of gods purpose the soule shall againe bee to the body

but to bee free from the dissolution is not the vttermost of mans desire he desires also to be free from the penall condition non est viuere sed valere vita better these parts neuer meete than not meete to their mutuall comfort and therefore the last branch of the resurrection is the endlesse vnion of body and soule in beatitudine plenâ securâ in qua nihil concupiscet nihil metuet so throughly so vnchangeably blessed that they shall haue their hearts desire and bee free from all feare of euill
insist no longer hereon because this point must be resumed againe
let vs come on then and apply what hath beene said to the different subiects
and here first wee must take for our guide a receiued rule talia sunt praedicata qualia permittuntur esse subiectis suis
death and resurrection must be limited differently according to their different subiects
and the first subiect is christ
death in sinne would not agree with him it will not stand with the grace of his holy vnction much lesse of his personall vnion he was the holy one of god luke
yea the holy of holies dan

adde hereunto that a sinner implies a contradiction to a mediatour neyther can they both consist in one for such a high priest it behoued vs to haue that was holy harmelesse vndefiled separate from sinners hebr
therefore could he not dye that death

as he could not dye the death in sinne no more could hee vndergoe all the death for sinne hee could not vndergoe either part of the penall condition
not that of the graue his body saw no corruption and why though it had sinne imputed yet had it none inherent and it is only sinne inherent that subiects vs to that part of death
and if his body were free from corruption much more was his soule from torment it left the body to take possession of heauen purchased and hell conquered vpon the crosse therein his meritorious power after conflict brake the knot wherewith the dissolution of body and soule came fast clasped with the penall condition and this he proclaimed in his last speech iohn
consummatumest the passion is now at a full end
there remaines then no part of death for christ to suffer but onely the dissolution the separation of his soule and body and to that he yeelded himselfe as an offerer that could not be inforced as a sufferer when hee had triumphed ouer principalities and powers the fiends of hell and shewed his murdering crucifiers by the supernaturall and eclipse how hee could rescue himselfe from death he laid downe his life in testimony of

his loue to vs and presented that sacrifice of a sweete smell to god which only was able to redeeme vs

this being the limitation of his death the limitation of his resurrection must needes be answerable it must be restrained to the of his body and soule

and it is no more in effect than quod potestate diuisit potestate copulauit with what power he laid downe his life with the same he tooke it againe
though the soule were seuered from the body yet was the from neither the hypostaticall vnion persisted still his body continued vitae sacrarium

he declared himselfe mightily to be the sonne of god by the resurrection from the dead

but farther to open the resurrection of christ
these words seeme to be a bare assertion and indeed a bare assertion vttered by them that are witnesses undefined span alphabet and therefore undefined span alphabet were enough to warrant an article of faith
but the words imply a manifold proofe and the proofe lyes in the word christ

for christ signifieth annointed annointed as the scripture speakes with the holy ghost and with power
this vnction is with grace and that eyther gratis data or gratum faciens of edification or adoption
the grace of edification designed christ to a threefold office to be a prophet a priest and a king and euery one of these implies a proofe of his resurrection

his prophesie for his resurrection was a principall argument of that whether you looke vpon the types prefiguring or the words foretelling it he was to make both good or else his prophesie were liable to exception
as the prophesie so the priesthood inforceth the resurrection how could it appeare that the obligation was cancelled the law fulfilled god pacified sinne purged if hee had not risen from the dead what had become of his merit finally how could his kingdome subsist without this resurrection when could he haue receiued the keyes of death and of hell made all knees bowe to him in heauen earth and vnder the earth been inuested with absolute power if hee had not risen from the dead
he had neuer been honoured as a king
the grace then of edification argues his resurrection
and so doth the grace of adoption also yea that former proues onely the undefined span alphabet but this the undefined span alphabet thereof that resolues strongly that it must be so but this why it must so be for the resurrection is not debitum carnis but sanctitatis it cannot be challenged by flesh but by holy flesh god will not suffer his holy one to see corruption psal
the prince of this world came and had nothing in christ iohn
therefore it was impossible that he should be detained of the sorrowes of death holinesse and happinesse are inseparable as in god so in christ the latter may undefined span alphabet bee for a time suspended but because of the former they could not be long seuered

but the name of christ doth not onely note the truth but the condition also of his resurrection for it must bee such a resurrection as doth answer his double vnction
first that of edification for it must answer the prophesies bruise the serpents head gen
be the death of death osea
yea by death ouercome him that had the power of death which is the diuell

hebr
it did so for he led captiuity captiue ephes

it must answer the priesthood there must neede no more sacrifice for sinne with that which he hath offered he must enter heauen and finde eternall redemption he did so for hee sits at the right hand of god for euer to make intercession for vs finally it must answer his kingdome and he must raigne as lord of lords he must haue the key of dauid shut and no man open open and no man shut
he doth so in that state he walketh in the midst of the golden candlestickes reuel

cap

these bee things wherein his resurrection is answerable to his first vnction

but it must also be answerable to his second
though we haue known christ after the flesh yet we must now know him so no more all mortalitie and misery did end at his resurrection for undefined span alphabet

was not onely undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet rursum sursum he not onely rose againe but rose to an heauenly life he brought to light life and immortality

id quod fuit in id quod non fuit surrexit nec amisit originem sed profecit in honorem the same body arose but not in the same state hee retained his nature but added glory to it the lord shewed him the path of life

in whose presence there is fulnesse of ioy and at whose right hand there are pleasures for euermore
therefore when he did eate and drinke after he rose and retaine the prints of the nailes wherewith hee was crucified all this was but dispensatio as the fathers well obserue it serued onely to settle the apostles faith as also did the concealing of his glory when he appeared vnto them
but to conclude this point non magnum est credere quia christus mortuus est saith st austin it is not hard to beleeue that christ dyed the gentiles and iewes plotters and actors of his death doe boastingly report it sed fides christianorum est resurrectio christi christians goe beyond them when they beleeue that christ is risen and risen so
the priests bribed the souldiers to deny it

the heathen abolished the sepulchre that gaue testimony of it the diuell raised vp euen in the apostles dayes heretickes to oppose it but maugre all this truth stands christ is risen from the dead
and thus much of the first subiect

come now to the second that is noted by dormientes those that slept which is equiualent to mortui and as manifold in sinne for sinne as it is vnderstood spiritually of the soule and body
need not put you in mind that the tense is no limitation of the subiect for in generall arguments the holy ghost indifferently vseth all tenses because all times are as one in god he giueth vs to vnderstand so much in his word
but to come to the matter
marke a suddaine change while hee spake of christ he vseth the word dead no sooner hath hee taught that christ is risen but he changeth the dead into sleepers

surely then christs resurrection made a powerfull alteration it turned death into sleepe

and therefore mos christianus obtinet saith bede it is vsuall in the christian dialect in acknowledgement that we beleeue the resurrection to call the dead sleepers hence are the places of sepulture called undefined span alphabet dorters

but are dormientes all or some surely the word will reach all mankinde

and the scripture applyes it indifferently vnto all take one place for many dan

many of those that sleepe in the dust shall awake which words compared to the like iohn
appeare to bee a description of the generall resurrection
the death then of all is but a sleepe

but wee must not mistake this fauours not undefined span alphabet it cast not the soule but the body into a sleepe and makes the receptacle thereof not of the soule to bee but a temporarie habitation
the sadducees of all ages thinke otherwise because they would haue it so you may read their dreames in the booke of the preacher and of wisedome together with the refutation of them will say no more to them but what this word warrants me undefined span alphabet there is none though undefined span alphabet there bee their soules and bodies are to continue by gods ordinance immortally mortall and god will vnite them againe neyther part shall cease to bee because neyther part shall cease to suffer
the body shall not as the suggestions and actions of sinne were ministred and acted by it so the vengeance of sinne shall be endured therein
and for the soule it is disquieted euen with the sleepe of the body while that rots the soule forecasts what racks what tortures are prepared for it and this hath it for an accessorie to its owne paine
sleepe then in this sense belongs to the wicked
but in my text by those that slept are meant the faithfull
it is of them onely that this chapter intreats

of those that sleepe in christ their death is compared vnto a quiet a sweet sleepe because whereas in this life they are subiect to the crosse impos'd or voluntary mortification in death they rest from their labours and sleepe without any terrours of euill so that this word doth encourage them to dye for who would be troubled when he is called to lay his wearied bones at rest but as the word hath that encouragement so hath it a better also and which doth comfort more
for notwithstanding the rest expected yet the parting of soule and bodie is irkesome the rather because we see that this sweet companion our body must vndergoe so different a condition from the soule the soule goeth to abrahams bosome there to be feasted with the foode of angels but the body must turne to dust and become the foode of wormes
and who can endure this surely he that remembers that it is but for a moment the body doth but sleepe it shall awake againe and awake to be of the same condition with the soule for so much we are taught in the next word which is primitiae first fruits aequiualent to the resurrection a phrase well befitting the season

to vnderstand it we must obserue that in the law there were two kinds of first fruits one generall consisting of the first of all the holy lands increase

and those might bee offered at any time of the yeare another speciall that was restraind to certaine seasons easter and whitsontide
the first season was easter day for the passouer was slain vpon good friday the day whereon christ dyed the next was to bee a holy conuocation wherein christ continued in the graue and the day following was the sheaff of first fruits to be presented to the lord and that was the first day of the weake the very day wherein christ rose from the dead
so that this word primitiae is vere significant and shewes how the truth did answer

the type christs resurrection was meant by that first fruits

hauing found the originall of the phrase let vs now rip it vp and inquire into the meaning of it and then we shall finde that it intimates two things christs prerogatiue and our communion
first of christs prerogatiue
though the resurrection belong to christ and them that slept yet first to christ first dignitate causatione some adde tempore also but leaue it to bee disputed by the learned that may passe inter piè credibilia but these two are articles of faith for doubtlesse christ had it in a greater measure and the measure that we haue we haue it from him
first of the digintie
vnumquodque recipitur ad modum recipientis as was christs capacitie so was his participation his capacitie was infinitely beyond ours his participation must be answerable
the capacitie may bee conceiued by his vnction and his vnion our mysticall vnion comes farre short of his hypostaticall and the vnction of him the head farre exceeds the droppes that distill therefrom into euery one of vs that is but a member when he rose his glorie was without all comparison
the best of men is but a starre of what magnitude soeuer hee bee but christ is as the sunne at the presence whereof the glory of all starres vanisheth
therefore is hee reshith biccure the first fruite of first fruits as the law speakes eyther word notes an eminencie the first alluding to his title the head the other to his title of first borne how much more eminent then is he when both are ioyned together
this is his first prerogatiue intimated by his being the first fruits

but as he is primus dignitate so is he causatione also

for he caused his owne and is the cause of our resurrection
his owne st bernard so differenceth him from others reliqui suscitantur solus christus resurrexit well may others be raised christ only rose hee only by himselfe could conquer death
therfore though the word be passiue yet must it be vnderstood actiuely christ was so raised that he raised himselfe and that not onely merito but efficacia also as the godhead graced the manhood to merit it so was the manhood inabled by the godhead to atchieue it

but christ rose though in se yet pro alijs in his owne person for our good that are undefined span alphabet his purchase by death

this is meant in the law of first fruits when god telleth the israelites they shall be presented to make you accepted and therefore as hee was the cause of his owne so is he the cause of ours also primum in vnoquoquegenere est causa reliquorum god hath giuen eternall life but this life is in the sonne he that hath the sonne hath this life and he that hath not the sonne hath not this life ioh
for he only is the quickning spirit and hath the keyes of death and hell

but causa is eyther aequiuoca or vniuoca christ is causa resurrectionis in both senses he is causa aequiuoca euen to the wicked for he is iudge and therefore shall summon all in the graue his angels shall gather as well tares as wheate and the goats as well as the sheep shall he call before him
yea hee shall not only cause their rising but their incorruptibilitie also for it is by his almighty power that they shall bee supported to endure their torment

this causation only is not here meant but causatio vniuoca also for he is primitiae faciens primitias what himselfe hath he makes others to enioy and therefore theophylact obserues well primitiae ad sequentes respectum habent these first fruits haue respect to others as if one of many should beginne to doe that wherein he is afterward to be followed by others

and this appeares in our communion communion in name and in the condition answerable to the name

in name for as christ so wee are called primitiae so speakes ieremy cap

israel was holinesse to the lord and the first fruits of his encrease and iames cap


of his owne will begot hee vs that we should bee a kinde of first fruits of his creatures and reuel

these are redeemed from among men being the first fruits of god and the lambe
hee is not so then the first fruits as if we were left to prophane vses for though in comparison of vs christ is the first fruits yet in comparison of the world we also are so esteemed

and therefore there is a second first fruites mentioned in the law which was offered at whitsontide and represented the church to whom the law was giuen and vpon whom was poured the holy ghost

but as we communicate in name

so doe wee also in the condition answerable to the name for christus est typus christianorum as wee haue borne the image of the earthly adam so shall we of the heauenly also

to open this point a little farther christus is typus victoriae vitae there bee two things wherein the first fruits doe warrant vs communion with him victorie and life victorie ouer all ouer enemies they shall all be subdued no more tentations no more foyles no more reproches euea when we shall fall asleepe we may lay our selues downe in peace and take our rest for christ which only can will make vs dwell in safety
as securely as himselfe rested in the graue so shall our flesh rest in hope there is the first taste of our victorie
but when wee awake wee shall drinke our fill of it and shall with the saints in the reuelation yea in this chapter insult and say death where is thy sting graue where is thy victorie thankes bee vnto god which hath giuen vs victory through iesus christ our lord

but he is typus not only victoriae but vitae also and that of grace and glorie

of grace in baptisme and of glorie at the last day so the fathers distinguish resurrectio carnis christi gratiam nobis corporalis spiritualis resurrectionis attribuit it raiseth out of both sleepes the spirituall and corporall and they doe it by the direction of st paul for he makes him a type of both but in a different fashion

of the first he is typus analogicus of the second exemplaris wee are buried with christ in baptisme that as christ dyed and rose againe from the dead so should we walke in newnesse of life rom
christ then in his resurrection doth first preach vnto vs rising from sinne
and indeed if the name christus did imply the cause of his resurrection the name of christians must imply the cause of ours no hope of an answerable resurrection if we haue not a part in the vnction for the first resurrection doth fit vs for the second
if we haue saith st paul
phil
our conuersation in heauen

we may looke for our sauiour which shall change our vile bodies and make them like vnto his glorious body

this all should thinke vpon that little intend the first and yet looke for the second resurrection whereas a spirituall body can be the tabernacle of none but a spirituall soule and wee must feele the answer of a good conscience to godward before we can bee begotten to a liuely hope by the resurrection of iesus christ

yea wee must undefined span alphabet foretaste glorie by the vse of grace
and if a man haue the spirit of grace theophylact comforts him well ne angaris animo quod mort ali corpore cinctus sis bee not disheartned when thou lookest vpon thy house of clay the spirit of life that is in iesus freeth vs from the law as of sinne so of death for if the spirit of him that raised iesus from the dead dwell in thy mortall body he that raised iesus from the dead will also quicken thy mortall body by the spirit that dwelleth in thee rom

there is one thing more noted by the first fruits

they were put on the altar but not burnt to note that they were ready for god without fire
the crosse of christ hath made an end of all affliction there remaines nothing for vs but acceptation that wee bee presented vnto god in his temple and receiued into those heauenly tabernacles

these be the things that the first fruits doe teach and whereof we may not doubt for therefore the fathers tell vs that christs resurrection is not only auspex and examplar but also fidei iussor

yea chirographum nostrae resurrectionis they make a faire demonstration of it primitiae habent cognationem cum vniuerso eo cuius sunt primitiae the first fruits and that whose first fruits they are must needes be of the same kinde

the cognation then is betweene christs manhood and ours in that he opened vnto vs the new and liuing way

non est dubit andum de consortio gloriae sicut non est dubit andum de consortio naturae
and therefore the fathers in the primitiue church testified their faith by standing vpright this day and many following daies while they prayed not onely to remember themselues whither their desires should tend but also to testifie that this day is quodammodo imagoventuri saeculi a representation of our blessed rising from the dead
it is true that as the easter first fruits were presented before those at whitsontide so god hath put a distance between christs resurrection ours we must stay our time yet the first fruits wils vs to be undefined span alphabet to bee as sure as if wee were already risen

the last note that will giue vpon primitiae is that they are primitia dormientium the first fruits of them that slept the same flesh awakes which slept that first slept in sinne and then for sinne
and is not this a wonderfull mercie this flesh if you looke to the basenesse of it how much more if to the sinnefulnesse may seeme vnworthy of so great glorie but god doth vouchsafe it and leaues vs to stand and wonder at it
he that could haue created new bodies chooseth rather to repaire our old that this our vnworthinesse might the more commend his goodnesse hee will make these quondam iustfull eyes itching eares bloudy hands fit to doe him seruice in the kingdome of heauen

but it is time to conclude
will shut vp all with a few admonitions that spring from the text
there is in euery man undefined span alphabet a naturall querulousnesse against death
this text will silence it for the remembrance of the resurrection undefined span alphabet as athanasius speakes furnisheth vs with a shield to quench that fiery dart it will make vs resolue that death is better than life because the passage to a better life
for the resurrection is pascha transitus death is not meta but via not our iournies end but the passage thereunto but it is to them that are christians that are according to the inner man temples of the holy ghost for where grace is

there is the passage vnto glorie quare appareant quoque in ciuitate sancta i.e in ecclesia dei futurae resurrectionis indicia quod gerendum est in corporibus fiat in cordibus let our renued hearts bee vnto vs a pledge that our bodies shall be renued

but grace must be paschall transitus sine reditu wee must so rise from sinne that we returne not like dogges to our vomit

and like swine to our wallowing in the myre

st bernard complained of many in his dayes qui sacram domini resurrectionem paschae priuabant nomine to whom it was not transitus but reditus that though they kept the feast for a day and did partake the sacrament also yet after all this turned as good fellowes as euer they were before
would it were not so with vs also that it is so with the vulgar people the tauernes can witnesse that are neuer better furnisht than about this time would they did not witnesse the like again also whose breeding should remember vs of a better course and teach vs that easter must be transitus sine reditu as in christ so in christians

whereupon it followeth that this meditation must make euery day to bee vnto vs an easter day and if it bee to our soules it will hearten vs to hope well of our bodies also so that euery one of vs may boldly say with st bernard

requiesee in spe caro misera my flesh fraile flesh bee still and rest in hope he that came for thy soule will come also for thee and he that reformed that will not forget thee for euer

lord that art the life and resurrection illighten all our darkenesse that we sleep not in death of sin or for sin let vs all awake vnto righteousnesse and sin no more so shall wee in thy light see light and by the life of grace be brought vnto the life of glorie
which god grant for his sonne christ iesus sake to whom with the holy ghost all honour glory might and maiesty be ascribed both now and euer
amen
awake thou that sleepest stand vp from the dead and iesus christ shall giue thee light

a sermon preached in the cathedrall church of wells on easter day epigraph

matth

vers
and as they were eating iesus tooke bread and blessed it and brake it and gaue it to the disciples and said take eate this is my bodie
and he tooke the cup and gaue it to them saying drinke ye all of it
for this is my bloud of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes
supply out of lvke
this doe in remembrance of mee
and out of st paul
cor
as often as you doe it you shew forth the lords death till his comming againe

ovr sauiour christ being ready to dye and by his death to redeeme his church the whole church that began in adam and was to continue vntill the end of the world immediately before honoured a sacrament of either testament the passeouer that was an annexe of the old and the eucharist that was to be the annexe of the new testament
of the passeouer st matthew speaketh in the words that goe before of the eucharist in these that haue read vnto you

the argument then of my text is the eucharist the originall thereof
and of that fitting the present

occasion my purpose is to giue you a very plaine and a very short exposition

wee may resolue then the originall of the eucharist into the author and the institution
the author is here called iesus
touching the institution we are to see
when and
how he did institute it
when while they were eating
how partly by practice and partly by precept
in the practice wee are taught what elements were chosen and what was done with them
the elements were two bread and wine christ chose these he tooke bread he tooke the cup
in opening what was done with them the euangelist informes vs of two workes first iesus his worke and secondly the worke of his disciples
and eyther of their workes is double iesus worke is first to consecrate and then to distribute the elements
in the consecration we must see first how christ did it and secondly why
how he did it by blessing and thanksgiuing blessing of the creature thanksgiuing to the creatour
why that the elements might

be the bread the body and the wine the bloud of christ so saith iesus after consecration of the bread this is my body and of the wine this is my bloud
my is a markable word for it improues the body and the bloud in that they are his which is iesus

secondly about this body the text instructeth vs in two other things first how it must be considered then whereunto it was ordained
though they bee the body and bloud of iesus christ that is glorified in heauen yet must they be considered as he was crucified on earth the body as it was broken vpon the crosse and there giuen for the church the bloud as it was shed and let out of his body on the crosse
the body and bloud so considered were ordained to establish a new couenant therefore are they in the text called the bloud of the new testament this was the first end
a second is to assure the church of remission of sinnes the whole church for the bloud is shed for many and the good that the many were to haue thereby is the remission of their sinnes
besides this first act of thus consecrating the elements christ performes another act he distributeth that which he consecrateth
in the distribution wee haue two things first hee diuideth the elements he brake the bread and the like is to bee conceiued by analogie touching the wine for though not actually yet vertually he did diuide that in that he would haue euery one drinke but a part of the whole
hauing thus diuided he deliuereth the parcels of the bread and the wine to bee drunke by parts in this sense saith the text he gaue the bread he gaue the cup he gaue both and both consecrated
besides this worke of iesus we haue here a worke of his disciples of the disciples for none might doe the worke but they and all of them must doe it
that which they must doe is they must take that which christ giues and what they take they must eate and drink as it was consecrated eate this which is my body drink this which is my bloud
and they must eate and drinke it to the same end for which it was consecrated the doing of this is not arbitrary it is enioyned by the commandement of christ take eate
haue shewed you iesus his practice which was the first mannerof instituting the eucharist

there is a second and that is by precept that precept is here but implyed for the act being sacramentall must continue so long as the doctrine doth whereunto the sacrament is annext the sacrament of the new testament vntill christs comming againe for so long must the gospell continue
but the precept that is here onely implyed is in saint luke exprest and repeated by st paul with some exposition added to it
the precept is doe this in remembrance of mee which words require the churches imitation and commemoration
imitation doe this the pastors the people both must performe their worke they must doe
secondly that which they must doe is this they must strictly obserue the patterne that is giuen in this place
besides their imitation here is enioyned them a commemoration what they doe they must doe in remembrance of christ
st paul openeth the phrase they must set forth the lords death
finally

whereas christ did it now once and hee would haue them doe it againe wee may see a difference between baptisme and the eucharist this may be reiterated though the other may not

and so haue laid before you as many particulars as thinke obserueable in this text which will now vnfold briefly and in their order first then of the author
he is here called iesus saint paul calleth him the lord iesus
though sacraments be ceremonies yet are they ceremonies of efficacie
were they onely of significancie the church might haue some power to ordaine them but being of efficacie their ordination belongeth onely to god because the efficacy floweth from his spirit and of his spirit none can dispose but himselfe
as onely god is the author of sacraments so did hee institute them by the second person by him that is the sauiour of the world doth hee institute the sacraments of sauing grace the sacraments are his most liuely picture therefore he was fittest for to draw them
he was fittest as for to draw them and as the lord to enioyne the obseruation of them therein especially stands his kingdome in his church to prescribe the meanes vnto eternall life
but how doth he do it you shall learne that in the institution therein obserued the time and the manner
the time while they were eating saith st matthew after supper saith st luke saint paul the same night that he was betrayed
st paul and st luke are easily reconciled for the passeouer was solemnized at the same time and st luke meaneth when they had done with that so far as concerned the paschal lamb but were not yet risen for that there was another ceremony to be performed as the iewish ritualls obserue and that ceremony was this the master of the family after the passeouer was eaten distributed with solemne words concerning the deliuerance out of the egyptian captiuity bread and wine before that was done christ instituted the sacrament and so it might be while they were eating though it were after supper
where out of st pauls addition that it was the night wherein christ was betrayed we may obserue that for the terrour of the crosse which he christ did not omit to doe any thing which concerned his office and was to be for the comfort of his church
secondly obserue that they were not at a prophane but a sacred banquet which hindered not but they might be meete guests for christs holy supper while they receiued one sacrament they were not vnfit for another
and this teacheth vs the reason why though christ gaue the sacrament to the apostles while they were feasting the church commands vs to take it fasting
for their feast was sacred the church forbids that which is prophane so doth st paul
cor
yea the iewes were to sanctifie themselues before the receiuing of the passeouer
how may we then come vnprepared to ours that the meate of our soules may the better be receiued we must not be prepossest with the food of our bodies

where by the way you may learne how to answer the cauill against

our liturgie which saith that the diuell entered into iudas after his vnworthy receiuing of the sacrament
for put the case he were not at the eucharist which notwithstanding will not easily be proued because the best harmonists are against the conceipt and so are the fathers greeke and latine
but put the case he were not there yet was he at the passouer that is plaine in the euangelists and the passeouer was a sacrament and so in effect the matter is all one

secondly obserue on these words while they were eating that before the sacrament of the old was abolished for it was not abolished but by the death of christ christ instituted the sacrament of the new that because we haue alwayes so much need of grace wee might neuer be without the meanes thereof
so did he substitute baptisme to circumcision the ministry of the gospell to the priesthood of the law the lords day to the iewish sabbath
seeing then christ hath been so carefull of vs we must not be wanting to our selues if we want grace the blame must not be laide on him but on vs

thirdly christ abolished the ceremoniall law but not all ceremonies
we consist of a body and a soule and god doth conuey grace vnto the soule by the body which cannot be done without ceremony
but ours are fewer in number than were the iewes

though they are not inferiour in power yea they are much more commodious though they be lesse burthenous
our charge being easier and our comfort greater our sinne is lesse excusable and our neglect more challengeable if we doe not practise such easie meanes to compasse so great a benefit
enough of the time

come now to the manner of the institution where wee must first see what elements were chosen and here we finde bread and wine
of this choice the reason is inquired
some thinke it occasionall because the father of the family did after the passeouer distribute bread and wine some thinke christ tooke an occasion from that ceremony to institute this by this truth to accomplish that type
others thinke the reason to be propheticall

malachy foretold that from the rising of the sun vnto the going downe of the same gods name should be great amongst the gentiles and in euery place incense should be offered to his name and a pure offering the word is mincah and so doth import an accessory to the ancient sacrifice that was made commonly of fine flower and wine this accessory might in some cases be a principall as appeares in the law
some rise higher vnto the dayes of melchisedech and because hee offered bread and wine and christ was a priest after the order of melchisedech therefore hee made vse of his sacrifice and perpetuated it to this heauenly vse
now the bread and wine which melchisedech brought out when hee met abraham are by many of the fathers thought to be a sacrifice
might adde a fourth originall that is manna and the water out of the rocke wherewith god sustained the israelites in the wildernesse st paul calleth them spirituall meate and drinke
cor

but to leaue these points which are subiect to dispute will come to that which is more cleare and that is bread and wine are the choisest

of food bread strengtheneth mans heart and it is the sustenance of all other sustenances the psalmist giueth wheate as it were kidnies of fat not onely alluding to the forme of the graine but also to the effect thereof and god by the prophet when he threatneth a famine expresseth it by breaking the staffe of bread as if without it all food were heartlesse
as for wine the psalme teacheth vs that it was made to cheare vp mans heart
the parable of the trees telleth vs it cheareth both god and man iudges
in the probleme esdras
what is strongest wine is brought in as one
ecclesiasticus hath made almost a whole chapter of it and holdeth that there is no life without it be we or

salomon will tell vs that wine is the remedy

as bread and wine are the choisest of foods so doe they comprehend entire food for humidum and siccum are all that are required vnto food the bread which is dry as the foundation of nourishment and the wine which is moyst as a necessary requisite vnto the concoction of the bread that it may be chylus for except moisture incorporate it selfe into it and helpe the stomach to digest it it will hardly be prepared for the liuer and being prepared for want of liquidnesse it can hardly bee disperst through the body
so that neither of these parts can bee wanting in our sustenance corporall if eyther be the sustenance will be imperfect
finally the elements of bread and wine serue to set bounds vnto our meditations vpon sacred things
for though the heauenly part bee the life of the earthly yet would wee lose our selues in sounding that great depth if our thoughts were not guided and stinted by the earthly
therefore hath god vouchsafed this gracious helpe both in the sacrifices and the sacraments by the elements he hath confined our meditations that being more distinct they might be more profitable
this being obserued concerning the elements what they are we must next obserue that they are chosen christ tooke the bread and he tooke the cup the taking of them into his sacred hands was a reall choice of them
and indeed he onely that can institute sacraments can appoint the elements and he doth both vpon the same grounds which touched before
only here note that we must keep our selues to his choice and we may not presume to alter the elements
some are bold and thinke that as in the apothecaries shop they haue succedanea one simple to supply the want of another so in case of necessity in stead of the elements taken by christ the church may vse analoga such things as are to the people in stead of bread wine
but that may well be doubted except it be better warranted than by humane coniecture
it is true that god made manna sacramentall and so did he the water of the rocke but man may not presume to doe what god did
and seeing sacraments haue necessitatem not medij but praecepti as it is a very foule fault to contemne the elements chosen when they may be had so when they may not be had it were better to want the sacrament than to vse elements of our owne choice
god can supply to our faith rem sacramenti sine sacramento in a case of necessity who happely will not be so gracious if we be so presumptuous to prescribe

if in case of necessity we may not be so bold much lesse may we be as the old heretickes were that corrupted the elements substituting water when they might haue wine which therefore were called aquarij against whom saint cyprian writeth
meane not those that put water into the wine which in the east countries was vsed first to allay the heate of the wine afterwards the fathers conceited a mysterie therein of ioyning the people vnto christ which ceremony the church of rome doth pertinaciously defend and of a thing indifferent which may be vsed as it is found expedient for euery church they make it necessary vpon their command to be vsed by all churches but meane those that vsed onely water

as some corrupted the element of wine so some that of the bread and that with so much lewdnesse as is fit neither for christian eyes nor eares to reade or heare

whether the bread should be leauened or vnleauened is a dispute
the aduocates of the church of rome hold it a thing indifferent though them selues vse vnleauened yet do they not condemn the churches that vse leauened and of the reformed churches some vse one some the other
though may not omit to tell you that the bread vsed by christ in the sacrament though it were occasionally vnleauened because of the law which commanded such bread to be eaten with the passeouer yet was it made of dough and not of batter and so was that which properly is called bread and is vsed with our meate and not wafers which haue not that vse

therefore the apostles giue it the name of bread yea of a loafe and from the apostles dayes during the primitiue church the fathers obserued that course of vsing loaues of bread

one thing more must obserue concerning the elements and that is that neither of them must be embeazeled from the people that neither of them must bee wanting for christ tooke both
neither may they bee confounded the one with the other as some put the bread into the wine christ tooke them both apart
hauing sufficiently shewed you what elements were chosen now come to shew you what was done with them
and here wee finde two works first iesus his work and secondly the work of his disciples both double
begin with iesus workes whereof the former is he consecrateth the elements
and his consecration was performed by two acts first blessing then thanksgiuing blessing of the creatures and thanksgiuing to the creatour

blessing is threefold as the persons that blesse may be of three sorts first onely god then the blessing is reall so he blest his creatures gen
and promised to blesse israel deut
secondly only man so the blessing is but verball thus isaac blessed iacob and iacob the twelue patriarchs gen
so kings pastors fathers blesse their subiects their people their children speaking the words but reseruing the deedes for god
thirdly ioyntly god and man so the blessing is both verball and reall such was the blessing of christ hee spake the words as man and made his words effectuall as god when hee multiplied the loaues and

the fishes and when hee instituted the sacraments

christ not onely blessed the creature but hee gaue thankes also to the creatour
christ had power enough of himselfe beeing god but hee did ordinarily ascribe the power vnto his father while hee did worke the redemption of man so was he pleased by his humilitie to make amends for our pride and to supply our forgetfulnesse by his thankefulnesse he acknowledgeth him the fountaine of all good and giueth him the glory of all his wonderfull workes teaching vs that the children of god only by adoption should be humble as hee is our patterne which is the sonne of god by generation
the psalmist goeth farther and concludeth vs if we be vnthankefull to bee worse than beasts seeing the eyes of all things looke vnto him which giueth them their meate in due season psal
wherefore whether wee eate or drinke corporally

how much more if we eate or drinke spiritually we must follow the apostles rule and doe all to the glory of god wee must question with our selues as did king dauid psal
what shall render vnto the lord and wee must with him answer for our selues will take the cup of saluation and praise the name of the lord vnto this end is this sacrament called the eucharist
thus christ conscerateth the elements

but why what good came to the elements by consecration surely much good for they are made the body and the bloud of christ so saith iesus this is my body this is my blood
the interpretation of these words is much controuerted and it is much disputed what change of the elements the wordes of christ did make for that christ changed the bread when he consecrated it wee make no doubt
whereas then there are three things in bread and wine
the name
the vse and
the substance wee confesse a change in the two first but deny it in the third

first wee confesse a change in the name directed by st austines rule

because of a similitude sacraments commonly beare the names of the things themselues the sacrament of christs body is after a sort the body of christ and the sacrament of christ blood is after a sort the blood of christ
of st

austins opinion in our case was tertullian christ saith hee calleth bread his body
and cyprian the signifying elements and the thing signified

are caded by the same name
our sauiour saith theodoret changed the names and called the signe by the name of his body
ambrose chrysostome

and others might bee alledged to this purpose

secondly wee acknowledge a change in the vse of the elements for there must be some ground for which the signes may beare the names of the things themselues and that is the vertue the power the operation of the flesh and bloud of christ beeing mystically vnited to the signes doe in a wonderfull sort manifest these things by the signes through the operation of the holy ghost
this we learne of st cyprian

to the element once sanctified not now their own nature giueth the effect but the diuine vertue worketh in them more mightily the truth is present with the signe and the spirit with the sacrament

so that the worthinesse of the grace appeareth by the efficiency of the thing
ambrose also if there be so great strength in the

word of the lord iesus that all things beganne to be when they were not how much more shall it bee of force that the mysticall elements should bee the same they were before and yet be changed into another thing theodoret
the signes which are seene christ hath honoured with the names of his body and blood not changing the nature but adding grace vnto nature
thus farre wee goe in acknowledging a change of the elements by consecration farther we goe not wee acknowledge no change in the substance of the nature of the elements

and herein we are guided by the fathers also
ambrose
thou camst to the altar and sawest the sacraments thereon and wondredst at the very ereature

and yet it is a solemne and a knowne creature
cyprian
after consecration the element is deliuered from the name of bread and reputed worthy to bee called the body of the lord notwithstanding the nature of the bread still remaines

chrysostome
the substantiall bread and cup sanctified with a solemne blessing is profitable for the life and safegard of the whole man

to proue this the fathers vse to parallel the sacrament and the person of christ

in their disputes against eutyches
gelasius
as the bread and wine after consecration are changed and altered into the body and blood of christ

so is the humane nature of christ changed into his diuine
theodoret hath the same parallel and so hath st austine as hee is cited de consecratione distinctione secunda hoc est quod dico
now a generall councell not onely particular fathers haue resolued that both natures continue in christs person vnaltered so doe their properties so doe their actions only this honour the diuine doth to the humane nature that as it hath associated it into one person so doth it manifest her properties by it and performe her actions euen so is it in the sacrament the heauenly the earthly thing are both vnited to make one sacrament but each keepeth vnaltered its owne nature properties and actions onely the heauenly doth worke by the earthly and doth not ordinarily without it manifest its operation
if in the person of christ there was no alteration of the diuine nature though the scripture say the word was made flesh much lesse may we dreame of any alteration in the earthly part of the sacrament though it be said the bread is the body and the wine is the blood of christ

out of this distinction of changing of the elements you may perceiue that christs consecration was effectuall though not effectuall to transubstantiation
for in a sacramentall argument both substances must remaine and by reason of the mysticall vnion disparats may be affirmed the one of the other without absurditie
whether the sacramentall vnion doe require moreouer a consubstantiation may also here be disputed for some vrge it out of these words
but their answer is briefly this the earthly and the heauenly thing may bee conioyned really though not locally
and as they may be conioyned so they may bee receiued seeing the proper exhibiter of the heauenly is the holy spirit and the receiuer is our faith
our faith may ascend to christ in heauen and the spirit beeing infinite may vnite vs vnto christ though we be as low as the earth
whereas then the words may haue their truth without any recourse to a miracle or contradicting any other article of faith or forcing strange senses vpon other

passages of scripture we content our selues with this mysticall relatiue vnion and forbeare all other vnnecessary speculations
although we must needs confesse that the words make more for consubstantiation than they make for transubstantiation

we confesse then that in the sacrament there is the body and blood of christ and that three manner of waies though we admit neyther of the two false waies transubstantiation and consubstantiation
first in regard of the signe for it was not chosen for it selfe but with reference to christ
secondly in regard of the resemblance it doth most fitly set forth the efficacy that is in christ the strengthning the cheering efficacie you heard before out of the
psalme that those properties are in bread and wine
strength is eyther increased or recouered and cheerefulnesse followeth eyther vpon the recouered or increased strength wee are babes and must grow in christ we are souldiers and lose blood in his quarrell we must finde that which is wanting to both in him
the conscience of sinne doth deiect vs and the want of grace slack that zeale that should bee in vs repaire of cheerefulnesse in both cases is to bee sought in christ
thus much wee are taught by the resemblance
a third reason why wee hold the sacrament to bee the body and blood of christ is because the heauenly thing is conueyed vnto vs by the earthly the bread which wee breake is it not the communion of the body of christ and the cup of blessing which we blesse is it not the communion of the the blood of christ in a word the sacramentall vnion made by consecration serueth to make the sacrament fit for our participation twas so it is so in euery sacrament of old of the new testament
the addition of my to the body and bloud must not be neglected for it doth insinitely improue them when it tels vs whose they are
for there is not an eminencie in the person that doth not reflect vpon this body and blood be it eminencie of dignitie or of efficacie
the person is iesus then it is the body and blood of the sauiour of the world he is christ then it is the body and blood of the anointed of the lord of the prophet of the priest of the king of the church he is the sonne of god the only begotten the dearely beloued son how heauenly how precious must that body and blood bee which are his for our better valuation and greater consolation wee may carry my through all the attributes of this sacred person
but let vs goe on
the elements of bread and wine were consecrated that they might be the body and blood of christ
but how are this body and blood to bee considered surely not as christ is glorified but as he was crucified for it is that body that was giuen as st paul speaketh was broken and the blood is that blood which was shed
and so doth it best answer the sacrifices of the old law and the sacrament of the passeouer
and no maruell for the glory of christ can little comfort vs except the crosse of christ doe first proue that he hath merited it for vs christs merit is the pillar of christian faith whereunto his birth is but an antecedent that hee might be able to merit and his glory a consequent witnessing that hee did merit
we must therefore in the sacrament haue an especiall eye to this

and this will not onely secure our soules but settle our iudgements against the sophistry of the church of rome who not distinguishing betweene christ crucified and glorified or rather not building their conclusions answerable to this vndeniable principle the sacraments represent christ crucified not glorified are driuen to coine so many new articles of reall presence corporall of a metaphysicall transubstantiation of an ill applyed concomitancie
all which easily vanish if we consider christs purpose to represent himselfe in the sacrament not as hee now is at the right hand of god but as he was vpon the crosse
not but it is the same body and blood which is in glory but it must not be so considered as it is in glory
which will necessarily inforce vs to acknowledge that theynion betweene the thing earthly and heauenly can be no more than sacramentall and that respectiue also to what was done on earth not what is in heauen was say done formaliter on the crosse but is effectiuè working in heauen
for that body which christ sacrificed for vs he presents in heauen to propitiate god towards vs not continuing the act of sacrificing for that was actiua passio or passiua actio many others concurred thereunto besides himselfe as it is cleare in the euangelists but perpetuating the effect of the sacrifice the act was but once done and that only vpon the crosse but the efficacie thereof continueth for euer though christ sit at the right hand of god in heauen as st paul proueth at large in the epistle to the hebrewes
and this cutteth vp the very rootes from whence springeth the masse and all attendants thereupon

the last thing which noted in the consecration is whereunto the elements consecrated and by consecration made the body and blood of christ the body as it was broken the blood as it was shed doe serue and what is intended by them
here are two excellent ends we must behold therein first the establishment of a new couenant betweene god and vs
we need a new one that haue broken the old by our mutabilitie before the fall and since the fall through our great imbecilitie so that finding our selues vnfit for hoc fac viues we must rest vpon iustus fide suâ viuet
it is our comfort that wee which cannot stand of our selues may subsist in christ and though the law be too hard for vs without the gospel yet by the gospel we haue a double good first it giueth strength to performe the law and secondly because that will not reach home it assureth vs that our iudge is our father and contracts with vs in no other person
of this couenant god speaketh in ieremy cap

and st paul openeth it in the epistle to the hebrewes
marke that the couenant is annext to the blood and so it was in the type the attonement was ascribed thereunto because the burning of the sacrifice did rather signifie a dedication of the person to god but the shedding of the blood did note the death and it was christs death in vertue whereof god was pleased to bee attoned and to enter into a new couenant

the second end is the remission of sinnes the sacrament is not onely vnto vs a pledge of a new couenant and warrants beleeue and thou shalt

be saued but lest looking backe wee should be afflicted with the conscience of our sinne the sacrament assureth vs that all shall be pardoned that is not that hath not been performed according to the law
wee come then to the lords table not onely for meate but also for medicine not onely for gold but also for this water of the sanctuarie runneth into vs as into mare mortuum it maketh vs no lesse whole than fruitfull this is the true poole of bethesda no sooner hath the angell descended into it but whosoeuer entereth it may bee cured by it
and so haue opened the first act of iesus he consecrated the elements
the second act followeth

what hee consecrated that hee distributeth
in this act there are two things the first is the diuiding of the elements the second is the bestowing of them
the breaking may represent eyther the vsage of christs body when it was sacrificing as in the old typicall sacrifices the like also must be conceiued of the pouring out of the wine or else it may fit the sacrifice for distribution as is vsed in a sacrament
christ hath the fulnesse of grace but wee haue euery one but his proportion according to our capacity
euen as from the sunne euery man receiues a beame of the same kinde though not the same beame or from a tree euery man gathereth an apple though not the same apple or out of a riuer euery man drinketh a draught of the same water but not the same draught of water euen so all doe partake of the same christ but not in the same measure and no man whole christ
whole meane totum christi though euery man doth receiue him whole that is totum christum euery man hath christ alike intensiuè though extensiuè wee haue him not all alike
and yet extensiuè euery man hath his full measure
as it was in manna hee that gathered more had not too much and he that gathered lesse had enough
the breaking then of the bread doth not onely represent christs passion but also his proportioning of himselfe fit for our participation for so it followeth breaking was for giuing
it is a question whether christ himselfe did communicate in the eucharist it may well be presumed that he did
it is euident that he did in his owne person sanctifie and honour both sacraments of the old testament circumcision and the passeouer
and touching baptisme the first sacrament of the new testament there can be no question why should there then bee any question of this if any obiect the silence of the holy ghost in the words of institution that may receiue an answer that it was not necessarily to be exprest because it might well bee supplyed out of the correspondency of this sacrament to that of the passeouer
but the next words to my text seeme to mee to put it out of all doubt will not henceforth drink any more of this fruit of the vine vntill that day when drink it new with you in my fathers kingdome
although st luke seem to place those words betweene the passeouer and the eucharist which st matthew and st marke place after the words of the institution

but to let that point passe though christ did partake yet it was not for any need that he had of it but for that by his owne participation hee would giue vertue vnto this as he hath done to other sacraments
hee

needed not to dye for himselfe he dyed for vs therefore as he gaue himselfe for vs so did he giue himselfe to vs for vs on the crosse to vs in the sacrament
here appeareth the truth of the apostles saying he that was rich became poore that wee by his pouerty might be made rich
cor
he that knew no sinne was made sinne for vs that wee might be made the righteousnesse of god in him
and let this suffice for christs worke

let vs come now to the disciples worke
and here first we must obserue that they that must meddle with these elements must be disciples that is profest christians
for as none might eate of the paschall lambe but they that were circumcised no more might any receiue the eucharist that was not baptized
the reason is plaine no man can be nourished except he liue and liue to god no man can but he that is incorporated into christ and incorporated he is by baptisme

but euery one that is baptized is not fit to receiue the eucharist hee must be of age to examine himselfe as st paul aduiseth and to discerne the lords body
it is true that about st austins time they did put the eucharist into childrens mouthes before they could vnderstand what it meant and this was done vpon the mistake of those words of st iohn except you eate the flesh of the sonne of man

and his bloud you haue no life in you
but that errour was long since deprehended and the custome discontinued and none receiue but those which are come to years of discretion and moreouer are able to giue an accompt of their faith yea by the laudable orders of our church none should receiue vntill they are confirmed and great pity it is that so laudable a custome is not obserued
were it many aged ones would not liue yea and dye too so ignorant of that which they receiue as now they doe to the dishonour of our church and discomfort of their soules
pastors parents masters churchwardens yea and godfathers and godmothers also should make more conscience of their dueties their oathes their vowes wherein they stand bound to god his church and their charge and take more care to remedy this than for ought see they doe

it is a question whether vnder the name of disciples more are vnderstood than the twelue apostles some thinke yea but not one of the euangelists doth fauour their conceit
it should seeme by them that onely the twelue apostles did now represent the whole church
and happely they onely were present because christ was pleased to teach them the forme and giue them the charge of administring the sacrament
surely that is more likely although if wee doe conceit that other were present there is no heresie in it
but leaue the persons and come to their worke
their worke is double as was the worke of iesus
the first is they must take take what christ gaue for he therefore gaue it that they should take it
and indeed it were a great contempt to bee present and not to take part
certainly the primitiue church thought so whose councels require scuere censures to be inflicted vpon idle gazers on

and there is great reason for it for they abase themselues and excommunicate themselues at least range themselues in the order of penitents

or undefined span alphabet who were not thought meete or worthy for their simplenesse or their wickednesse to be guests at the lords table
yea and what a wretchednesse is it for them that know what neede they haue of the new couenant to be carelesse of confirming their assurance thereof and for them that are loaden with sinnes and iniquities not to vnburthen their consciences of the guilt and purge them from the corruption by taking the pledge of remission of sins and meanes which should further the amendment of their liues he deserues to perish for want of grace that hath it offered and doth refuse it

besides this worke of taking the disciples had another work and that is eating and drinking what they take that they must eate and drinke also
these are corporall acts but they must be vnderstood according to the food
and seeing the food consisteth of an earthly and a heauenly part we must eate and drinke both
and god hath prouided vs wherewith we may doe it for wee our selues consist of an earthly and an heauenly part we must bring both parts vnto this feast and there vse them both our bodies must take eate and drinke the elements our soules must take eate and drinke the body and bloud of christ
yea our bodies must in these acts onely attend our soules for the feast is not ventris but mentis neither is our corporall feeding vsed otherwise than to helpe forward our spirituall
secondly our eating and drinking must not onely feed vpon christs body and bloud but vpon them as the one was broken and the other was shed as they were the propitiatory sacrifice
and then thirdly wee must draw out of them and digest in our soules the two comfortable ends of the sacrament that is first our assurance that wee are in the new couenant secondly that our sinnes are pardoned
if wee doe not take all these things in our eating and drinking we doe not take all that which is set before vs and offered vnto vs
and here we must marke a difference betweene our corporall and spirituall food
non ego mutabor in te sed tu mutaberis in me as st austin bringeth christ speaking
when we eate corporally our food is turned into vs but when we eate spiritually we must be turned into our foode we must be transformed into christ
first into his grace wee must bee liuely images of his heauenly vertues of his patience of his obedience of his humility of his charity of whatsoeuer other vertue shined in his mortall life
and then wee shall be sure to be transformed into his glory and by vertue of this food hee will change these our vile bodies and make them conformable vnto his glorious body
and indeede this conformity doe the fathers make a principall effect of this our spirituall foode

whom doth this feeding concerne told you the disciples here are two other words that may not be neglected and they are all and manie all that are disciples and of age and those all are many for christs bloud was shed for many
of the poole of bethesda it was said that it could cure but one at a time and that one which first went into the water after the angell had stirred it but christs sacraments are like vnto his garments

of them we reade in the gospell that as many as touched them were made whole matth

and of these it is true that as many as faithfully partake them shall as truely bee made whole spiritually as the other were corporally

as many
the sacraments are sufficiently soueraigne for all not so efficiently and yet efficiently for many for although in comparison of vnbeleeuers beleeuers are but few yet considered in themselues beleeuers are many

both iewes and gentiles
will not trouble you with a dispute whether in this place as in some other the word many is put for all will rather obserue vnto you that this same feeding is not a thing arbitrary but enioyned the disciples neither may they hope to haue any part in the new couenant or remission of sinnes except they performe this commandement
and the commandement is not more than needs for whereas wee need no incitement for to take our corporall food yet were wee not incited wee would pine away for want of our spirituall therefore is god in the prophet faine to call vpon vs esay
hoe all ye that thirst come to the waters and wisedome in the prouerbes is faine to send her maides and say come eate of my bread and drinke of my wine prou
so likewise doth the king at the marriage feast matth

and so is christ faine to importune the church of laodicea reuel

but remember that it is an affirmatiue commandement and so doth tye semper though not ad semper

will dwell no longer vpon the practice let vs come now briefly and see the precept
the precept is not here exprest but implyed for seeing here is the institution of a sacrament it is the institution of that that must be as lasting as the doctrine whereunto it is annexed
for a sacrament is an annexe vnto doctrine euen as a seale is set vnto a pardon
the sacraments of the old testament were so annext vnto the ceremoniall law so are the sacraments of the new testament vnto the gospell
as he that taketh the charter of pardon without the kings seale when hee may haue it loseth the benefit of his pardon so hee will haue but little benefit of the gospell that is a contemner of the sacraments they must both goe together vntill the worlds end or as paul speaketh vntill the lords comming againe
cor
this institution of christ is like that of the creation not to bee stinted by this present act but extended to euery of the like as it doth in the other sacrament of baptisme yea and of ordination and absolution
the first of euery of them was seminall and to bring out others according to its kinde
whereupon it followeth that the words of christ in his practice are vsed by the pastors not onely as historicall but also as operatiue
and this is the ground of our faith and security in the effect of these and other sacred rites

but touching this sacrament the precept is cleare in st luke doe this in remembrance of mee
wherein there are two markable things which the precept doth require
will touch them in a word the first is imitation doe this the other is commemoration in remembrance of me
doe this that calleth for the worke of the pastour in imitation of iesus and the

worke of the people in imitation of the disciples both must be doing in this sacrament and except they be both doing it is no communion
priuate masses are a direct peruerting of christs institution where the priest onely is doing but the people doe nothing at least they doe not what they should there is undefined span alphabet whereas the precept doth not onely require that we doe but that wee doe this the priest must precisely doe that which iesus did he must take the same elements the same in nature the same in number and when he hath taken them he must vse them as christ did consecrate them with blessing and thanksgiuing to the end and for the vses before specified according to that of st paul quod accepi domino tradidi vobis
cor

and what he hath consecrated that must he distribute and withhold no part not the cup as the church of rome doth christ gaue that and for many hundred yeares the church imitated him so doing and now they reserue it onely to the priest that doth execute or doe the honour to monarches to giue them the cup
and that may worse be withheld from the people than the body
for the new couenant and the remission of sinnes is in the text annext vnto the bloud as if christ would haue them especially remember it in that
concomitancy is an idle shift for seeing a sacrament is the participation of the sacrifice they confesse that they cannot make vp the sacrifice without consecrating both bread and wine how doe they not then defraud the people of a part of the sacrifice if they giue them the bread and not the wine or which is most absurd the priest receiueth christs body as it was crucified because he receiueth in both kindes and the people as it was glorified because the concomitancy maketh them receiue both in one kinde
adde hereunto that they must mocke the people with vnconsecrated wine or beare them in hand that it is arbitrary in the church whether they shall or shall not haue it
their other reasons are ridiculous certainly they agree not with the precept doe this
no more doth whatsoeuer they doe besides as their reseruation their circumgestation their application of the host vnto many vses whereunto god neuer ordained it
but the most notorious corruption of these words is that they are made a part of the priests ordination as if they did giue him power to sacrifice both for quicke and dead for from these words doe they deriue that part of the priesthood yea vpon these words they build the masse also as if hoc facite were as much as sacrifice and immolate christ vnbloudily
but will not stand to refute them

as the pastors worke is enioyned in hoc facite so is the peoples also they must doe as the disciples did take that which was distributed amongst them eate that which was consecrated for them and they must feed thereon with their bodies and with their soules
not only with their bodies as carnall christians doe nor with their soules as the papists teach their people to communicate mentally with the priest as if a man were euer fit to communicate mentally when he is not fit to communicate corporally but we must communicate with both otherwise wee are not

compleat guests of this entire feast
and though of the two better the body bee wanting than the soule because the grace that possesseth the soule will redound to the body but the food of the body cannot benefit the soule yet seeing the body and bloud of christ is the fountaine of life spirituall to our soules immortall to our bodies our best course is to eate and drinke with both that we may liue and liue in both blessedly for euer
as the people must doe this so they must take heed that beside this they doe not eyther superstitiously adore the elements or atheistically prophane them in swearing either by the heauenly or the earthly part of the sacrament

the last note that will giue is the commemoration that is enioyned by the precept doe this in remembrance st paul expounds the word thus shew forth the lords death
and indeede the sacrament is a liuely representation of the crucifying of christ and but a commemoration for the popish masse is refuted in this very word and st pauls phrase which shew that christ is not crucified againe but the manner of his crucifying sacramentally represented to vs and so the fathers tooke it
but as the pastor must commemorate the sacrificing in his worke so must the people the sacrifice in taking and feeding thereupon as vpon the viaticum peregrinantium militantum
finally that which remembreth vs must be often frequented by vs so must this sacrament
wherein it differs from baptisme which cannot be reiterated this may yea it must
the first christians thought so who at first receiued it euery day they may make vs blush whose deuotion is now so cold
but end
that death which christ endured for vs and doth offer to vs wee must remember in such signes and apply to our selues by such meanes as he hath appointed if we meane to be benefited thereby
most mercifull sauiour that by thy powerfull word hast consecrated these holy mysteries of thy most precious body and bloud broken and shed to be the vndoubted pledges of thy gospell and conduits of thy grace curing the deadly wounds of all our sinnes and satisfying as many as thirst and hunger after righteousnesse grant that we neuer neglect to receiue and when we receiue may euer be prepared prepared both in body and soule so here by faith worthily to feed on thee as thou representest thy selfe veyled in thy church militant that we may hereafter fully enioy thee as thou presentest thy selfe vnueiled in the church triumphant
and in acknowledgement of this present grace and that future glory let euery one of vs become a sanctified eucharist that with soule and body wee may now and euer sing glory be to thee lord lord our strength and our redeemer
amen

three sermons preached in the cathedrall church of wells at the feast of whitsvntide
epigraph

ephes

verse
but vnto euery one of vs is giuen grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended vp to the
verse

the apostle in former chapters hath opened the mysteries of the gospell but at this hee beginnes to deduce certaine rules of life which spring therefrom and hee doth specially recommend vnto the ephesians three christian vertues vnitie pietie and constancie he would haue them all agree in gods truth and expresse that truth in their liues and not wauer in their liues for feare of the crosse
but more particularly touching vnitie he tels them wherein it consists and wherefore it must be entertained
wherein it consists we learne in the verses that goe before but wherfore it must be entertained we are taught in these that now haue read vnto you
the reasons are partly the meanes whereby and partly the end for which we receiue the gifts of god
the meanes are two one principall which is christ the other instrumentall which are his ministers
and the end is twofold first our consummation in grace secondly our preseruation from errour
these bee the particulars which take vp so much of this chapter as reacheth from the seuenth to the seuenteenth verse
at this time sutably to the time shall entreat only of the first of our meanes of christ the principall meanes whereby we obtaine the blessings of god

and here we are to see first what christ doth then what right hee had to doe it
what christ doth is set downe three wayes but all yeelde but one

sense first he giueth grace secondly he giueth gifts and thirdly he fils all things that is by him we haue gods blessings

but we may resolue them into two points the gift and the giuer the gift is grace and that grace hath power to fill and this is nothing but a description of the holy ghost which descended this day for he is the filling grace of god
of this gift the giuer is christ it is here called expresly his gift and he giues it discreetly because according to a measure and yet vniuersally not one of the church which doth not partake it to euery one of vs is giuen grace
this christ doth and he doth no more than he may his right to doe it is gathered out of his ascension which st paul describes to be a deserued triumph
the parts of a triumph as they know which are read in stories were these two first the person of the conquerour was carried in state and secondly the monuments of his conquest did attend his chariot and were disposed at his pleasure
lo here our sauiour christ his person is lifted vp on high and it doth not ascend single but leades captiuitie captiue and diuideth the spoyle he gaue gifts to men such an ascension was a triumph indeed
and as it was a triumph so was it a deserued one for christ descended before he ascended yea he ascended not so high but he descended as low for he that ascended aboue all heauens descended before to the lower parts of the earth the same person did both and so became the ascension the reward of his descension
and so haue you the contents of the first branch of my text whereof shall now god willing vnfold so many as the time will permit

beginne at the gift
and the gift is called grace and grace is a free gift it is such a gift as can neyther bee deserued before hand nor bee required after it is receiued
between men there passe three sorts of gifts the first is salarium when a man giueth that which another hath earned of which the rule is the labourer is worthy of his hyre such a gift grace is not for though god impose workes vpon vs yet are they not as they ought done by any of vs adam failed much more doe we we can claime no salarie
the second kinde of gift is honorarium it is such a gift as testifieth the inferiours reuerent regard of his superiours eminencie such a gift grace is not for if the angels light be darkenesse in comparison of god and their perfection is imperfection as iob teacheth how vile and base is man who is but dust and wormes meat there is nothing which god should honour in him
the third gift is called eleemosynarium the almes which the rich giues to the poore this comes nearest to the nature of grace and yet it comes farre short of it
for the rich are bound to relieue the poore partly by gods law and partly out of a consideration reflecting vpon themselues that be they neuer so rich they may become poore and stand in neede of the same reliefe which they afford to others
but god is bound to none neyther can he possibly neede the helpe of any therefore his gift and only his is properly grace and comes within st austines definition that tels vs that non est gratia vllo modo si non sit omni modogratuita no gift deserues the name of grace except it be absolutely free and such are gods gifts
the more are we indebted if we receiue them and

the lesse proud should wee bee for whereof should he be proud whose tenure is altogether pura perpetua eleemosyna meere almes and the most free charity of god nay the very word undefined span alphabet put for undefined span alphabet the loue of god for the gift proceeding from loue doth put vs in mind that our eyes should not be fixt so much on that which we haue as on him that gaue it and we must not take so much content in our owne state as in his fauour

but it is moreouer to be noted that grace in the scripture is contradistinct to nature and the workes thereof are different from those of the creation and preseruation of the world
it is true that all the workes of god wherein hee doth communicate of his goodnesse vnto the world spring freely from his fauour for hee might haue chosen whether hee would at all haue made the world or bestowed such excellent endowments vpon any man but yet the holy ghost is pleased to vnderstand this word of those blessings which belong to the second couenant the couenant of the gospel it is an euangelicall word and signifieth only those gifts wherein the euangelicall couenant doth consist and whereby it is furthered
they are of two sorts in the schooles the one is called gratia gratum faciens the other gratia gratis data not but that both are gratis datae freely giuen for in that respect the members of the distinction are coincident but because they are not reciprocall all grace that is freely giuen is not that grace which doth recommend vs vnto god
this is the peculiar of the grace of adoption the grace of aedification reacheth not so farre
but that which we must principally note is the heeding of the pelagians heresie who confounded nature with grace and grace with nature who as they did too shallowly thinke of the fall so they did derogate much from the fauour which god vouchsafed in restoring of man
but we must learne as to neglect no gift of god so to set a right estimate vpon the gifts of the gospel these gifts are by an excellencie called grace
and thus much of the nature of grace wee come now to the property thereof which is to fill
some refer this word vnto the person of christ as if that did fill all places and indeed it liued on earth descended into hell and so did enter into heauen it was successiuely in euery of these places
others straine it too farre that would haue the manhood to communicate with the deity in vbiquitie and to be at the same time in euery place
but as we grant attributa undefined span alphabet that supernaturall endowments in the highest degree were conferred vpon the manhood of christ so may we not admit any attributa undefined span alphabet therein we may acknowledge no attributes that destroy the nature of his manhood the truth of his manhoode is the greatest comfort of a christian whether wee respect what he hath done for vs or the blessed conformitie that we shall haue to him

it is true that these words of filling doe concerne christs manhoode or rather his person as hee was no lesse man than god for it speaketh of some thing that christ did after his resurrection there is no doubt but he filled all things with his godhead before which is euer infinite but the

manhood making one person hath diuers prerogatiues by vertue of the hypostaticall vnion
first it is euery where present though not with yet to his godhead and christus is totus vbique though totum christi is not vbique the whole person fils heauen and earth though the manhoode be finite
secondly both the natures are associat in their actions the manhood is priuie vnto and consents with the godhead in all the works of christ yea and the merit of christ whereunto the manhood concurred doth moderate all the actions of the mediatour
thus farre wee may safely speake of an vbiquity of christ but the proper sense of this place is not of the person but the worke it is true that he that fils is christ but that wherewith he fils is his grace

and grace is the only thing that fils
and it fils two manner of waies first sistendo appetitum for whereas all other things which wee desire grow quickly loathsome and tedious vnto vs and wee are faine to shift because wee finde wee haue not lighted vpon that which should giue vs content as we may gather out of the preachers censure vanitie of vanities and all is but vanity when wee come to grace there wee rest st austine giues the reason of it fecisti nos domine propter te irrequietum est cor nostrum donec requiescat in te and dauid expresseth it most passionately psal
whom haue in heauen but thee and there is none vpon earth that desire besides thee my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for euer
and no wonder for nothing can giue constant content but that which is verum and summum bonum that which is good indeed and is our soueraigne good these are found only in god none finde them but they that partake of him
secondly the same grace that doth sistere appetitum doth also explere as it doth giue vs content in that we desire no other thing so of that only we may haue our fill
other things are not onely worse than that wee principally desire but they are lesse and we therefore doe loath them not because they are not good at all for they are the creatures of god and they are made for our vse but because they beare not proportion vnto our desire when we haue them we finde a great want of something else besides them let a man haue all the riches in the world all the honour yea all the wisedome they will not satisfie him yea let euery power haue his distinct obiect yet they will not satisfie him there is a common obiect that they all desire and which onely can fill them the desire of them all and that is grace grace is the fulnesse of god as the apostle cals it ephes

and the prophesies of grace doe promise fulnesse

god will not onely prepare a table for vs but our cup shall ouerflow psal
here we hunger and thirst for a time but if grace be our portion we shall be satisfied and we shall be admitted to the tree of life and drinke our fill of the riuers of gods pleasure

but told you that this which you haue heard is nothing else but a periphrasis of the spirit for the filling grace is nothing else but the holy ghost this day as we read acts
when hee came he filled and filled not only with the type but also with the truth
that you may vnderstand this you must obserue that as christ our passeouer was sacrificed iust at the time of the legall passeouer and as he became the first fruits of

them that stept rising that very day that the first fruits were offered euen so the spirit was giuen vpon the very same day when god with his owne mouth pronounced the law in the hearing of the people the mysterie whereof was this that man can neuer haue the benefit of the law but by the grace of the spirit iustifying him by faith and making him a new man

but by the spirit we must vnderstand not only the grace but the person also or else it will neuer fill for as the corne that is sowne is but a small graine but being watered with the dewe of heauen and comforted with the sunne it comes to a full eare euen so grace when it beginnes in man it is very scant there must bee some bodie to foster and cherish it that it may come to perfection and that is the spirit
and herein appeares a difference betweene adam created and adam restored
adam created was furnished with grace and being so furnished was left to himselfe whereupon he quickely became an vnthrift and brought to nought that portion which he receiued of his heauenly father but being restored he is better prouided for hee hath the person of the spirit bestowed vpon him as a liuing roote so that although hee haue his winters and his autumne he doth not alwaies spring nor is alwaies loaden with good fruit yet he hath life in the roote which will shute forth againe and he that seemes to be dead will reuiue and like corne that stockes better when it is nipt with frost will afterward beare the more fruit
you haue heard the gift what it is now heare of the giuer and the giuer is christ
christ is the giuer of the spirit duplici iure originis meriti in that the spirit doth proceede from him so he is said to bestow him because ordo ad extra is answerable vnto ordo ad intra he hath also a right by merit he deserued in doing the worke of a redeemer to haue the bestowing of the spirit in this later sense must wee vnderstand it in this place and of this sense in the next part of the text
and here we must consider the difference betweene the hebrew of the old testament and the greek of the new accepit dona saith the psalmist dedit dona saith the apostle they are easily reconciled if you marke christs second power of giuing the holy ghost for accepit quae daret accepit ex merito quae daret ex arbitrio therefore st austine saith well vtroque verbo altero prophetico apostolico altero plenissimus sensus redditur the apostles are the best commentators vpon the prophets and when we parallel texts that are found in both wee must not oppose the one to the other but expound the one by the other which we may safely doe because in vtro{que est diuini sermonis auctoritas as the same father speaketh
seeing then christ receiueth what he giues receiues of his father what he giues to vs these words must be vnderstood of christ incarnate as god he could not receiue because he had all things wherefore if he receiue it must be as he became man so indeed he was christus anointed and his name was as an oyntment poured out cant
the precious oyntment poured on his head ran downe vnto the very skirts of his cloathing hee was made the sonne of righteousnesse and became the father of lights precious promises are giuen vnto vs by him and of his fulnesse we all receiue grace for grace

finally we must marke that though hee receiued as he was incarnate yet he giues as he is god for though accipere be meriti humani yet dare is potestatis diuinae though in neither giuing nor taking wee must seuer the person yet must wee in eyther obserue which nature is principally respected

as christ is the giuer of the spirit so doth he giue him discreetly and vniuersally discreetly for he giues undefined span alphabet hee keepes a measure in his giuing
there is this difference betweene the head and the body of the church the head hath the spirit without all measure but the members of the body haue it in measure neither doth this argue any impotency in christ the giuer but his wisedome
it is true that as it is in christs power to giue or not to giue so hee may giue as much or as little as hee will for hee may doe what hee will with his owne but hee doth not onely follow his will but the counsell of his will as this apostle teacheth vs

and the counsell of his will or his wisedome doth respect undefined span alphabet in the endowment of the church

as in our body naturall god hath ioyned beauty and commodity in framing the limmes so that euery one hath that proportion as is most comely and vsefull so the church though vna yet is varia though it be but one body yet hath it diuers members and though the one body be quickned with the same spirit yet in euery member the spirit doth varie his gifts and the church thereby is the more beautified and benefited so that no man is undefined span alphabet sufficient of himselfe but hee is thereby vrged to desire the communion of saints wherein stands our mutuall comelinesse and comfort
seeing then christ giues as hee thinkes meete euery man is bound to thanke him for that which hee hath and enuie must not make him murmure for that which hee hath not
it is absurd for a man to dislike with the dispensation of christ it is as if the members of the body should grudge that they haue not the endowments each of the other wherein if god should satisfie them the deformity and discommodity which would follow would quickly make them weary of their desires
though christ be thus discreet in giuing yet is hee kindly bountifull also for he giues to euery one
st ambrose hath a good rule in donis officiorum diuer sitas est non naturae all drinke of the same spirit though they drinke not the same draught as in our naturall body there is no member that liues not by the soule no more is there in the mysticall bodie any member that liues not by the spirit christ will haue euery one haue some token of his loue and will haue euery one stand the church in some stead

the church say for the particle all is limited by vs
there are gifts that are bestowed vpon all the world as wee acknowledge in our daily grace the eyes of all things looke vp vnto thee lord and thou giuest them their meate in due season thou openest thy hand and fillest with thy blessing euery liuing thing psal
but the graces here meant are the peculiar of the church you heard it in the gospell this day the spirit is such a thing as the world cannot receiue but the church seeth and knowes him and

he shall abide with her for euer for it is onely the church that can say the let is fallen to her in a faire ground she hath a goodly heritage

but the gifts that as vpon this day descended on the apostles were visible gifts and they had corporall effects speaking in diuers languages casting out diuells curing of diseases treading vpon serpents these gifts we haue not how then haue we the spirit that descended this day gregory the great answereth well thou hast it though it appeare in another sort thou canst not speake diuers tongues but of what nation soeuer thou art thou canst speake the language of canaan and it is as great a miracle that all nations vnderstand the same heauenly language as that the same person should speake all languages thou canst not cast out diuels out of mens bodies but out of their soules thou mayst and cure the diseases of their soule though thou canst not the diseases of their body yea bruise thou mayst the old serpents head though thou canst not safely tread vpon a snake
in a word thou mayst doe many things inuisibly and spiritually which are not inferiour to those things which the apostles did visibly and corporally and doubt not but if thou beare the fruit of the spirit the spirit of christ doth rest vpon thee
and if wee doe solemnize the memory of saints how much more should we solemnize the memory of the sanctifier wee are all bound to keep this day holy to the lord because this day the lord gaue that gift which doth concerne vs all
wherefore let vs all say blessed be the lord god euen the god of our saluation hee daily loadeth vs with his gifts euen the spirituall gifts of grace hee that giues them fill vs with them that as we are called to be so we may be indeed comely and profitable members of the mysticall body of christ and liue for euer conformable to our head
amen

the second sermon
on trinity sunday at an ordination of ministers
epigraph

ephes

he gaue some to be apostles some prophets and some euangelists and some pastors and teachers

the passage of scripture contained from the to the
verse doth informe vs of the reasons which perswade christians to agree in gods truth
these reasons are two drawne the one from the meanes whereby the other from the end for which the church receiues the spirituall gifts of god the meanes is christ
and touching christ st paul teacheth vs in this passage what he doth and what right he hath to doe it
that which hee doth is expressed three wayes but all yeeld but one sense
he giues grace
he bestowes gifts
he fils all things that is his gift is a filling grace
grace is a free gift a gift donum non salarium not an hyre of our labour but an argument of gods fauour
and this gift is free it is grounded vpon no obligation all gifts of men are in part due as the reciprocall between equals for loue challengeth loue or those that are not reciprocall between vnequals be they honoraria or eleemosynaria whereof the inferiour oweth the former to his superior in acknowledgement of his eminency and the superiour owes the latter vnto his inferiour out of a which hee must haue of his wants but gods gifts can neither bee deserued nor requited neither doth he finde ought worthy his regard in vs neither doth any danger of his moue him to commiserate vs his gift then is absolutely free
but this is common to the gifts as well of creation as of redemption but the scripture restraines the word grace vnto the gifts of redemption which are not onely non debita but indebita whereof god owes vs no one but he owes vs the contrary that is plagues and therefore hee doth giue not only non dignis to those that are without all merit of good but also indignis to those that are full of the merits of sinne
the word then is plainly euangelicall and signifieth such blessings as accompany the new testament those blessings are most properly termed grace

this grace hath a power to fill which no other thing hath and it fils sistendo and explendo desiderium it fixeth our wandring desires so that we

desire no other obiect and this is able to satisfie to the full and satisfie the whole man
now this filling grace is nothing else but the holy ghost
but by the holy ghost we must vnderstand not onely his gifts but also his person both are bestowed on vs the gifts to qualifie vs and the person to continue and increase these qualities in vs

and herein stands a great difference betweene adam created and adam redeemed adam had rich gifts but hee had not the promise of the spirit to perpetuate his gifts but we haue in christ
and indeed christ is the giuer st paul saith so but the psalmist makes him a receiuer they are easily reconciled for he receiued that which he gaue therefore christ here is vnderstood as hee is undefined span alphabet god and man hee receiued as man that which he gaue as he was god
and he gaue this discreetly according to a measure not his power but his wisedome moderated his gift and his wisedome had an eye to the comelinesse and commodity of his mysticall body the church
and although he gaue discreetly he gaue vniuersally to euery one is his grace giuen euery member hath a marke of his fauour and hath some gift wherewith he may stead the church
and thus farre we came the last sabbath in opening what christ doth we must now goe on and see another point herein contained in this
verse christ giues grace but hee giues it not without meanes for hee giues ministers
and of these ministers this verse doth shew vs the different degrees and the common originall the different degrees for some are apostles some prophets some euangelists the common originall for christ giues them all
of these points god willing briefly and in their order
first then christ that is our means vseth means himself giues grace before he giues grace
to vnderstand this we must obserue a distinction of grace there is grace of adoption and grace of edification the first makes christians the second maketh ministers christ giues the latter that by it he may giue the former
the ministers calling then stands in grace of edification that is in ability to bring others to the state of christians christ could doe it of himselfe he that at first made man after his image could repaire that image againe in man

and that he can doe it he sheweth plainly in those whom he first cals and maketh meanes to call others of these wee haue patternes adam abraham the apostles
so that though causa salutis be coniuncta yet it is arbitraria the vse of meanes in our saluation is not necessary but voluntary no minister may dreame that christ doth vse him because he needs him he must rather acknowledge how much he is bound to christ that he vouchsafeth to vse him though he hath no need of him
he doth honour him with the name of a and in the whole course of mans conuersion ministers beget vs to christ they nourish vs in christ they binde and loose our soules they open and shut heauen and in a word they saue
all these things christ doth by them and the people must acknowledge causam coniunctam the of the minister with christ st paul doth excellently expresse it by the resemblance

of an epistle written whereunto he compares the corinthians
cor
and makes the author thereof the spirit and himselfe hee vseth another similitude of husbandry
cor
whereunto concurreth god and himselfe the foolishnesse of preaching and the demonstration of the spirit goe together and faith is wrought by gods word but as it is heard from men
the people then may not seuer these they may not looke for inspirations from heauen without preaching on earth nor thinke that preaching on earth will preuaile without inspiration from heauen

but causae coniunctae are eyther coordinatae or subordinatae they are both of equall power or one hath soueraignty ouer the other christ concurres with man and man with christ but farre be it from vs to thinke that their power is equall in this businesse no dominium est christi ministerium hominis christ is lord man is but the seruant and therefore whatsoeuer man doth he must doe according to his instructions he may not presume to doe more or lesse balaam could tell balaac so and st paul deliuers nothing but what be receiued of the lord
we may not make new articles of faith nor institute new sacraments we may not publish any other couenant betweene god and man than our master is pleased to enter into nor set to any other seales than his
the angels behold gods face alwayes to direct their seruice and christ did not his owne but his fathers will when hee was on earth and shall man arrogate more vnto himselfe no he must still remember his subordination and venter no farther than he hath commission
haue not yet opened enough the inequality betweene christ and vs in this worke for indeed a minister is not only a subordinate cause but also no better than an instrument the efficacy of all that hee doth proceedeth from him that vseth it
other soueraignes giue their charge and leaue their seruants to vse their owne faculties in dispatch of their businesse and the worke is no greater than their faculties can compasse the embassadors and commissioners of princes beare witnesse to this truth according to their weaknesse or wisedome doth their errant speede but it is not so in that worke wherein christ and the minister concurres it is true that the minister must vse the vttermost of his endeauour and husband his talent to the best aduantage but his planting his watering his watching his building is of little force except the worke be set forward with a stronger hand except christ giue increase there is an inward influence which is soly christs and produceth the heauenly light and life
in regard of this ministers are but imagines as saint ambrose speaketh in psal
they do but outwardly delineate and represent in the word and sacraments what christ doth powerfully worke by his spirit
so that the minister seeth how farre hee is employed and how short hee comes in this worke of equality with christ
and seeing christ will haue our ministry vsher as it were his efficacy and will haue the people to reuerence our words if they meane to bee partaker of his workes chrysostome speaketh not amisse when he saith that we doe in potestate seruire so serue our master that we haue authority ouer the church and so we need not be ashamed nor may be contemned whose seruice is so honourable

and thus much in generall of the calling of the ministry come now to speake of their degrees

and here we must marke that they haue all a degree aboue others but yet they differ in degrees betweene themselues grace of adoption is common to all the church not so grace of edification the apostle implyes it in these words undefined span alphabet restraining the later grace to some few
and indeed if all should haue it the gift would bee contemptible for who cares for that which euery one hath and the distribution would be vnreasonable for how shall one member further another when all haue the same gift but in calling some and not the rest god doth prouide that his gift is mag is augustum more reuerend and the body of his church is mag is ordinatum better proportioned all then doe not partake this calling

it was a mutinous speech of corah dathan and abyram when they said to moses aaron you take too much vpon you seeing all the congregation is holy
it is true that all are holy in that they are christians yea in that they are christians they are anointed priests so the scripture cals them

and they haue spirituall sacrifices which they must offer but it is one thing to offer sacrifice another thing to offer publicke sacrifice it is one thing to offer for themselues another thing to represent the whole church vnto god this publicke function is peculiar to some the other is common vnto all
the like must we thinke of the other part of the ministrie euery one may reade gods word vnto himselfe and to his familie and may instruct himselfe and them therein but in gods house and in the presence of the whole congregation to dispense the mysteries or to take vpon him any where to set to gods seale of the sacrament is so peculiar to the stewards of his house that others may not presume to meddle therewith
but yet this is the honour that god hath done vnto all men that they are de genere sacerdotali euery one is capable of holy orders euery man say for st paul vpon good reason hath excluded women if hee bee fit he may be called to serue in the sanctuarie of god and administer in sacred things
and this is no small honour though the world thinke otherwise who thinke not that so to minister to god was a prerogatiue of the first borne the patriarkes made it their chiefe employment our sauiour christ did not disdaine it and they are basely proud that thinke themselues too good for it
but enough of the first difference the difference betweene the minister and his flocke and the degree they haue aboue it

as the clergie doe all differ from the laitie and haue a degree aboue them so doe they differ betweene themselues and haue each degrees aboue others it is cleare by the diuision that st paul makes in my text some apostles some prophets some euangelists

it is true that the gospell is but one that is committed to them all and all agree in this that they are but ministers but the same abilitie is not giuen vnto all to publish the gospel neither are they all trusted with alike ample charge
and yet this distinction is not such as that diuers of these degrees may not meete in one person though the gifts differ formally

et may they meete in the same subiect
a vegetable soule differs from a sensitiue a sensitiue from a reasonable and yet notwithstanding they all three meete in the soule of a man euen so though it be one thing to bee a pastor another thing to be a doctor yet may one man sustaine all these persons you will perceiue it when open the particulars

of these degrees then some be extraordinary some be ordinary the three first are extraordinary and serued for the first plantation of christian religion
of those three the apostles had plenitudinem ministerij the fulnesse of ministeriall power for their calling comprehended all the other degrees
and why they were to lay the foundations of the church so the apostle teacheth vs in this epistle and st iohn cals the twelue apostles the twelue foundations of the heauenly hierusalem reuel

they had infallibilitie of knowledge because they were to set downe the canon of the scripture their diocesse was all the world they might plant churches euery where their flocke were not only all nations but all pastors they had power not only to ordaine them but also to inable them neuer was the like ministeriall power giuen vnto meere men
as for the other two the prophet and the euangelist they had each of them a piece of the apostles power
the prophet of the new testament was he that was so well seene in the prophets of the old that he could discern the new testament in the old and shew how the one is confirmed by the other
this was his proper gift though hee had some other accessory which was to foretell future things to aduise in perplexed cases answerable vnto vrim and thummim and to discouer the secrets of mens thoughts which were occasionall works of the spirit of prophecie but the ordinary was that which first specified
the euangelist deliuered the new testament only and in doing that was assistant to the apostles following their directions and supplying their place whithersoeuer they were sent
this was their principall worke whereunto some of them had an accessory which was to record the summe of the gospel indited vnto them by the apostles so did luke and marke
besides these there were other gifts extraordinary as of speaking with strange tongues curing of diseases working of miracles but they serued rather for to raise attention than to conferre the grace of adoption and therefore they are not here specified these here specified are those which serue properly for that principall end and therefore they are only specified

the other two degrees are ordinarie pastors and teachers
some of the fathers make these different some take them to be but one degree
they that make them different hold the doctor or teacher to bee that person whose care is only to deliuer truth and the ground thereof whereby it is confirmed maintained against opposite errours such as were the catechists or lecturers in cathedral churches in the primitiue times of whom we read often mention in the ecclesiasticall story and the chancellors of churches were founded for this vse
but now it is apparent in the vniuersities where therebe speciall professors appointed to train vp youth in the knowledge of the truth and this is the principall vse of those nurseries of learning a blessed vse
the pastor is hee that resides vpon his cure

and takes care of the people to instruct them in the knowledge and feare of god and recall them when they goe astray and comfort them in perplexities of conscience

as it is true that there must be nurseries of learning and the testimony there of doth much recommend the pastour to the people so we must know that none may bee a pastor which is not undefined span alphabet able to teach though many be able to teach which are not pastors
therefore many of the fathers vnderstand one degree by these two names and the obseruation is that the names put the minister in minde of his duety hee must feede by teaching man liues not by bread only saith moses deut
but by euery word that goeth out of the mouth of god gods word is the bread of life and it is that wherewith pastors are trusted
neither may any man in the church take vpon him the name of pastor bee hee neuer so holy except god hath furnished him with some part of this prouision how should he be a guide that is blinde how should he be a steward that is not stockt but more particularly
if a pastors knowledge must bee food it is not enough if that which he preacheth be true hee must preach nothing but that which is profitable the pulpet is neyther for curious nor idle questions st paul hath censured both and it were to bee wished that all pastors of our church were so discreete as they did not neede such a censure
secondly whereas of food some is wholesome and some is vnwholesome it is not enough for the pastor to bring foode he must looke that it be wholesome food errours and heresies must be heeded and he must deliuer nothing for which he hath not good warrant he must feede the israel of god with no manna which comes not downe from heauen and they must drinke of no water but that which flowes from the spirituall rocke which rocke is christ
young students take vp much diuinitie vpon trust but whom doe they trust promiscuous authors both moderne and ancient they should be aduised in making their choyce and whomsoeuer they reade try before they trust try it at the touchstone of gods word and weigh what is said in the scales of the sanctuary which while they doe not they mistake them selues and misleade others
thirdly it is not enough that the foode be wholesome but it must be conuenient for there bee babes in christ as well as strong men so that the pastor must haue milke and strong meate and it is absurd to feede eyther men with milke or babes with strong meate each must be prouided for according to the power of his digestion
and here appeares much indiscretion in those that fit not their matter to their auditors being more carefull eyther of their owne praise or ease of their paines than of their good to whom they speake
in a word a pastor must neyther starue nor bane nor neglect reasonably to satisfie his flocke and blessed is the seruant whom his master when hee comes shall finde so doing yea and blessed are the people for god hath giuen vnto them pastors according to his owne heart ier
if they so feede with knowledge and vnderstanding

but it is not enough that the pastors deale so the people also must carry

themselues answerably vnto him they must not only heare doctorem but pastorem they must not only be the wiser but the better for that he saith the knowledge which they doe treasure vp in their head must as good food bee digested also in their heart and as good foode if it nourish sheweth it selfe in the vigour of our body so good lessons if they doe worke as they ought will shew themselues in our life and conuersation

finally as the degrees are partly extraordinary and partly ordinary so must the ordinary keepe correspondencie with the extraordinarie ministers now are not apostles yet they must bee apostolicke they are not prophets but they must bee propheticall they are not euangelists but they must be euangelicall that is they must imitate them in doctrine and discipline
and indeed what is a doctor but a prophet for both search out the true sense of the scripture the one did it by reuelation the other must doe it by meditation
and what is a pastor but an euangelist for both feede the flocke of christ though both be not enabled thereunto by the same meanes
and if the euangelist and the prophet doe share in the apostolicke function then the pastor and the teacher comming so neare them must needs haue good cognation with the apostles in the substance of their calling though not in the amplitude in that which they doe though not in the abilitie to doe it
and as the extraordinary differ in degree euen so doe the ordinarie also and so haue they euer done in the church the bishops haue succeeded the apostles though in a smaller modell yet in this that all orders are included in the sphere of their calling and as euangelists and prophets doe share in the apostolicke function so presbyters and deacons haue some parts of that higher calling which is in a bishop and they striue to bee wiser than the holy ghost that call for an equalitie the mother of confusion as if the same reasons did not still hold which moued the apostles to subordinate pastors
all may no more now be trusted with gouernement than they might heretofore and schisme is a weede that will spring in all ages yea the latter times are the worser and therefore they more neede the remedie
so that though the ground were onely humane which cannot bee proued the change of ecclesiasticall policie will be very dangerous and others haue made so ill tryall of equalitie that wee shall doe well for to continue the inequalitie especially considering the originall ipse dedit nazianzent inferreth ne contradicas obserue and reuerence the distinction considering the author and the author is christ
leauing to speake further of the degrees will now then come to speake of the originall

ipse dedit two words which yeeld two notes the person that giues he and the title of his ordinance

it is a gift
he the person is christ
it is true that the ordination of ministers is ascribed sometimes to the first person sometimes to the second and sometimes to the third
and indeed seeing the ordination is by the gift of the spirit all that can giue the spirit may be reputed the originall of holy orders this being a worke ad extra of those we must pronounce undefined span alphabet euery of the persons hath a hand in them

in all such works we must acknowledge the trinitie

in vnitie vnitie in the action representing the vnitie of the essence of god and a trinitie in the efficients representing a trinitie of the persons in god

and indeed this mysterie of trinitie in vnitie the memoriall whereof wee solemnize this day cannot better bee studied than in the effects that giue vs a glimpse of it and of all effects none more comfortable than those of our redemption and the meanes whereby wee are made partakers thereof wherein euery person is pleased to shew his loue to man
but yet as in other workes so in this they keepe an order and that order the greeke fathers call undefined span alphabet the latine fathers dispensationem though with consent and concurrencie of the other two persons some one shewes himselfe principally in the worke
in this worke the second person he as head of the church master of the assemblies and chiefe shepheard and high steward of gods house appoints all vnder officers he sent the apostles and by the apostles others

and this his sending is called here a gift and well it may be so called for god might haue left vs in the dregges of our corrupt nature or after we are called suffer vs to relapse but hee is pleased to appoint meanes of our new birth and to recouer vs when we fall which wee may well call a gift
secondly it is such a gift as men desire
in the fift of deuteronemie it appeares that when the israclites had once heard god they desired to heare him no more they desired a moses and god was pleased to yeelde to their desire and hath euer since fedde them by men
thirdly this dedit is not restrained only to the apostles time for they had semen in speciem the church hath still the same commandement and the same promise and must propagate these functions and what wee doe christ doth by vs fourthly no man must take it before its giuen no man must take this office before he is called seeing it is a power no man must vsurpe it without his leaue to whom god hath giuen all power especially seeing the sinewes of it are the assisting spirit of whose presence no man may presume without imposition of hands for he breathes where he will not where we will christ though hee bee gone from the church doth not destitute his church if the church will follow his ordinance
finally holy orders are a gift therefore not to be bought symony is opposite to the nature of them precio res nulla deiconstat

this generall rule is specially true of holy orders and therefore thinke the schooles call grace of edification gratis datam am sure these things must be freely receiued giuen

conclude when wee looke vpon holy orders we must obserue two duties that are required reuerence which is called for by the author and obedience by the vse
and god grant that we may both pastor and people so be affected to these meanes and so be wrought by them as that god may haue his glory and we may reape our good
amen

the third sermon

ephes

vers
wherefore he saith when he ascended vp on high heled captiuitie captiue and gaue gifts to men
now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended vp farre aboue all heauens that he might fill all things

the church is but one and therefore the members thereof should liue at one two speciall reasons mouing hereunto the apostle in the second part of this chapter alledgeth the first of which is drawne from the meanes whereby the second from the end wherefore the church is indued with manifold graces
of the meanes haue begun heretofore to speak and told you that the meanes is christ and touching christ the text doth teach what he did and what right he had to doe it of these two points haue handled the former at seuerall times haue shewed you what christ did it followeth that now goe on and shew what right he had to doe it
and the apostle will shew vs that christ did no more than he might he gathereth it from christs ascension for that ascension was a deserued triumph
in a triumph as they which are read in stories doe know there were two obserueable things the person of the conquerour was carried in state and the monuments of the conquest did attend his chariot and were disposable at his pleasure behold these things in the ascension of christ first exaltation of his person hee ascended on high farre aboue all heauens secondly the attendants vpon his exalted person hee led captiuity captiue and gaue gifts to men such was his triumph
and this triumph was deserued for he was not exalted before he was humbled that hee ascended what was it but that hee first descended yea he ascended not so high but hee first descended as lowe as hee ascended farre aboue all heauens so hee descended into the lower parts of the earth the same person is the subiect of both he that ascended is the very same that descended
these are the particulars whereof shall god willing now speake briefly and in their order and first of the exaltation of his person

and the exaltation was the ascending thereof on high

ille triumphato capitolia ad alta corintho victor agit currus

on high saith st hierome that is to an high place and state
first to a place localis homo saith fulgentius ad thrasimundum christ being

man wheresoeuer he is he is in a place and st austin tolle spatia corporibus non erunt christ could not haue a body and that body not contained in a place whatsoeuer deuices the vbiquitaries haue to colour their conceits of the illocality of christs body by that rule of st austin and st austins rule is grounded vpon the nature of bodies they cannot auoide a contradiction

into a place then christ ascended and it is behoofefull for vs so to thinke for as christs ascension was so shall ours be christ speaketh it expresly where am

there saith christ in his prayer will that all that beleeue in me be also and st paul doth distinguish betweene our presence and absence from the lord which could not be if christs body were euery where

where the place is whereinto christ ascended we may gather out of the word undefined span alphabet which doth often signifie heauen god on high is as much as god in heauen but st paul here puts it out of all doubt when hee saith he ascended farre aboue all heauens meaning the visible heauens and so pointing at the place which hee elsewhere calleth the third heauen

which is a place appointed to bee the receptacle of saints
what manner of place it is we need not curiously enquire wee should rather striue to come to the place of this wee may bee assured that being the place which god hath assigned wherein hee will haue angels and men enioy blessednesse it must needes bee a blessed place it is resembled to paradise wherein grow the trees and runne the waters of euerlasting life it was shadowed by the holy land flowing with milke and honey it was represented to st iohn in that glorious heauenly hierusalem that came downe from heauen it is called gods house gods sanctuary the city of god and the kingdome of heauen the pleasures thereof we finde touched in the
and in the
psalmes
this must be obserued concerning the place because it is the first steppe of felicitie this earth is the valley of teares and they that liue here are in condition answerable to the place mortall in a mortall place and christ hauing put off his mortality was no longer to abide in a place of mortality
but enough of the place

christ ascended not onely in place but in state also in a blessed place he had a blessed state and his state is reduced to two branches glory and power for he sate downe on the right hand of god and the right hand of god singifieth both first glory
they that come neare in place to the person of a king come neare also in glory and dignity vnto him
st paul saith he was receiued vp into glory
dauid psal
he was crowned with glory and worship the author to the hebrewes he is set downe at the right hand of maiesty farre aboue all powers and principalities hauing a name giuen him aboue all names
and this is opposed to the forme of a seruant which christ tooke in the dayes of his flesh while hee was in the world he emptied himselfe of glory and made himselfe of no reputation becomming as the scorne of men and of the people not a house to hide his head but after the resurrection he appeares in another habit
in the first of the reuelation and other passages of that booke iohn saw him as the king of glory and the fathers interpret those words in the psalme

be opened ye gates and be ye lifted vp ye euer lasting doores and the king of glory shall come in of the ascension of christ and entring into his glory for then did he lift vp himselfe aboue the heauens and his glory aboue all the earth

as his state was full of glory so was it also of power for all power was then giuen vnto him both in heauen and earth and all knees bowed vnto him all things were put vnder his feet and he became king of kings and lord of lords

yea he heares vp all things with the word of his power it usharper than any sword
the psalmist compares it to sharpe arrowes psal
he hath an tron scepter in his hand wherewith he breakes the wicked as a potters vessell finally he reignes in the middest of his enemies
and this power is opposed to that weaknesse wherein he appeared in the dayes of his flesh the condition of that time is amply set downe esay
wherein you shall see nothing but passion and subiection and the gospell confirmes that prophesie wherein you shall finde that from the day of his birth vntill the moment that he gaue vp the ghost christ endured as if hee were the subiect of euery wicked mans blasphemous tongue or bloudy hands but the case is now altered for his enemies are now the patients and he the agent they are subiect vnto him and hee can as hee will bridle and crush them for his kingdome is ouer all
this is the summe of the exaltation of christs person and our nature in his person for hee made vs sit with himselfe in heauenly places that will appeare better in the second part of the triumph

wherein noted two particulars the first was that the monuments of the conquest did attend the chariot of the conquerour incedunt vinctae longo ordine gentes quam vartae linguis habitu tam vestis armis to this allude these words he led captiuity captiue and indeed undefined span alphabet notes that which is taken by force undefined span alphabet christ was the lyon of the tribe of iudah and esay cap

he is described as a glorious conquerour shah the prey be taken from the mighty or the captiuity of the iust be deliuered thus saith the lord the captiues of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be deliuered esay
christ the stronger man entered the strong mans house he bound him he rifled him

but st austin on these words obserues a distinction of captiues and captiuity

austin on these words obserues a distinction of captiues and captiuity there is inuolunt aria captiuit as and voluntaria whereof the former is misera the later faelix the fiends of hell were taken captiues christ triumphed ouer them and made a shew openly of them and the children of god were taken captiues

for they are undefined span alphabet a purchased people and st paul tels vs that the weapons of his spirituall warfare are mighty through god to the pulling downe of strong holds casting downe imaginations and euery high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of god and bringing into captiuity euery thought to the obedience of christ
the children of god are deliuered from captiuity but to continue captiues still for they must take vpon them christs yoake and they must account themselues not their owne but his the very same doth st paul meane rom
when he saith that of seruants of sinne we are made seruants to righteousnesse for servus and captivus are synonoma's
but betweene these

captiues there is this difference that the first are vnwillingly captiues and in their captiuity are miserable for they are reserued in chaines of darknesse for the iudgement of the great day and they take little content in this thraldome but as for the children of god they are glad that they haue so changed their master and well they may be for they are made happy by the change for their seruice is perfect liberty and what can our heart more desire in this difference captiuity being vnderstood of both sorts it is true that they attend christs chariot the wicked vincti as prisoners the godly coronati as being conquerours for what christ did hee did for them and there is a sense thereof in euery one of them

but how is this true that eyther the one or the other are so captiues seeing this our apostle in this very epistle doth tell vs

that we striue not with flesh and bloud but with powers and principalities and spirituall wickednesse in heauenly places
we must therefore obserue that christ hath taken away from sathan two things ius in nos and dominium in nobis
his right vnto vs hath christ taken away absolutely in his owne person for christ hath the keyes of death and hell and sathan cannot stirre but when and as farre as christ giues him leaue
as for dominium in nobis christ hath taken that away by putting his spirit into vs and thereby mortifying the old man but yet so that wee still consist as well of the old as of the new the flesh rebels against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh thus christ is pleased to exercise vs that wee may imitate his triumph and by experience of our trampling vpon sathan be vndoubtedly assured that christ hath bruised his head
st paul was buffeted by a messenger of sathan he prayed and christ answered him my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weaknesse if we would but resist the deuill he would fly from vs if we would resist say stedfast in faith for the shield of faith is able to quench all siery darts of the deuill
the martyrs tryed it who neither were circumuented by the serpent nor dismayed by the lyon but ouercame by the bloud of the lambe in that they loued not their liues vnto death and therefore with crowns with palms and harpes they sing the triumphant song of moses
and we must all be resolued that as ioshua when he had ouercome the kings of canaan brought them and made the heads of israel to set their feete vpon their neckes euen so iesus that hath spoyled the powers of darknesse will haue his members with like confidence to insult vpon them
yea it is a part of that iust and glorious reuenge of adams cowardise in his great strength hee yeelded himselfe a prey to sathan when he had full power to withstand him to blot out that shame hee will haue the sonnes of adam that are much weaker to encounter and trample on that mighty hunter and serpentine lyon
and wee much neglect the honour that christ would doe vs and the manifestation of that power which hee is pleased to vouchsafe vs if so be wee haue no testimony from our owne conscience that wee haue in our owne persons experience of this triumph
tertullian hath a good rule that oftentimes men are foyled not

because he that set on them was the stronger but they did not know or vse their owne strength that did resist
it is the case of most men neede no other proofe than their enormous falls the reason why they become sathans prey is their cowardise or their negligence eyther they doe not at all resist or they pray not for assistance vnto god if they did they might confidently say with saint paul can doe all through him that strengthneth me philip

and that is christ
but howsoeuer we faile in doing what we should this is sure that this conflict is no disproofe of the triumph seeing the intent of it is to be a perpetuall euidence or rather an euident perpetuation thereof

and so haue you the first attendant vpon the triumphant chariot

the second is the disposing of the spoiles he gaue gifts and hee that rifled the strong man distributed whatsoeuer hee found in his house
touching the nature of the gifts need not speake now former words of my text occasioned mee to open them here onely you must marke originem and mensuram donorum though they were giuen often before yet tho dispensation depended vpon christs ascension

in saint iohn we reade that the spirit was not giuen because christ was not yet glorified and acts
saint peter tels the iewes that christ being exalted poured forth the spirit yea christ himselfe acts
when hee was readie to ascend biddeth his disciples stay at ierusalem vntill they were endued with power from aboue
and no wonder that it depends vpon his ascension seeing it is an effect of his kingdome and his kingdome began properly at his ascension
and as this is true of the originall so is it also of the measure of the gifts though hee gaue them before yet hee neuer gaue them in that measure whether you respect the number of persons that partake them or the degree of the gifts which were bestowed on them
saint peter
pet

compares the gifts of the prophets vnto a candle the gospell vnto the day light a great oddes betweene the lights and as great oddes is there betweene the spheares of their actiuity for it is no great roome that a candle can illighten be it neuer so great a candle and the prophets went not out of the holy land ordinarily and that was but a corner of the world but the sunne goeth out from one end of heauen and the circuit thereof is vnto the end of it and there is nothing hid from the heate of it psalme
euen so the sunne of righteousnesse shed his beames ouer all the world and christ after his ascension made his church catholike euen wee that are assembled here are beholding for this our sacred assembly vnto the ascension of christ from thence it is that this light is come to vs
and as often as in our creede we remember his ascension let vs thankfully remember that we owe this our spirituall condition vnto it
and let this suffice for the opening of christs triumph

my text doth not onely tell vs of a triumph but tells vs also that that triumph was deserued christ by vertue of his hypostaticall vnion was able to doe all that is specified in the triumph to ascend in place and state to leade captiuity captiue and to giue gifts
but hee would not attaine

it onely by power hee would receiue it by merit and why hee stood out for man and therefore would obserue the articles of that couenant which god did enter into with him and the couenant was hoc fac viues
though adam being created holy was immediately fit for heauen yet god would not haue him come vnto heauen but by vse of his holinesse in obedience to god euen so christ would fulfill all righteousnesse and vndergoe the crosse in satisfaction for our sinne before hee would enter into glory
and wee must not deceiue our selues and dreame of any other course for though wee cannot equall christs crosse yet by mortification and tribulation wee must resemble it though wee cannot fulfill the law yet must wee doe our vttermost endeauour
and this course must bee vnto vs though not causa a merit as it was to christ yet via regnandi the meanes vnto the kingdome of heauen without which no man shall euer haue accesse vnto the blessed presence of god

but more distinctly wee must marke that the descension went before the ascension and that the degree of the ascension beares correspondencie to the degree of the descension
first the descension goeth before the ascension and it must needs doe so in christ you will acknowledge it if you know what the descension is the descension is the incarnation and the passion of christ in respect of these the sonne of god is said to descend
and indeede he fell below himselfe when he submitted himselfe to them by so much as a man is below god and so to bee vsed being a man is little answerable to the maiesty of a god
had hee not thus descended hee could neuer haue ascended for whither should hee ascend that was in the forme of god and so as coaequall as coaeternall what state what place could hee bee aduanced vnto that as god was highest in both but his pleasure to descend made it possible for him to ascend it was possible for him to ascend in regard of that wherein hee did descend hee might glorifie his manhood in which hee was pleased to be humbled
secondly as the descension must needes goe before the ascension so doth the ascension keepe good correspondency with the descension christ ascended high farre aboue all heauens and hee descended lowe into the lowest part of the earth not onely to the earth the lowest part of the world but euen to the lowest part of the earth for wee say in our creed he descended into hell he tooke his rising from the lowest place to ascend into the highest
and herein doth christ reade a good lecture to vs hee teacheth vs that humility is the way to glory and the more we are humbled the more wee shall be exalted
adam and angels were both ambitious both did desire to climbe but they mistooke their rising and so in climbing tooke grieuous falls
if wee would climbe without a fall wee must learne to climbe of christ so shall wee bee sure to tread the steppes of iacobs ladder which from earth will reach as high as heauen

may not omit to obserue that the apostle speakes significantly when hee saith that he that ascended is the same also that descended non ascendit alius licet aliter
nestorius was condemned for an hereticke who distracted christs two natures and made of them two persons but as it is gods truth so it is our great comfort that the person is but one and these are the workes of one and the selfe same person they both concerne the same person in the nature which hee tooke from vs hee that was humbled is the same person that was exalted
and so will god deale with vs crowne no other person than him that doth conflict and in the depth of our humiliation euery one of vs may say with iob chapt

though after my skinne wormes destroy this body yet in my flesh shall see god
non alius

sed aliter though the same person of christ ascended which descended yet hee ascended otherwise than hee descended for hee descended metaphysically ascended physically hee descended not by changing of place but of state the godhead that is infinite could change no place but it could exinnanite it selfe and become of a worse condition than it was
but in the ascension the person changed place the manhood remoued from earth to heauen hee that in his incarnation being onely god became man in his ascension went into heauen god and man hee that to make way to his passion suspended the influence of his godhead into his manhood did in his ascension permit the one to indowe the other so far as a creature was capable of the influence of his creatour
and wee shall ascend though not other men yet otherwise than wee descend wee descended morally but wee shall ascend physically in our descending wee put on other affections than before wee had wee exchange our naturall pride for christian humility but in our ascension wee shall change our place remoue out of this wildernesse into canaan from earth to heauen and the same god that is pleased here for a time to make vs sowe in teares will then yeeld vs a plentifull haruest which wee shall reape in ioy wee shall then see the fulnesse of his loue towards vs which too vsually wee misdeeme by reason of the crosse which hardly can wee conceiue that it can stand with his good will towards vs castigo te non quod odio habeam sed quod amem is a proposition more true than euident the combination is so strange that it is no wonder if we be hard of beleefe but god will then cleare it and we shall confesse we had no reason to discredit it

one note more and so an end
before you heard of grace now you see that grace is a spoile a spoile taken from that enemy that tyrannized ouer vs and this is no small improuement of grace
before you heard that grace did fill vs but now you see that wee were captiues and the condition of captiues is to endure hunger nakednesse all kinde of miserie and how welcome is that grace that fils such empty persons before you heard that this grace was a gift but here you finde that christ payed dearely for it the more it cost him the more precious should it bee in our eyes
what shall say then to you but wish you to couple

this third sermon with the first that you may bee more feeling of the loue of god in christ

lord that wouldest descend before thou diddest ascend grant that wee may make our way through humility to glory giue vs grace to consummate thy triumph by manfully resisting and conquering of sathan let vs not feare to tread on him whom thou hast disarmed yea enrich vs wee beseech thee with the spoyles which thou hast taken from him and make vs euer willing and deuout captiues of thine let it neuer grieue vs to serue thee who hast so mercifully saued vs let vs now ascend in heart whither we hope to ascend in place and so prepare vs on earth by a holy conuersation that wee may partake with christ of a happy condition in the kingdome of heauen
amen

kings cap

vers
if there bee in the land famine if there bee pestilence blasting mildew locust if there bee caterpillers if the enemie besiege them in the lund of their cities
whatsoeuer plague whatsoeuer sickenesse there be
what prayer and supplication soeuer bee made by any man or by all thy people israel which shall know euery man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands towards this house
then heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place and forgiue and doe and giue to euery man according to his wayes whose heart thou knowest
for thou euen thou onely knowest the hearts of all the children of men
that they may feare thee all the daies that they liue in the land which thou gauest to our fathers

the&se words are a clause of that prayer wherewith king salomon did dedicate the temple and expresse that vse thereof which commeth very neare our present case
our case is twofold we suffer from gods wrath wee are suppliants to gods mercy
and lo two like cases are presented in these words the case of sufferers verse
and in the three next verses the case of suppliants

but more distinctly to rip vp the text we will consider therein first

the manner of the deliuerie and secondly the matter that is deliuered
the manner it is a prayer the words are conceiued in that forme
in the matter we shall see
whom these words concerne and
wherein they doe concerne them
those whom they concerne are the inhabitants of canaan the children of israel the people of god this you may gather out of the
and
verses
and they concerne them in two maine points for they shew first that they may vnderlye the heauie hand of god secondly that they must then haue recourse vnto the throne of grace

the heauie hand of god is here set downe first definitely it may afflict israel eyther only in their persons by famine and pestilence or onely in their possessions by blasting and mildew distempers of the aire whose corruption breedeth also vermine to worke the same mischiefe locusts and caterpillers or ioyntly in their persons and possessions by the sword when the enemie doth besiege them in the land of their cities
definitely thus is the heauy hand of god exprest
it is exprest also indefinitely lest israel should thinke that these bee all the instruments of gods wrath salomon addeth a more liberall phrase whatsoeuer plague whatsoeuer sicknesse there may bee it may bee in the land god hath many more waies to afflict israel than are exprest
this is israels first case a bad one
it hath another and a better
when israel doth vnderlye the heauy hand of god then must israel haue recourse vnto the throne of grace
and here we will obserue first that god which sendeth calamities prouideth his church of a remedie
secondly though the calamities bee many yet the remedie is but one the onely remedy of all calamities is penitent deuotion my text calleth it prayer and supplication
touching this deuotion we shall learne here the performance and the acceptance of it
vnto the performance two acts concurre one inward penitents must know euery one the plague of his owne heart the other outward the penitents deuotion must be attended with conuenient ceremonies here are two specified the one of the hands they must bee strecht out the other of the eye that must looke towards the temple of salomon
thus must the deuotion be performed
and it must be performed by euery israelite in particular any man that will bee penitent must performe it so and all israel must performe it so if they will be penitent the text is plaine for both
the penitent deuotion that is thus performed god will accept and touching his acceptance wee are here taught wherein it consisteth and whereat it aymeth
it consisteth in two things god will giue accesse to penitent prayers then heare thou in heauen the place of thy dwelling
secondly hee will giue redresse vnto the sufferings of the penitent a redresse to the cause of them that is he will forgiue sinne a redresse to the effect of sinne that is woe he will doe what they desire and giue ease to their paine

but marke god dispenseth his double grace discreetly he will giue to men but according to their waies those waies not outward but inward

he will giue according to their wayes whose heart he knoweth and this heart though vnknowne to all others cannot be hid from him he he only knoweth the hearts of all the children of men
as god dispenseth discreetly so vniuersally he dispenseth vnicuique to euery man of eyther sort according to his wayes
well god doth accept penitent denotion
but whereat doth he ayme in this acceptance surely at the amendment of israel he doth it that israel may feare him and be constant in this amendment feare all the dayes that they liue
and the place where they liue putteth a double obligation vpon them first it is ha aretz ha adama a very eminent land secondly their tenure is francke almoine hee whom they must feare gaue it to their fathers

you see beloued that the particulars which haue pointed out are many and they are pertinent yet feare not that will be ouer long remember the mortalitie of your hearing my speaking it shall therfore suffice that moderately touch at them only god vouchsafe by them to touch vs all to the quicke
let vs then beginne with the manner of the deliuerie
my text is conceiued in the forme of a prayer but in the next chapter this prayer is made a promise so that shall not mistake if turne the words into seuerall assertions and you shall lose nothing for in the close wil returne them into a petition againe
this is all will say of the manner of deliuerie

in the matter deliuered wee must first see whom these words concerne and the text telleth vs that they are the inhabitants of canaan the children of israel the people of god if say no more this were enough to notifie them but it is expedient for my purpose that moreouer dignifie them they were the peculiar of god

his iewell of men a royall priesthood an holy nation

trusted with gods oracles depositaries of his couenant they possessed the arke and christ according to the flesh was the of that nation

you may finde more of their honours in the new testament and in the old but these may suffice to shew how neare they came and how deare they were to god

and yet may this people vnderlye the heauie hand of god israel may be made as egypt a theater of plagues the paradise of god may become like sodome and gomorrah a monument of vengeance the holy ghost foretold it and the euent hath iustified it
the church hath no priueledge from gods iudgements god spareth sinne in none hee will visit it with scourges wheresoeuer hee findeth it
yea so farre is the church from being priuiledged that it is though a strange one yet a prerogatiue of the church to drinke first of the cup of gods wrath
iudgement saith st peter cap


must beginne at gods house
god in the stripes of his children letteth the world see what it must expect
and indeed the perswasion would not be forcible if the argument ranne thus god striketh his enemies therefore he will strike his friends who would be moued with it but if it runne thus he striketh his friends therefore he will not spare his enemies the conclusion is vnauoydable

what then is our lesson bee not high minded but feare rom
and

let him that standeth take heed lest he fad cor
for he that falleth into sinne will fall vnder wrath the israelites are to vs types of morall correspondencies what befell them may befall vs
and it is happy that it may for nulla poena maxim a poena a man is neuer in worse case than when hee is most at ease such ease temporall is the harbinger of eternall paine neither doe men much intend their saluation who are not quickned thereunto by some temporall affliction
a stray sheepe will neuer returne into the way except it bee forced by the shepheards staffe and god neglecteth them as bastards

who neuer feele that rod wherewith hee vseth to correct his children
you see then that the prerogatiue of the church which is not onely an vndoubted truth but whatsoeuer flesh and bloud may thinke to the contrary it is a great blessing it is a blessing that the church may vnderlye the heauie hand of god it was israels blessing and it is ours that wee may vnderlye gods heauie hand

may nay doe
it cannot be doubted that wee may seeing it is euident that we doe the next point in the text will confirme that wherein we shall see the heauie hand of god which we vnderlye
it is set forth first definitely then indefinitely both clauses make vp an abridgement of the
of deuteronomie a chapter which was read but euen now vnto you a chapter which he that will bee penitent cannot reade too often and if he reade it feelingly it will make him penitent indeed am sure the holy ghost thought so that doth borrow into the other canonicall bookes many passages hence to worke this pious affection

but you will say what is this to christians it was spoken of the israelites yes it concernes christians much for in the new testament our sauiour christ in his sermon matthew chap

speaking of the end of the world saith there shall be famine and pestilence and warre the very plagues mentioned in my text
st iohn in the reuelation cap

commenting vpon that sermon of christ doth tell vs of the like plagues which should follow in the world after his time they haue bin in other ages before vs and they are euen now in ours yea they are come vpon vs come and see the blacke horse he is gone forth whose rider hath ballances in his hand and proclaimeth a measure of wheate for a penny and a measure of barley for a penny and vse wine and oyle thriftily reuel

the words denounce a famine in phrases respectiue and agreeable to that countrey which will not now stand to expound only thus much let me tell you that the vnseasonable weather which hath continued long with vs may make vs feare that god this yeare will breake the staffe of our bread send vs cleannesse of teeth and pinch vs by the belly
and this plague is not a little aggrauated by the circumstance of time

it is a pitifull thing when we haue seene a fair spring and the fruits of the earth in a good forwardnesse when haruest commeth

to haue a great deale of grasse and little hay a great deale of straw and but a little corne and surely if god send not better weather the husbandmans hopes and paines will proue but vaine and fruitlesse
if any man desire to know the fearefull euill of this first plague famine let him reade in the
of deuteronomie the holy

ghost hath there so described it that his heart must needs bleede that readeth it

surely a king of israel a wicked king could not but be moued when hee did but heare that there was a proofe thereof in samaria and how passionately doth the prophet ieremie lament the like proofe in ierusalem

let vs in our humiliation pray god that wee bee neuer driuen to experience the like
you may call this plague the plague of luxurie

you haue heard the first plague a grieuous plague but not the onely plague for we may say in the prophets words esay
yet for all that his wrath is not turned backe but gods hand is stretched out still
and that because of another yet which we finde in the prophet amos cap

yet for all that haue yee not turned vnto mee saith the lord
if the first plague doe not rowse men god hath a second to send the first is a plague of poore men he that hath mony in his purse will say if there bee no victuals in england haue wherewithall to fetch them from beyond sea will not starue god hath a plague in store for such which their purses cannot keepe from them
would therefore haue them come and see the pale horse and his rider his name that sate thereon was death
by death st iohn meaneth pestilence hee speaketh in the dialect of the septuagint who render the hebrew deber by undefined span alphabet both in moses deut
and in my text the reason is because the pestilence is indeed a mortall disease
the hebrew deber signifieth a word a word gone out of gods mouth against all sorts of men
in the booke of wisedome cap

wee reade that when the first borne of egypt were destroyed they were destroyed by the almighty word of god that leaped downe from heauen as a mighty man of warre certainely it imports that wrath is gone out from god and by gods commandement the punishing angell hath the sword put into his hand
you may call this plague the plague of pride and disdaine
for how can god better answer it in his iudgement than by bringing men to such a case that not onely their bodies are filled with a loathsome disease but also that their nearest and dearest friends stand aloofe from their sore

and they cannot in reason desire that they should come neare them in so desperate a danger they are in a most disconsolate condition

might out of histories describe the miserie of this disease out of our owne chronicles might shew you

how desolate it hath made many places in this land
but to what end should spend time whereas it is not so long since the last great plague but that the most of this auditorie may well remember the euill of it and doubt not but euery one of vs will feare it though hee bee not admonished
only let me aduise you to correct one wicked phrase which is too frequent in mens mouthes whether in iest or in earnest thus they vse to curse others with whom they deale a plague or the plague of god bee on him or on his and god hath heard vs though not to satisfie our wicked desire yet to punishout wicked tongues
will say no more of this second plague the second of those plagues whereby god afflicteth only our persons

but gods iudgements are not confined to our persons yet for all this his wrath is not turned backe but his hand is stretched out still
and why because yet for all this plague we returne not vnto the lord therefore god

hath another plague in store whereby he doth afflict our possessions blasting and mildew distempers of the aire proceeding sometimes from too much drought the cause of blasting sometimes too much moysture the cause of mildew at leastwise the words in the originall doe point out an excesse in these two qualities
god promised to noah that there should be winter and summer seede time and haruest gen
but this promise must bee vnderstood of gods generall prouidence ouer the world and no doubt but in many parts of the world the parts of the yeare haue that seasonable temper
but god hath not tyed himselfe to euery particular place as if he may not for sinnes make as he threatneth in the law their heauen brasse and their earth iron so that neyther the heauen shall drop downe his vsuall fatnesse nor the earth shew forth her vsuall fruitfulnesse if we disorder our liues god will disorder the seasons of the yeare and wee should reflect our eyes from the great heauen and earth vpon the heauen and earth of this our little world see the correspondencie of the one to the other and rectifie this if wee desire that the other should bee rectified

from the distemper of the aire proceed the vermine here specified second afflictors of our possessions locusts and caterpillers which haue their names the one from being a great deuourer the other from comming in great swarmes so great that sometimes they haue darkened the sunne as stories report both lay all waste wheresoeuer they come the scripture maketh them godshost ioel
and surely when they set vpon a nation the greatest armies of the mightiest potentates are more easily rectified than they can bee
wee are not god bee thanked so much troubled with those creatures as hotter countries are and yet wee are not free from them altogether they haue sometimes done much mischiefe in this land
there is a kinde of metaphoricall locusts and caterpillers locusts that came out of the bottomelesse pit meane popish priests and iesuits and caterpillers of the common weale proiectors and inuentors of new tricks how to exhaust the purses of the subiects couering priuate ends with publicke pretences
but will not now trouble youwith them
only let me tell them that in well gouerned states they were wont to bee called pestes reipublicae plagues of the common wealth
but to goe on neither doth this plague exhaust all gods wrath it is not turned backe but his hand is stretched out still
and that because that yet for all this we doe not returne to god

come therefore and behold the red horse and him that sitteth thereon to whom power is giuen to take peace from the earth that men may kill one another and to him a great sword was giuen
and indeede this was the plague of the sword which is a manisold plague

it seizeth not only vpon our persons nor only vpon our goods but vpon both it spareth neyther a mans own person nor his familie nor his goods it containeth in it famine and pestilence especially if it be a besieging sword such as is specified in my text
the rich may prouide against famine great men may shift their dwelling to escape the pestilence who can fly from the sword which beareth downe kings and kingdomes princes and principalities let

vs goe no farther than a royall branch of this kingdome who hath long been a pitifull instance of this plague of the sword wee now labour for the recouery thereof and let it be none of the least importunities of our humiliation to sollicite god that we may happily effect it
to point out the miseries of warre were too tedious a worke for this time referre you to the prophecie of ioel cap

where you may see the image of it especially to ieremies lamentations which are able to make euen a stonie heart lament it bitterly lament the impiety the impurity the iniquity that followes the sword

wee reade indeede in the gospell of a centurion that built a synagogue for the iewes luke
but how many centurions doe wee reade of that haue spoyled and ruined thousands of churches we reade of a centurion which gaue much almes acts
but how many centurions are there that make all prey that commeth to hand and grow rich and mighty by the destruction of whole countries happely you reade of one scipio that tendred the honour of matrons and virgins but what more common with souldiers the greatest commanders amongst them than to rauish wiues and daughters souldiers for the most part feare neither god nor man
we may then well conclude that the sword is a fearefull plague
behold now in these definite stroakes of god how gods iudgements answer our sinnes wee starue our soules through neglect of grace and god pineth our bodies with want of food
wee disperse the vernome of our wickednesse and infect others out of the malignancy of our nature which is maliciously ambitious to spread it selfe and god hee sendeth a venome into our bodies that is most contagious and poysoneth all that come neare vs the pestilence of the body is herein very like to the pestilence of the soule they are both alike malignant vnto others
wee fight against god by our sinnes as if we would dethrone him and vsurpe his kingdome wee attempt it foolishly and in vaine but god sendeth those against vs that shall not onely assault but subdue triumph ouer vs and trample vs vnder their feete
finally we vndervalue and god and he maketh the basest of his creatures to confound vs and lay our state waste

secondly consider how the wrath of god commeth on by degrees god is compared to a consuming fire now you know that in fire there is first smoake a flame and coale the first onset of gods wrath is but like vnto smoake if that doe not moue vs we shall feele the flame and if wee be not the better for the flame

then the coale shall burne vs
this gradation of iudgement is excellently set forth by moses leuit

where chaining a following to a foregoing iudgement hee bringeth god in speaking thus if yee will not for all this hearken vnto mee but walke contrary vnto mee then will walke contrary to you also in fury and euen will chastise you seuen times for your sinnes

haue sufficiently opened vnto you the heauie hand of god as it is definitely set forth by salomon
lest we should thinke that god hath no more instruments of vengeance than these commonly knowne ones

which are in the scripture by an excellency called the plagues of god ezech

salomon addeth an indefinite clause whatsoeuer plague whatsoeuer sicknesse importing that god hath many more in store
and indeed

moses in the chapter read vnto you this day specifieth many more yet hath he not specified all that god can send and of late there hath hardly past a yeare wherein we haue not heard of some new disease

but there is one plague which may not omit haue called you to see three horses the black the pale the red and the riders thereon there is in the same chapter of the reuelations a fourth horse mentioned a white horse and he that sate thereon had a bowe in his hand a crowne on his head and he went forth conquering
it is commonly conceiued that this is the gospell of christ preuailing in the world wee misse that white horse now as it did in the first age goe on planting so it did in this last hundred yeares goe on restoring of the gospell
but now for many yeares together this conquerour doth not appeare and the orthodoxe church is much straightned
and wee should count it a greater plague that this horse is missing than that the others are so visible in the world considering that spirituall plagues are much more heauie than corporall and we should in our humiliation ioyne our cryes with those soules vnder the altar that were slaine for the word of god and the testimony which they held saying how long lord holy and true doest thou not iudge and auenge our bloud on them that dwell in the earth reuel

the vse of all this first part of my text that is the case of sufferers is this that we know not god to halues god describeth himselfe to be iust as well as mercifull exod
and the sonne of syrach tells vs ecclus

that god is as mighty to punish as to saue therefore we must not look vpon onely gods mercy but vpon his iustice also which is so palpable in the plagues
and yet must wee not so plod vpon gods iustice as not to carry our eye from thence to his mercy for as in the first case exprest in my text we haue seene the church suffering from gods wrath so now in her second case we must behold her as a suppliant hauing recourse vnto the throne of grace
and here first wee must obserue that though god for sinne be pleased to humble his church yet doth hee afford her a meanes of reliefe whereby shee may come out of her greatest distresse
and why god is not undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet not a destroyer but a sauiour of his church he doth not punish her but to recouer her as anon you shall heare more at large

but though the church be subiect to no more calamities than she hath remedy for yet of her manifold distresses the remedy is but one penitent deuotion is the onely remedy of all distresses
and this deuotion is here called by two names prayer and supplication
the words in the originall are fitted to the argument the first is tephillah which is such a prayer as a prisoner maketh to him before whom hee is arraigned you may interpret it by those words in iob cap

will make supplication to my iudge
and indeed a penitent must so come to god as if he came to the barre hee must suppose himselfe to bee an indited person
and being

such the second word will teach him what his plea must be euen a psalme of mercy for so techinnah signifieth hee must come vnto god with haue mercy vpon mee god after thy great mercy psal
and hee must pray with daniel cap

lord righteousnesse belongeth vnto thee but vnto vs confusion of faces

in the primitiue church they had stationary dayes tertullian saith their name is borrowed from warfare and christians vpon that day putting on the whole armour of god did stand vpon their guardes against powers and principalities

and spirituall wickednesses in heauenly places
st ambrose more plainly saith stationes vocantur ieiunia quòd flentes ieiunantes in ijs inimicos repellamus
these were the weekly fasting dayes wednesdayes and fridayes whereon christians repaired to the church and therein quasifactâmanu like an armie with spirituall weapons of fasting and praying weeping and lamenting of their sinnes they put to flight all their ghostly enemies and remoued all the heauie pressures of the church
we keepe the dayes but haue lost the truevse of them it is much to bee wisht that they were restored againe and that thereon we did as our were wont plye god in these sinnefull and wofull times especially with tephillah and techinnah the prayers of guilty ones and supplications for the mercy of god

but more fully to rip vp this deuotion so farre as wee are led by my text obserue that it consisteth of two acts one inward and another outward
the inward is a liuely sense of the penitents euill case and an expression of his deuotion out of that sense euery one of them must know the plagues of his owne heart
where first obserue that the plagues inflicted are corporall but the sense required is spirituall
and why the originall of sinne is in the soule whereunto the body concurres but as a pliable instrument therefore god would haue the body serue by his smart to awaken the soule make it apprehensiue of gods displeasure and tremble at his iudgements

the word which we doe render plague doth signifie a wound now in the heart there may be a wound of sinne or a wound for sinne
the wound of sinne

is that which sinne giueth to the soule st peter tels vs that our sinfull lusts fight against the soule and in fighting giue the soule many a stabbe the sonne of syrach expresseth this excellently all iniquity is as a sword the wounds whereof cannot bee healed ecclus

and what meane we else when we say that sinne is mortall but that it giueth mortall wounds besides this wound of sinne there is a wound for sinne you know that when a man in fight hath receiued a wound the chirurgion must come with his instrument and search that wound scoure it and put the wounded man to a second paine euen so when wee haue wounded our soules with sinne wee must wound them a second time for finne if wee meane to be deuoutly penitent wee must be prickt at the heart we must rent our hearts we must breake our stonie hearts wee must melt our hearts we must poure forth our soules our spirit must be wounded within vs and our heart must be desolate
this is that which god commanded the iewes leuit

when hee bid them afflict their soules in

the day of their solemne fast this is that godly sorrow which st paul
cor
speaketh of sorrow not to be repented of animae amaritudo est anima poenitentiae this vexing of our soules is the very soule of repentance

as a penitent man hath these two wounds so he must know them but wee come very short of this all this mortall life of ours is nothing else but a masse of plagues full of temptations iohn
and trauelleth with vanity of vanities and vexation of spirit psal
all the sonnes of adam doe daily suffer from the wrath of god in some thing or other and euerie one of vs may say as augustus the emperour sometimes said that he sitteth inter lachrymas suspiria betweene sighings and teares
certainly as the christian world now standeth wee are encompast with lamentable spectacles both abroad and at home
but many men are so hardened that they feele not their owne disease much lesse others yea so farre they are from feeling the ordinary plagues of man that they doe not feele the extraordinary ones wherewith god doth rowze sinnefull men
wherefore we must hold it for one of the gifts of grace wherewith god doth endue his children that they recouer againe the sense of godly sorrow
and wee may well conclude that hee that is senslesse is gracelesse and they which haue no sense beare the heauiest plague

the word doth carry with it not onely knowledge but acknowledgement knowledge without acknowledgement is of little regard with god auailes vs but little he knoweth his wounds as a penitent that by searching sindeth what cuill he hath done and though to his owne confusion yet layeth it open before the tender eyes of god and so qui addit scientiae addit dolori

the penitents knowledge is the fountaine of his forrow
saint austin wittily wresteth those words of the preacher to this purpose

marke moreouer the word his owne for men are most willing to know and make knowne other mens wounds but vt nemo in sese tentat descendere nemo men loue not to bee knowne to themselues yet many a man hath inward plagues which none knowes but god and himselfe
but it is an absurd thing to passe ouer our owne wounds and inquire into other mens
it is much to be wisht therefore that we would translate this scrutinie and spend it vpon our selues take pity vpon our owne selues

and let the sense of our owne ill deseruings open a passage to the relieuing bowels of our most mercifull father who relieueth none but those which know the euill which they haue done and suffer

when wee come according to the ordinance of the church to make confession either at the entrance to common prayer or the eucharist euery man should haue premeditated his owne sinnes and acknowledge them vnto god in the secret of his heart and craue pardon for them

but though a man must haue this passion in regard of his owne case yet must he not be without compassion toward the ill case of others
if it be but a priuate mans case we must be compassionate towards him because he is a member of the same body we know the parable of the man that went from ierusalem to ierico and fell amongst theeues who stript him and wounded him the priest and the leuite are taxed for want of

compassion towards him as the samaritane is commended for hauing it
and if we must shew compassion towards priuate mens cases how much more towards the publicke it is a grieuous complaint that god maketh against the great men of israel amos
who stretch themselues vpon iuorie beds eate the lambes of the flocke but were not grieued for the affliction of ioseph if the whole feele the distresses of euery part of our body should any part be so senslesse as not to suffer for the whole especially seeing if the whole perish euery part perisheth whereas the whole may subsist though this or that part doe perish and fall away
the miserable estate of christendome especially the orthodoxe church and our own generall calamities importune mee to recommend this compassion vnto you and beseech you to include it in this dayes humiliation and to let the one be as long liued as the other to let neither of them decay much lesse dye till god returne to his church and this state in his wonted mercy and with his wonted blessing

you haue heard the first inward act of a penitent
there is another act here specified which is outward penitent deuotion must be accompanied with conuenient ceremonies here are two mentioned one of the hands they must be stretcht out this is a naturall ceremony for marke a childe when he hath offended his parents as hee falleth vpon his knees so he lifteth vp his hands so doth a seruant to his master a subiect to his soueraigne and the conquered to the conquerour and it importeth as much as do victas in tua vincla manus sir am at your mercy
the word supplicium hath its name hence because it humbleth the weaker vnder the hand of the stronger the inferiour to the superiour and maketh him supplicare submit vnto him
from hence it is translated vnto praier and made a ceremony thereof both in the old testament let the lifting vp of my hands bee as an euening sacrifice psal
and in the new testament will that men pray in all places lifting vp pure hands
tim

this is the first meaning of this ceremony when it is applyed to penitency
as god stretcheth out his hand to strike so the penitent stretcheth out his hand for mercy
though am not ignorant that it may also signifie the correspondency of the inward to the outward man that as the heart lifteth it selfe vp to god so must the body also by the hands
this is excellently set forth in the psalme stretch forth my hands to thee my heart thirsteth for thee as a thirsty land psal
and in this sense moses in the warre against amalecke salomon in this dedicatory and others may bee thought in their prayers to haue stretcht forth their hands vnto god
the former sense doth not exclude this

the second ceremony is of the eye that is mysticall the eye must look towards the temple of salomon that is the place where god put his name and where the cloud representing god resided betweene the cherubins vpon the mercy seate
this brings it home to that which before told you was to be done by the suppliant who hath recourse to the throne of grace and as tephillah the prayer made vnto the iudge did require a ceremony of submissiue stretching out of the hand so techinnah the

prayer of mercy requires a cast of our eye vpon the mercy seate the ceremonies fit well the deuotion
the riches of gods nature are infinite but wee vse to single out such of gods attributes as are most fit for our deuotion to behold not excluding the rest but desiring that the rest may not hinder but further rather that attribute vpon which wee lay hold
salomons temple is long since ruined there is now no typicall mercy seate whereunto wee should looke according to the example of daniel and others
but the truth abideth for euer god that was in christ reconciling the world doth accept our prayers if wee offer them though iesus christ where christ then is thither must we bend our eyes euen to the right hand of god whereat he sitteth to make intercession for vs

out of both ceremonies ioyntly gather that the place whither we direct our deuotion sheweth from whom the plagues come and that is from god and he sendeth them for sinne the confession thereof is plain in the acts of the deuotion the plagues come not by chance neither are they sent without a cause
the heathen did acknowledge the author and therefore pacified god with their solemne supplications christians knew him and propitiated him much better as appeares by the ancient letanies
to say nothing of the law and the prophets which are plentifull in teaching that all plagues come from god
as god sendeth them so he sendeth plagues for sinnes being offended with our crying sinnes he poureth vpon the world grieuous plagues maledicta terra propter te the first curse was for mans sinne the law runnes in the same tenour and so doe king dauids penitentialls god commands wicked seruants to bee beaten deut
will conclude point with two short admonitions one out of the prophet heare the rod and who sends it micah
the other is out of the psalme as the eye of a seruant looketh to the hand of his master and the eye of a mayden to the hand of her mistresse euen so our eyes looke vnto the lord our god vntill he haue mercie vpon vs psal
other ceremonies were vsed by penitents in the old testament and in the new especially who were wont to humble themselues vs{que ad inuidiam coeli as ancient writers doe hyperbolize but with no ill meaning they did so farre afflict themselues for sinne that the very saints in heauen might enuie their deepe humiliation
but tantae seneritati non sumus pares those patternes are too austere for these dissolute times onely let mee obserue this vnto you that repentance must be an holocaust all our inward our outward senses should concurre to testifie our godly sorrow for sinne wee should suffer not one of them to take rest themselues or giue rest to god
by this you may perceiue that penitentiall deuotion is an excellent vertue but not so common as the world thinketh

the last thing that noted vpon this deuotion is that it must be performed by euery one in particular and by the whole congregation in generall for the same remedy serueth both the publike must take the same course which euery priuate man doth and euery priuate man must take the same course that the publicke doth
the reason is because the church is corpus homogeneum and therfore eadem est ratio partis totius

in the peformance of those religious dueties no man must thinke himselfe too good to humble himselfe neyther must any man thinke himselfe vnworthy to appeare before the throne of grace
in our priuate occasions wee must come by our selues and wee must ioyne with the publicke when the publicke wounds call vs thereunto as now we do and we haue comfortable precedents for that which we doe in the prophet ioel and ionas
behold how good and ioyfull a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in vnitie can neuer be more comfortably sung than at these religious meetings when as one man with one voyce and heart we present our deuotions before god doubt not but as hopefully as humbly

it is true that god in ezechiel cap

threatneth that if noah daniel and iob were in ierusalem as liue saith the lord god they shall deliuer neyther sonne nor daughter they shall but deliuer their owne soules by their righteousnesse when send but a pestilence into the land how much more when send my foure plagues the like is threatned in ieremy cap

but we must obserue that then god was risen from the mercy seat and in punishment of their many contempts had giuen the iewes ouer to their owne hearts iust
but god be thanked this assembly sheweth that we haue not so far forsaken god neyther hath god who hath put these things into the mind of the king and state so forsaken vs but wee may hope for acceptance
which is the next part of my text
what israel performeth that will god accept for hee is as mercifull as iust
blessed are they that mourne saith christ for they shall bee comforted matth

for christ came to heale those that were broken in heart luke
you aske saith st iames cap

and haue not hee addeth a reason because yee aske amisse but if you aske aright then christs rule is true aske and ye shall haue seeke and ye shall find knocke and it shall be opened vnto you mat
he that shall confesse to gods name and turne from his sins shall finde acceptance with god for undefined span alphabet the teares of repentance are not only not displeasing but pleasing to god as incense
but gods acceptance consisteth of two acts the first is god will giue accesse vnto their prayers heare in heauen his dwelling place the prayers were to be made towards the arke but god heareth in heauen
and what is the cause of this change why god should not heare there whither we direct our prayers surely we must ascend from the type to the truth that is but a manduction to this
it was a maine errour of the iewes to diuorce them and haue in most esteeme the least part rest in the type passing ouer the truth
heauen is the place of gods habitation only because the place of his manifestation the septuagint render the words undefined span alphabet a place fitted for god to distinguish it from the church below which is but a place a fitting
the chaldee rendreth it domum maiestatis a maiesticall house and surely the place of gods dwelling is locus amplus et angustus a large a stately palace adorned with holines glory

and when wee thinke vpon god wee must not conceiue of his state by things below but by things aboue the earth is but as a point vnto the visible heauens much more in comparison of the heauen of heauens and they though they are the goodliest place created yet are they not a

worthy habitation for the infinite maiestie of god onely he vouchsafeth there most to manifest himselfe
the church that is resembled to heauen and called gods dwelling place must be remembred hereby that god must not dwell therein or in any member thereof angustè or sordidè
we must inlarge our hearts to receiue god and purifie them that they may somewhat beseeme the residentiary therein which is god
finally it is no small fauour that god doth vouchsafe to heare that beeing in heauen hee doth vouchsafe to heare vs that are on earth for sometimes hee hideth himselfe as it were with a cloud

so that our prayers cannot haue accesse vnto him and our sinnes separate between him and vs and he is as if he heard not not that the eare of iealousie heareth not all things but he is not pleased to giue a gracious signification that hee doth heare
but the spirituall clamor of the contrite expressed from the secret closet of the inward man hath the power of a loud voyce and piercing which can enter the heauens and approach acceptably vnto god
god will not onely heare and giue accesse to the prayers of the penitent but redresse their sufferings also
quando non geniculationibus nostris jeiunationibus etiam siccitates sunt depulsae saith tertullian what calamitie was there euer which wee haue not diuerted by our penitent deuotion the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much if it be feruent iames

but god doth redresse the sufferings of israel orderly first he redresseth the cause which is sinne and then the effect which is woe he will forgiue and then he will doe and giue neyther may a sinner looke for peace except he first speede of mercie
first then god forgiues

it is one of his properties so to doe to forgiue iniquities and transgressions
and without all doubt god ceasing from anger which is contrary to his nature will embrace mercie which is agreeable to his nature if we repent neyther would he euer haue giuen christ to death for vs if hee had desired our death
but our god is mercifull and hath appointed vs ministers to be sponsores misericordiae to giue assurance of his mercy to penitent sinners and our message what is it but the gospel that is glad tidings of the reconciliation of god and man
neyther doth he only redresse the cause but the effect also that is the woe for woe is the effect of sinne and where god remitteth the guilt of sinne hee will also remoue the punishment thereof eyther wholly or he will at least irae merum clementia diluere by clemencie much allay the seueritie of his wrath where condonare goeth before there donare followeth after giuing doth accompany forgiuing

in the text there are two words god will doe and giue which are not put in vaine for the first signifieth that god will doe that which wee request that is as the psalme speaketh psalme
hee will fulfill the desire of them that feare him he also will heare their cry and will saue them
in our extremities wee call onely for ease of our paine and god will doe that
but that is not the vttermost of his fauour he will also giue vs many good things he will as the prophets speake delight to doe vs good and as if he did repent of his vengeance hee will multiply his blessings and redeeme as it were the time of our affliction with an extraordinary measure

of peace and prosperitie
such promises and such performances we reade in the scripture and our hope may entertaine them as belonging to our selues if we be deuoutly penitent

yet must you obserue as it followeth in the text that god doth dispence this double grace grace of forgiuing and grace of giuing discreetly according to mens wayes
as all men are not alike deuout so god intreates them not all alike hee rewardeth euery man according to his workes as the scripture speakes rom
faber est quisque fortunae suae men shall finde god as god findeth them surely gods prouidence proceedeth so if you looke vpon the second causes touching the first and st pauls maxime cor
quis te discernit a point that much troubleth the world at this day it is no time now to dispute the plainest and shortest resoluion is that of the prophet hosea
perditio tua ex te israel exme salus
they that perish must blame themselues but they that are saued must giue the glory thereof vnto god
but the waies according to which god dealeth with men are eyther inward or outward god dealeth with men according to their inward waies for god seeth not as man seeth neyther iudgeth according to the outward appearance but according to the inward disposition
the reason is twofold
because vera bonitas malitia sunt tantùm in corde true goodnesse and malitiousnesse are only in the heart in the outward actions they are not farther than they are deriued from thence according to the rule in the schooles our actions are so farre vertuous and vitious as the will hath a hand in them
a second reason is this the knowledge of the heart is the strongest proofe that can bee produced in iudgement and because gods iudgement is the most infallible the euidence produced therin is the most vndeniable his euidence is such and none but his for he and he only knoweth the hearts of the children of men as salomon addeth
he is called undefined span alphabet the searcher of the heart and reines he is more priuie to our secret thoughts than we our selues are and as st iohn saith iohn
greater than our heart
therefore god in iudgement non facta numerat sed corda when he commeth to reckoning look how many good hearts hee findeth so many good men and so many ill men as hee findeth ill hearts
men in their iudgements cannot proceede so exactly for want of this knowledge of the heart they are faine to rest vpon weaker proofes which though they satisfie in humane cognizance yet may they possibly be false and the person arraigned may bee and
two things follow out of this doctrine the doctrine that god onely knoweth the hearts
the one is that god often taketh not off his heauie hand notwithstanding we humble our selues because wee doe not turne to the lord with all our heart
the second is that god taketh away many a man in the act of his repentance lest he should relapse and malice change his heart
wee must therefore not be out of heart if god should take away any of vs euen in the middest of this good worke

as god dealeth discreetly in dispensing of his grace so that supposed he dealeth vniuersally he dispenseth the grace with euery man according to his

waies as euery man is sensible of his own ill case or not sensible so god applieth or applieth not a remedie thereunto no penitent man but may speed of the grace no impenitent man may looke for it for god will deale with euery man according to his waies

you haue heard what gods acceptance is it remaineth that you now heare whereat it aymeth it aymeth at the amendement of israel god vouch safeth israel grace that israel may feare him

and so saith the penitentiall psalme with thee lord there is mercy that thou mayst bee feared gods iudgements are not onely penall but medicinall therefore are they called corrections because they set vs straight that went awry eruditions because they ciuilize vs that were growne wilde castigations because they make vs spiritually chaste that went awhooring
and what is repentance but renascentia animae a renuing of our minde by putting off the old man crucifying the flesh becomming new men tertullian saith right penitentia sine emendatione vitae vana quia caret fruclu suo cui eam deus seuit in vaine is that repentance which is not followed by a better life because it beareth not that fruite for which god planted it that is the saluation of men or it bringeth not forth the peaceable fruit of righteousnesse vnto them which are exercised thereby heb

mercy is shewed propter spem for hope of amendement so parents spare their children masters their seruants princes their subiects and we may not expect that god will spare vs vpon any other condition therefore when we vnderly gods heauie hand wee must say with ephraim bemoaning himselfe thou hast chastised me and was chastised as a bullocke vnaccustomed to the yoke turne thou mee and shall be turned thou art the lord my god surely after that was turned repented ier
god spares vs not that we should continue in sinne but that we should returne and feare him feare him walking in his waies as it is in the parallel chapter

and becomming more wary that wee prouoke not his wrath
out of all this you may gather that the feare is not seruile but filiall wee must feare not so much to smart from god as to offend him it must be fear that doth not only hold the hand but change the heart it must be that fear that is the beginning of wisedome of which the psalmist a good vnderstanding haue all they which doe thereafter it is a well doing feare

and such a feare doe commend vnto you at this time of humiliation giue me leaue to shew you how you must practise it
the first plague which before you heard of was famine god if hee remoue that doth it that we might shew our feare of him by repressing luxurie
now luxurie is represt two manner of waies
by the voluntarie sobrietie of euery man and it were to be wisht that euery man would be a law vnto himselfe and out of his owne detestation of sensualitie enioyne himselfe the diet of mortification that he would bring his owne body vnder and by his endeauour thereof testifie his vnfained sorrow for former excesses

but this is not to be expected that sobriety will be so forward if men be left to their free will therefore a compulsory course must worke vs vnto that from which wee are by nature too auerse
the rather if long peace and plentie of gods blessings make the way easie to our sinnefull lustes

sumptuarie lawes therefore if euer are in these loose dayes most requisite they are most requisite to set bounds vnto our backe and belly which are euen mad with vanitie whole bookes might be written of our many metamorphoses both of diet and apparell and not to flatter you wee are the most infamous morall changelings that are in the world prodigall yea prodigious are the expences that our nation is at to make it selfe the of other nations
adde hereunto that many good and great families are so exhausted with this vanitie that in these times of publicke supplyes they that by their rancke should are least able to helpe the state
wherefore lest the common weale bee not able to support it selfe by reason that the priuate weale is vainely profused and that the poore may haue some comfort of that which is saued from riot let the state put a remedie to this politicke consumption lest the whole perish by the waste of euery part

mistake mee not know that there are requisita personae as well as naturae reason and religion as it rangeth men into sundry degrees so doth it proportion their expences and the greater men are the more costly may their apparell bee and their fare the more daintie
but two things great men must doe the one is they must learne from morall philosophie to distinguish maiestie and magnificencie from luxurie and vanitie the one is ordered by discretion but they are that entertaine the other
secondly wee must remember that there is a time for euerie thing a time to fast and a time to feast a time to weepe and a time to laugh we must take heede therefore of diues example who fared delitiously euery day and euery day wore fine linnen and purple you know what became of him if we feare his end let vs not imitate his life
our second plague was pestilence if god spare vs and stay that infectious disease we must take care to stay the contagion of sinne crying sinnes spread farre and euery day poyson many they are growne so rise that they are growne past shame and gods tenne commandements are become ridiculous wee are thought but weake men when we remember the sonnes of belial of their obedience to them
whether lawes bee wanting aduise you it is certaine that if there be any they are as if they were not when iustice sleepeth both in city in country and enormous sinners passe commonly vncontrolled magistrates would be awakened and quickned to stoppe this morall pestilence that so by gods mercy the corporall pestilence may be stayed also

the next plague was the sword if god spare vs from the slaughter thereof he doth it that we should testifie our feare of him in fighting his battels against sinne the world and hell hee doth not remoue the sword from our throats that we should flye at his flye at him wee doe in vaine but it will betray the malignitie of our will when we open our mouthes against heauen and become undefined span alphabet rebels against god send him this message we will not haue this man raigne ouer vs but we will do what seemeth good to euery man in his owne eyes
that god may turne our swords into plowshares and our speares into mattocks let vs turne our members that haue beene instruments of vnrighteousnesse vnto sinne

into members that became instruments of righteousnesse vnto god rom

told you that there is a plague that lighteth vpon our goods or possessions if god remoue that plague he doth it that we should testifie our feare of him in that fashion as daniel taught nabuchodonozer

in his words will speake vnto you let my counsell be acceptable vnto you and breake off your sinnes by righteousnesse and your iniquities by shewing mercy to the poore if it may bee a continuing of your tranquilitie let our charity who are yet free extended to those poore ones vpon whom god hath laid his hand begge mercy for vs and hold off gods heauie hand from our goods for there is nothing that can sooner preuaile to make the earth bring forth her increase and god euen our owne god to giue vs his blessing and if we make friends of our wicked mammon this may be our comfort if we should faile in these perillous times they wilreceiue vs into euerlasting tabernacles

the last plague which specified was the great diminution of the orthodoxe church and what thinke you is the best way to repaire the decayes thereof no doubt but politicke vnions of states is a very good meanes and warlike preparations the vsefull instruments of those vnions if they be timely if they be competent they are fit meanes to bring them to reason perforce with whom ciuill treaties and brotherly intreaties cannot preuaile
but the best meanes is to make much of gods truth while we haue it and to make a sauing vse for our eternall comfort which god knoweth hitherto wee haue not done as much as we should and wee doe euery day lesse and lesse and what wonder if that be weary of vs seeing wee grow weary of it neither is it enough for vs to make much of it for our own good but also wee should propagate it to others
and here let me tell you that there lieth a great guilt vpon christian states this amongst the rest that they haue not been carefull to bring them that sit in darknesse and in the shadow of death to the knowledge of christ and participation of the gospel
much trauelling to the indies east and west but wherefore some go to possesse themselues of the lands of the infidels but most by commerce if by commerce to grow richer by their goods
but where is the prince or state that pitieth their soules and without any worldly respect endeauours the gaining of them vnto god some shew we make but it is but a poore one for it is but undefined span alphabet an accessorie to our worldly desire undefined span alphabet it is not it is not our primarie intention wheras christs method is mat
first seeke ye the kingdome of god and then all other things shall be added vnto you you shall fare the better for it in your worldly estate
if the apostles and apostolicke men had affected our saluation no more we might haue continued till this day such as somtimes we were barbarous subiects of the prince of darknesse

those of the church of rome boast of their better zeale for the kingdome of christ but their owne histories shew that ambition and couetousnesse haue beene the most predominant affections that haue swayed their endeauours and they haue with detestable cruelty made their way to those worldly ends in stead of sauing soules haue destroyed millions of persons
we should take another course for their conuersion yea the same that was taken for ours and if wee doe it is to be hoped god will

continue vs his people and adde daily to his church such as shal be saued

for popish recusants let me speake a word their case is mixt consisting partly in ignorance of the truth and partly in the seed of disloyaltie
wee haue made many good lawes if not to roote out at least to keepe downe so much of their corruption as is dangerous to the state it were to bee wisht that greater care were taken for informing their consciences and indeed there should our lawes beginne with them vnder a reasonable paine to vrge them to conference for why should we doubt but that god would blesse the honest endeauours of the ministers of the truth who permits the seducers to steale away so many hearts from god and the king of this we may be sure that eyther god will worke that which we wish the recouery of those which are seduced or at least their obstinacie will bee without all excuse and the punishment thereof by sharpe lawes will be no more than is iust in the sight both of god and man
the neglect of this care of infidels and recusants is no small cause of that great distresse which at this day is fallen vpon the reformed churches and god thereby calleth vpon vs to amend these defects

let vs vse our punishment well and let gods chastisement prouoke vs to a better life though it seeme grieuous to vnderlie gods heauy hand yet it is much more grieuous to be neuer a whit the better for the plagues for it is a second refusing of grace the same god that doth at first recommend vnto vs pietie by sweetning it with temporall blessings when that course speedeth not tryeth whether wee will bethinke our selues if we smart for our vntowardlinesse and certainly his case is desperate who is the worse for his stripes as you may reade in gods complaint passionately exprest by esay

by amos and ieremie hath illustrated it by an excellent simile of reprobate siluer which is molten in vaine because the drosse cannot bee separated from it
amend then wee must
that is not enough we must be constant in our amendment we must feare god all the dayes of our life that is true repentance when a man so turneth to god that he doth not returne againe like a dogge to his vomit or a sow to wallow in the myre relapses are dangerous as saint peter teacheth pet

and our sauiour christ tels the recouered lame man in the gospel iohn
behold thou art made whole goe thy way sinne no more lest a worse thing happen vnto thee
will hearken saith the psalmist psal
what the lord will say vnto me for he will speake peace vnto his people and to his saints that they returne not again vnto their folly
we should all remember lots wife who for looking backe was turned into a pillar of salt animae in vitia relabentis accusatricem a visible inditement of relapsing soules
most men are to like planets sometimes in coniunction with him sometimes in a more or lesse aspect too often in plaine opposition but let vs take heed we be not in the number of those wandring stars of whom st iude speaketh to whom is reserued the blacknesse of darknesse for euer
to begin well and not to go on is as if a man should put a soueraigne plaister to a dangerous wound and after a while teare it off againe thinke you that man would bee the better for his salue or the worse rather you heard before our sinnes are wounds and although repentance be a soueraigne

salue yet proueth it not such vnto vs except it be lasting
there is a good reason giuen by st bernard cecidimus in lutum lapides our sias are like vnto fals into the myre wherein there are stones the mud doth soile vs and the stones bruise vs we may soone wash away the myre but we cannot so soone recouer our bruise euen so the guilt of our sin is sooner remitted than the corruption can be purged
therefore repentance taketh time to restore our spirituall health and doth not compasse it but with much fasting watching praying almesdeeds and is watchfull ouer vs that second wounds make not the first more dangerous in a word being deliuered from our enemies and the hands of all that hate vs we endeauour to serue god in holinesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of our life

here are added two motiues vnto this constant amendment taken from the place wherein they liue
it is true that wheresoeuer they liued they were to feare god all the dayes of their life because god is euery where a knower of the the heart a rewarder of men according to their workes
but the place of their aboad put no small obligation vpon them first because it was an eminent place eminent corporally a good land a land flowing with milke and honey eminent mystically for it was the seate of the church and a type of heauen and who should bee fruitfull in good workes rather than they that dwell in a fruitfull land and holinesse beseemeth gods house for euer
but to sin in the land of immanuel in the land of vprightnesse is no small improuement of sin and hee that is barren of good works in a fruitfull land shall haue the earth that brings forth her increase rise vp in iudgement against him
our countrey hath both these prerogatiues and therfore it preacheth vnto vs that which canaan preached to israel amendment of life and constancy therein
the second motiue which the place doth yeeld is the tenure thereof god saith salomon gaue it to our fathers they held in franck almoigne and god telleth vs in the psalme that hee gaue it them to this end that they might keep his statutes and obserue his lawes
and should not men bee dutifull vnto god when god is so liberall vnto men wee may thinke haply that this doth not concerne vs because we came otherwise by our lands
if we thinke so wee plod too much vpon the second causes but we must know that whether we come by them by purchase or by gift we are beholding vnto gods blessings for the mony wherewith wee purchase and for their good will which bestow it on vs and the same god that could haue hindred vs of both can strip vs of both at his pleasure
but to shut vp the matter of my text
you see the end of gods plagues and of his mercy they doe sollicit vs to returne in time this doth call vpon vs not to bee weary of

wherefore let vs entertaine gods chastisements prudently let vs not contemne them because they are fearefull and the contempt of this temporall will but procure vs eternall wrath at least in this life god may rise from smaller vnto greater plagues nor let vs despaire because god is mercifull yea he hath shewed a great deale of mercy in that multi corriguntur in paucis in presenting before vs some few mens harmes hee bids vs all beware and what should our praier be but domine ne in supplicijs nostrie

alios erudiamus let not vs by thy heauy hand bee made examples to others cum liceat nobis aliorum cruciatibus emendari whereas if wee haue grace other mens corrections may be our instructions
to you of this assembly let me say boldly that the greater we are in place and power the greater share should we haue in this worke of repentance by our example we should teach the people compunction for sin correction of life the two most preuailing folliciters of gods mercy and preseruers of a state god forbid that it should be with vs as it was with israel

that god should find the great men more sons of belial than the meaner sort it would be a shrewd prognostication of very euill dayes to come
this day promiseth better things
pray god the continuance be answerable and that we repent not that wee haue resolued to repent but that euery day sinne may more and more dye in vs and grace liue more and more if we do so we may be sure that though for a time we sow in teares yet in due time wee shall reape in ioy

nothing remaineth now that haue for your greater edifications opened and applied the pious assertions that are contained in my text but that wee should returne it againe into that forme wherein king salomon conceiued it and make it our common petition vnto god
lord there is great feare of a famine the pestilence hath entred already far vpon vs by the enemies of thy truth and our peace we are forced to prepare for war we knowing euery man the plague of his owne heart cast our selues downe before thy throne of mercy deprecating thy wrath and supplicating for grace beseeching thee to take off thy heauie hand from vs and fight for vs against our enemies because without thee vaine is all the strength of man heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place forgiue do and giue to euery man of vs according to his waies thou which only knowest the hearts of all men that we may fear thee all the dayes which we liue in this good land which thou hast giuen to our fathers and bee vouch safed after this life to attend thy throne with thy blessed saints in the kingdome of heauen

vers
all power is giuen vnto mee in heauen and in earth
goe ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the sonne and of the holy ghost
teaching them to obserue all things whatsoeuer haue commanded you and lo am with you alway euen vnto the end of the world
amen

the&se words contain one of the last solemne acts which our sauiour christ performed immediately before he ascended into heauen and that was his sending of his apostles to conuert the world
in this act our sauiour christ doth informe them first of his owne right to send all power is giuen me both in heauen and in earth then of the errant whereupon they were to be sent goe yee therefore and teach all nations baptizing them

but more distinctly
about christs right our first enquiry must be of what sort the power here mentioned is and wee shall finde that it is heauenly and my text will teach vs that this heauenly power of christ is lawfull because giuen vnto him and full because in it selfe vnlimited it is all power and extendeth to euery place it worketh both in heauen and earth
vpon this power of christ is grounded the apostles embassage that must you gather out of the illatiue therefore
in the apostles embassage or errant we will consider their common charge and comfort
in the charge we shall see
what they must doe they must goe ite
to whom they are sent and whereabout
they are sent farre and wide goe yee to all

nations
that which they must doe is to winne them vnto christ teach them or as the originall hath it make them disciples
if they preuaile with any if any entertaine the gospell then they are to consecrate their persons vnto god baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and to worke their obedience wholly conformable to euery one of those precepts which themselues had receiued from christ teach them to doe all things whatsoeuer haue commanded you
this is their common charge

their common comfort standeth in the powerfull and perpetuall assistance of christ assistance he is with them and this presence is powerfull for he that is present is ego that haue all power both in heauen and earth and it is perpetuall hee is with them alwayes vnto the worlds end alwayes without intermission vnto the worlds end therefore not onely with their owne persons but also with their successors
vpon this common comfort they must all fixe their eyes ecce behold it and their faithfull prayer must hopefully expect it so much is meant by the close of all amen
these bee the particulars which offer themselues in this text to our consideration will god willing speake of so many of them as the time will permit
consider you what say and the lord giue you a right vnderstanding in them all
begin with christs right
wee are first to enquire of what sort it is undefined span alphabet the word vsed by the euangelist doth signifie an eminency now that may be either in ability or in authority in men these are often times seuered some haue abilities that haue no authority some haue authority that haue no ability some haue good gifts that are in no place of gouernement and some are in place of gouernment that haue no sutable gifts
but in god and christ it is not so both concurre in them and in them both are equall the authority to the ability and the ability to the authority
and it should be so in those that serue them it is pity but that those which haue good gifts should bee set in good places but it is a shame for them that are set in good places to be without good gifts
wherefore let this be your sacred ambition who are now to receiue holy orders neuer to let your preferment your indowments labour to bee as able to serue as you are willing to be employed

something we haue said of christs power but not that which is principally intended here
to make you see that must remember you of a logicke rule talia sunt praedicata qualia permittuntur esse subiectis suis when any attribute or title is giuen to a person it must bee conceiued in such extent as the person is capable of
now in christ there are two capacities for he is god and he is also man
if we looke vpon him as hee is onely god so hee hath an infinite and an eternall power hee is as almighty a gouernour as maker of all things
this is potestas innata not data but becomming man hee had another capacity and power proportioned thereunto a power fitting to a mediatour a mediatour that should recouer man fallen and reconcile him vnto god gather a church and establish a kingdome of heauen
of this power our sauiour

christ speaketh when he confesseth vnto pilate that he is a king but addes my king dome is not of this world iohn
and st paul the kingdome of heauen is not meate and drinke it standeth not in any earthly thing but in righteousnesse and peace and ioy in the holy ghost rom
the scepter of this kingdome is the gospell the seate of it is the conscience of man it is as christ speaketh in st luke chapt

regnum dei intra nos a kingdome of god within vs a spirituall kingdome mannaged with a spirituall power
such is the power of christ the mediatour

but this power doth not in christs person exclude the other power of a creatour nor the deriuatiue therefrom the power of scepters and crownes which are all subiect thereunto they are by christs ordinance and he that is mediatour hath power ouer them and doth dispose of them as is best for his church
but hee doth not doe this as a mediatour kingdomes are founded vpon another ground a ground that went before the fall vpon paternall authority though in time it hath receiued many variations yet did not the mediatour intermeddle with those humane policies he erected no power ouer those powers but left them to the former prouidence of god neither would hee haue them any way preiudiced or impeacht by the entertainment of the gospell
this christ testified in his time the apostles in theirs the primitiue church for many hundred yeares as our writers haue clearly proued against the vsurpation of the bishop of rome who claimeth by some of his aduocates directly by other some indirectly a power at least ouer all christian scepters and crownes but this is to confound that which god hath distinguished the power which the church deriueth from a mediatour which is a spirituall power with the power which kings deriue from the creatour and founder of humane policy
obserue then in few words how princes and pastors are superiour and subiect in seuerall respects one to the other
in foro poli in cases of conscience and things that belong to ghostly counsell and comfort those things that belong to the saluation of the soule the prince must be ruled by the pastor so long as he is a faithfull minister of christ
but in foro soli in the iurisdiction that is annext to the sword the pastor must submit to the prince and obey his command
this you may learne out of the titles which are giuen them for as princes are children of the church and pastors reputed their ghostly fathers so pastors are children of the kingdome ezechias calleth the leuites his sonnes
chron

and the prophet calleth princes nursing fathers and nursing mothers of the church esay
constantine the emperour distinguished well in his speech to the prelates vos estis episcopi ad intra ego ad extra you are bishops seruing for the administration of sacred things and mannaging of the keyes but also am a bishop of the church to see it well gouerned countenanced and protected while they serue god princes are as it were sheepe of the fold but they are shepheards also and must see god well serued

this obserue the rather because that you seeing the fountain of your calling may keepe your selues within the boundery thereof and not

with either papists or schismatickes encroach vpon the princes sword deny vnto him his iurisdiction ecclesiasticall or vsurpe vpon his temporall two diseases which raigne much in this age which a man may more wonder at that readeth the new testament wherein the iewes dreame of their messias worldly kingdome is so plainly discouered and the ambition of the sonnes of zebeaee iames and iohn who would sit one on christs right hand and the other on christs left hand in his kingdome is checked so discreetly and that generall rule giuen matth

the kings of the nations beare rule they that are great men exercise authority but it shall not be so with you you shall receiue a spirituall but no temporall iurisdiction you shall haue power not of the sword but of the keyes not ouer mens bodies but their soules in them must raigne you must erect my kingdome there
and thus much of the kind of christs power

this power of christ is lawfull because giuen to him giuen by his father as elsewhere we learne
and here wee must first obserue that if data

then it is not rapta that which is giuen is not vsurpt the prince of this world hath power euen in the consciences of the children of disobedience and their soules are captiued to his pleasure god hath permitted this but he hath made him no grant of this power onely hee is contented to leaue men to his will by reason of their sinne though the diuell be so arrogant vpon this permission that hee told christ himselfe the kingdomes of the earth and the glory thereof are mine and theirs to whom will giue them luke
notwithstanding he is but an vsurper
neither is antichrist any better who sitteth in the temple of god and carrieth himselfe as god
thos
taking vpon him that power ouer the consciences of the people which christ neuer gaue him the particulars are many you may meete with them in the casuists and in the controuersie writers will not trouble you with them

our sauiour christs power is iust for it was giuen vnto him
but when first in his incarnation for no sooner did he become man but he was annointed with the holy ghost and with power therefore the angels that brought the newes of his birth to the shepheards said that to them was borne a sauiour which was the lord christ
no sooner did the sonne of god become man but hee was inuested with this power the eternall purpose of god and prophesies of him began to be fulfilled the godhead communicated to the manhood this power not changing the manhood into god but honouring it with an association in his workes the manhood is of counsell with the godhead in his gouernment and christ from the time of his conception wrought as god and man who before wrought onely as god of this gift speaketh the psalmist thou art my sonne this day haue begotten thee aske of mee and will giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance psal
and in daniel chapt

one like the sonne of man is brought vnto the ancient of dayes and to him was giuen a kingdome

but though this gift were bestowed at christs conception yet was the execution thereof for the most part suspended vntill his resurrection some glympses he gaue of it and shewed his glory in his miracles

but for the most part he appeared in the forme of a seruant and his humiliation was requisite that he might goe through with his passion his power though it were not idle before yet was the carriage of it veiled and therefore acknowledged but by a few
but after his resurrection god gaue him this power manifestly and the world was made to see it clearly for christ did then not onely cloath his person with maiestie but shewed himselfe wonderfull in the gouernement of his people therefore the time of the gift is by the holy ghost limited to the resurrection and declared to be a reward of his passion so saith the psalme thou hast made him a little lower than the angels that thou mightst crowne him with glory and honour psal
st paul applyeth it vnto christ

and tells elsewhere that christ dyed and rose againe that hee might be lord both of quicke and dead
the same he teacheth the ephesians and the colossians

but especially the philippians christ being in the forme of god took vpon him the forme of a seruant and did exinanite himselfe and became subiect to death euen the death of the crosse therefore god exalted him and gaue him a name aboue all names
this gift or manner of giuing is properly meant in this place the gift of power in reward of christs merit for by this merit did he enter into his glory and into his kingdome
and from this must ministers deriue their power which christ hath right to conferre vpon them not onely by the gift of his conception but also by the reward of his passion

as christs power is lawfull so is it full also for hee hath all power a plenary power
the word undefined span alphabet doth note sometimes a passiue power sometimes an actiue a passiue power as in those words of the gospell to them that receiued christ hee gaue undefined span alphabet power to bee the sonnes of god iohn
actiue when christ sent his disciples hee gaue them undefined span alphabet power ouer vncleane spirits matth

that is to cast them out
according to this double acception of the word is the fulnesse of christs power diuersly expounded
some say it is full passiuely before christs resurrection christ was obeyed but per nolentes by those that serued him against their will and so hee was serued but to halfes but afterward hee gathered populum spontaneum an ingenuous willing people psal
a people that should serue him readily not with a mixt will halting between two or between willing and nilling but with all their heart and cheerfully not like luke warme laodiceans for the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence and the violent take it matth

this is the interpretation of some true in it selfe though not so proper to my text
therefore we must vnderstand it of an actiue power that power which by allusion out of the prophets words is specified in the reuelation

he hath the key of dauid that shutteth and no man openeth openeth and no man shutteth he hath both keyes of the church clauem scientiae and clauem potestatis the key of doctrine and the key of discipline hee giueth all men their talents and calleth them to an account for the vse of them it is he that separateth the sheepe from the goates and from his mouth proceedeth as well goe ye cursed as come ye blessed

but if you will haue it to the full it is comprehended in those three

offices whereunto christ was annointed he was annointed to be a prophet a priest and a king all by an excellency all heauenly and what power is there belonging vnto spirituall gouernment which is not reduced vnto these three and they were all three in him without exception without restriction and so he had all power or as told you a power vnlimited in it selfe

and yet marke the phrase it is omnis potestas not omnipotentia though in christ as he is god there is omnipotency yet that power which hee hath as mediatour is of a middle size it is greater than any creature hath angell or man but yet not so great as is the infinite power of god that extends ad omnia possibilia to all that possible may bee but the power which god hath giuen to the mediatour is proportioned not to scientiae simplicis intelligentiae but visionis it extends as farre as the decree which god made before all times of all that shall be done in due time especially concerning the church it hath an hand in mannaging all that prouidence and mannaging it in an heauenly manner
as the power is vnlimited in it selfe so it extends to all places hee hath all power in heauen and in earth
heauen and earth are the extreame parts of the world and in the creed are vsually put for the whole but in the argument we haue in hand we must restraine it to the church which consisteth of two parts one triumphant in heauen the other militant on earth christ hath power in both for both make vp his body and he hath reconciled both vnto god
in earth he giueth men grace in heauen he giueth them glory here he commandeth our seruice there he giueth vs our reward in earth hee bindeth and looseth by his ministers and what soeuer they binde or loose here himselfe doth ratifie in heauen he reigneth in heauen in glory and by his spirit hee ruleth on earth therefore the angels and saints adore him in heauen no lesse than the faithfull doe here on earth both are recapitulated in him as the apostle speaketh hee is that iacobs ladder one end whereof reacheth to heauen and the other to the earth vpon him continually do the angels ascend and descend vnto these two places
finally the angels at his birth congratulate both places glory be to god on high that is in heauen in earth peace good will towards men luke
and the apostle saith it is the fulnesse of him that filleth all in all
and thus much of christs right or power to send

come we to the errant he sends them on
this is grounded vpon that power of christ wherof you haue heard the illatiue therefore importeth as much
and indeede a kingly power hath good right to send embassadors and the dignity of the embassador is answerable to the king from whom he commeth he that looketh vpon the persons of ministers only will not much esteeme eyther them or their words but adde whose ministers they are and that requireth reuerence to bee yeelded to their persons and obedience to their doctrine
especially if we consider that all those to whom they come are at his mercy from whom they come for he hath power ouer them all and such power hee must haue that sends so it is not a message sent by a king to a neighbour king but by a king to

his vassals the more are they to be respected and their words heeded
but let vs come to their charge

ite goe yee
they were not to abide still at ierusalem after they were endued with power from aboue they were presently to be walking their names apostles angels embassadors all sound a walking life
but in the word take notice of two things first the apostles doe not goe before they are sent it is the marke of a false apostle to bee so forward
hebr
no man should take vnto himselfe this honour except hee be called by those to whom christ hath giuen authority
it is an anabaptisticall dreame that euery man may thrust himselfe into this worke as he findeth himselfe moued by the spirit and it is an impious attempt of some vagrant schollars that make vp a poore liuing by exercising this function whereunto they were neuer ordered how farre are both these from that modesty which was in moses in ieremy and others who were so farre from going before they were called that they held backe when god would send them and pleaded their insufficiency so did chrysostome nazianzene other lights of the church
and indeede quis ad haec idoneus he is ouer well conceited of himselfe whosoeuer he be that doth not thinke it to be an burden a burden that will crush the strongest shoulders if he beare it as he should
notwithstanding when god commeth to quid statis hic otiosi why stand you idle as many as are fit to worke wee must yeeld our paines and doe as well as wee can though wee cannot doe so well as wee should it is no lesse a fault to bee too backward than to bee too forward and yet there are many such whether because they thinke the calling vnworthy their gifts and below their birth or because they will not vndergoe the paines and danger that doth accompany the same men that will neuer bee labourers except they be thrust into the haruest thrust not by the lord of the haruest but by their owne necessities or aduantages
a second note in this word ite is that wheras the world should come vnto god out of a sense of their owne want god is faine to send to them this word iustifieth that saying of god in the prophet am found of them that sought mee not am made manifest to them that enquired not after mee esay
neuer would adam haue returned to god if god had not sought him out and the sonnes of adam would perish in their sinnes did not he seeke them likewise
the marriage feast would hane no guests if the king did not onely inuite them but send his seruants also to call yea compell them therefore this ite should remember vs to magnifie the goodnesse of god which is so indulgent to vs carelesse men
but let vs come to the particulars of the charge and first see to whom they are sent they haue a great iourney to goe for they must goe to all nations

in the first mission the apostles were restrained to the lost sheepe of israel and forbidden to goe into the way of the gentiles or into a citie of the samaritanes that commission is here recalled and the partition wall is broken downe and their circuit is enlarged they are taught that in iesus christ there is neyther iewe nor gentile grecian nor

bond nor free male nor female all are one in him as st paul saith and st peter warned by a vision breakes out into this confession perceiue of a truth that there is no respect of persons with god but in euery nation hee that feareth god and worketh righteousnesse is accepted of him the prophets foretold it should be so

and now the apostles heare from christ that they must make good those prophesies their sound must goe out into all the world they must be the light of the world or rather carry the sunne of righteousnesse round about the world and they must be the salt of the earth that must season all mankinde which christ sanctified in his person

and though by others hee were called the sonne of dauid yet the name which hee commonly giueth himselfe is the sonne of man

and here see a difference between the typicall and the true redemption the typicall extended to one nation and moses law went no farther the true reacheth all mankinde and the gospell must be carried as farre
but here wee must take heede of a mistake the nations are oftentimes opposed to the iewes so wee finde it in the writings of the prophets and apostles but it is not so here for the apostles are willed to preach vnto all nations beginning at ierusalem and so saith st paul to you ought the gospell first to be preached but because you make your selues vnworthy of it loe we turne to the gentiles
and here also wee must not mistake for from the contempt of the iew occasion was taken of preaching sooner to the gentiles not simply of preaching to them had the iewes entertained the gospell the apostles would haue spent more time with them and they spent the lesse time with them because they did not entertaine it
the truth then is that all nations comprehend both iewes and gentiles and in the prophets the of iuda and israel so often mentioned meaneth no other than the knitting of the iewes and the gentiles into one church and making one flocke of these two kinde of sheepe the oliue tree will beare both branches rom
the seale of god is to be set vpon both reuel

and both make vp one peculiar people of christ one houshold one kingdome ephes

all are christs by the merit of his passion and therefore the apostles must goe to all euen to all that sit in darkenesse and in the shadow of death luke
and none are in any better case as st paul proueth to the romanes they were dead in their sinnes and destitute of the glory of god
all need the gospell and therefore it must bee preached vnto all and that it might bee preached the apostles were endued with all languages
the world is much troubled now about vniuersall grace the resolution in short may be this that forbearing to bee with gods predestination who is not pleased to acquaint vs with his counsell in his distinguishing persons in a ministers commission grace is vniuersall we should labour the conuersion of all and euery one neither should any man except himselfe but labour to bee in the number of that all to whom god sendeth

one note more before leaue this point
this large circuit was one of the perogatiues of the apostles they were not restrained to any diocesse or prouince as bishops now are but as the spirit led them and

they saw cause they might euery one plant and water the church euery where
it is true that for conueniency and expedition of their message they diuided themselues into seuerall quarters but without excluding each the other in this sense was peter the apostle of the iewes paul of the gentiles yet did peter preach to the gentiles and paul to the iewes
the power of orders in their successors is not limited in it selfe actually all that are ordered are inabled to exercise their function in any part of the world and they may be sent to conuert any nation and it is but for the more orderly gouernment and edification of the church that the exercise of euery mans orders is restrained to a certaine charge and without leaue or a case of great necessity those that breake these canons offend grieuously and there bee not a few that offend that way
hope that you which are now to be ordered will not proue such

hauing competently been told whither the apostles are sent it followeth that yee now heare whereabout
they must teach undefined span alphabet saith the text make disciples
and indeede it is not a bare historicall narration that they must make of the gospell they must seeke by morall instruction to winne the people vnto christ so teach that their hearers may become the followers of christ

and here obserue first the wonderfull goodnesse of god
the iewes and the gentiles conspired both to crucifie christ they put him to a shamefull and a painfull death would not you feare least and looke that he should send messengers against both with fire and sword to take vengeance on them and worke their vtter desolation but see our sweete iesu came not to destroy but to saue

hee forgetteth and forgiueth not onely peters deniall and the rest of the apostles forsaking him but also the impious blasphemers of his holy name and barbarous murderers of his sacred person hee is ready to receiue them vnto grace and admit them to be his disciples
a goodnesse so wonderfull that all the world may stand amazed at it

secondly all the world was rent into sects the iewes into pharisees sadducees herodians the gentiles they were distracted not only in their philosophy but in their diuinity also and had as manifold deuotion as they had opinions the word undefined span alphabet sheweth that the time was now come that they should all grow into one and in point of religion speake one and the selfe same thing and serue one and the selfe same god all nations should remember themselues and be turned to the lord psal
the prophets foretold it esay
one shall say am the lords and another shall call himselfe by the name of iacob and another shall subscribe with his hand vnto the lord and surname himselfe by the name of israel so speake the iewes but not the iewes onely for in zachary chapt

the prophesie is deliuered thus the inhabitants of one citie shall goe to another saying let vs goe speedily to pray before the lord and to seeke the lord of hosts will goe also ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations euen shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a iewe saying wee will goe with you for we haue heard that god is with you
and that they goe vp to be disciples it is plainly affirmed by esay chapt

many people shall goe

and say come ye and let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the lord to the house of the god of iacob and he will teach vs of his wayes and wee will walke in his pathes
in micah you shall reade the very same all comes to that which our sauiour christ speaketh be yee not called rahbi for one is your master euen christ matth

and the weapons of the apostles warfare were mighty through god to bring into captiuity euery thought to the obedience of christ
cor

but those weapons were not carnall but spirituall
it is for mahumetans to make their muselmans as they call them that is right beleeuers if he beleeue aright that beleeues in the alcaron a sinke of all senslesse and sensuall dreames by the sword
but such a manner of making schollars is fit for the matter they shall learne
and would too many christians were not too neare followers of them in this barbarous course who pretend the reclaiming of heretickes so they call the orthodoxe but indeede would propagate their owne heresies and what they cannot doe by the word that they endeauour by the sword
of this we may be sure that the apostles neuer made disciples that way neither would christ haue schollars come to him by constraint teaching is the heauenly meanes of conuersion those that are gods schollars are undefined span alphabet taught of god and his law is thora a doctrine christ went about teaching matth

and it was by teaching that the holy ghost led the apostles into all truth iohn

and indeede this is the most noble kinde of winning men to winne their vnderstanding and winne their will winne his reasonable faculties then you winne a man
not so if you force his body that may make him yeeld against his conscience but at best hee will be but an hypocrite and you haue gotten but the worser part of him not a man but his vizard which can neuer proue good either to the conquerour or the conquered
well then seeing teaching is gods method of conuerting you see whereof you must take care the word of god must dwell richly in you especially you must arme your selues with the sword of the spirit

which is the word of god that you may bee able to instruct the ignorant and refute those that are contrary minded
and this care doth st paul commend earnestly to timothie and titus
and you know that it was a very bitter reproofe which christ vsed vnto nicodemus art thou a master in israel and knowest not these things

if you will be pastors according to gods owne hrart you must feede his people with knowledge and vnderstanding
and let this suffice concerning the manner of bringing men to christ in the next place wee are to see what must be done to them that entertained the gospell

first they must consecrate them vnto god baptizate baptize them
this is not the first institution of baptisme for not onely iohn the baptist but the apostles also baptized as it is in st iohn chap
and howsoeuer there is a question whether the baptisme of iohn the baptist and of christs apostles be the same for christ baptized none in his person and of the same efficacy yet there is no question but that the baptisme is the same and of the same efficacy which the apostles administred both before and after christs passion
so that christ in this place extended

the baptisme vnto the gentiles but doth not of new institute it

to baptise is properly to dip into the water in that fashion were they wont to baptise except in case of infirmitie wherein the church allowed springling in stead of dipping but nicitie hath almost worne out the old forme at least in many places and yet the old forme doth most liuely represent that which st paul maketh the life of baptisme that is our conformitie to christ know you not saith he rom
that so many of vs as were baptised into iesus christ were baptised into his death therefore we are buryed with him by baptisme into death that like as christ was raised vp from the dead to the glorie of the father so wee should walke in newnesse of life
and indeed to baptize is not only to dippe into the water

which is immergere but it is tingere also to dip as it were into a so that a person dipped in commeth out of another hue than hee went into the water though not physically yet morally
go to saith gregorie nyssen thou that art baptized thou art become another man it doth not appeare in the lineaments of thy body it must appeare in the lineaments of thy manners thou must be dead vnto the sinne whereunto thou diddest liue and liue vnto god vnto whom thou wert dead thou must haue put off the old and put on the new man mortification and viuification remission of sinnes adoption to be gods sonnes iustification and sanctification are the blessings that wee reape by being put into that bath of regeneration which is also the very gate of saluation and maketh vs capable of all other sacred rites of the church which they call sacramenta or sacramentalia sacraments or things that haue cognation therewith
and indeed it is called sacramentum initiationis the sacrament of initiation or our admission into the church
all religions haue some ceremonious forme whereby they admit professors into their societie

the iewes had circumcision the gentiles had seuerall kindes of purifyings though herein the gentiles were but the apes of the iewes the same god that annext circumcision to the old testament was pleased that baptisme should bee annext to the new and by that toadmit all the world into one body of the catholicke church
but let vs come to the forme

they were to baptize in the name of the father sonne and the holy ghost
and here we meet with the first and greatest fundamentall principle in religion which is vnitie in trinitie and trinitie in vnitie in nomine in the name noteth the vnitie of the godhead against arius for were there more gods than one the holy ghost would say in nominibus and not in nomine

secondly in the phrase in nomine note that where no one name is specified all the names of god are comprehended for all note but one and the selfe same nature the riches whereof we cannot comprehend but vnder diuers names which helpe our weake vnderstanding but doe not diuide it
the mention of the father sonne and the holy ghost refutes sabellius and shewes that though the nature of god is but one yet in that one there are three persons whereof no one is the other neyther is one euer called by the name of the other when they are considered in

relation one to the other but in relation to vs they communicate in the name father and spirit is their common attribute because god is a spirit
saint basil hath a short but a good note undefined span alphabet we must obserue the forme of baptisme which is deliuered in the gospel and we must beleeue in them into whom we were baptised and we must glorifie as many as we beleeue in the father the sonne and the holy ghost
and indeed without the true knowledge and acknowledgement of the trinitie we cannot reape the comfortable fruite of our baptisme for wee owe it vnto all three persons though to none but to them three
st ierome saith right vna diuinitas vna largitio the deitie in all three is one and therefore all three bestow the same gift vpon vs we haue the same author of our regeneration as we had of our creation all three persons concurred to worke it and all three to put vs in possession of it
which that wee may the better perceiue

learne of st austine that this forme of baptisme doth containe the whole creede for the creede is is diuided into three parts euery part doth expresse one of the three persons and the benefit which the church reapeth from that person for so in the catechisme we teach children to summe vp the creede when we aske them what they learne therein they answer vs they learne three things first to beleeue in god the father that made them and all the world secondly to beleeue in god the sonne that redeemed them and all mankind thirdly to beleeue in god the holy ghost that sanctifieth them and all the elect of god marke then st austins conclusion symbolum igitur profitetur quis eo ipso quod baptizatur the receiuing of baptisme is a profession of the christian faith
and this is a principall reason why the sacrament of baptisme was as st austine telleth vs called sacramentum fidei the sacrament of faith

a little more distinctly now to open this forme you must take notice of these vsefull obseruations
first to baptize in the name of the father sonne and the holy ghost doth signifie to doe it by their warrant and commission for as god only is the fountaine of grace so none can appoint the meanes of conueying grace but only god
this checketh the presumption of the bishop of rome in multiplying sacraments and we must be warned to do nothing in gods seruice without his warrant
secondly to baptize in nomine is to baptize in the person of the trinitie a minister is a publicke person whatsoeuer he doth in the church he doth it in anothers name the parts of his ministrie being two to administer undefined span alphabet to present the peoples deuotion to god or to minister undefined span alphabet to bring gods message to the people hee should offer no other prayers to god but such as the church appointeth because he speaketh in her name and so when he bringeth any thing from god he must remember that he doth represent his person to the church
this must warne vs to come with holinesse to performe sacred acts because we sustaine the person of god the leuites washt their hands and their feete and we must wash our selues in the blood of christ

thirdly to baptize in nomine is to ascribe the efficacie of baptisme to the trinitie the minister must remember himselfe to be onely an instrument as st peter confesseth when hee wrought the miracle vpon the lame man acts
wee baptize with water but the gifts of the holy ghost come from god
wherefore let vs giue the glory of whatsoeuer successe we haue in our ministrie to the principall agent that is god

fourthly in nomine trinitatis is to baptize vnto their seruice and to dedicate vnto them the originall undefined span alphabet notes as much
and therfore the ministration of baptisme is accompanied with an abrenunciation those that are baptised by themselues if they be of age or if children by their sureties renounce the diuill and all his workes the pompes and vanities of the wicked world and all the sinfull lustes of the flesh then they deuote themselues vnto god to beleeue the articles of the creede and to liue according to the tenne commandements
to this end wee should baptize and we must put the people in minde of this morality and let not their thoughts dwell vpon the ceremonie as if when that were past all were done
finally inuocatur nomen trinitatis super nos from the time that wee are baptized wee must acknowledge that the lord is our god hee hath made vs not wee our selues wee are his people and the sheepe of his pasture or as the apostle speaketh wee are not our owne because wee are bought with a price wherefore we must glorifie god with our bodies and with our soules for they are his
we that are ministers then as we doe not baptize in our own name so must wee not denominate disciples from our selues as the corinthians some held of paul some of apollo some of cephas we must teach them all to hold of the same lord of him into whose name they are baptized
as the baptizer so the baptized should make vse of euery of these obseruations they must
beediscreet in not admitting more sacraments than god sendeth
reuerence the minister in regard of his person whom hee sustaines
giue the glory of the grace which they receiue vnto god
appropriate their seruice vnto him and
let him be their only lord
one scruple there is about this forme for in the acts cap


it should seeme that some were baptized onely into christ and some haue thought that the apostles at pleasure did vary the forme but the constant practice of the church in all parts of the world retaining this form permits vs not so to construe the words in the acts the meaning seemeth rather to be this that those persons confessing their faith in the redemption wrought by christ were baptised after the vsuall forme
some difference there is also betweene the east and west church for in the west church the minister speaketh thus to him that is baptized ego baptizo te in the east church thus baptizetur iste but the difference is confest on both sides not to be materiall therefore passe it ouer

you see here none of those many ceremonies which the church hath multiplied whereof many are very ancient and might be continued if they had not beene corrupted by the church of rome especially
themselues hold them not to be of the essence but of the solemnitie of

baptisme they cannot they doe not deny but that wee keepe the essence intire of those things which belong to the solemnitie our church hath retained so much as is thought fit for edification the rest it hath cut off not without cause and out of that libertie which euery church hath in such things

one thing may not omit to remember you of that are to be ordered that these solemne words in the name of the father son and holy ghost are vsed in your ordination and therefore what instructions haue giuen vnto you vpon the forme of baptisme you may make vse of euery one of them when you meditate vpon your ordination
and wish you so to doe

now lay together teach and baptize and then you see the method of your ministrie you must first catechise and bring your hearers to beleeue and then dedicate them vnto god because without faith it is impossible to please god heb
so st iohn baptized so baptized the apostles and the rule is non potest corpus baptisma recipere sacramentale nisi anima accipiat fidei veritatem

and baptisme saueth no man but faith is that which maketh a man partaker of grace and this faith doth not rest vpon the water but vpon the word accedat verbum ad elementum fit sacramentum non quia dicitur sed quia creditur

but as faith hath necessitatem medij so baptisme hath necessitatem praecepti we may by no meanes neglect baptisme if it may bee had and the contempt hazardeth saluation except a man be borne againe of water and the holy ghost bee cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen iohn
but faith in no case may be wanting
mistake not tertullian and nicetus vpon nazianzen orat de baptismo these words and thought that children except it were in extreame danger of death should not be baptized because they could not bee taught
the anabaptists out of this place and marke
proue that no childe must bee baptized vntill he commeth to the yeares of discretion
but they grosly mistake for christ is here and in st marke to be vnderstood de adultis none without the church were to be receiued in except they were first catechised and could professe their faith
the ancients write much de catechumenis worth our reading and imitating in the same case and of those adulti or persons come to the yeares of discretion must you vnderstand all those rules in the scripture which require those acts of the reasonable soule faith hope and charitie before admission into the church of whom yee may require one you may require all and of whom you may not require all you may require neuer a one
but christ doth not here prescribe who shall be baptized but how
at least christ doth not forbidde them to be baptized which are not taught but commands them that are taught to be baptized children of the faithfull must bee baptized vpon another ground they are not increduli they haue no actuall vnbeliefe neyther can they ponere obicem resist the grace of the spirit or make themselues vncapable thereof
secondly they are foederati they are in gods couenant by meanes of their parents whom when god receiued into the church he receiued them with this promise ero deus tuus

so then there is an obligation that lieth vpon children by a natiue allegiance vnto god the vow that their sureties make for them is not arbitrary but necessary and he is bound to make it good aswell as a childe vnder age is bound when hee commeth to age to satisfie his tutor for whatsoeuer hee reasonably doth expend vpon his health foode apparrell and whatsoeuer else the child did owe himselfe by the law of nature and of reason
see then is the child on his part so bound vnto god in his infancy and is not god bound vnto the child by his promise euen in the same infancie to giue him the grace of his couenant and the minister in his name to seale vnto the childe the assurance thereof by the sacrament surely hee is otherwise the stipulation is not mutuall
and take away this what is the prerogatiue of a christians childe beyond the childe of a turke or infidell to thinke there is none is impious and besides this they can name none
as then kings giue vnto their naturall subiects euen so soone as euer they are borne the benefit due vnto subiects though they expect their personall homage till they come to yeares of discretion so doth god deale with the subiects of the kingdome of heauen
and as it were very hard for a king to put a childe borne vnder his allegiance out of the protection of his law till he is of yeares to doe his owne homage and take his oath so standeth it not with the goodnesse of god to the benefit of the sacrament from him whom he hath taken to bee his childe till he can with his owne voice professe that hee doth vow himselfe to bee such
nay as in the primitiue church many together with holy orders receiued the qualities fit to discharge the calling though others were qualified before they were ordered euen so in baptisme some receiue the grace of faith hope and charity by the sacrament as infants though those which are come to yeares of discretion must bee in some sort seasoned with them before they are baptized

but the time biddeth mee end and reserue what haue farther to say vpon this text till some other time
wherefore let vs pray god that the pastors may so teach and the people so learne that both doing their duety in the kingdome of grace may receiue their reward in the kingdome of glory from him that hath all power both in heauen and earth
this he grant into whose name wee are baptized the father the sonne and the holy ghost to this one god in three persons be rendred all honour and glory now and for euer
amen

the second sermon
epigraph

matth

vers
teaching them to obserue all things whatsoeuer haue commanded you and lo am with you alwayes vnto the end of the world
amen

this text with the former verse doth containe christs right to send and his sending of his apostles hee had good right to send because hee is soueraigne lord of all the world
hee sendeth them with a common charge and comfort
their charge is to goe through the whole world to endeauour to conuert all both iewes and gentiles vnto christ
if in doing their errand they speed with any they are first to consecrate them vnto god by baptisme and then to conforme their liues vnto the gospell
this is the summe of the common charge
their common comfort standeth in the powerfull and perpetuall presence of christ christ promiseth to be with them hee will be with them that hath all power hoth in heauen and earth
and hee will neuer forsake them he will be with them alwaies or with their successors hee will bee with them vntill the worlds end
vpon this comfort they must sixe their eyes loe or behold and their hopefull prayer must desire this amen
these be the particulars whereinto heretofore speaking vnto you vpon a like occasion brake this and the former verses then handled christs right to send haue opened vnto you the large diocesse ouer which the apostles were set you haue seene how they must endeauour their conuersion and last of all opened vnto you the manner of consecrating beleeuers vnto christ farther could not goe at that time except would trespasse too much vpon your patience purpose now god willing to goe on and goe through with the particulars which remaine vntoucht
of the charge then there remaines one point to be handled and that is the conforming the liues of beleeuers vnto the gospell of christ
the apostles are willed to teach beleeuers to keepe all things whatsoeuer christ had commanded his apostles

in which words will obserue vnto you these two things first whereunto the seruice of a minister is resembled to the office of a schoolemaster the word undefined span alphabet alludes thereunto and they must proceed in this manner they must praeire verbo exemplo by word and by deed christs word for they must teach them to doe all whatsoeuer christ hath commanded but the deedes must bee their owne for christ hath layed his commandements

immediately vpon the apostles to do all things which haue commanded you

but let vs open these points a little more fully first the resemblance of a minister to a schoolemaster
the resemblance is very fit the first name that euer was giuen vnto christians was the name of disciples that is schollars wee finde the name in the former verse implyed in the word undefined span alphabet make disciples now if the beleeuers are disciples then the pastors are undefined span alphabet
masters of those schollars they are appointed to instruct them and so the most renowned of the fathers are in the writings of the fathers oftentimes termed

but that which will obserue vnto you that are to be ordered is from schoolemasters to learne a point of discretion they range their schollars into formes and though themselues bee neuer so learned yet they reade vnto their seuerall formes no deeper points than they are capable of if they should doe otherwise well might they shew their learning they would shew no discretion neither would the schollars be the better for that which they should teach them
and you must remember that it concernes you so to distinguish your auditors feede some with milke some with strong meate you must catechize the youth plainly

briefly the elder that are riper in yeares and iudgement must be built on with more learning and more full instruction
this is that our sauiour meaneth when hee saith that the steward of the lords house who is faithfull and wise will giue to euery one of the family his portion

and that in due season in due season not only speaking verbum dei in die suo opening such passages of scripture as are sutable to seuerall times and feasts a thing which discreet ministers should looke vnto and thinke that the church hath therefore disposed the passages of scripture in the liturgie agreeable to times that the minister should therehence learne what arguments hee should chuse for his texts
but this is not all that is meant by giuing the beleeuers each one his portion in due season it is meant also that they must so breed all that are committed to their care that the old shall not neede to come backe againe to learne their rudiments wherein they should haue beene throughly instructed when they were young
if this were done so many discontents would not grow betweene pastor and people while they contend which of the flocke should be or should not be catechized neither should ministers haue cause to complaine of the grosse ignorance which they finde in many that are well stricken in yeares
but this comes to passe for that the wholsome ordinance of the church is neglected which requires that you should call vpon children to performe in their owne persons that vow which was made for them by their sureties and not suffer them to partake the communion and other sacred rites till they can doe it so well that you may vpon your knowledge present them to the bishop and the bishop vpon try all confirme them and admit them to the other priuiledges of christianity but as foolish schoolemasters that ignorant people may thinke their schollars are very forward reade greeke to them

when they scarce vnderstand any latine so doe many vnaduised ministers teach the people great mysteries of religion who vnderstand not the elements thereof and their catechizings are more profound than their preachings should be
wish you would hope you will take heed of this errour and shew your selues more skilfull schoolemasters in breeding your disciples

there is another errour and it is some kinne to this and that is to teach them that are present the duety of some that are absent teach the people what is the pastors duty and the pastor what is the peoples duetie in a country parish to speake of their faults that are in authority and at an assembly of iudges of iustices to discourse at large of those things which concerne the duety of a country man
will not deny but that the moralities are so intermixt in scripture that occasion may bee giuen to intermingle instructions concerning different auditories but discretion requires that we should then passe by or at least lightly passe ouer what concernes others and insist vpon that which is fitting to the present auditory otherwise wee shall but feed a corrupt humour which is naturall to vs all and that is a desire to heare other mens dueties especially their faults and in the meane time to be carelesse of our owne dueties and to be puft vp with the conceit that our selues are the better because we heare others are so bad thus many are brought to sigh for other mens sinnes who might better spend their griefe about their owne
it were well if it were no worse it breeds an ill conceit of others which proceeds to vncharitable and vndutifull both words and deedes the world hath had too much proofe of it it is a seede of sedition your precise preachers haue sowne too much of it
but surely this is not undefined span alphabet to imitate discreet schoolemasters in teaching of the people

but pastors must not onely bee undefined span alphabet they must teach the people undefined span alphabet to keepe that which is taught them or obserue it in their liues and conuersation
a discreete schoolemaster doth not onely teach his schollars grammar rules whereby for example true latine may bee made but hee teacheth them also to make latine according to those rules neither doth he thinke his paines bestowed to any purpose before his schollars can doe that
euen so a discreet minister must teach his people not onely to know but to doe their duetie to turne their science into conscience so to learne christ as to become christians christians in that sense which st paul speaketh of to the galathians

my little children with whom am in trauell againe till iesus christ bee formed in you which you may farther interpret by his words in the first of that epistle liue saith st paul yet no more but iesus christ liueth in mee
to the corinthians likewise thus hee writes

that they are his epistle written by the spirit of god in the tables of their hearts by his ministry so legible as that it might bee seene and read of all
and elsewhere he saith that to learne christ is to put off the old man and put on the new
and certainly

hee is a very truant in the schole of christ whose life doth not expresse his learning that is not aswell a doer as a hearer of the word
it is a grosse conceit that true beleeuing without godly liuing will aduantage

a christian and yet it was an ancient conceit st austin was occasioned by it to write his bookes de fide operibus yea before him the apostles in euery epistle forget not to correct that errour
and indeede baptisme which is sacramentum fidei the obsignation of our faith doth it not represent vnto vs our dying vnto sinne

and rising vnto righteousnesse and if wee doe not make this vse of it non prodest sed obest they that are not the better by it shall fare the worse for their baptisme for the indelible character which we receiue in it will testifie against vs in the day of iudgement that wee haue not only transgrest gods commandements but also broken our vow of obedience which will adde to our guilt and increase our paine for the seruant that knoweth his masters will and doth it not shall be beaten with more stripes

and you know in the gospel that of the two sonnes he was the worse that told his father he would goe worke in the vineyard and did not

but keeping doth signifie not only obseruing of that which wee learne but the encreasing thereof also we must not thinke that the first steppe is the highest but we must grow in grace and from vertue to vertue there is a perfect age in christ whereunto we must all contend to come
we must keepe that which is taught vs as the earth keepeth seed corne the earth keepeth the seed to multiply it into one or more eares loaden with many graines the vnprofitable seruant kept his talent hee was punished because he did not vse it to increase and surely we must not looke to be approued of christ if wee are not the better the longer wee liue
of this truth if we were well resolued we would profit more than vsually wee doe by the paines of the minister

haue dwelt long enough vpon the resemblance of your calling let vs now see how we must proceede
we must praeire proecepto exemplo wee must lead the people by a good rule
a that will make good schollars chooseth good or classicall authours which he readeth vnto them and christ the chiefe master of the great schoole of the church leaueth not ministers which are but to reade what they will vnto their schollars but tyeth them to quae ego praecepi that which himselfe hath giuen in charge
whereupon st paul cor
vseth those words quae accepi domino tradidi vobis what haue receiued of the lord that haue deliuered vnto you
the apostles as told you on the former verse were embassadors of christ and so are all that succeede them in the ministrie now you know that embassadors deliuer not their own minde but the mind of their master the words that they speak are his words euen so the ministers of christ must deliuer christs message vnto his church it is to his will not their owne

that they must require the peoples obedience the only is christ and he the only master

this would haue you take notice of because one of the crafty insinuations wherewith popish seducers worke vpon simple people is this you are baptized into the faith professed in the church of rome at least as many of you as liued in queene maries dayes in henrie the eights dayes and before and if in your owne persons you were not yet your ancestors were

and if they or you were you haue vowed obedience then to the bishop of rome you ought then in conscience to be reconciled vnto him
thus pleade the seminarie fugitiues in their apologies
but though they haue stained baptisme with many superstitions yet haue they not therein or in the forme thereof set out by authoritie of the councell of trent so farre countenanced their forgerie as to binde christian people in their baptisme to any but to christ they that are baptized saith the apostle put on christ and in baptisme are adopted to bee children of god to obey the voyce of their father to heare the command of christ their sauiour
true saith the papist we require no more
but the pope is christs vicar and gods deputie from him we must receiue gods pleasure
wee will prouided he alwaies shew vs his euidence if vpon triall it appeare not to be counterfeit we will submit to it but this the papists haue not done neither indeed can they and therefore what without good record they obtrude to the church christian people may refuse without breaking their vow they made in baptisme

the baptizer and the baptized are the one to deliuer the other to receiue undefined span alphabet whatsoeuer christ giueth in charge to the church christ requires them both not to take from nor to adde to that which he commanded
we must not take from it ought
hee that will obey of christ his charge some part and omit some other doth not follow christs will but his owne for he taketh what he will not what christ will haue him take but he must know that tota obedientia is copulatiua as the schooles speake all the commandements of god are knit together with a coniunction copulatiue consider them asunder you may you may not seuer them
the philosophers held that the cardinall vertues are so knit together that he that hath one must needes haue all and hee that hath not all hath neuer a one
this is more true of the theologicall vertues faith hope and charitie hee that hath faith must haue hope and faith and hope will not be without charitie
so that no one branch necessary to saluation can bee kept at least be kept salubriter but in communion with the rest st iames therefore telleth vs cap

hee that is guilty of one is guilty of all because hee that commandeth one commandeth all
the law runneth in generall termes deut
cursed is hee that abideth not in euery point of the law to doe it
christ will haue vs resigne our selues wholly to his pleasure the pastor must not conceale ought from the people christ deliuered to his disciples whatsoeuer he had heard of his father requisite for their saluation and st paul opened to the ephesians all the counsell of god acts
faithfull pastors must imitate these good patternes neither for feare nor fauour must they spare to deliuer any part of the truth of gods word that were to humour men or rather to foster corrupt humours in them to their destruction
and people must not bee like vnto those that haue queasie stomacks who must choose their meate else will not feede on that which is set before them they must vse their stomacks to all spirituall sustenance and learne to digest whatsoeuer god speaketh to them by his ministers not doubting but that though many things rellish not pleasantly to flesh and bloud yet the things are wholesome

which christ commendeth vnto them

this all is exclusiue they that must keep all that which christ commandeth must doe that only they must adde as little to as they must take from it doe all saith god vnto moses exod
according to the patterne shewed in the mount the prophets the apostles kept themselues strictly to their charge
and you know that it is dangerous for an embassadour to patch any deuice of his owne to his masters instructions
what balaam answered vnto the messengers of balaac may well beseeme euery faithfull pastor if balaac will giue me his house full of gold

cannot goe from that word which receiue from the lord to doe more or lesse
what this same all is it would bee too much to open distinctly at this time
st marke cap

calleth it in one word the gospell and indeed that is properly christs charge
st luke cap

resolueth it into the doctrine of remission of sinnes and of repentance
we may reduce it vnto that which is represented in baptisme which is a conformitie to christ dying and rising from the dead in a word all christs commandements are eyther affirmatiue or negatiue in regard of the affirmatiue wee must imitate dauid a man after gods owne heart acts
who did facere omnes voluntates dei doe all that which god would haue him doe and touching the negatiue wee must imitate the same dauid who saith of himselfe that all wicked wayes he did vtterly abhorre psal
if thus we liue we shall doe as we pray gods will in earth as it is done in heauen

but who can doe so it is more than is possible for this fraile life wherefore we may vnderstand all two manner of wayes secundum partes and secundum gradus
according to the parts of our duety wee must omit no part but must exercise our selues in euery thing which christ requires as for the degrees though we must striue to attaine the highest yet if we reach not so farre we must not despaire

quisquis non potest implere quod iubet christus amet eum qui impleuit in illo implet that which was impossible for the law by reason of the weaknesse of our flesh

god sending his sonne in the similitude of our flesh for sinne condemned sinne in the flesh that the righteousnesse of the law might bee fulfilled in vs

which walke not according to the flesh but according to the spirit

hitherto you haue seene how the minister must praeire praecepto lead the people by good instruction now see in a word how hee must lead them by good example

the commandements that christ gaue he gaue to the apostles meaning that they should make vse of them themselues as well as perswade the people to it st paul vnderstood it so who saith of himselfe cor
beate downe my body and bring it vnder lest when preach vnto others my selfe become a reprobate and biddeth timothie bee an example to his flocke we must not be like scribes and pharisees

that bound heauie burdens and layd them vpon the peoples shoulders whereat they would not lift with one of their fingers
it is too foule a reproach for a minister so by his liuing to contradict his preaching as to deserue to be replyed vnto in that prouerbe medice cura teipsum and so destroy more than he can build
this dishonour wish you to auoyd

and so at length haue done with the charge come we now to the comfort
that told you standeth in the powerfull and perpetuall presence and assistance of christ christs presence is noted by ego vobiscum am with you which doth shew vs the truth of christs name immanuel god with vs

the holy land was called terra immanuel the land of god is with vs and because that was but a type look into the place where god put his name
ezekiel in the vision of the new hierusalem telleth vs that the name of that citie is iehoua shamma

dominus ibi the lord is there both in the new testament and in the old that saying of wisedome in the prouerbs cap

is receiued my delight is to be with the sonnes of men

but how can christ which is ascended into heauen be with them vpon earth the name of christ containeth the manhood as well as the godhead now the manhood is finite therfore cannot be both in heauen earth
true the manhood cannot but the man may
no man saith christ iohn
ascendeth vnto heauen but hee that descended from heauen the sonne of man which is in heauen this christ spake when he was vpon the earth
if the sonne of man could bee in heauen while christ was on the earth surely the sonne of man may bee on the earth while christ is in heauen
we must vnderstand it of the person which is but one though two natures subsist therein and both natures concurre in the production of the seuerall workes of the mediator in a manner which wee cannot conceiue
but we must take heede of the lutherans racking of this conceipt who would make the humanitie of christ to haue a double existence one finite which they call physicall the other infinite which they call hyperphysicall which distinction is such as thinke themselues doe not vnderstand am sure they doe not expresse it so that it may bee conceiued no more doe papists that to beare out transubstantiation haue coined the like

but to leaue them christ that is man is present euery where though not in his manhood yet in his godhead
if this bee too obscure take a plainer manner his presence by his holy spirit misit vicarium spiritum sanctum as tertullian speaketh if go not away saith christ the comforter will not come

but if goe will send him to you from my father and where the spirit is there is christ st iohn teacheth vs so by this wee know that he abideth in vs by the spirit that he hath giuen vnto vs

but it is not a bare presence that we haue to doe withall told you it is a powerfull presence the word ego must bee vnderstood with an emphasis that haue all power giuen mee both in heauen and earth that haue ouercome the world in my owne person and in my own person cast out the prince of this world that haue all iudgement giuen vnto me from the father whom all the angels doe worship
and indeede the presence of such a person was behoofefull whether you respect those to whom they were sent or that which they were to doe the apostles though they carried heauenly treasures it was but in earthen vessels themselues were but plain men of no great parts nor parentage in outward shew likely not only to be scorned but also to be persecuted when they had deliuered their message the dragon and all his angels were like fiercely to oppose them

ea christ told them that he sent them as sheepe amongst wolues
and how vnlikely might they thinke themselues to preuaile with all sorts of men and perswade them to forsake their idolatry and turne to god to beleeue in christ crucified take vp their crosse and follow him the vndergoing of such a danger the compassing of such a designe require a powerfull presence without which the apostles would neuer haue ventared to vndertake their charge
when god bid moses goe to pharaoh and command him to let israel goe out of captiuitie how doth he excase himselfe himselfe what adoe hath god with him nothing could put him in heart but ero tecum will be with thee

that so emboldned him that being but a single and a silly man at least the companie that hee tooke with him were of no great regard yet they ventured into pharaohs court into his presence and without feare of him or his greatnesse deliuered their message plainely and roundly and renued it more than once so resolute did gods presence make them
whereas afterward when god threatned to withdraw his presence by reason of the vntowardlines of the israelites cariage moses speaketh plainly to god if thou wilt not go with vs send vs not hence and yet then he had
men with him and more notwithstanding all that ayde he had no heart to enter vpon canaan till god promised againe that hee would goe with him as also his being with iosua made iosua valiant and of a good courage
to passe ouer the like promise made to gedeon and others not so pertinent to our purpose though shewing how auaileable gods presence is

ieremie and ezekiel that were prophets had an employment in nature much like vnto this of the apostles and wee finde that both of them startled at their message and held backe till god drew them on with a promise of being with them
but of all promises that is most markeable which is made to zorobabel zachary
who art thou great mountaine before zorobabel thou shalt become a plaine hee shall bring forth the head stone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace vnto it
this is the worke that zorohabel shall doe but what is the meanes not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord

in this sense our sauiour christ when he sendeth the apostles hee biddeth them not to take care what they should speake for that not they but the spirit of their father should speake in them and christ promised to giue them such a mouth and wisedome

as all their aduersaries should not be able to nor resist by this you may perceiue that it is not a generall presence that is promised which is common to the good and the bad but a speciall and that a gracious presence a presence which hee to whom it is vouchsafed may well ioy in and be comforted by for what good shall he want what euill neede he feare with whom christ is so present

but you may resolue christs presence with his apostles into the protection of their persons and cooperation in their worke

the protection of their persons non vt nihil patiantur sed vt non superentur christ did not protect them so as that they should not suffer the crosse but that they should conquer by it as himselfe had done their martyrdome was their conquest and they most aduanced the gospel when they sealed it with

their bloud
as for christs cooperation it is plaine that the conuersion of the world was mutatio dextrae altissimi that in such a moment of time the gentiles in all knowne parts of the world should bee so brought to entertaine the gospell was a worke of no weaker power than that of the almighty it was his worke qui facit mirabilia magna solus that onely doth great wonders

but what is this to vs that are ministers now wee are not apostles
true but wee are the successors of the apostles and christ promiseth not onely a powerfull but a perpetuall presence he promiseth to be with them alwayes vnto the worlds end
might tell you that the apostles liue in their writings to which all succeeding pastors are tyed and the miracles which they wrought are to posteritie the warrant that their worke was christs and so christ in vs is with them
but more distinctly
if hee had said vnto them onely alwayes wee might haue vnderstood it as of a personall promise a promise proper vnto them but when he addeth to the worlds end others are comprehended also euen the succession of pastors wee also must comfort our selues with the promise of gods protexion we shall neuer want crosses in the world but we must hope that god will make perfect his strength in our weaknesse
and we must comfort our selues with the cooperation of christ and acknowledge that wheresoeuer paul planteth and apollo watereth it is god that giueth the increase it is not we but the grace of god with vs that doth produce these supernaturall effects in the people their regeneration their absolution their ghostly consolation

vnder vobiscum with you you must comprehend not onely pastors but people also for where two or three are gathered together in my name saith christ am in the middest of them and in the reuelation christ appeareth walking in the middest of the golden candlesticks
in regard of protection

he promiseth to bee a wall of fire vnto his people and in regard of cooperation he promiseth that they shall be undefined span alphabet taught of god and they haue an vnction that teacheth them all things

finally the phrase am is not to bee neglected in this perpetuity for it doth not onely suite well with christ who is alwayes the same and changeth not but it noteth also the constancie of his operation whether he defend or worke by the pastors and in the people
oh would to god wee did all acknowledge this presence of christ in his church it would make vs carry our selues more holily and more readily doe our duety and in so doing continue alwayes the same

before leaue this point of perpetuity must refute a calumnie of the church of rome and correct their arrogancie
first to meete with their calumnie
they charge vs that contrary to this text we hold the church hath failed and may faile but certainely they can name no author of ours that euer deliuered such an opinion wee beleeue and confesse that christ hath built his church vpon a rocke

and that the gates of bell shall neuer preuatle against it that there shall not want christian pastors and people in the church

vntill christ shall come to iudgement
but this wee say that there is no branch of the church militant which

is not subiect to corruption in opinion and in conuersation yea many degenerate so farre herein that they may be lopped off from gods vine and cease to bee a church wee haue many wofull examples hereof in africa in asia in europe long since swallowed vp by mahumetans yet the body of the church hath continued still though it haue lost many of its branches
god was neuer pleased to suffer corruption so farre to preuaile but that he prouided a new plant to shoote out before he forsooke that which degenerated
you see how the church was continued till the floud in noah who succeeded the patriarches that descended from seth after the floud god preserued a sem at the least vntill the church was setled in abraham in whose posterity hee did continue it vntill christ came in the flesh neither did he vtterly forsake the iewes till the church was rooted in the gentiles amongst the gentiles he hath continued it notwithstanding tyrants hereticks but not without the spirituall husbandry cutting off those branches which were past recouery

this is true will the romanist confesse of all particular churches the church of rome is more that is the very trunke of the tree it is more than a branch the other churches may faile she cannot faile she and she only hath a priuiledge from erring from falling from the truth deriued from st peter
but told you when brake vp the text that the charge and comfort were common to all the apostles
st crprians rule is true the apostles were sent pari consertio potestatis honoris
cypr de simplicit clericorum
and that their successors are all equall herein is cleere because both charge and comfort are common to them all vntill the worlds end
were there no other text in the bible this is plaine enough to refute the vanitie of their priuiledge
doth not christ here speake to all the apostles yea and their successors too as themselues confesse and promise to bee with them to the worlds end and yet wee see that many apostolicall churches haue long since failed
they might saith a romanist but we cannot read st paul to the romans and read there that st paul doth not onely repute them but a branch of the church grafted in the old stocke

but biddeth them not to bee high minded but feare for they are not so grafted in but they may bee broken off againe no lesse than the iewes if they giue god the same cause
nay st paul goeth farther and insinuateth to the thessalonians

that the romans will fall away their bishop be the man of sinne who shall sit in the temple and vndermine the orthodoxe faith

but will trouble you no farther with this point onely obserue two errors of the romanists
one that they appropriate to themselues the common promises made vnto the whole church the second that they vnderstand them absolutely whereas they are meant conditionally
this difference they would haue vs obserue between the promises made to the old testament and the new
in the old testament they say that god promised indeed a perpetuall residence but it was if the iewes performed their obedience and they say true in it the promised of gods being with the king with the priest with the nation all were made vpon such a condition take for example the storie of iosua in the first chapter

god promised he would not leaue him nor forsake him yet wee see that not many chapters afterwards hee did forsake him offended with achans sacriledge
but obserue that this condition is not alwayes exprest in the promise it is vnderstood then when it is not exprest
it is no better with the new testament the forecited chapter of the romanes confirmes this truth and the euent hath proued it true
for though touching the elect it is true that god will preserue them and it is true absolutely that god will euer haue a church wherein those elect shall bee yet no man nor congregation must vnderstand the promises of god made vnto them but with condition of their performance of that which god requires if they doe they doe but vainely flatter themselues and wofull experience will make them spectacles to the world of this vaine presumption

to conclude this point the apostles had a charge and a comfort the comfort was to encourage them to performe their charge and the one must not goe without the other and as the apostles so we must entertain them
st chrysostome biddeth vs take notice that christ mentioneth the end of the world that hee may thereby hearten his disciples and preserue them preserue them from being besotted with any worldly hopes seeing they are transitorie and must haue an end they haue nothing in them for obtaining whereof they should forgoe their calling and as for the crosse which they are to suffer they should not bee troubled with that that also must haue an end wherefore doing their dutie christ would haue them minde that prouerbe non si male nunc olim sic erit this world shall not last euer yea this worlds comming to an end bringeth vs to a world that shall haue no end persecuters and vnbeleeuers shall find another world wherein stript of all their earthly comforts they shall haue miserie without end and the faithfull seruants of christ they also shall come to another world where they shall enioy the reward of their paines a blessed life for euermore so that the end is not only an end of consumption but of consummation also both to good and bad whereupon followeth another note that the word donec vntill doth not meane that after the end of the world christ wil be no longer with vs that sense of the world condemned by st hierome writing against heluidius in the case of the mother of christs virginitie must also receiue the same sense here
christ shall bee with the church then but in another manner than now not modo mediatorio as mediating to god for vs for then god shall bee all in all but he shall be with vs as he is with the angels that are confirmed in grace the enioying of his blessed presence shall be no small part of our eternall happinesse
haue opened vnto you the charge and the comfort that are exprest in my text two points remaine to be touched very briefly

the first is contained in the word loe which telleth vs whereon wee must place the eyes of our minde
wee are apt to busie them about disheartning obiects and plod vpon the difficultie of our charge and our own disabilitie and thereupon to shrincke backe and be vnwilling to bee employed in such seruices of god we can with the cowardly israelites

obiect the sonnes of anak in comparison of whom we are but grashoppers the high wals which we can neuer scale and so giue ouer our iourney our warfare
but god taketh off our eyes from these bugbeares that so affright vs and biddeth vs looke vpon him ego vobiscum am with you
if god be with vs who can be against vs

hee can cowardize all the hearts of our enemies and can curbe all their fiercenesse and can crush all their might nay he can turne a laban or an esau that deadly hate vs at least into seeming friends so farre as to salute to entreat vs kindly euen then when we expect they will doe vs mischiefe he can doe more turne euen saul into a paul make him a conuert when hee is hot in persecution finally he can make his conquer more dying by the hands of the enemie than when hee liued to encounter them
whensoeuer god putteth vs vpon any hot seruice ecce looke vpon this let this bee in our eye it wil suffer no feare to dismay vs
for seeing it is not our strength that must withstand them but gods power sustaining vs and there is no proportion betweene the power of a creator and all the creatures what is there that should trouble vs therefore let vs keepe our eyes on him and we shall bee vndauntedly patient of any disgrace or danger that wee must passe in performing our charge

againe though we bee naturally proud and thinke our selues worthy of high preferment and sufficient for great employment yet when wee are called to these supernaturall acts we are farre from being ambitious yea we are plaine incredulous that euer such things can be done by vs or that we are fit to be vsed in doing them wee can then plead our imperfections the imperfections of our head the imperfections of our heart it is strange then to see how vile we will be in our own eies and be glad that any one should haue the honour of this seruice rather than our selues we see this truth in moses ieremie and others
but this is a of our eyes christ taketh them off from this contemplation and placeth them vpon himselfe behold am with you it is my spirit my wisedome my grace that produceth these heauenly effects doe you the honour to make you my instruments but will be the principall agent regard not your weaknesse but my power and doubt not but that will doe by you whatsoeuer shall giue you in charge
let this be your encouragement christ would neuer send vs to baptize with water but hee meaneth to baptize with the holy ghost hee will neuer send vs to dispence bread and wine but hee will bee present to giue vnto beleeuers his body and blood if he send vs to binde and loose on earth himselfe will binde and loose in heauen finally the foolishnesse of preaching which he vttereth by our mouths himselfe doth accompany with a demonstration of his spirit ecce behold this behold how am with you how cooperate with you

the last particular which obserued is contained in the last word amen and this must second ecce behold
so soone as euer our eyes are vpon the right obiect and wee see what shelter what succour wee haue who doth support vs who doth worke by vs we must fall to our amen we must vndoubtedly beleeue the truth of christs promise and heartily desire the accomplishment thereof the word amen implieth both and we must say

amen both waies christ doth promise am with you will not leaue you nor forsake you whensoeuer or whithersoeuer you goe in my seruice we must answer amen lord am assured it will be so
am sure it will be so also when thou sayst loe am with you by you to giue light to them that sit in darkenesse and in the shadow of death and guide their feete into the way of peace
and seeing what thou lord sayst shall bee what is my desire but that it should bee da domine quod iubes inbe quod vis lord be thou with me and care not what charge thou dost impose vpon me thou biddest me goe into all the world amen so bee it will goe thou promisest to be with me wheresoeuer goe amen so be it
thus should ecce behold set amen and amen so be it should euer attend this ecce behold

haue done with my text and with the particulars which pointed out therein lay those particulars together and see how many things there are to be obserued by you that are to enter into holy orders
here you may see that the originall of your calling is from christ that christ calleth you to bee his embassadours the errand whereupon you are sent is the gathering of gods children into his church hee trusteth you with the seales of his couenant his sacraments he maketh your mouthes his oracles vnto the people his presence maketh your persons secure and sacred whether hee bee pleased that you be patients or agents his presence shall make you conquerours vnder the crosse and conuerters of sinnefull men
and this hee will doe by you and those that shall bee honoured with the like calling vntill the number of the elect are fulfilled and we all meete comfortably after our seruice is happily ended to raigne with him for euer in his kingdome of glory
hee that giueth you this charge grant you this comfort and make you so behold it that you may say amen vnto it
amen
amen

a sermon preached at a visitation at bathe
epigraph

zachary
vers
and tooke vnto me two staues the one called beautie and the other called bands and fed the flocke

this chapter containes the last and worst destruction of the iewes the manner and the cause is contained herein
the manner is most wofull for it is libellus repudij
god will haue no more to doe with them and they were to be no longer the peculiar people of god no degree of person was to bee exempted from this plague neyther were they euer to recouer their state againe
of so wofull a manner the cause was most iust curati noluerunt curari god gaue the iewes ouer pastors and people to a totall to a finall desolation because in their day the last of their dayes they would not know they did not regard those things that belonged vnto their peace
what those things were for the most for the best part wee are taught in these words that now haue read vnto you
the whole text is a parable wherein a ghostly shepheard is resembled to a bodily and the care of the one is represented in the others care
this is the summe of the whole text
but more distinctly
in moralizing the parable wee are to make two enquiries first who it is that speaketh these words secondly what that is which he meaneth by this speech
by laying together the parts of this chapter you shall finde that he that speaketh is our sauiour christ it is he that saith tooke to my selfe two slaues
as it is he that speaketh so that which hee speaketh concerneth himselfe the contents of his words are his owne exemplarie pastorall care

in opening this care the text will teach vs
how hee did furnish himself sutably to his calling
how he did employ his furniture to the good

of his charge
his furniture was authority and ability authority noted by the staues for padum insigne pastoris a shepheard is designed by his crooke and the crooke is an embleme of authoritie

authority is not enough he hath abilitie also his ability is noted by the propertie of the staues
the properties are two and so the abilitie groweth to be twofold the first is noted by beauty by which is meant veritas euangelica a shepheards skill in the couenant of grace the second is noted by bands whereby is noted charitas christiana the shepheards care of the churches peace
with these doth the shepheard furnish himselfe so hee saith tooke vnto my selfe tooke he receiued this furniture from his father so gather out of the fourth verse and what hee tooke therewith he qualified himselfe it fitted him for the charge which his father imposed on him
as the shepheard was full furnished so was hee well employed he employed his furniture for the good of his charge
his charge is noted by the flocke a short but a faire description of the church is intimated in this word for a flock is congregatio ouium an assembly of sheep euery member of the church is resembled to a sheepe and as sheepe so are these members sociable
of such a societie christ tooke care he fedde them hee wrought the properties of his statues into them hee instructed euery sheepe in truth and vnited them all in peace
this was christs pastorall care a care which we must hold exemplary if exemplary then other pastors must exemplifie it it beseemes vs to bee conformed to the chiefe shepheard of our soules
haue laid before you the contents of this scripture will now begin to enlarge them and fit them to this occasion
qui pascit pastorem the master shepheard that feedes the vnder shepheards so feed mee that may herein be the better able to feede you and both of vs may proue duetifull obseruers and followers of his pastorall care
the first inquirie that must bee made is who he is that speaketh these words hee is not exprest therefore the interpreters differ
of those that speake probably some will haue him to bee zacharie our prophet some our sauiour christ they are easily reconciled
it is an vndoubted rule that there are aswell reall as verball prophecies and not onely persons but things also were typicall in the old testament the prophets did often times act their persons whose stories they related certainely zacharie in this chapter doth personate both good and had shepheards the bad in the end of the chapter and the good in this seuenth verse
and this good shepheard is our sauiour christ st matthew puts it out of all doubt for in him wee read that certaine words in this chapter were fulfilled when iudas sold christ vnto the high priests now hee that was sold was hee that spake these words that is plaine by the contexture therefore he that speaketh these words must needes be our sauiour christ
neither is it strange that he should be resembled to a shepheard the prophets the apostles doe so compare him and least they should seeme to doe it with disparagement christ is pleased in the tenth of st iohn to warrant their doing by doing the same himselfe

but that which worke hereout is that this shepheard is non seruus sed filius he is no seruant but the sonne of god there is eminency in his person and indeede seldome is hee remembred without some addition importing his worth undefined span alphabet the shepheard of speciall note the good shepheard the great shepheard the chiefe shepheard of our soules are his honourable titles
the higher his person the more regard is due vnto him st paul argueth so heb
contempt cost the iewes deare and it is to be wished that other mens harmes make vs beware

secondly if the sonne stoope to this calling what seruant without intolerable pride may thinke himselfe too good for it no man can vnderualue it but withall hee must needes disgrace his blessed sauiour
note this the rather because it checks the gentrie the nobilitie that thinke so well of their birth that they thinke scorne to be of our coate
in the beginning of the world for many hundred yeares the kingdome and the priesthood did concurre in the same person when they were seuered they were diuided between two brethrene moses and aaron yea at this day christian kings haue somewhat of the clergie conferred on them at their coronation and they disdaine not to be reputed mixt persons
will not remember those senators and officers of state that in the primitiue church became clergie men nor the princes that in the church of rome at this day vndergoe our calling though according to the fashion of that corrupt church with more policy than piety
onely this will say that seeing our calling in the state of grace is to bee kings and priests hee is vnworthy as a priuate person to haue this honour that scornes it in a publike one which hath an addition not a diminution and maketh them fathers which were before but sonnes the enlarging of the prerogatiue should vindicate it from contempt especially seeing therein wee haue communion with christ
and let this suffice for the first enquiry
the second enquiry must be into the meaning of the words
told you they meane nothing but the pastorall care of christ
in the deliuery wherof the first thing that obserued in the text was the shepheards furniture and thereof the first part appeared to be his authority for it is his authority that is noted by the staues
the originall of this phrase is partly historicall and partly mysticall the history is briefely this
the first patriarches as it appeares in genesis were for the most part shepheards and yet to them being such god did commit both ecclesiasticall and ciuill power
in an honourable remembrance hereof when the church of domesticall became nationall the title continued still the priest the prince both were called shepheards and each is said to haue his shepheards staffe moses no lesse than aaron and aaron no lesse than moses though in time the princes staffe was changed into a scepter and the priests into a crocier yet are both monuments of the old shepheards staues
this is the originall of the phrase which we finde in the rituals

but may not conceale from you a later birth of the crocier wee read it in that part of the ciuill law which is intuitled consuetudines feudorum

there you shall finde that after the translation of the romane empire vnto the germanes the forme of inuestiture of any person with office or land was per traditionem baculi the party doing his homage was inuested by receiuing of a staffe
as our originall is from those nations so are their customes retained amongst vs when the great officers of the court of the crowne are created they haue a staffe deliuered them and in court barons are admitted by the deliuerie of a wand bishops holding large temporalities did homage for them and were inuested with them for many years per traditionem haculi annuli by receiuing a staffe and a ring from their soueraigne from whom they held their temporalities
about this manner of inuestiture the popes neuer left wrangling with the emperours and with other kings vntill by peters keyes and paules sword excommunicating them and vncrowning them he wrested it from their hands and exempted the clergies person from the oath of allegiance farther than it was subordinate vnto him and made himselfe master of all such inuestitures to the preiudice of all christian kings and states
but we must learne to distinguish the old symbolicall staffe from this historicall and not confound the power spirituall which a pastor hath from christ with the temporall which he deriueth from princes the confusion hath shed much christian blood and we must take notice of this that we neuer be engaged in the like vniust quarrell
but enough of the historie

there is a mysticall meaning which the holy ghost aymeth at in mentioning the staffe and that is the analogie betweene the care that is taken for irrationall sheepe and that which must bee taken for the rationall god that trusteth princes and pastors with the gouernment of his people will haue them to set before their eyes a iacob feeding labans sheepe or a faithfull shepheards care and thereof doth he put them in minde in this phrase
but forget my principall note told you that the staffe is the hieroglyphick of power and indeed power is here meant virga potentiae as it is called in the tenth psalme it is a rod of power the titles that are giuen vnto pastors they all sound superioritie episcopus oeconomus bishop steward leader architect ghostly father
this cannot bee denied vnto the pastor of whom this text speaketh who as you haue heard is not seruus but dominus is lord of the house and therefore rules undefined span alphabet with soueraigntie and with power
touching the seruants there may bee some question because to them is committed onely undefined span alphabet they are onely ministers
but their ministrie must not be mistaken for it is undefined span alphabet they doe administer indeede but it is the power of christ that they administer so saith christ himselfe as my father sent me so send you
a steward is a seruant in a house but such a seruant as vnder the master commands the whole familie wee are stewards the keyes are committed vnto vs we are to rule not to be ruled by the people

but this power brancheth it selfe into two parts for there is baculus directionis and baculus correctionis the pastors power is first to teach the

people their dutie they must receiue his words as the words of god and gods words are commanding words and they are binding lawes it is not left vnto the peoples choyce whether they will or will not obey them they proceede from the staffe of direction that directs in foro poli not soli the consciences of christian people

as the power is of direction so is it of correction also not ciuill
tis true that the bishop of rome hath patcht such a power to his pastorall staffe but we can claime none such from christ our are spirituall we binde or loose mens soules we remit or retaine their open or shut the kingdome of heauen vnto them
but though the weapons of our warfare are not carnall but spirituall yet are they mighty through god to the pulling downe of strong holds

and to reuenge all disobedience
iustly therefore is this branch of power to be awed that is contained in the staffe the staffe that is the embleme of the power of correction

will obserue no more vpon the first part of the furniture the pastors authoritie that is noted by the staues
come on to his abilities which are gathered out of the properties of the same staues whereof one is the staffe of beautie the other of bands
might tyre out both my selfe and you if would scan the seuerall coniectures of the learned commenting on these words some by them distinguishing the sheepe eyther into the families of noah and abraham or into the nations of iewes and gentiles some distinguishing the shepheards into good and bad some the furniture of the good shepheards which they will haue some to bee the law of nature and the written law some restraine it onely to the written word and finde in these words the sweetnesse of the gospel and the seuerity of the law
the grounds and mistakes of these seuerall opinions list not to discusse the truest commentarie is that which wee finde in this chapter
at the tenth verse then we reade that when the shepheard brake his staffe of beauty he disanuld with that fact his couenant that he had made with all people and what was that but the couenant of grace· at the fourteenth verse where he breaketh the staffe of bands he addes that by that fact hee did dissolue the brotherhood between israel and iuda and what is that but the band of charitie whereupon it fairely followes that these words doe note the properties of the shepheard the properties of the euangelicall shepheard who must be well seene in the gospell and keep christians at one veritie and charitie are meant the one by the beauty the other by the bands of the staues

and indeede these are the two grounds of a blessed church veritate nihil pulchrius nihil fortius vnitate there is nothing that allures more than the gospel or that holds faster than charitie the losse of eyther of these will much distresse a church
for it will thereupon be either deformed or distracted deformed with heresie if it want the truth and distracted with schisme if it want charitie it will become tohu undefined span alphabet bohu without shape and voyde returne to its former chaos
christ the great shepheard was melchisedech king of righteousnesse and king of salem

also that is king of peace hee not onely beautified his church with righteousnesse but fortified it with charitie also
and whatsoeuer pastor vnder him doth not herein resemble him he is too like the idoll shepheard mentioned at the end of this chapter and hath eyther his arme dryed vp or his right eye darkened he wants a staffe of beauty or of bands and so will be the cause through defect of his abilities that the church be eyther despised by schisme or with heresie disfigured

but let these abilities asunder and looke into them seuerally
first into the staffe of beauty
the word in the originall signifieth pulchritudinem suauitatem fairenesse and sweetnesse whereof the later is a consequent vpon the former for the fairest persons if they degenerate not are most commonly the sweetest natures
certainely it was so in our sauiour christ who was the fairest of the sonnes of men and grace was poured in his lips and so the gospell that commeth from him beareth both the characters of his nature fairenesse and sweetnesse
touching fairenesse cyrillus alexandrinus on this text giueth this note undefined span alphabet the doctrine of the gospell is eminently beautifull but hee addes well undefined span alphabet wee must not mistake it is no corporall but a spirituall beauty for the kings daughter is all glorious within

but the corporall may teach vs what to obserue in the spirituall corporall beautie consists of figura and forma proportion and complexion euery member of a body must haue his iust lineaments and his proper die and then the body is beautifull
something answerable hereunto there is in spirituall beautie in the beautie of the gospel it teacheth how all men should bee ranged in their orders and rest contented with their measure of gifts it teacheth the true reference between parents and children masters and seruants magistrates and subiects pastors and people yea between pastors it noteth the inequalitie which it maketh good by the analogie which is betweene our naturall body and the church
as it doth thus teach proportion so doth it complexion also the blood of doctrine as tertullian cals it is defaecated clensed from all earthly dreggs and drosse it endureth no earthly and grouelling affections no melancholy or dismall cogitations
as no humour more than melancholie doth deforme the beauty of complexion no more is any thing more opposite to the truth of the gospell than sowre and hellish desires and thoughts
but vnto beauty it is not enough that the blood be purged from melancholy the colour will not bee viuidus floridus fresh and cheerefull if the blood be eyther dilutus or sublimatus nimis too watery through phlegme or too fierie through choller the one maketh a fallow complexion the other too high coloured
and verily the gospell doth not humour men nor feede their raw and vndigested vanities whereunto our adle heads and euil hearts while we affect commerce with this world are prone
as it doth not humour the carnall wantonnesse of men no more doth it make them enthusiasts nor carry their thoughts into the closet of gods secrets there to reade what hee hath not reuealed in his

word it teacheth them not to seeke the things that are too hard for them nor to search rashly things that are too mighty for them it clippeth the wings of such soaring spirits with the admonition of the apostle rom
let no man presume to vnderstand aboue that which is meete but that hee vnderstand vnto sobrietie
the gospell that worketh such spirituall proportion and complexion is iustly termed a staffe of beauty
undefined span alphabet saith an old philopher no painter or caruer can limme or graue any picture or statua that in any sort can represent the exquisite beauty that is in truth
he spake it of philosophicall it is much more true of theologicall truth
the sonne of syrach compares simon the sonne of onias the high priest ministring in the sanctuarie vnto the morning starre in the middest of a cloud

vnto the moone when it is at full to the sunne shining vpon the temple of the most high to the bright in the faire clouds to the fairest flowers the goodliest trees the richest iewels he concludes

when hee put on the garment of honour he was cloathed with all beauty so likewise saith the wise man in the long garment was all the ornament or as some reade all the world as if all the beautie of the world were concluded therein yet all this was but a transitorie type types come short of their truths and things temporall of those things which are eternall if those were so beautifull how beautifull are these learne the inequalitie from st paul if the administration of condemnation were glorious much more doth the ministration of righteousnesse exceede in glorie for euen that which was glorified was not glorified in this point that is as touching the exceeding glorie for if that which should be abolished were glorious much more shall that which remaineth be glorious cor
this is excellently represented in the image of the church which we haue
with the moone that is all mutable and transitorie things vnder her feete her selfe was cloathed with the sunne and had vpon her head a crowne with twelues starres

will not trouble you with the portraiture of the church which is made cant
where euery limbe of her is set forth in its proper beauty
that which will onely note is that this beauty came by the gospell

so esay foretold arise hierusalem bee bright for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen vpon thee and the apostle confirmes it when out of another place of the same prophet he congratulateth the time of christs comming

and the publishing of the gospell by his ministers with those words rom
how beautifull are the feete of them which bring glad tidings of peace surely that was the time wherein christ came to make his church sine macula ruga without spot or wrinkle to make heauenly hierusalem the perfection of beauty as it is called in the psalme and described in the end of the reuelation
doe not now wonder at dauids exclamation how amiable are thy dwellings psalme
and his one thing haue desired psalme
for hee cannot but bee rauished with loue that hath a sight of this heauenly beauty

the word doth not onely signifie beautie but sweetnesse also and indeed christ was wholly delectable as we read in the canticles his fruit was sweet vnto his spouses mouth the gospel is sweeter than honey and the

honey combe the prophet esay compares it to a banquet of sweet wines of meat full of marrow the gospell to a marriage feast his spirit is the spirit of adoption and of libertie his burden is light his yoke is easie st paul gal

doth amplifie this by the opposition of mount sion to mount sinai in a word christ hath his name from oyle euen sweete oyle to signifie the softnesse and pleasantnesse of his nature zacharie foretold he should come meeke vnto his church himselfe bids his disciples matth

learne of him because he is meeke and st paul exhorts the christians by the meeknesse of our sauiour iesus christ
st bernard found much sweetnesse in the name of iesus also when he conceiued that it was mel in ore melos in aure iubilum in corde honey in the mouth musicke in the eare and the very ioy of our hearts so that christs first staffe was a staffe not only of fairenesse but of sweetnesse also

and this is for our imitation that are pastors
at the deliuering of the crocier we finde in the ritualls that the ordainer speaketh these words to the ordained accipe baculum pastoralis officij vt sis in corrigendis vitijs piè seuerus our staffe inableth vs to strike at sinne but we must neuer strike but with tender compassion towards the sinner in curing of spirituall sores wee must imitate good chirurgions haue lions hearts but ladies hands
this is that we must learne from the staffe of beauty

come now to the other staffe the staffe of bands or the second ability that must be in a good pastor
as he must bee well skild in the couenant of grace and furnished throughout with euangelicall truth which is the sweet beauty of the church so must hee also be prouided of and tender christian peace taking care that the parts fall not asunder the one from the other

undefined span alphabet when men are come so farre as gods truth there is nothing they should prize so much as christian peace
and this peace depends much vpon the shepheards staffe

for undefined span alphabet it depends much vpon the pastors gouernment whether the people shall liue at peace or no it depends vpon his exemplarie and doctrinall charitie
for charitie is undefined span alphabet as nazianzene speaketh it is louing nay it is the mutuall loue of men st paul speaketh more closely to our purpose when he saith it is undefined span alphabet

the band of perfection or the knot of those that are initiated in truth

and well may it be called a band first quia adhibet impedimenta
there are two impediments which stay the dissoluing of societies the one is if a man doe no wrong the other is if hee be not ouerfeeling of wrong done vnto him
now charitie hath both these properties it is innocent and patient it doth no euill and it is it couers a multitude of sinnes and taketh heede that it giueth no offence you shall find these properties in the thirteenth of the first to the corinths
as it is accompanied with these impediments so is the nature of it to worke societie for charitie is virtus vniens as the soule knits together the heterogeneous parts euen so doth charitie different persons and maketh them all as one by it is wrought the communion of saints

but the staffe is not of a band but of bands which implies that the charity

is manifold
and indeede so it is there is the loue of god and the loue of our neighbour each is a band st chrysostome compareth one to the bodie the other to the soule the body without the soule and the soule without the body cannot make a man no more can the loue of god without the loue of our neighbour nor the loue of our neighbour without the loue of god make vp a full charitie if the loue of our neighbour be wanting we want the body of charitie and wee want the soule if there bee wanting the loue of god put both together and then the charitie becomes vincula bands

some obserue a threefold loue in charitie amorem honestum iucundum vtilem
it is true that these three are reckoned in philosophie for distinct and may goe asunder as the vegetable sensitiue and reasonable soules doe yet as none hath a reasonable soule but hee that hath all three so doth charitie containe all three kinds of loue
honest loue because of vertue without which there is no charitie
pleasant loue because of familiaritie for charitie is sociable
profitable loue for none of them that are in charitie thinketh any thing of that which hee possesseth to be his owne but they haue all thing common acts
common quoad undefined span alphabet though not quoad undefined span alphabet for their mutuall vse though without preiudice to their distinct propriety
this is the second reason why charitie is called bands

a third reason is because as chrysostome wittily obserues by charitie undefined span alphabet hee that is but one becommeth many looke how many friends a man hath so manifold is he hee hath so many bodies so many soules so many paire of eyes to watch for him so many paire of eares to heare for him so many tongues to speake for him so many feete to go for him finally so many paire of hands to fight or to worke for him so may charitie make a thousand to be but as one and one to be a thousand times himselfe worthily therefore is charitie called bands and reckoned the propertie of one of christs staues
and indeede christ came especially to recommend this vnto the world it is the new commandement that he gaue vnto his church that we should loue one another and tels his iohn
that by louing one another all men shall know that they are his disciples for the spouse of christ is as an armie with banners cant
and ierusalem is as a citie that is compacted in it selfe psal
she is vna in vno one church vnder one head christ so much these compounds import undefined span alphabet

they note all the effects of the staffe of bands
let this suffice concerning the second abilitie

hauing thus vnfolded the meaning of the staues must now shew you how christ furnished himselfe with them for so he saith tooke vnto my selfe
which words looke backe vnto the fourth verse where the father layeth the commandement vpon him saying pasce oues feede the sheepe appointed to the slaughter here hee professeth his obedience to his father signauit pater the father designed him and he came into the world to doe his will that sent him iohn
st paul giueth the rule no man taketh the honour of priesthood but he that was called of god as was aaron therefore christ took not vnto himselfe this honor to be made the high priest

but hee that said vnto him thou art my sonne this day haue begotten thee heb
gaue it to him
and if christ did not take this honour before it was giuen much lesse may any other without a lawfull calling intrude into this sacred calling and entermeddle with these holy staues

secondly christ tooke vnto himselfe though this phrase may bee here as it is elsewhere pleonasticall yet is it not amisse to obserue that christ did qualifie himselfe with the staues before hee did exercise himselfe in his calling
many venter to bee heads before they are worthy to be hands or feete undefined span alphabet as nazianzene speaketh purifie others being impure themselues undefined span alphabet such men may rather goe for than graue teachers of the people for a graue teacher must first haue the staues before he vse them secondly he must worke the effect of the staues into himselfe before he endeauour to worke others by them
but many saith nazianzene undefined span alphabet wrangle like artisans to make their partie good rather than like graue diuines keepe the people at one
thirdly as a pastor must haue both the staues so must hee take them in their order the staffe of beauty before the staffe of bands for the holy ghost goeth before the catholicke church

and communion of saints yea the church is undefined span alphabet so that he is not in the church that is not for the truth there can be there may be no vnitie where there is not veritie

there can be none the historie of hereticks in epiphanius and irenaeus testifie as much there may be none for what communion hath light with darknesse the enmitie betweene the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent is undefined span alphabet a sacred warre neyther may the church entertaine any peace with those that haue warre with their sauiour christ
you haue seene how christ did furnish himselfe sutably to his calling it remaines that shew you now in few wordes how hee did employ his furniture to the good of his charge

his charge is called by the name of a flocke which told you is though a figuratiue yet an implicit definition of a church
for a flocke is a congregation of sheepe and euery member of the church is a sheepe so they are often called and all true members are so indeed
but wee must remember a distinction of st austins

multae oues foris multi lupi intus there bee many wolues in sheepes cloathing and many sheepe in wolues skinnes both in time will appeare in their proper hue and a sheepe shall be only he that is a true member

will not enter vpon the manifold analogie that is betweene a member of the church and a sheepe will keepe my selfe to the words that go immediately before my text wherein they are called grex occisionis pauperes terrae they are appointed to beare the crosse that is their portion in this world and the world thinkes it cannot be better occupied than in slaughtering of them
neyther are they thus vsed only by their enemies but by their own shepheards also god complaineth hereof in this chapter as also in ieremie
ezekiel
the stories of the maccabees and iosephus confirme this truth to say nothing of the ecclesiasticall storie of the new testament
as they are appointed to the crosse because sheepe

so are they pauperes terrae poore not so much corporally though that followes the crosse but poore in spirit lowly in their owne eyes humble out of the conscience of their owne vnworthinesse tractable vnder hand of their shepheard and pliable to his staffe such are sheep that pelong to the fold

of such sheep the church is a flocke
solitarinesse is a note of in beasts for those that are tamed heard and flocke together
it is no lesse true of rationall than irrationall sheep true sheep doe fold together and if any stray his complaint will shew his propension to the fold and if any doe stray and not complaine it is to bee doubted whether hee haue the true nature of a sheep
which they should obserue that can bee contented to liue and dye either excommunicating themselues or beeing excommunicated by the church a shrewd argument that they are no sheepe
but must goe on
as this was his charge so christ bestowes his furniture vpon it he fed he flocke
cannot better expound the phrase than to say he wrought the properties of the staues into the sheepe
of iacob a good shepheard it is obserued that when hee would haue speckled sheepe hee pild certaine wannes and layd them in the watering troughes and when the sheepe to drink and were in heat before the rods they brought forth young partie colours
and no doubt but christs sheepe if they be spiritually warine when they come to drinke of the water of life in gods church they would be altered by the shepheards staues certainly st paul saith as much of the efficacie of the gospel we all with open face behold as in a mirrour the glory of the lord and are changed into the same image from glorie vnto glorie euen by the spirit of the lord
there is a speciall reason why christ is said to feed the flocke because he made himselfe food for it his flesh is meat indeed and his blood is drinke indeed iohn
and with what he fed with the same must we feed we must desire to know nothing amongst our people but christ and him crucified
but as we must so feede so must wee doe it discreetly and constantly the sheep are not all of one growth some must haue milke and some stronge meat
secondly we must remember that grace is like meat it must be supplyed otherwise the sheepe will starue certainly neuer come to their full growth
last of all neither must the pastor administer nor the people expect any better patterne than that of this great shepheard wee can haue no better furniture than the staffe of beauty and bands and the people can learne no better lessons than truth and peace

wherefore let vs all pray god that we that are pastors in our seuerall places may execute the iudgement of truth and peace in the gates of our hierusalem and the people that heare vs may profit in the knowledge and in the loue of god
so shall not these staues bee wanting to vs and wee shall bee conformed

vnto them and both pastours and people shall truely and comfortably sing the three and twentieth psalme the lord is my shepheard therefore doe want nothing hee maketh vs to rest in greene pastures and leades vs by the still waters he restores our soules and leades vs in the path of righteousnesse for his names sake

to whom with the father and the holy ghost bee rendred honour and glory amen

vers
by the grace of god am what am and his grace which was bestowed vpon me was not in vaine but laboured more abundantly than they all yet not but the grace of god which was with mee

saint paul testifying to the corinthians the resurrection of christ and ranging himselfe amongst the select witnesses thereof doth at verse the ninth meet with an exception that might bee taken to his former life and remoue all preiudice to his testimonie that might grow herehence
for as hee doth ingenuously confesse that he was most vnworthy of his sacred calling so doth hee also thankefully acknowledge a wonderfull alteration that god had made of him
and this alteration is the argument of those wordes that now haue read vnto you
touching this alteration the text will teach vs whence it sprang and wherein it stood
it sprang from a cause powerfull and mercifull powerfull from god mercifull for the preuailing attribute was grace from this gracious power or powerfull grace the alteration sprang
but wherein stood it in st paules indowment and in his employment in both we shall find somthing common to the whole church and something proper to the clergie

the clause that expresseth the endowment is short and dark am that am you must resolue and cleare it thus am a member of christ that is an endowment common to the whole church am also a minister of the church that is proper to the clergie
but what am am by grace by the grace of adoption am a member of christ and am a minister

of the church by the grace of edification
such was st paules endowment

touching his employment the text teacheth vs two things first that he did not neglect gods gifts as he was not emptie so hee was not idle gods grace bestowed on him was not in vaine not the grace of adoption he was not carelesse of a holy life of the common endowment not the grace of edification the proper endowment hee was no vnprofitable seruant neyther stood he in the market place idle when hee should labour in his lords vineyard
secondly vnto his vse of these gifts there concurred more workers than one hee tels vs who they were and what was eyther of their preheminence
they were two himselfe laboured and gods grace that laboured also with him
either of these workers had their preheminence st paul had he laboured more than all and that in either grace he striued to exceed all in holinesse of life and in the painefulnesse of his ministrie
as st paul had a preheminence in working so had grace also it had a preheminence aboue st paules preheminence yea st paul doth confesse that hee doth owe all his preheminence in working to the preheminent working of gods grace laboured more than all yet not but gods grace that was in me
when we haue thus considered the particular branches we shall point at two good obseruations that arise out of the whole bodie of the text they are st paules sinceritie and his modestie
sinceritie in giuing god his due glorie he ascribeth vnto god the originall the gifts the vse of whatsoeuer was good in him or was done well by him
and there can be no greater modestie vsed by a man in speaking of himselfe than st paul expressed here in his extenuating and correcting speeches he was a member of christ a minister of the church he mentioneth neither he contenteth himselfe with this commendations am that am
and for his vse of gods gifts hee attributeth no more vnto himselfe than that which was next vnto nothing gods grace bestowed on me was not in vaine so he extenuateth his worth
and because hee was to say something more of himselfe to stoppe the mouthes of his maligners laboured more than all he presently correcteth himselfe as if he had hee drownes all the conceit of his owne eminencie in the contemplation of the much greater preheminence of the grace of god
haue opened the contents of this scripture which god willing shall now farther vnfold and haue an eye in vnfolding of them vnto this present occasion
and because they will concerne both pastors and people shall desire both to follow me with their religious attention

first then wee are to see whence the alteration of st paul did spring
might in a generalitie tell you it sprang from heauen so we find in the acts of the apostles

and st austine hath obserued it
and indeede it is no fruit that springeth from the earth the earth may make men of better become worse by reason of mans mutabilitie and the kingdome of darknesse but if of worse men become better the cause thereof must bee sought in heauen
especially if as st paul of wolues they become sheep

of blasphemers beleeuers of persecuters preachers of the faith

but told you this heauenly cause is powerfull and mercifull powerfull god is the cause
and the cause cannot be lesse than god for the alteration is a creation so it is called by st paul cor
euery one that is in christ is a new creature
now creation as wee reade in the entrance of our creede is a worke of an almighty power
and indeed it must bee so for it produceth things either ex non ente simpliciter out of nothing at all or else ex ente non disposito out of that which in nature hath no possibilitie to become that which it is made yea st paul meaning to shadow our new creation by the old chooseth the branch wherein the subiect was so farre from being disposed that it was directly opposite to that which it was made god which commanded light to shine out of darkenesse is he which hath shined into our hearts to giue vs the light of the knowledge of god in the face of iesus christ cor
st paul rom
vseth another similitude of graffing a branch of the wilde oliue into the true but contrary to nature for nature aduiseth to set sweet graffs into sowre stocks and though it be naturall for the stocke to be vehiculum alimenti to conuey the nourishment to the graffe yet naturally virtus temperamenti the qualitie of the iuice is from the graffe not from the stocke
but in our supernaturall graffing it is farre otherwise the branch of a wilde oliue is made partaker not only of the roote but of the fatnesse also of the true oliue
being then a worke so contrary to nature it must needs be a work of the god of nature
and indeed we learne in st iohn cap

that the sonnes of god are borne not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god hee of his owne will begetteth vs by the word of truth that we should be the first fruits of his creatures iames

as the cause is most powerfull so is it also most mercifull for the attribute that preuaileth with god in this worke is grace
all good gifts before the fall vouchsafed angels and men proceeded from his goodnes but after the fall his fauours are ascribed to his mercie which mercie the scripture vsually vnderstandeth in the name of grace for mercie is nothing else but sauing grace
now grace then importeth free loue

for it excludeth all merit for quis prior dedit who euer preuented god in well doing that god should make him amends grace giueth not merenti to one that deserueth rather it giueth immerenti to an vnworthy person to man polluted with his owne blood grace saith thou shalt line ezek
yea dat contraria merenti grace is indulgent euen before a man is penitent god setteth forth his loue in that when we were enemies christ dyed for vs rom
and such was the grace that altered st paul as st austin obserues vt tam magna efficacissima vocatione conuerteretur paulus gratia dei erat sola quia eius merita erant magna sed mala st paul doth very iustly ascribe the change that was made in him to this powerfull and this mercifull cause

and seeing we are all by nature children of wrath we must all ascribe our regeneration to the same cause tit
it is worse deceipt than that of alchemie for a creature to assume vnto himselfe the transforming of a sinner god only can change as earthly mettals so earthly men of

vessels of dishonour make vessels of honour of vessels of wood make vessels of gold and of vessels of wrath make vessels of mercie who is found of them that seek him not and manifested to them that enquire not after him esay
this destroyes the errour of the pelagians and let them that are receiued into grace remember to whom they are indebted for it it will make vs modest and not to insult vpon others that haue lesse

hauing found the originall of the alteration we are now to see wherein the alteration standeth
told you the first thing wherein it standeth is st paules endowment the phrase that expresseth it is am that am where first may not omit the phrase lest it bee mistaken will shew you the true meaning of it
for am that am is the stile of god and containeth as the iewes well obserue the force of his incommunicable name his name iehoua which giueth vs to vnderstand that all his attributes are his nature that all in god is god which cannot be affirmed of any creature for all are compounded and consist of many things besides that which is their nature yea whereof they may be stripped and yet their nature remaine such as are in man the many qualities both in body and minde
how then doth st paul vsurpe a style that is peculiar vnto god marke the addition wherewith he doth qualifie the phrase
the addition is by grace this differenceth the words as they are applied vnto st paul from them as they are applyed vnto god
god saith absolutely of himselfe am that am he is undefined span alphabet he hath his being of himselfe st paul also saith of himselfe am that am but hee addeth by the grace of god so that to the grace of god he oweth his being and it is he that hath made vs and not we our selues we are his people and the sheepe of his pasture
but man hath many beings for hee is a little world hee hath abodie made of the elements like the stones vpon which you tread hee hath a vegetable being like the graffe and plants that grow in the field he hath sense and motion like beasts he hath vnderstanding and a conscience as all men haue in the world
but none of these beings are properly here meant there is a being that goeth beyond all these the being of home theologicus the being of a man as diuinitie considereth him and diuinitie considers him as he is a part of the church
but told you that the clause is short and darke must therfore resolue it and cleare it that you may the better vnderstand it
st paul then had a double being in the church the being of a member and the beeing of a minister and he had both these beings by the grace of god
the first was common to him with the whole church will speake of that first

arbor scientiae spoliauit adamum arbore vitae no sooner did adam taste of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill but presently hee lost all his being to godward or the life of god his being holy and his being happy
now grace doth properly repaire this being without which it were better not to bee than to bee in which respect by an excellencie this communion with god is termed our being
wisedome saith salomon prouerbs
causeth them that loue her to inherit flesh that is substance
circumcision saith st paul gal

is nothing nor vncircumcision but a new creature and the preacher eccles

feare god and keep his commandements

this is a whole man
when god then quickneth vs that are dead in sinnes and trespasses he calleth those things which are not undefined span alphabet as things that then begin to haue a being

this is the cause why the three theologicall vertues wherein consists the true being of a christian haue giuen vnto them in the scripture expresly or by implication the name of substance
first faith
we are made partakers of christ saith st paul heb
if we hold fast undefined span alphabet the beginning of our substance that is our faith in christ for hee infers it vpon this exhortation take heed brethren lest there bee at any time in any of you an euill heart of infidelitie to depart away from the liuing god
secondly charitie
if haue no charitie am nothing cor
if without charitie there be no substance in man then charitie is his substance
thirdly hope
st paul describes that by the word undefined span alphabet in that phrase undefined span alphabet

for hope is a ioyfull expectation of gods performing what he hath promised so that substance of reioycing and ioyfull hope are all one
cyril bishop of alexandria opening those words of the apostle

my little children of whom am in trauell againe till iesus christ be formed in you saith formatur in nobis christus spiritu sancto diuinam quandam formam per sanctificationem iustitiam indente sic enim in omnibus nostris elucet character substantiae dei which is all one in effect with that of st peter pet

by grace we are made partakers of the diuine nature
aben ezra a rabbi of the iewes hath a witty conceit of the hebrew names that signifie man and woman ish and ishah they haue in them saith hee some letters that are part of the name of god iehouah which if you take away there will remaine no other letters than those that make vp the word which signifieth fire the morall of the conceit is that their subsistence is in god and they will both come to ruine if they be seuered from him
st paul phil

with whom wee haue now to doe speaketh more plainely though hee had many worldly things to stand vpon and which might seeme to make him some body yet he professeth that he accounted them all dung and in comparison of the excellent knowledge of iesus christ our lord
would we did all learne of him whence to take and how to make the estimate of our being we would not so our nothing and that which only can make vs something as commonly we doe
our true being standeth in our vnion with god and communion in his grace if any man without these thinke himselfe to bee any thing hee is indeed nothing but deceiueth himselfe in his vaine imagination be he worldly noble or rich wise or mightie if he measure his being by these things he deceiueth himselfe in his vaine imagination
and let this suffice touching the part of st paules endowment which is common to him with all the church of his grace of adoption

he had another endowment which is proper to the clergie the being of a minister and this was the gift of grace the grace of edification and is though not solely yet principally intended in this place
that it is a grace st paul obserues rom
ephes

he receiued grace and apostleship he doth not vsurpe hee was neyther undefined span alphabet nor undefined span alphabet
yea in that he was an apostle st austin calleth it abundantiorem gratiam an extraordinarie

grace a speciall trust was reposed in him a weighty embassage was committed to him he was made steward of gods house a disposer of the secrets of the kingdome of god an oecumaenicall both steward and disposer et ad haec quis idoneus no man that is not qualified by grace and by grace not only called but inabled thereunto as st paul was that was not only an apostle but had also apostolicall gifts

but said would haue an eye to this present occasion wherefore will enlarge this point as fitteth the present auditorie
the grace of a minister is eyther inherent or assistant the first giueth abilitie the second authoritie by grace inherent hee vnderstandeth the scripture by grace assistant hee hath power to retaine and remit sinne
of these two graces both are requisite to the being as it were of a pastor there should be a sufficiencie in him vnto whom authoritie is giuen and hands should not be imposed on them which haue not a competencie of gifts
and yet it falleth out too often that through the ambition of ignorant men and of those that haue power to lay on hands many weake yea wicked ones are honoured with that sacred calling whereunto themselues are no meane dishonour who in regard of the grace of inherence cannot say with st paul by the grace of god am that am inward grace in this kinde they haue plainely none
would they would redeeme this shame and not liue to bee scandalls of our church
but the sinne of such doth not impeach their power they are true though they are not fit ministers
which must bee considered by those which factiously refuse or scrupulously forbeare to be sheepe vnder such shepheards or to communicate with them in sacred things although hee come short in regard of grace inherent yet god is not wanting to him in regard of grace assistant whether he dispence the sacraments according to gods ordinance or present according to the ordinance of the church the peoples deuotion vnto god
and let this suffice touching st paules endowment come now to his employment

and here told you first that st paul did not neglect gods gifts gods grace bestowed vpon him was not in vaine
vaine is eyther emptie or idle emptie is that which hath a shew but no substance idle is that whose efficacie is not answerable to its abilitie
the grace that st paul had was neither way vaine for he had gods spirit indeed not in shew onely and his deeds did beare witnesse that gods spirit was in him
in this place the apostle meaneth not so much emptinesse as idlenesse for though whatsoeuer is emptie must needs be idle yet whatsoeuer is idle is not emptie otherwise there could be no sinne of negligence whereof notwithstanding there is too much in the world
negligence of both kinde of graces of the grace of adoption which is common to all the church for how many be there whose vnderstanding god illightneth with the knowledge of the truth that neuer make vse of it in ordering of their liues but liue as if they knew neyther creede nor ten commandements how many good motions doth god kindle in the hearts of many a man who notwithstanding

liueth frozen as it were in the dregs of his owne impure lusts and those good motions set him not a whit forwarder towards heauen nay as water that hath beene warmed is apt to bee bound faster with the frost so are the more violent by reason of former good motions
but this is a foule neglect of gods good gifts
wherfore let me remember you all in the apostles words to follow his good example not to receiue the grace of god in vaine st paul did not the more grace he had the better he liued and so must we if there be light in vs it must shine forth from vs and they must feele the heat of our inward zeale that conuerse with vs outwardly in the world
in a word wee must all walke in that spirit by which wee liue they that boast of gods gifts let them shew the effects of them for haue chosen you saith christ that you may goe and beare fruit
gods grace that makes vs other men must make vs also profitable men

as none of the church must neglect the grace of adoption so must not the ministers neglect their grace of edification they must not hide their talent consult with flesh and blood bee disobedient to the heauenly visions they must undefined span alphabet stirre vp the grace of god blow off the ashes that would it sound the trumpet and giue timely alarums be instant in season and out of season being salt wee must euer be seasoners of the world being light we must euer be dispelling the darkenesse of men being architects wee must euer be building of gods house being husbandmen wee must euer bee labouring in gods field finally being shepheards we must euer be attending on christs flocke so was st paul so must we
otherwise gods grace is bestowed on vs in vaine our conscience cannot yeeld vs this good testimonie which st paul giueth here vnto himselfe it will rather challenge vs of our neglect and the grieuousnesse of our neglect will bee answerable to the gifts which wee receiue from god
and god knowes there is too much of this neglect of our calling in many at whose hands god will require the blood of many perishing soules
but will dwell no longer vpon this first branch of st paules employment
st paul did not neglect the gifts of god but vnto his vse of them there concurred more workers than one he doth specifie them and the preheminencie of eyther of them

the workers are two st paul and gods grace
and here must put you in minde that though in our first conuersion we are only passiue yet being conuerted we become actiue also god onely maketh vs new men but being new he will haue vs make vse of our new vnderstanding and our new will and our new affections he will haue vs vse them all
and it were grosse for vs to neglect our selues when god hath giuen vs abilities which we may employ yea honoured vs so farre as to enable vs to work out our saluation and walke the waies that leade vnto eternall life neither doth hee euer deserue to come there that will not set forward that way
and yet many such wretches haue you that leaue themselues to be carried to heauen by god while they giue themselues to fulfill their owne wicked lusts that hope well of god but themselues doe no good at all
and as there bee such carelesse christians so are there carelesse

ministers also who presuming vpon dabitur in illa hora do all things extempore preach pray and what not as if premeditation and studie did not concerne them but the spirit of god would alwaies supply them and giue them an extraordinarie abilitie
but this is grosse presumption and dangerous also euen the high way vnto enthusiasme anabaptisme and all those mischieuous sects the banes not of learning only but of religion also

st paul is one worker but there is another also which is gods grace god doth not endow vs and then leaue vs to our free will if hee did so our endowing grace would quickly perish or doe nothing therefore hee giues a second grace to the operant he addes a cooperant
that must worke also
the reason is euident whether you cast your eies vpon the common workes of pietie or else vpon the speciall workes of the ministrie
see it first in the speciall workes of pietie

if our vnderstanding and our heart be left in their pure naturals the one will neuer perceiue the other wil neuer sauour the things that are of god therefore must the one be lightned the other must bee purged by grace otherwise they will neuer comprehend their obiect they will neuer bee able to doe any supernaturall worke how much lesse will they bee able to doe it their naturals being corrupted as by sinne they are but before in the endowment we found a man indued with grace and here we finde mention made of grace againe wherefore wee must obserue that god vouchsafeth a man a double grace an habituall and an actuall a grace that giueth him abilitie and a grace that setteth his abilitie on worke
touching habituall grace that is true which st basil hath

it is semper presens but not semper operans it may be in vs and yet be idle he expresseth it by a similitude of the eye sight wherewith a man may see oftner than he doth see

st austin vseth that simile more fully to our purpose vt oculus corporis etiam plenissimè sanus nisi candore lucis adiutus non potest cernere as the sharpest can discerne nothing except it haue the help of outward light no more can a man perfectly iustified liue well except he be holpen from aboue with the light of the eternall iustice
neither is this cooperation of grace a transeunt but a permanent act so the same father teacheth
sicut aer praesente lumine non factus est lucidus sed fit quia si factus esset non fieret sed etiam absente lumine lucidus maneret sic home deo sibi praesente illuminatur absente autem continuo tenebratur gods grace in man is like the light of the ayre the one steeds our bodily eye so long as it is maintained by a perpetuall influence of the sunne and the other steeds our soules so long as it is excited and helped by the holy spirit and grace will be as vnfruitfull without this helpe of the spirit as the light of the ayre will be fading if you intercept the influence of the sunne
so that a mans soule must be like vnto the land of canaan vpon which the eyes of the lord were from the beginning of the yeare to the ending to giue it the former and the later raine deut
our sufficiencie and our efficiencie must be both from god

neyther is this second grace needfull only for the work of pietie but for the workes of the ministrie also the lampes that burne in the temple

must continually bee fedde with oyle st paul though hee calleth vs labourers yet he calleth vs undefined span alphabet there is another labourer with vs
and indeed as moses told god if thou wilt not goe with vs send vs not hence so vncomfortable were the worke of the ministrie were it not for christs promise lo am with you vntill the worlds end if he did not hold the starres in his hand they would quickly become wandring quickly become falling stars
besides our selues therfore we must acknowledge another worker

hauing found the two workers wee must now see what was eyther of their preheminencie
first the preheminencie of st paul he laboured more than all the word all must be vnderstood not collectiuely but distributiuely
he was not so arrogant as to equall himselfe to the whole either church or ministrie but to any one he might wel equall himselfe he might well affirme that not any one did equall him in labour
but it is a question whom he meaneth by all whether only false apostles or also true
there is no doubt but he went beyond all the false apostles if he went beyond the true
and he went beyond the true it is euident if you consider the circuit of his trauell which is described rom
and in the acts especially if you adde that he planted churches wheresoeuer he came and enlarged the kingdome of christ undefined span alphabet as himselfe speaketh
adde hereunto his many epistles sent to so many remote places and persons so profoundly opening the mysteries of saluation and resoluing the hardest knots thereof
but aboue all things take notice of the two supporters of his paines with which no man euer bore himselfe out more resolutely they are the prouerbiall sustine abstine
how did he despise all profit all pleasure that would take no salary for his paines but laboured with his owne hands that hee might make the gospell of christ free that when he might lead about a wife a sister as cephas and the other apostles did made himselfe an eunuch for the kingdome of heauen
you see what his abstine was or despising of profit and pleasure
as for his sustine enduring of afflictions that was no lesse remarkeable reade but the eleuenth of the second to the corinths there we finde them collected to our hands and what kinde of affliction is there which wee doe not finde there if you reade it you will say he was a manifold martyr
cannot dwell longer vpon this point only this obserue though no man can suffer or abstaine more than he should or labour beyond his dutie supererrogations of any of those kindes are popish dreames as they expound them yet may one man goe farre beyond another and some there are which are miracula hominum they may rather be admired than imitated and such was st paul

neither was he such a pastor only but such a christian also and indeed his sustine and abstine must be referred to his grace of adoption though they did attend his grace of edification
but if that will not suffice see how he did buffet his bodie and keep it vnder lest while he preached to others himselfe should become a reprobate cor
when he was buffeted with the messenger of sathan cor
hee neuer left importuning christ with his prayers till christ answered him my grace is sufficient for thee my strength

is made perfect in weakenesse his constant care was to keepe an inoffensiue conscience towards god and men acts
but aboue all places reade and exemplifie those two memorable descriptions of a true religious heart striuing against sinne rom
and making towards heauen phil

you cannot better see his pietie and learne to bring your owne to a commendable highth than by profitably reading of those places
you shall learne thus much also that factus christianus is much more pious than is natus he that out of a forlorne state is by the mercie of god brought to the state of grace when he is come to the yeares of discretion doth abound much more in the fruits of righteousnesse than he that is borne in the state of grace and so will euerie true conuerted sinner abound more than he that neuer tooke a grieuous fall

but must hasten to the preheminencie of grace a preheminencie beyond st pauls preheminency euen by the testimonie of st paul himselfe not but the grace of god that is with me he correcteth himselfe as if he had presumed too farre
where marke that though a man worke with grace not only per effectum but also per consensum not only to the producing of the effect but also vnderstanding and willing it for hee is instrumentum rationale and god doth not deale with men as with blockes and bruit beasts yet is a man but undefined span alphabet an instrument the principall agent is the grace of god
and although there be two workers yet must they not be reputed coordinate but subordinate neither doth man worke otherwise than as hee is moued by grace and the children of god are led by his spirit
whereby you may gather how wicked a doubt that is which now doth perplexe the church whether forsooth our will determines gods grace or gods grace determines our will in the point of iustification certainly st paul thought the point out of question when he vsed this correctiue not but the grace of god that is with me mecum or quae in me
the grace of god doth not cooperate with our free will except it bee first regenerated by grace
therefore the defence of free will is idly gathered hence seeing papists meane it in actu primo and st paul speakes here de actusecundo
he is most vnthankefull then and so vnworthy of grace that doth not giue the preheminence to the grace of adoption cooperant in all his workes of pietie
and so to the cooperant grace of edification must we giue the glorie of all the workes of our ministrie paul planteth and apollo watereth it is god that giueth the increase wee haue heauenly treasures but we conuey them in earthen vessels the foolishnesse of preaching is ours the demonstration of the spirit is from heauen non vos estis loquimini sed spiritus patris matth

wee speake the words god openeth the heart wee wash with water christ with the holy ghost we giue the bread and wine christ his body and blood ros coelestis sacit messem terrestrem wee may not thinke better of our selues than of ministers the power of whose worke dependeth on the spirit of our master wee are undefined span alphabet but christi a second grace is the cause why our first is not frustrate so was it before the fall much more is it so now

haue done with the particulars of my text two things gathered out

or the whole bodie of it which will note in a word
the first is st pauls sinceritie who giueth the glorie vnto god of the originall of the gifts and of the vse of the gifts wherewith he was endowed condemning all sacriledge of this kinde
what god told zorobabel the temple of the earthly hierusalem the same is fulfilled in the restauration of our heauenly neyther by armie nor strength but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts men shall bring forth all the stones thereof with shouting crying grace grace zach
therefore let vs say not vnto vs lord not vnto vs but vnto thy name giue the praise for of thee and through thee and for thee are all things all things that belong to the being of thy church the being both of pastor and people let him that glories glorie in the lord

as st paul dealeth sincerely in regard of gods glorie so doth he also modestly in regard of himselfe as he extolleth god so doth he abase himselfe witnesse the extenuation of his endowment of his employment and the correction of that speech wherein hee might seeme to value himselfe at too high a rate
cannot stand to amplifie this vertue of his though the pride of our nature deserues to haue it amplified that it may be admonished thereby will onely commend vnto your meditation king dauids psalme lord am not high minded haue no proud looks and christs exhortation to vs to become as little children hee that exalteth himselfe shall bee humbled and that humbleth himselfe shall bee exalted
let vs not therefore bee ashamed to cast downe our selues that the lord may lift vs vp and seeing our helpe standeth in the name of the lord and without christ we can doe nothing for quis te discreuit and what hast thou that thou hast not receiued because it is hee that worketh in vs both to will and to doe let vs continually pray lord make speed to saue vs lord make haste to helpe vs saue and helpe both pastor and people that both may truly say with st paul by the grace of god am that am and euery one may haue this sweet repose of conscience gods grace was not bestowed on me in vaine
finally the apostle ascribing before his sinnes to himselfe and his vertue to god doth teach that we are sufficient to our owne ruine not so to our rising according to that of hosea destructio tua ex te
therefore the minister must with meeknesse teach the contrary minded timothie

haue set before you an exact patterne of a good pastor and christian wee should all endeauour to conforme thereto but this is rather to bee wished than hoped because of the frailtie of our nature
wherefore a timely suruey of the church is requisite to make such a suruey is the reason of this meeting
the world hath many saules blasphemers oppressors wicked liuers but you vse to present all as pauls you say all is well when euery man may see that much is amisse
remember that this is iudicium ante iudicium a medicinall iudgement before a mortall the iudgement of man to preuent the iudgement of god doe not by cruell indulgence exempt any from the iust censure of the church to

expose your selues and them to the intolerable vengeance of god
rather let vs all ioyne of saules to make paules that so wee may repaire the decayes of the church and heare a comfortable doome when we all come before the tribunall seat of christ

the lord giue vs all this effectuall grace the vndoubted pledge of eternall glorie
hee that hath begunne in you a good worke perfect it till the day of the lord
amen

ezra
vers
and whosoeuer will not doe the law of the lord thy god and the kings law let him haue iudgement without delay whether it be to death or banishment or confiscation of goods or imprisonment

the&se words that haue read vnto you are the close of a commission granted by artashasht king of persia at that time also king of the holy land vnto ezra a religious priest and learned scribe of the iewes
this commission consisteth of manie branches the last commands the creating of iudges in the territorie of iewrie concerning whom it is expressed how they ought to be qualified and whereunto they are authorised
their quality is set downe vers
their authority is the argument of my text a great authoritie because it is of the sword the king giues this power that biddes them giue iudgement
but that their power may be as good as it is great they must vse it against malefactors so saith the king against them that will not doe the law and against them they must vse it so that first they frustrate not the end of the law
a iudgement vnseasonable is vnprofitable they must therefore giue iudgement without delay
secondly they must not sway the indifferencie of the law to haue respect of persons in iudgement is not good they must then giue iudgement against whomsoeuer whomsoeuer will not doe the law

but there are lawes diuine and humane the iudges must proceede against the violaters of both against them that will not do gods law against them that will not do the kings law but with two cautions they must

take heed that the god be the god of ezra the true god they must no maintaine false religion and they must not forbeare to giue iudgement against them that violate the kings lawes though he be a king of persis a false religion doth not hinder him from being a lawfull soueraigne the iudge must not foster seedes of rebellion
they that violate the lawes of that god of this king the iudge must draw his sword against them

but how farre may he draw it and how deepe must he strike with it surely so farre as the magistrate is gods instrument for the peoples weale so farre may he be his instrument for their woe
his prouidence reacheth to their liues liuings and libertie so farre may his vengeance reach also thus farre he may draw his sword
but he must giue no deeper wound therewith to offenders than offenders giue to the law the degrees of punishment must answer the degrees of offences some must dye some be fined some restrayned euery one as he deserues
you see the substance of this scripture withal conceiue that theron we must consider of these two points the power the vse of the sword the vse lawfull full speak to them that haue vnderstanding therfore need touch these particulars but briefly but that touch them not vnprofitably beseech you in the feare of god to iudge what say
and first some may demand why being to speake in the name of god vnto iudges sent from a christian king remember vnto them the instruction of a king indeede but a heathen king such an author as may much lessen your regard of the matter
it may but not except it be mistaken
for besides that it is correspondent to the like in moses and the prophets ezra acknowledgeth in the next verse that this commission was indited by diuine inspiration god put it into the heart of the king
and were it not so yet it is of no small moment to heare reason concord with religion
the vse of this power is the more obseruable when it is enioyned by the pen not onely of god but also of man yea the lesse likely a heathen king is to write it the more faulty a christian iudge if he set light by it
heare then what is your power it is to giue iudgement

but iudgement is either of discretion or iurisdiction the first is common to all the second belongs but to a few all may discerne right from wrong but all may not right them that suffer or correct them that doe wrong
he that takes the sword vngiuen shall perish with the sword as christ told peter mat
and told it him when hee was too busie with his sword it is not giuen to euery man
and it is well that it is not giuen our affections do with such a false light delude our iudgements that where there are scarce moates we see great beames in other mens eyes but beames in our owne are so insensible

as if they were not so much as moates
and as wee apprehend so would wee proceed our strength would be the law of vnrighteousnesse wisd
and as tacitus well notes malice the more vniust it is the more violent how many cains would there start vp in the world that would kill their owne brother abel onely because his deedes were good and theirs euill and if some would not be so vnnaturall yet would they be so vnreasonable as simeon leni of whom their own father pronounced cursed be their wrath for it was fierce

and their rage for it was cruell genesis
we are so partiall and impotent when we haue the law in our owne hands and may satisfie our own lusts that wee will proceede without cause or at least aboue measure

god knowing this vnbridlednesse of our nature hath laid this charge vpon all priuate men auenge not your selues but giue place towrath for vengeance is mine and will repay saith the lord rom
whatsoeuer therefore they pretend of the lawes of honour that apologize for duels in a ciuill in a christian common weale they should be reputed no better and it were good if they did fare no better than murderers they would not be so common if they were branded with their true name and had their iust reward
priuate men may not reuenge
but who may it is only his right that is the or theirs that hold from him to recompence euery man according to his deeds gods law is deut
that when two striue together they shall stand before the lord euen before the iudges where the iudges are there the lord is psal
god standeth in the assembly of gods he iudgeth among gods the apostle therefore calleth them the ministers of god rom
so that a iudge doth not only represent the person of a king but is in part with him the deputie of god
when the burden was too heauie for moses god assisted him with the seuentie but marke how he inaugurated them he took of the spirit of moses and conferred it on the seuentie intimating his immediate presence and concurrence with them
wherefore what shecaniah spake to ezra cap

when he lamented the disordered liues of the iewes that must say vnto you arise for the matter belongeth vnto you bee of good comfort yea and courage too for this age moues more than teares and do it giue iudgement god and the king are your warrant you may take the sword
but your power must bee put in practice you must vse it against malefactors peccare peccantes non cohibere iuxta putato saith agapetus to the emperour the proper sinne of the magistrate is not to represse sinners and sinners are they that doe not the law

iudgement hath two workes as the law hath two parts
the parts of the law are proeceptum sanctio the workes of iudgement are conuiction and execution
the king followes this methode in his commission hee will not haue any executed before he be conuicted
st basil in an epistle to eustathius bishop of sebastia doth excellently describe the manner of the iudges proceeding in his daies quirerum potiuntur in hoc mundo quando facinorosum aliquem sunt vindicaturi cortinas obducunt
the iudges in temporal causes when they are to sentence a malefactor retire themselues desire to heare what the wisest of their assistants can say in defence of the arraigned they pause long sometimes beholding the prisoner sometimes reflecting their eyes vpon themselues as communicating with him in the same nature and feelingly bemone his case whose life they must cut off not moued thereunto by any passion of their owne but performing that seruice which is vndeniably imposed vpon them by the law
the law then must speake before the iudge and not the iudge before the law for iudicium legis is iudicium solius rationis but iudicium hominis est iudicium rationis libidinis no man murmures if his doome be euidently the voice

of the law though it bee a very grieuous doome but let it bee neuer so light if it bee onely the voyce of a man hee is very patient that doth not murmure at it
the king therefore doth wisely subiect his people to the law and wills the iudges to vse that for their rule and try therewith who deserues the stroke of the sword and all iudges must subscribe to ireneus his note indumentum iustitiae leges habet magistratus if a magistrate would be reputed iust he must referre euerie mans case to bee ordered by the vnaffectioned law

secondly marke that a malefactor is described not by doing against the law but by not doing of the law the reason whereof is the first intention of the law is the working of the common good
it should be in the world of men as it is in the world of other creatures euerie thing furthereth the felicitie of the whole he is not worthy to bee a member of a state by whom the state is no whit the better
the romanes wel vnderstood it when they instituted their censors to inquire into euerie mans course and to note them with infamie that could not giue an account of some good vse of their life
it is pitifull to consider how many there are in this land whose glorie is their shame as the apostle speaketh the chronicle of whose life was long since summed vp by the poet nos numerus sumus fruges consumere nati no better than cyphers if you respect the common good they doe but if you looke vnto the common euill they are the vipers of the state
surely they doe not the law which they should but which they should not they doe against the law they are daily seene and who doth not know them meane riotous swaggerers and masterlesse vagabonds but by whose default know not few are challenged fewer punished and so they swarme because they feele not the sword and yet they are the proper obiect of the sword
for whereas st paul rom
expresseth two vses of the sword one the laude of them that doe well the other the terrour of them that doe euill this commission remembers only the later the reason whereof is giuen by ireneus quoniam absistens deo homo in tantum efferauit imposuit ei deus humanum timorem vt moderentur ad inuicem in manifesto positum gladium timentes
had there been no fall there should haue beene a power indeede in man ouer man but it should haue beene only directiue it is now coerciue also wee neede now not only correction for doing ill but coaction also to do well and this is the principall employment of the sword whereunto accords that of st paul lex non est posita iusto if all men were good euerie man would bee a law vnto himselfe but there are few that can guide themselues too many that will not bee guided by others

and those the philosopher calleth fooles of whom you know salomon saith arod must bee for the backe of fooles
the magistrate must vse the sword against them

and he must vse it without delay
sero medicina paratur cum mala per longas conualuere moras is no lesse true in the politicke than in the naturall bodie whether wee consider the corrigiblenesse of the delinquents or the preseruation of the state both should bee intended by iudgement but both grow desperate through delay
in the heart of euerie man there are principles of honestie which when first lust casts into a slumber the magistrate

may awaken to checke sinne by holding him in that was running riot but if the magistrate winke consuetudo peccati obducit callum conscientiae by impunitie men will grow senslesse and shamelesse the preacher confirmes it because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily

therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in them to doe euill secondly sinne is like a contagious disease it will spred like a leprosie especially where the law of leprosie is not in force and where the wicked are not forced by the stroke of the sword to cry vnto the sound that approach them am vncleane am vncleane leuit

and so in time conniuencie breeds vitia adulta praeualida as tacitus calleth them and a state becomes like rome of which liuie speaketh neque vitia neque remedia ferre possumus though the sinnes bee so strong that they vuioynt the whole state yet the patient growes so tender that it will sooner dye than endure the setting of the ioynts againe
how neere wee are to our climactericall yeare leaue it to the statesman to consider onely this will remember you that a iudge which is a father in his countrey must be a louing father and of such a one salomon speaketh pro

hee that loueth his sonne correcteth him betime
or if a louing father be too meane a precedent imitate a good king king dauid betimes saith he psal will rise to roote out the wicked
or if you will goe higher learne of god who speakes thus vnto cain genesis
if thou dost ill in foribus peccatum that is as the sonne of syrack speaketh ecclus

the lord will not be slacke the almighty will not tarry long till hee hath smitten in sunder the loynes of the vnmercifull and auenged himselfe of the heathen
this presse the rather because undefined span alphabet as nazianzene speakes it is a very dangerous thing to be ouer prodigall of mercie for it is nothing else but an occasion of crueltie when rancke sinnes will not be cured without letting of great quantitie of blood a little seuerity in time would preuent a great deale of crueltie will not say but somewhat that will resemble it which the iniquitie of the times doth hasten to wrest from you or which is worse to bring vpon the state
you see the admonition that ariseth from this place is that your feet bee not nimium lanei lest your hands proue nimium ferreae you must strike soone that you may not strike too often or too deepe

but it is not enough that you proceede timely except you proceede vnpartially you must proceede against whomsoeuer
gods law is

magnum paruum iudicabis thou shalt not regard the poore because hee is poore nor the rich because he is rich there is no respect of persons in god neither should there be in his lieutenants a iudges sentence must be like a true looking glasse it must represent euerie mans case as the glasse doth his countenance neyther embellishing nor deforming it
and no maruell for seeing they are physitians of the state and sinnes are the diseases of it what skils it whether a gangrene beginne at the head or the heele seeing both wayes it will kill if the part that is diseased be not cut off except this be the difference that the head being nearer the heart a gangrene in the head will kill sooner than that which is in the heele euen so will the sinnes of great ones ouerthrow a state sooner than those of the little

ones
but yet know not how wee are more prouident for our naturall body than wee are for the politique curing in that first the principall parts and in this the lesse principall if wee cure them
the vanity of which course sigismund the emperour well obserued in the generall councell when vpon the motion that it was fit to reforme the whole church one said then let vs begin at the minorites nay rather saith the emperour at the maiorites for if the great ones be good the mean ones cannot easily be ill but be the meane ones neuer so good the great will be nothing the better

end this point with the saying of christ nolite iudicare secundum faciem sed iustum iudicium iudicate and wish you the zeale of phyneas

that spared not zimri or cosbi though the one were a princes sonne of simeon and the other a princes daughter of madian so may it be imputed to you for righteousnesse and to your seed after you

and thus leauing the conditions to bee obserued in the vse of your power come to the limitations of the power it selfe

the limitations are two first of the lawes
there are diuine and humane lawes the magistrate must proceed against the violaters of both against them that will not doe the law of god against them that will not do the law of the king

he must be custos vtrius{que tabulae look to the obseruing of salomons feare god the king or christs a greater than salomons giue vnto caesar the things that are caesars

and vnto god the things that are gods he must conioyne both and acknowledge dominum dominum my lord god and my lord the king
but with this difference that the one is an absolute lord the other but subordinate the one commands as in his owne right the other but in the right of god

secondly as are the lords so are their lawes gods must haue the first place the kings but the second and no maruell seeing gods lawes are primitiue the kings but deriuatiue nay the substance of euery law is from god it is but the determination of some circumstance that is left vnto the power of the king
in lawes meerly morall thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steale the king hath power onely in regard of the sanction not that god hath left it in his choice whether these sinnes shall or shall not be punished but to his discretion hee hath left it how and how farre the good of the state requires to haue them punished
in things meerly indifferent because many things are lawfull in regard of that liberty which we haue from god which are not expedient in that society whereof we are parts with other men the kings lawes may impose precepts and that vnder paines but still prouiding that the law of nature yea and of grace too may stand with them and be not impaired by them nay nature and grace must in a christian giue the first light vnto them
adde hereunto that gods lawes binde the conscience immediately as hauing power in themselues to make things good or euill but the kings lawes binde but mediately as the king hath authority from god and is in the promulging of his lawes the minister of god
so that although you must looke to both yet must not your care be of both alike for both are not of like worth there must be an eminency in the care of gods lawes aboue the care of the kings
yea

there is a necessity too for as nazianzene speakes of iouinian the emperour undefined span alphabet it was princely wisedome in him to protect the truth because the truth could best support him kings lawes are neuer so readily obeyed as where the people are religiously disposed and magistrates which neglect the care of gods lawes doe but teach the people how to vilifie theirs

but you must be sure that the god be the god of ezra the true god this is the first caution so were these iudges and so must you be you must not maintaine false religion or persecute the true vnto the seruice of this true god you may lawfully compell st augustine obserues it in the parable of the marriage feast
and that it is profitable you may perceiue also in the same parable for of many that were compelled wee finde but one that came without his wedding garment the rest had their part in the feast
god himselfe in osea saith

that he will hedge the iewes way with thornes so that they should not breake through to follow their spirituall fornication but withall pricke themselues and marke what followes the iewes bethought themselues thereupon and said will returne to my first husband and that was god for it was then better with me than it is now
nazianzene a man of a meeke spirit as appeareth in his writings had obtained some patience to be vsed toward the apollinarists but when hee saw how ill it succeeded hee wrote backe to the president of the countrey undefined span alphabet my intercession was vnseasonable for these wicked men will not make so good vse of your indulgence as to be ashamed and reclaimed
wherefore as st iude obserues you must saue some with feare and plucke them out of the fire wherein they would burne themselues you must compell them to learn and obey the law of the god of ezra the true god whereupon followeth also the next point which is they will the more easily be brought to doe the kings law

of obseruing lawes in generall need say no more than haue but the iniquity of the times wills mee to remember you that lawes must bee obeyed though they be the lawes of the king of persia this is the second caution
the proctors of rome though they dare not flatly deny it yet so sophystically handle it that what with subiecting the scepter of kings to the command of popes and exempting of such persons and cases as seeme good vnto him they vndermine what they would seeme to yeeld and the most they grant is no more nor no longer than their holy father doth thats too much or hereafter will allow them
if hee will abrogate all they must acknowledge none no lawes of a king of persia a king that is not of their religion
others haue learnedly and sufficiently shaken their grounds and my text is an argument of no small force to resolue the consciences of such as doubt whether a different religion doth euacuate the power of a lawfull soueraigne
it doth not though it be a false religion how much more when it is the true and the king our king commands onely for the god of ezra the true god and enioynes no other worship of him than according to his owne lawes the vndoubted register whereof is the sacred word of god wherefore you must bee

as the earth mentioned in the reuelation cap

and swallow all those waters that the dragon casts forth to drowne the woman you must crush these seedes of rebellion which ayme at nothing but the ouerthrow of true religion

and how must you crush it euen by punishment
and so come to the second worke of iudgement from the precept to the sanction which containes the second limitation of the power
wherein obserue first how farre the magistrate may draw his sword looke how farre his prouidence doth reach so farre may his vengeance reach also
the reward of sinne is death eternall death to violate gods lawes or the kings is no lesse than sinne it should therefore be reuenged with eternall death
but behold here vnspeakeable mercie god would haue vs iudged here by men that we be not condemned hereafter by him
this is the proper end of the keyes and the sword of the power that is in the prince and the pastor
the occasion draweth mee to speake of the sword yet let me giue you this item touching the keyes that malefactors must remember that for euerie of their offences challengable by the law of man they owe a repentance vnto god and the greater their offence the deeper should be their repentance
which the rather note because there are too many of them that scarce giue glorie vnto god when they suffer by the law and if they escape make no conscience at all of their sin as if how soeuer they speed at the iudgement seat of men they were not to take heed that they be not cast at the barre of god which the first councell of nice well corrected when imitating gods law without preiudice to the ciuill sword it appointed sundrie yeares penance according to the grieuousnesse of sinne
sed pristino rigori non sumus pares the liturgie of our church saith that it were to bee wished but the iniquitie of the times that it is not to be hoped
secondly seeing your power should touch men with a losse temporall to keepe them from a losse eternall you see what wrong you doe them when you suffer them to spend their dayes in loosenesse and in a moment as iob speaketh though from their beds they goe quicke down into hell how much better were it for them if with one hand or one eye they might goe into heauen than hauing both to bee cast into hell then let the righteous rebuke them yea smite them rather than that your precious balmes should breake their heads yea slay their soules spare nothing that is temporall so you may preserue them from the paine which is eternall

you see how farre you may draw the sword
but when you strike your strokes must bee proportionable to their sinnes but the proportion must not be arithmeticall but geometricall they must be secundum merita but not aequalia meritis you may punish intra but not vltra medum so doth god who notwithstanding doth punish in number weight and measure semper aliquid detrahit de poenae atrocitate as nazianzene speaketh undefined span alphabet he doth temper mercie with iudgement in the hand of the lord there is a cup the wine thereof is red and it is full mixt whereof though his children offending drinke yet only the incorrigible wicked drinke the dregs thereof
and the same father writing to the emperours

deputie reckoning vp his vertues demands this undefined span alphabet what shall say of your clemencie undefined span alphabet here you decline something but he addes undefined span alphabet cannot much blame you you haue god for your patterne who in hosea speakes thus of himselfe how shall giue thee vp ephraim how shall deliuer thee israel how shall make thee as admah how shall set thee as seboim my heart is turned within mee my repentings are rouled together will not execute the fiercenesse of my wrath
you must wisely then temper iudgement and mercie but so that mercie doe not hinder iudgement and yet that of the two mercie reioyce against iudgement

and thus haue you heard what a iudge may and must doe he may take the sword and must vse it against malefactors but with the conditions of the vse and limitations of the power specified in my text
the conditions are two he must vse it timely and indifferently the limitations also two he must extend it to all transgressions of both tables and intend it according to their transgressions
and the end of all must bee by a temporall punishment to saue the wicked from eternall paine or if that will not bee that the blood of all cursing shimei's and factious ioabs and irreligious abiathars also may bee vpon their head and the head of their seed but vpon dauid our dauid vpon his house and vpon his throne vpon this whole church and common weale may bee peace for euer from the lord

most mighty most mercifull lord who to preserue sincere pietie and secure peace in the church and common weale hast put the sword into the hands of mortall men and for the vse thereof hast aduanced them aboue their brethren we humbly beseech thee so to sanctifie them with thy grace whom thou hast armed with thy power that with a watchfull and single eye they may obserue and represse with a seuere yet a tender hand all vnsound beleeuers and inordinate liuers that church and common weale may blesse them as happy supporters of this christian state and themselues may with comfort make their last account to the vnpartiall ludge of quicke and dead and now and euer both of vs may giue glory vnto thee that art our most mighty and most mercifull lord
amen

psal
vers
when shall receiue the congregation will iudge vprightly the earth and all the inhabitants are dissolued beare vp the pillars of it
selah

this psalme was penned if not by surely in the name of some worthy iudge the people blesse god for the comfort they receiued by him and hee promiseth to redresse the disorders of the people put both their speeches together and you haue a good commentary vpon the title of this psalme
the title is ne perdas or rather non perdes the hebrew will beare both and it imports that a good iudge yeelds the best hope that a disordered state may recouer although it be farre gone
who this iudge is all are not agreed some ghesse at him by one part of the psalme some by another and according to their different apprehension giue the psalme some a mysticall some an historicall interpretation both may stand true as elsewhere so here
but being to fit this present occasion my purpose is to passe by the mysticall and insist only vpon that sense which is historicall
according to the history the person that speakes seemeth to bee the king of israel and that king as it is most likely is king dauid
he speaks here first of his owne tribunall the tribunall of a king but because that was set at naught by many insolent ones hee calleth them to an higher tribunall the tribunall of god and telleth them that it is god which from time to time appoints those that shall iudge here on earth till by christ he call that great assizes and fit iudge of all the world

this is the effect of the whole psalme my text containes so much

thereof as concernes the tribunall of the king the dignity the necessity the vtility thereof

to vnfold it beseech you to marke therein the person and his work the person is the king whose worke is to iudge will iudge
but of the iudgement wee are farther taught when it shall be executed and how
the time is at an assizes when shall receiue the congregation
the manner is according to the law to try the vprightnesse of mens liues will iudge vprightly and that of mens vprightnesse the word mesharim reacheth so farre
as if this were not enough here is a seuerall reason added to each of these branches a reason of calling an assizes
it is no more than needeth there is much amisse in the people the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolued
and a reason there is why the king must iudge vprightly and of vprightnesse because if any goe awry if any swerue hee must set and keepe them strait so saith the king beare vp the pillars of it
these be the points that are to bee considered on this text and that they are to be considered seriously you may gather by the last word selah the character of a remarkable sentence it signifieth an extraordinary eleuation of the speakers voice which calleth for a more than ordinary attention of the hearers eare
consider then beseech you in the feare of god the particulars that shall deliuer thereon and god grant you a fruitfull vnderstanding of them all
the first is the person and this person is the king to iudge is his work
at ierusalem are thrones set for iudgement saith another psalme and those thrones belong to the house of dauid therefore in the scripture is the kings throne called not onely the throne of glory but of iudgement also yea therefore of glory because of iudgement the glory is giuen to countenance the iudgement
so that the plaintiffes speech was though not very courtly yet very true which hee vttered to a king denying him iustice si non vis iudicare noli regnare implying that it is the proper worke of a king to be a iudge and indeed god commits the power of iudgement immediately to the king and to that end setteth him vpon his owne throne

but you know what iethro obserued to moses

and what moses himselfe in his complaint to god confessed to be true a king in his owne person cannot beare all this burthen if he attempt it hee vainely tireth out both himselfe and his people wherefore it is gods pleasure that so much as he cannot doe by himselfe he shall doe by his officers
whereupon ariseth a good distinction of a kings person it is either naturall or politique and vnder the politique are contained the iudges
this is cleare by gods owne fact for when he called the to bee assistants vnto moses and to that end did qualifie them he saith not that hee will take of his owne spirit though that which hee tooke was the spirit of god but god is pleased to call that the spirit of moses which he tooke and gaue to the

giuing vs to vnderstand that they were alwayes to bee reputed a part of moses
yea and they communicate also in the same diuine title for haue said yee are gods containes not the peculiar title of a king it extends

to euery iudge as moses teacheth in the law if it be not plaine enough in that
psalme
so then when a king sendeth iudges hee sendeth his owne eares to heare the complaints of his people his owne eyes to looke into their causes and his owne mouth to pronounce according to that which is heard and seen
the person then in my text though at first sight it seeme to bee onely the king yet now appeares to bee moreouer the iudge and by it is most plaine honourable and beloued that you are vnderstood

the vse of this point for the people is made by st peter
pet

wee must be subiect to euery ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it be vnto the king as supreame or to gouernours sent from him such as are the iudges the improuement of their persons must make them reuerend in our eyes

but there is a vse also which honourable and beloued must be made by you you may not mistake your eares your eyes your mouth you haue of two sorts priuate and publike the priuate you may vse about your domesticall affaires but to the bench you may bring none but the publicke you must heare there with none but the kings eares and you know that a king is abimelec my father the king and being father of his countrey doth heare like a father that is most tenderly you must see with none but the kings eyes and you know that my lord the king is as angell of god discerning good and euill
sam

you must speake with none but the kings mouth and the wisest of kings hath obserued that there is a diuine sentence in the mouth of the king

his lips shall not transgresse in iudgement
nay whereas euen the kings eares and eies and mouth are not his owne as he is a king but gods you must looke for your quality yet higher euen to that which is obserued in god gods eare as the wise man hath well abridged that which the scripture sets downe but in many words is an eare of iealousie wisd
and iealousie is the best whetstone of feeling attention the eye of the lord as habakuk speaketh chap
is a pure eye it can behold no iniquity
finally of the mouth of god wisedome it selfe hath obserued all his words are truth and wickednesse is an abomination to his lips prou
conclude this point with the words of the apostle wrested confesse to our purpose yet the wrest is not much amisse you are not your owne you sustaine anothers person wherefore glorifie shall say the king if said no more it were enough to moue you but must say more glorifie god with your eares with your eies with your mouth glorifie the king glorifie god they are the kings yea they are gods

but wherefore are you trusted with them the worke will shew the kings worke and yours vnder the king is to iudge
and to iudge what is it but to measure the originall shaphat hath that for his first signification as appeares in mishpot which signifieth a rule and the holy ghost author of that doth significantly expresse that the principall worke of a iudge is to measure yea this very word measure which is by vse english is by birth hebrew the plaine hebrew mesurah whose originall is from sur which is principem esse as if to measure were the

proper worke of a prince and the imperiall definition of iustice iustitia est constans perpetua volunt as ius suum cuique tribusndi what is it but a reall definition of this measure which solon the renowned lawgiuer of athens aymed at also in the wittie analogie by him obserued betweene coine and lawes making both measures but the one in the hands of priuate men the other of the magistrate

a prince then and so a iudge is a measurer and what wonder seeing he is the lieutenant of god euen in that respect wherein god himselfe is termed a measurer
the heathen philosopher could say undefined span alphabet whose words you may expound by those of the wiseman wisd
god doth all things in number weight and measure
nay god himselfe hath witnessed it vnder his owne hand the hand that wrote baltassars doome vpon the wall mene mene tekel thou art numbred thou art weighed and how often in the prophets doe we reade of the line and the plummet in the narration of the works of gods prouidence god then is a measurer and vnder god the king and vnder the king the iudge their iudgement is a measuring
and the worke is most behoouefull for euerie man is partiall in his own case out of selfe loue apt to stretch or shrinke a case as it shall make for or against him and out of malice moued eyther without cause or aboue measure so that it would goe ill with a state were there not a measure whereby to try how farre men ouerlash or come short in those quarrels that artise
there was no king in israel and euery man did that which was right in his owne eyes but that right was in the eye of the law plaine wrong it was idolatrie adulterie robberie murder as it appeares in the booke of iudges
god therefore dealeth mercifully with vs that commands there should be a publicke standard as in the market that we bee not deceiued in our prouisions so on the tribunall that we be not wronged in our eases
it is the expresse letter of the law deut
if a controuersie arise betweene man and man they shall both come to the iudge he is to measure their case
the vse of this point for you honourable and beloued is that the saying which plato caused to bee engrauen at the entrie of his schoole is worthy to be set on the front of your tribunals undefined span alphabet it is pitie any should sit vpon that seat that hath not say not skill the prouidence of the king is not so carelesse in the choyce of your persons but a care to discharge that wherewith he is put in trust and to bee indeed the measure of all cases a partie not interested in either side but carrying himselfe indifferently between them both
that is your vse
and ours is we must not be sonnes of belial we may not vsurpe the sword to right our selues we may not displace the indifferencie of the law to giue soueraigntie to our intemperate affections
conclude this sentence with the wordes of the apostle brethren auenge not your selues but giue place vnto wrath for vengeance is mine and will repay saith the lord
he will repay one day by himself but vntill then he will haue his payment made by iudges vpon which warrant the king spake these wordes will iudge

but when at the assizes when shall receiue the congregation
some reade when shall take a set time both translations are ancient the later as ancient as the septuagint and caldee paraphrase you may reade it in them the former as ancient as aquila and symachus st basil reports it out of them the later translators incline some to the one side and some to the other if you ioyne them both together you haue no more than the full sense of the word for mogned is not only an assembly but an assembly made at a solemne time

but to leaue the words and come to the matter
men haue houses of their owne and domesticall employments according to their meanes but the instinct of nature and their manifold wants incline them to be sociable and to entertaine commerce with others hence sprang societies but societie cannot bee maintained without a rule of fellowship which commands to giue euerie man his due and bends priuate endeauours towards the common good
to frame this rule kings call one kinde of assembly which is a parliament and to see whether this rule bee obserued they call another which is the assizes
an assizes is nothing but an assembling of the people to enquire whether euerie man so temper the loue of himselfe as not to wrong his neighbour whether hee take no other course to thriue than such as may further the common wealth
and indeed in vaine were parliaments were it not for assizes you may see it in your priuate families to what end should a man giue instructions to his houshold if he neuer meant to take account of their conformitie thereto but all this is no more than a ciuill ground it deriues an assizes only from the light of reason my text goeth farther it maketh it also a sacred assembly mogned signifieth such a one and indeede how can it be lesse doth not god stand in this congregation and are not they that sit vpon the bench called gods psalme
the lawyers that plead at the barre are euen in the entrance of the ciuill law called sacerdotes iustitiae they haue a kinde of priesthood the iurors and all persons of necessary seruice are bound iuramento dei with the lords oath so the scripture calleth it the worke as salomon speaketh prouerbs
is more than a sacrifice finally the place is mogned a synagogue a holy place

obserue this the rather because would raise the estimation of that place to a higher rate than it commonly passeth at with the vulgar people
the iudge when he passeth from the church to the bench doth but passe from one sacred assembly to another only with this difference that sitting but as a sheepe in this fold in the other he sitteth as a shepheard
wherefore the iudge when he sitteth there must remember the saying of natianzene undefined span alphabet thou art the image of god and they with whom thou dealest beare his image also if any staines haue blemished that image purge them but neuer forget so to deale with the people as those that beare gods image
the lawyers must remember that the iudges bench is gods altar and being priests thereat they may not sacrifice with eyther polluted tongues or hands
the iurors that haue bound themselues to god must deale as in his sight they must take heed of that wherewith they are too vsually charged that undefined span alphabet

priuate men the common weale are not so much abused they are not abused so cunningly by any thing as by their oathes the words are significant giue me leaue to open them
sinnes are compared to debts he that breaketh a law becommeth a debter thereby the iudge commeth to enquire after those debts that satisfaction may bee made for priuate for publick wronges the iurors are trusted with the relation and taxation of these debts they are to bring in who is in debt and how far and their oathes are credited herein but their oath is become a sophister and cunningly priuate wrongs at the one barre and publike at the other receiue an acquittance and yet the debter makes no paiment or surely no such payment as in equitie he should
if their oath were iuramentum diaboli their sophistrie were tolerable but beseech them in the feare of god to consider that sinceritie is the attribute of the oath of god and let them take heed lest obliging themselues to god and doing seruice to the diuel they descend not into hell when they hope to ascend to heauen
finally whereas the ground whereupon the assembly standeth is holy ground let euerie man put off his shooes put off his corrupt affections so shall the worke be an acceptable a profitable sacrifice which may yeeld a sweet sauour vnto god and a sauour of rest vnto our whole land it shall so be and it shall do so if the iudge hauing called this assembly iudge according to the rule if hee iudge vprightly
come then from the time to the manner

some take the word mesharim for a nown some for an aduerb wherupon arise two interpretations one respecting the person of the iudge the other that whereupon the iudge worketh
if you respect the person of the iudge then the words are will iudge vprightly that is according to the law
before you heard of a publicke standard whereat mens causes must be tryed the iudge is not fabricator but adhibitor mensurae

iupiter ipse duas aequato examine lances sustinet

the king himselfe much more the iudge is put in trust with it not to make it but to vse it and as st augustine speakes non iudicat de legibus sed secundum leges he must not confound a parliament with an assizes
that is the first thing that must be noted

a second thing is that the word signifieth streight or right lines which is the proper attribute of a law and you know that recta linea est brenissima inter eosdem terminos and if mens causes be iudged according to law the handling of them must not take the next way about the proceeding must be as euen so speedy

and yet which wee must note in the third place the straitnesse of the law is not a mathematicall but a morall straitnesse it is not inflexible but it is so farre to be bent as the minde of the law giuer did intend
a iudge must not insist vpon the words of a law but put on the minde of a lawmaker and a doth follow medium not arithmeticum but

not rei but rationis
the circumstances of quid quantum cui quando

do varie the proceeding and yet the rule is still euen
prouided alwaies that the king and the iudge bee as melchisedeck undefined span alphabet so righteous a king and iudge that he hath no consanguinity nor affinity but only the common weale if a iudge follow such a rule hee then iudgeth vprightly

but told you though mesharim may beevsed aduerbially yet is it a nown and so the ancients did take it in this place as appeares by their translating it undefined span alphabet recta and thinke it is most naturall here to referre it to that whereupon the iudge worketh hee calleth an assembly to see what vprightnesse there is in mens carriage
god as the preacher speaketh made man straight the word is iashar that is set him in a straight way the holy ghost doth much delight to resemble lawes by waies and that resemblance is implied in this word but man being set so straight sought out many inuentions
the rule is as true in policie as in diuinitie
iohn baptist the harbinger of christ according to the prophefie of esay crying vnto the people to prepare christs way and to make his path straight doth reduce all the obliquitie thereof vnto foure heads saying that euery hill must be brought low
you shall finde some men through pride to swell like hils like mountaines lifting themselues aboue their ranke and vsurping more power than belongs vnto them such are the violent oppressors of the poore
and adde vnto them those that are mountainous also the supporters of the man of sin dwelling vpon the seuen hils who vsurped spirituall power of old but of late is grown more eager for a temporall hee hath many proctors for both in this land and they should all be brought low
besides these mountaines you shall find valleyes men that by base qualities fall below their ranke the ranke of men such as are epicures yea vnto the ranke of diuels such as are profest atheists this land swarmeth with too many of them they are not ashamed so gracelesse are they yea so senslesse that they do not tremble to name themselues the damned crue such vallies would be filled vp if it might be by discipline they should bee reclaimed if not by the sword they should be cut off lest they proue bottomlesse gulfes and swallow vp the whole land it is to be feared if bee long tolerated god will pursue with vengeance the whole land for their blaphemies
besides these you shall find some serpentine waies iohn calleth them crooked waies the waies of subtill foxes that wilily circumuent yong ones and simple ones and strippe them of their goods of their lands they would be set straight and that craft which preuailes elsewhere should not serue when they are pierced into by the direct eye of a iudge
finally you shall find ruffe waies the waies of scandalous persons that are exemplarily ill and make many weake ones to fall they must bee made smooth if their hearts cannot be altered yet their deeds must be bridled that they cause not others to offend such are the corrupters of youth by gaming by drinking other loose liuing
in a word undefined span alphabet you must apply your measure to them and

spare no obliquitie that is in any of them then shall the way of all the people be via librata as esay speakes of the way of righteous men it shall bee straight or leuell

there is one thing more which may not omit
this word is neuer read but plurall the reason therof may be manifold the worst is worth your marking
if you look vpon the persons on whom a iudge workes they are good or bad he must withhold iustice from neither of them and iustice requires that one haue proemium the other poenam each receiue according as he deserues and iudgment is not full except both parties haue their due so saith the law the iudge shall iustifie the righteous and condemne the wicked you may not violate this combination
there is another combination in the rule by which you iudge and that is of commutatine and distributiue iustice you haue two barres one for nisiprius and the other for criminall causes my text requires that the measure be euen at both barres
adde hereunto that you are custodes vtriusque tabulae and must haue a care as well that god bee serued as the common weale keeping your selfe to the discreet limitation which constantine the emperour set vnto himselfe leauing episcopatum ad intra vnto vs meane the defining of sacred things and taking vnto your selues no more but episcopatum ad extra the compulsiue commanding of those that are refractarie vnto the good ordinances appointed by the publicke authoritie of the church that so the slanders of the romanists may be refuted and yet that duetie that you owe to gods church bee discharged
you must take care of this second combination
there is a third also that lookes to your owne persons here must bee a combination of your head and your heart you must iudge not onely rectum but rectè that the sentence bee vpright depends vpon you skill but it is your heart that maketh it a vertuous sensentence and surely the holy ghost meaneth something when in the sixteenth of deuteronomie it is said thoushalt follow iustice iustice hee meaneth the iustice of the head and the heart
yea seeing you are not onely magistrates but christian magistrates there must bee in your sentence not onely equitie but pietie your religion must raise your morall vertues vnto an heauenly pitch and what you doe you must doe in faith and to the glorie of god
this is the last combination and for you the best the former two doe rather benefit others
conclude this point with a wish that you would imitate iob who when hee came to the tribunall reports of himselfe that hee put on righteousnesse and it couered him iudgement and it was a robe and a crowne vnto him iob
and pray god that righteousnesse may goe before you and set your steppes in the way
and thus much of the manner of dealing

it followeth now that we come vnto the reasons which are two

the first is the reason of assembling the people or calling an assizes there is great reason for that for there is much amisse the earth and all the inhabitants are dissolued

were wee immutable though wee should neede directiue yet of correctiue instice wee should haue no neede
a parliament were enough to set vs in a good way it would bee superfluous to examine our wayes at an assizes but our condition was mutable in paradise it is much more so now it appeares in that wee may bee dissolued or as the word in the originall is melted
but there are two kinde of meltings according as the parts of the bodie melted are of two sorts homogeneous or heterogeneous if homogeneous as gold and siluer then though they melt yet do they not loose their holdfast cast gold into the fire melt it will but so that in running the parts doe hold fast together but if the parts bee heterogeneous then not onely the whole melteth but the parts fall asunder and are loosed the one from the other
the melting whereto wee are subiect is of the later sort and therefore the interpreter intending the meaning rather than the signification of the word translates it are dissolued that is so melted as that one part hangs not to another
but let vs looke a little farther into this kinde of melting

as in our bodie naturall so in the bodie politicke melting groweth from some outward heate which extracteth the inward and so the parts which were strengthned thereby to hold together
there is a fire of charitie and iustice by which the societie of men is fostered and cherished so long as they hold wee hold together and when they faile wee fall asunder now they faile not except they bee extracted extracted by a fire and that is the fire of hell the diuell that could not endure that blessed societie that we enioyed in paradise with god with angels each with the other but loosed all the bands and set vs at oddes cannot endure so much as the continuance of ciuill societies but hee is still at his forge and is blowing of his coales and wee are too apt to come neare his fire the fire of concupiscence which is a melting fire
saint austine fitly on this place moueth the question and answers it himselfe si defluxit terra vnde defluxit nisi peccatis hee addeth cupiditate superiorum roboratur quasi liquescit cupiditate inferiorum if wee will finde out the true cause of melting wee must finde it in sinne
and sinne what is it but the inclination of our heart vnto these base and earthly things which should bee carried towards heauen and heauenly things while our thoughts doe so stoope wee approach that fire of which saint iames speakes that it setteth the tongue on fire and wee may well say that the whole frame of nature is set on fire thereby so set on fire that it is melted so melted that it is dissolued
there is a threefold band
betweene god and man


betweene superiours and inferiours
betweene those that are equals
in those that come neare this fire they are melted all there continueth no communion betweene god and vs for want of no communion betweene superiours and inferiours neyther respects the other as it ought nor any commerce between equals each doth endeauour to deuour the other

but to open this a little plainer from our bodie naturall wee must learne what an euill this melting is in the bodie politicke
in the bodie naturall if a ioynt bee dissolued wee finde a double euill the part groweth weake in it selfe and troublessome to the neighbour parts as you may see in an arme out of ioynt it is weake it selfe and a burthen vnto the next part whereupon it resteth beeing not able to sustaine it selfe the same falleth out in the policique melting
men through disorder grow weake themselues and they are troublesome to others weake they are though their lusts bee strong because that strength is not of the man who should bee a reasonable creature but it is of a beast of the sensuall part of a man
hee that rideth a fierce horse let the horse keepe what pace hee will so long as the rider commandes him by the bridle wee say hee rides strongly but if the horse get the bit in his mouth and runne away the faster his pace the weaker the rider because hee cannot checke him our affections are as that fierce horse and our reason should bee as a strong bridle stirre they neuer so much if reason commaund wee are strong but if reason haue no power and they runne loose then certainely the more violent they are the weaker are wee
wee speake significantly when wee say that a man transported by his passions is an impotent man and wee therein imitate the phrase of god himselfe who by the prophet reproouing iudah for her vnsatiable spirituall fornication saith how weake is thy heart drunkards and murtherers adulterers and all kinde of dissolute liuers thinke themselues very stronge because they haue their full forthe in sinne but let them not deceiue themselues they are melted they are dissolued this is but a weakenesse they haue lost that strength not onely wherewith god created them vnto vertue but euen that strength wherewith humane policie doth strengthen them vnto ciuill societie they are vnprofitable therefore
but that is not all the euill
a member out of ioynt is not only vnseruiceable it selfe but also painefull to the other partes and whosoeuer groweth disordered as hee weakeneth himselfe so is hee mischieuous to others adulterers to other mens wiues murtherers to their persons robbers to their goods slanderers to their good name it is the condition of all sins they disorder policies

that which obserue vnto iudges herein is that they should not onely take notice of the facts vpon which they sit iudges but to stirre vp in themselues the zeale of iustice should diligently consider these two things which cleaue vnto euery such fact the weakenesse and the annoyance of the malefactour hee is not what hee should bee seruiceable to the state and what hee should not bee hee is mischieuous vnto others
so much is implyed when hee is said to bee dissolued

but let vs see of whom this melting or dissoluing is affirmed
the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolued
some take these words according to the figure undefined span alphabet and resolue them thus all the inhabitants of the earth are dissolued as if the melting and dissoluing did concerne onely the persons yea and point out also such persons as are apt to bee dissolued namely those that haue their thoughts and affections grouelling vpon the earth
we haue a distinction in saint paul of the two adams the first was of earth earthly the second was the lord from heauen as is the earthly so are they that are earthly and as is the heauenly so are they that are heauenly
corinth

they are so in this that the earthly is easily dissolued but the heauenly is not if wee did set our affections on things aboue and not on things below if wee had our conuersation in heauen and would bee though in the world yet not of it wee neede not feare melting wee should not bee dissolued but while wee grow more like the old adam than the new while wee set our affections on things below and sauour onely the things of earth no wonder if wee melt if wee bee dissolued
the admonition for vs all is to keepe vs to the example of christ yea to let christ liue in vs let our hearts bee possessed with the loue of heauen and heauenly things so shall wee not proue melting or disordered members of the state

but the words may bee taken as they lye in my text and the dissoluing may bee applyed no lesse to the earth than to the inhabitants thereof both may bee dissolued both may melt
but then wee must obserue a distinction
there is a penall and there is a sinnefull melting the earth is subiect to a penall but the sinnefull is that whereunto men onely are subiect and being subiect thereunto cause the earth to bee subiect to the other
a fruitfull land may become barren and a healthy countrey become contagious yea a countrey that is like the garden of god as sodome was may become a salt a dead sea as sodome is which is the penall melting or dissoluing thereof but this befalleth not except the people sinne and the crye of their sinne come vp vnto god maledicta terra propter

te hath a constant truth there is neuer any penall melting where a sinnefull melting hath not gone before

the vse that would make hereof is that when wee see plagues wee should thereby bee put in minde of sinnes the magistrate should bestirre himselfe thereabout especially hee should inquire after crying sinnes
god taught this lesson to ioshua when the israelites fled before the men of ai ioshua rent his clothes and fell to his prayers and so did others with him a good worke you would thinke in such a case to deprecate the wrath of god but god telleth ioshua that he should intend another worke vp saith hee what makest thou here israel hath sinned therefore they cannot stand before their enemies goe thou and correct that sinne and that sinne was but the sinne of one how much more must hee doe it if as in the text all the inhabitants bee dissolued the more sinners the more speed must the magistrate make and there can be no more than all

but all may bee vnderstood eyther of singula generunt or genera singulorum it cannot bee vnderstood of singula generum god neuer suffered sinne so farre to preuaile but hee euer had a church in the world and some true children the world could not continue if it were so bad as to haue none
though the times when dauid came to the crowne were verie bad yet not so bad there liued nathan and gad and sadoc and manie thousands too no doubt were there in the dayes of saul as in the dayes of ahab which liued in the feare of god and as orderly members of the state but denominatio sequitur maiorem partem the greater part was the worser part and therefore the complaint is bent against the whole
a complaint which may well fit our dayes wherein though god hath preserued manie as liuing members of christ and profitable inhabitants of this land yet can it not bee denyed that all sorts of sinnes doe raigne in all sorts of persons wee may renew esayes complaint chapt

from the sole of the foote vnto the head there is nothing whole therein
and chapt

the people are oppressed one of another euery man by his neighbour the children presume against the ancient the vile against the honourable what state is there that is not dissolued honourable and beloued will not wrong your wisedomes so farre as to particularize onely this obserue that when you giue your charge you doe nothing but relate the liues of the people they yeeld instances of all those sinnes which you so profitably disswade and would the that haue their eares open to heare your charge would haue their eyes open also to behold the peoples liues and make a conscience to present what if they winke not they cannot choose but

see and if they present there remaines nothing but that you honourable and beloued doe your part as carefully as they performe theirs faithfully
and your part is set downe in the next point of the text in these wordes of king dauid beare vp the pillars thereof

this is the second reason the reason why you must iudge vprightly because when things are amisse the redresse of them lieth in you you beare vp the pillars thereof
the pillars of a state are good lawes and good men good lawes are the pillars that beare vp men and men beeing so borne vp by good lawes doe beare vp the whole state of the land
the reason why this title is giuen vnto lawes is eyther historicall or morall the historicall is the ancient custome of ingrauing lawes in brasse and fastening of them to pillars in publique places as wee vse now the kings proclamations it were not hard out of diuers authors to confirme this custome
will alledge but two and they are two feeling authorities the one to bee heeded by a iudge which is the saying of a poet fixit leges pretio atque refixit the other is also the saying of a poet but it lookes vnto the common people hae he meaneth lawes miserae ad parietem sunt fixae clauis ferreis vbi malos mores affigi nimio fuerat aequius
saint paul seemeth to allude to this custome when hee calleth the church the pillar and ground of truth tim


but to leaue the historicall reason there is a morall reason of it also
our wits and our wills doe both stay themselues vpon the lawes while wee reade philosophers writings de aeque bono what is meete to bee done and what is not meete our iudgements doe wauer through vnresolued discourse so soone as a law hath defined men cease to dispute wee captiuate our iudgment to the wisedome of the state and hold their resolution not to bee excepted against
as a law fixeth our iudgement so doth it settle our will also though good bee louely yet the loue of good is but weake in vs and were there not a law that threatens the transgressors how little wee loue good it would too soone appeare when our affections would melt with sinne they are held together and held vnto their duetie by the bridle of the law the law stayes the law holds and therefore saint basil doth well vnderstand by these pillars undefined span alphabet those lawes which with power and authoritie settle euerie man in his orderly course of life
lycinius the emperour spake barbarously when as eusebius reports hee said that iuris cognitio was virus pestis reipublicae and the iewes who as ambrose obserues said that leges were crimina spake but as iewes that is as a rebellious people and the anabaptists that hold lawes to bee contrarie to christian libertie doe but by their doctrine giue vs to vnderstand the qualities of

their liues which is epicuricall licentiousnesse
but christians must giue lawes their right and repute them as they are the pillars of the state

they are immediately the pillars of the inhabitants and the inhabitants beeing qualified by them become pillars of the state
therefore good men are a second kinde of pillars and indeede so they are called st paul giues that name to peter iames and iohn galathians
nazianzene saith of athanasius that he was undefined span alphabet and of attalus nicephorus saith that hee was undefined span alphabet
neither is this true onely of the worthies of the church but of the common weale also ioseph is called not onely pastor but petra israelis as much is to bee vnderstood of eliakim the sonne of helchia of whom god saith in esay cap

will fasten him as a naile in a sure place and he shall bee for a glorious throne to his fathers house and they shall hang vpon him all the glorie of his fathers house the meaning is they shall all rest vpon him
and indeede there is no good man vpon whom the land doth not rest for as the world was made for them so they beare it vp and when god remooues them the world groweth so much the weaker yea the wicked themselues doe grow the weaker for that they doe enioye their states they are beholding to the good they thinke when they breake lawes and persecute good men themselues fare the better and their posteritie is the greater but fooles they are and therein proue their owne foes for they ouerturne the pillars whereupon both themselues and the whole state doe leane
there is that care in vnreasonable creatures of the preseruation of the whole that euerie part will hazzard it selfe to preuent the common ruine onely men forgetting that themselues must perish when the common weale goeth to wracke to satisfie their own lusts continually push at and would ouerturne both kind of pillars and sampson though not with so good a minde as sampson nor in so good a cause for themselues are more like philistines endeauour the ruine both of others and themselues
what is the remedie surely the remedie lyeth in you in you that are the pillars of the pillars in vos domus omnis inclinata recumbit
good lawes and good men are like vnto a vine that beareth grapes yeelding pleasant liquour to cheere both god and men but a vine must haue a prop or else it will fall to the ground and there all the grapes will rot
of the lawes wee doe quickly perceiue that same of the poet true mores trahunt leges in potestatem sui euerie man would bee a law vnto himselfe a law of vnrighteousnesse and as for good men the better they are the worse they should fare they should not bee thought worthie to breathe but undefined span alphabet it neuer appeares how powerfull a law is till a law is in the hands of a good iudge then

all stand in awe of it and good men if they haue a sunctuarie to betake themselues vnto and a good iudge is such a sanctuarie dare boldly professe and practise goodnesse wherefore what in aeschilus is said of atlas undefined span alphabet that may bee affirmed of good iudges on whose shoulders the pillars of the church and common weale doe rest they beare them vp so we translate but the word is more significant it is borrowed from architecture and hath reference to mesharim that is gone before a terme of the same art also and imports that a iudge so soone as euer hee hath applyed his rule and findes a pillar to incline he falleth to setting of it straight no lesse than a good surgeon must a good iudge iustissimas facere luxationum compositiones neuer leaue mouing of the bone till hee hath set it in his iust place no more must a iudge leaue reforming of a person till hee is come into good order
no doubt but it will fall out that as in setting of a ioynt the patient will bee impatient so austere reformation will bee impugned with much murmuring for exitium suum mali pronâ cupiditate desiderant yet must you haue a lions heart which is commended in a good surgeon or physitian and as iulius firmicus spake to magistrates so doe vnto you subuenite miseris libertate pereuntibus melius est vt liberetis inuitos quàm vt volentibus concedatis exitium and you shall finde the saying of salomon true in the end that hee that reproues a man shall finde more thankes at the last than hee that flattereth him with his lippes and they will say with saint bernard

bonum indicium quod me illi districto diuinoque subducit
wee haue good cause saith saint austine to thanke god that himselfe doth not strike so soone as wee sinne but expects our repentance and thereunto calleth vs by many meanes and no small one is the tribunall of the iudge hee hath the rectifying of all crooked pillars to set them straight yea and keepe them straight also the awe wherein they must stand of you must make euerie man carefull to keepe his place and if you faile wee haue iust cause to feare ne collapsa ruant subductis tecta columnis
for if the light bee darkenesse how great is that darkenesse and if the salt bee vnsauorie wherewith shall it bee seasoned and what will become of the common weale if our eyes see that which salomons did vnder the sunne the place of iudgement that wickednesse was there and the place of righteousnesse that iniquitie was there it is much euill that the state shall fare so ill but it is an euill that must bee feared by you for a

iudge is guiltie of whatsouer hee might and did not reforme and your account will bee the heauier the more you suffer to scape vnpunished
wherefore seeing god hath done you this honour to bee undefined span alphabet for told you that you are a part of the politique person of the king yea as christ is lapis angularis the corner stone of the church so you are also of the common weale falsifie not your names faile not the pillars beare out and vp both lawes and good men deliuer him that suffereth wrong from the hand of the oppressour and be not faint hearted when you sit in iudgement be as a father vnto the fatherlesse and in stead of a husband vnto their mother so shall you bee the sonnes of the most high and he shall loue you more than your mother doth eccles


the last point is that which calleth for your attention to euerie of these former points selah told you it is the character of a remarkeable sentence
there bee diuerse coniectures at the meaning of this word but the likeliest is that which iudgeth of it by the matter whereunto the holy ghost commonly doth apply it
some take it intensiuely as if it did note a superlatiue degree some protensiuely as if it did note a perpetuitie of time will ioyne both surely this sentence is such as you cannot thinke vpon it eyther too much or too long yea euerie branch of it deserues a constant deepe meditation
your person doth for it represents the king yea god himselfe and deserues not that a selah your office you are the common measure of all mens causes and all mens partialitie deferues not that a selah your assemblies are sacred many waies sacred how can you looke on them without a selah and that which you enquire after in them what is it but vprightnesse how conformable they are in their liues vnto the lawes surely that deserues a selah but when you finde how much men haue gone astray and swarued from that euen rule that will raise your selah to a higher pitch finally the benefit expected from you to set right what is awry doth deserue the highest selah there is not an ordinarie point in the text therefore must you entertaine it with more than an ordinarie regard
must end
the summe of all is iudges are sacred persons trusted with the allowed standard of the common weale to call the people to it and by it to examine their liues that finding how farre they haue declined they may set and keep all vpright
lord that hast vouchsafed this honour vnto men and art pleased that such trust should bee reposed in them giue them grace to tender their honour in beeing carefull of their charge blesse this sacred assembly that all triacts therein may passe pages missing

now teach vs surely first discreetly to distinguish times then to solemnize extraordinarie times religiously
these two points are amplified throughout the whole psalme but wee haue a good taste of them in those words that now haue read vnto you
here we shall learne first to distinguish times all times are not alike there are nights aswell as there are dayes the time here remembred is a day a remarkable day it hath the two markes of a festiuall set vpon it
to the making of a festiuall two things must concurre operatio diuina recognitio humana there must be some extraordinarie worke of god done thereon and man must make a speciall acknowledgement thereof
both these are euident in my text first gods worke deus fecit god made the time a day secondly mans acknowledgement haec est dies the church doth kalender it for a high day
as we must learne thus discreetly to distinguish times so we must also learne to solemnize them religiously in performance whereof the text will teach vs what we must doe and how
that which wee must doe is reduced to two heads wee must take full comfort in such a day we must reioyce and be glad in it reioyce with our bodies bee glad in our soules both bodie and soule must expresse a comfortable sense
neither must wee only take comfort in it but pray also for the happie continuance of it for the continuance saue lord we may be depriued of it for the happie continuance of it prosper lord it may be in vaine bestowed on vs these be the things that must bee done but how that is when and by whom when now at the verie same time that wee haue ioyed in the day must wee also bee praying for the continuance thereof
and whom doth the psalmist meane by we looke vnto the beginning of the psalme and you shall find the parties thus specified israel the house of aaron all that feare the lord the the church the cleargie the laitie all whom the day concernes must take notice thereof and expresse this dutie thereon

you see the summe of this scripture which will now god willing enlarge farther and apply vnto our present occasion
but before enter vpon the particulars may not forget to let you vnderstand that this psalme hath a double sense an historicall and a mysticall the historicall concernes king dauid and the kingdome of israel the mysticall toucheth christ and his church
the mysticall hath warrant from the gospell wherein christ doth apply some branches of this psalme vnto himselfe the the historicall is cleare in the bookes of samuel which intreat of the aduancement of king dauid
if we follow the mysticall then the day here remembred is easter day or the day of christs resurrection and that was a day indeed the sunne of righteousnesse then shone forth in great strength and brought life and immortalitie to life
but if we follow the historicall sense then was the day here remembred the day of dauids succession vnto saul a verie festiuall day to israel though not so high a feast as is our

easter day
the fathers commentaries runne most vpon the first sense our occasion is better fitted with the latter wherefore without preiudice to the former we will insist thereon leauing the mysticall we will insist only vpon the historicall sense of these words

the first point therein is the discreet distinguishing of times
all times are not alike there are nights and there are dayes the time here specified is a day
saint basils rule must guide vs in vnderstanding this word he tels vs that when the holy ghost speaketh of a day in this and many other places wee must not plod vpon the course of the sunne but looke vnto the occurrents of the time the occurents are of two sorts prosperous or aduerse the former is vsually called day and the later night
we haue not then to doe with a naturall but a metaphoricall day
but metaphors haue their reasonable grounds and because they are implicitae similitudines close couched resemblances we must vnwrap them that wee may see the resonablenesse that is in the vse of them if we doe this in our present metaphor the reason will be apparent why a prosperous state is tearmed a day
for a day is caused by the sunne rising who by his beames sendeth to the earth light and heate light by which all things are discerned and may bee distinguished and heate by which they are quickened and cherished euen so in a prosperous state there is something that answereth to the sunne and that is a good king and well may the king bee tearmed a sunne in the as the sunne is tearmed a king in the midst of the planets
a good king then like the sunne the with light and heate light all things doe appeare in their right hue or tyrannie doth not blanch or beare out falshood as truth and good as euill euery one beareth his proper name and is reputed no better then he is which is no small blessing of a state if we take notice of that which is occurrent in euerie historie that the best men haue beene branded as the vilest and the vilest haue beene commended for worthies so farre hath darknesse ouercast the iudgement of the world seeke no farther then the storie of christ and his apostles the scribes and the pharisees
as a good king doth remedie this of iudgement by a truer light so doth hee by a vegetable heate put heart into those that deserue well and further their well fare it is no small blessing you may gather it out of the
psalme where the cheareful face as it were of the state doth speake the comfortable influence of a good king you may amplifie this point by that difference which in the
psalme you finde betweene a day and a night
the night is a time wherein the sauage beasts doe range abroad men retire and appeare not but in the day men goe freely abroad to their labour and the sauage beasts retire euen so in the time of an ill gouerned all sorts of beastly men as filthy as swine as greedie as wolues as cruell as tigres as deceitfull as the crocodile these and such like riot and controule and without shame satisfie their lust and then it is dangerous to be iust to be mercifull
but

the countenance of a good king chaseth such vermine away and none vnlike vnto him find grace with him or appeare before him the
psalme hath no other argument but this very point and solomon hath exprest it in seuerall prouerbs

this blessing of light and heat of distinguishing and cherishing the good from and aboue the bad springs from a good king if hee bee only a head of the many heathen kingdomes enioyed such dayes vnder their augustus traians adrians and the like but if the king be also a member of the church a king of israel as king dauid was then doth he yeild vnto his state another day vnto the ciuill hee addes a spirituall day for as constantine said well a good king is episcopus ad extra ecclesiam as the pastors are ad intra though he may not administer sacred things yet must hee command them to be administred to bee administred sincerely that no errours or heresies dimme the heauenly light and to be entertained reuerently that the people may feele the sweet inflaence of grace

hee maketh lawes for the promulgation of the sauing truth of god as saint austine teacheth and by wholsome discipline brings the people to be aswell religious as loyall no lesse dutifull children of god then obedient subiects to their prince

by this that you haue heard wee may learne how to reckon dayes we must not put into our morall kalender all times for dayes wee must looke whether the sunne be vp not the sunne which runneth in the corporall firmament but the sunne of the politicke or ecclesiasticall state wee must see how much light how much heat is deriued into either of them how much the king doth aduance our temporall our eternall prosperitie so we must measure dayes
and if we doe we shall find how much the world doth oftentimes mistak and wee shall find them children of the night which thinke themselues children of the day wee shall find that they are couered with grosse darknesse when they thinke they doe partake of the light this is the case of the turkish monarchie if wee looke to a ciuill day and kingdomes that are enthrawled to antichrist if we looke to the spirituall day the time of neither of these gouernments may properly be called a day
but when wee looke vpon a faire sunshine day and see how welcome it is to the earth we must be put in minde thereby of gods blessing vouchsafed vs and learne to illustrate our metaphoricall by such a naturall day
certainly the time wherein wee now liue is a very cleere day the ciuill state hath long enioyed abundance of peace and the gospel hath free passage in the church euery man sits quietly vnder his owne vine and boldly doe wee assemble in this place to heare gods word these bee plaine euidences of a day a double day such a day as few nations haue enioyed for either the sword rageth amongst them or the light of the gospel hath not shined vnto them
it is then worth the marking that our time is a day

but there is something more which may not omit this day began

such a day as our chronicles for many generations doe not report the like when we reade the storie of ioshua who commanded the sunne to stand still and stretched forth one day to the length of two we all wonder and well we may for it was a great wonder to see two dayes come together and neuer a night betweene but had not we as great a wonder haue we not had so long a day hath not our metaphoricall matched that naturall yea it hath gone so farre beyond it as the metaphoricall exceeds the naturall reade our chronicles and you shall find how seldome we haue had two such dayes together as queene elizabeth hath made with king iames immediatly succeeding both double dayes dayes of church and dayes of
looke beyond queene maries time was at least a spirituall night king edwards time a short though a spirituall and a ciuill day also king henrie the eighth his time was neither night nor day henrie the seuenth his time was a spirituall night but a ciuill day richard the thirds time was a night both spirituall and ciuill if you goe yet more vpward you shall not find it much better only by comparing this you shall find how short their times come of ours to whom god hath vouchsafed this double day wee may fitly call it duplex festum such a day must needs be a festiuall day a double day a double feast

and indeed it hath set vpon it the markes of a festiuall thereunto told you must concurre two things first operatio diuina secondly recognitio humana gods worke and mans acknowledgement gods worke must goe before deus fecit is the first character of an holiday
why doth one day excell another saith the sonne of syracke

seeing the light of the dayes of the yeare commeth from the sunne the knowledge of the lord hath parted them asunder and hee hath by them disposed the solemne times and feasts some of them hath hee chosen and sanctified and some of them hath hee put amongst the dayes to number

but this is not all that is to be obserued in gods making of the day the lord doth not only appoint such a time but doe something thereon for which it deferues such a title
obserue then that a time of aduersitie is called the day of the lord but yet god is not said to make it a day but rather he maketh that day a night one and the selfe same time is called in the scripture both day and night
in the fift of amos

we reade is not the day of the lord darknesse it is darknesse and there is no light in it micah and zephanie accord therewith
a strange composition there is when the same time is called both day and night a day it is called only in regard of the euidence all shall see plainly what it is and therefore it is called the reuelation of the iust iudgement of god
gods iudgements are alwayes iust but they doe not alwayes appeare so to all but god hath appointed a time wherein he will so cleere it that the wicked themselues shall not bee able to denie it in regard of this euidence that time is called a day
but if you looke to the substance of things that doe befall them in that day

then sure it is not a day but a night they are dismall and dreapfull things either corporall or spirituall and in these two points standeth the substance of a metaphoricall night

a second reason why god is said to make the time a day is because he is the sole cause thereof it is true that god createth darknesse and woe but he doth it not but as he is prouoked by man man doth sin if god send plagues but of light and prosperitie god is causa undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet also the occasion and the cause of blessednesse are both of god moued only by his owne goodnesse doth hee doe good vnto men especially the good of this double day such as was the day of israel
for if you looke vpon the people they were most sinfull if vpon the enemies of king dauid they were most malicious and violent so that had not gods goodnesse and his power the one past by the sinne the other represt the malice of king dauids aduersaries the day could neuer haue dawned king dauid had neuer sate vpon that throne well may god then bee tearmed the authour of the worke which had so little probabilitie of being if you looke vpon all other things excepting god
in a word the very phrase teacheth this lesson that when wee see alterations in the world we must no more doubt of the author of the metaphoricall then wee doe of the naturall day god is the authour of both and of both with like facilitie hee lighteth our candle and maketh our darknesse to be light psal
though we may not neglect second causes yet must we ascend as high as the first
it was heathenish idolatrie when the gentiles saw the benefits that came from the sunne in lightning and warming the earth to make the sunne a god and giue the price of the creatour vnto his creature whereas they should haue argued from it vnto him and conceiued the eminencie of his goodnesse from whom such good things did proceed
and wee shall not be farre from idolatrie if the comfort of peace and religion affecting vs our hearts ascend no higher then the immediat cause thereof which is our king and wee doe not giue glorie vnto god which out of his loue to vs hath set him vpon the throne if we doe not discerne that the lord hath made our day
what our sinnes were that might haue hindered it need not tell you the pestilence that did attend the dawning of the day was an intimation from god how vnworthie wee were but his pleasure was that we should fall into his hands not into the hands of our enemies
for as we were vnworthie so they were inraged witnesse their treason that immediatly was discouered manifold plots of treason but all defeated by the prouidence of god
wherefore we must say not only that wee haue a day but also that the day which we haue was made by the lord and conclude not vnto vs lord not vnto vs but vnto thy name be prayse

deus fecit is not enough to the making of a festiuall the church must come in with haec est dies when god goeth before in working

something in the time the church must not bee behind in giuing the due estimate to the time we must not esteeme all dayes alike when god doth not worke alike vpon all
but nothing is required of vs to the making of a festiuall but only acknowledgment of gods worke take a view of all the festiuals of the iewes you shall find that they did no more no more then commemorate that on such a day god did doe such a worke
and the christian church hath trod the very same steps and hath not thought it fit to suffer any of the remarkable workes of god to passe vnregarded whether they concerne the whole church or any particular state they haue stamped vpon the time of those workes haec est dies this is not a day to bee forgotten and therefore haue enioyned the anniuersarie commemoration thereof
yea and euery priuate family and person that hath receiued any extraordinarie blessing from god may make vnto himselfe such an aniuersarie and refresh the memorie of that time wherein god hath done him some great good
and let this suffice for the discreet distinction of times let vs now see how religiously we must solemnize them

though to the making of the day no more be required of vs then this acknowledgement haec est dies this is the day yet to the vsing of it more is required here wee must consider what must be done and how
that which must be done reduced to two heads first we must take full comfort in the day and secondly pray for the happie continuance thereof

in expressing the comfort the psalmist vseth two words which are fitted to the two principall parts of man his bodie and his soule so the vse of them in the originall language teacheth and venerable bede doth so distinguish them exultemus corpore laetemur animo let the bodie as it were dance for ioy and the soule reioyce
both partake of the day the bodie principally of the ciuill day and of the spirituall day the soule is the principall partaker yet so as that each in either doth congratulate the other if the day bee ciuill the soule congratulates the bodie the bodie which is exultant for his day if the day be spirituall then the bodie congratulateth the soule the soule that is gladded at the heart for her day
so then the bodie cannot exult but the soule will bee glad neither can the soule be glad but the bodie will exult there is a undefined span alphabet and the word nos let vs exulte let vs reioyce noteth that what is proper to either part redounds to the whole person
and the holy ghost in coupling of both these words doth put vs in minde that neither part must be wanting in performing of this worke because either part doth share in the day and so you shall find that king dauid doth oftentimes rowse his soule and rowse his bodie also to performe this eucharisticall sacrifice he remembreth carnem cor his flesh and his spirit his glorie that is his tongue and all that is within him
and no maruell for he would recommend himselfe as well to god as to men

and wee must thinke that our workes of pietie are imperfect if either part be wanting

but as when the moone and the sunne doe meet aboue the horizon and each doth contribute his light to the making of a day the light of the moone is not sensible in comparison of the light of the sunne so should the impression which is made by worldly things which are as changeable as the moone be dimme or darkened as it were by the impression made by spirituall things which are more constant then the sunne
and the ioy of our bodies must so be tempered as may not hinder the predominant gladnesse of our soule all the world must see that though wee prize both the dayes the ciuill and the spirituall yet the rate which we set vpon the spirituall doth infinitely exceed that which wee set vpon the ciuill
if this lesson were well learned the world should not haue so many wofull experiments of those who being put to their choice whether they will lose had rather enioy the ciuill day with the losse of the spirituall then by sticking to the spirituall hazard the ciuill but we must chuse rather to be glad in soule then exult in bodie if we cannot doe both together
but whether we doe expresse our comfort by one only by the bodie or also by the soule we must keepe both parts vnto their proper obiect that is to the day though wee expresse our affections by meats drinkes triumphs and other solemnities yet may we not while we signifie our ioy by them exulte or ioy in them and yet behold the most part of men little thinke on the day their thoughts and senses are taken vp for the most part with the accessories eating drinking they doe these things more freely and are more frolicke then ordinarie the state of the or of the church commeth little into their thoughts it is not much remembred at their feasts to remedie this the church hath appointed that we should begin this solemnitie in the church there first heare in how good case we are and breake forth there into spirituall prayses and thankesgiuings and make a religious acknowledgment of our blessed day
of our blessed day but not forgetting the author thereof god that hath made vs such a day no hee must bee the principall obiect of our reioycing if wee exclude him or giue him not the first place we shall not be farre from the sinne of the angels and adam who fell they were contented to reioyce in their day but not in him that made it and so when pride made them vnthankfull iustice bereft them of that wherein they ioyed and wee may forfeit our day if wee make them patternes of our ioy king dauid is a better example who in all his psalmes of thankesgiuing doth more remember by whom then how happie he was

the last thing which obserue on this point is that ioy must gee with the day
the philosopher can tell vs that pleasure is an adiunct of felicitie vpon this principle is saint iames his rule built if any man

be merrie let him sing the neglect of this taking comfort hath a heanie doome in moses

because thou diddest not serue the lord thy god with ioyfulnesse and a good heart for the abundance of all things therefore thou shalt serue thine enemies in hunger thirst and nakednesse
it was not then without cause that nehemias did reproue the iewes for weeping when the time remembred them of feasting and indeed what a senslesse thing is it when god taketh pleasure in the prosperitie of his seruants when angels doe congratulate our happinesse and the rest of the world doth either admire or enuie it for vs to be senslesse and giue no token of our thankfull remembrance of it and if such neglect deserue blame what blame deserueth the murmuring libelling slandering malecontent that maketh a night of our day and confoundeth the bright sunshine with an ominous ecclipse such spirits as they are vnworthy of the day so it were good they were made more sensible of it by experience of the opposite night

out of all this that you haue heard touching our comfort we may learne that saint chrysostomes rule is true non est parua virtus gaudere de bonis there is more required vnto full comfort then euery one either heeds or performeth if we will take comfort as we ought wee must not omit any one of those branches which haue exprest
but enough of the comfort come now to the prayer
as wee must take full comfort in the day so must wee pray for the happie continuance thereof first of the continuance saue lord
the words are hoshingnana which in the gospel is rendred hosanna solemne words vsed by the iewes at the feast of tabernacles
when they were in their passage to canaan they had no other houses but boothes or tabernacles god was pleased to figure the church militant in the forme of a campe when they came into the holy land and possessed cities god would not haue them thinke they cease to be militant and therefore commanded them once a yeare to dwell in tents and thereby remember that they must bee alwayes readie to betake themselues againe to such moueable houses and that they wanted not enemies that would put them to it
but marke in what place the tabernacles were to be pitched euen at hierusalem which signifieth the vision of peace there were they to haue a spectacle of warre
neither were the tents only pitcht at hierusalem but also round about the temple to let them vnderstand what that was which was maligned not only their ciuill but also their spirituall day for both they were to pray hoshignana saue lord let not their wicked imaginations prosper that haue euill will either at hierusalem or at sion

the point implied herein is that both our dayes are changable the ciuill day though it be as glorious as the day of salomons raigne yet may it haue a rent as great as salomons kingdome had when he lost ten tribes of twelue yea when all twelue were carried away in captiuitie
neither may the ciuill day only be changed but the spirituall also the temple may be burnt aswell as the citie the priest destroyed aswell

as the citie the priest destroyed aswell as the prince the mists of idolatrie yea and infidelitie may ouercast the church it is plaine in the storie of the iewes who at first were idolaters and now are become plaine infidels
neither hath the new testament any exemption from this change the easterne and westerne churches shew that all are subiect to the same condition therefore whilst we stand we must take heed of a fall and the best heed is to pray saue lord

as we must pray for the continuance so must we pray that that continuance may be happie
we see that though the sunne bee aboue the horizon and so apt to make a day yet many so gges and mists rising from the earth ouercast the skie and intercept the comfortable influence of the light euen so though god vouchsafe neuer so good a prince a prince vnder whom we enioy abundance of peace and the free passage of the gospel such may be our gracelesnesse that wee shall be the better for neither of them not for the peace that will not make our times a day if we abuse it in riot and luxurie extortion and imurie diseases that the malignitie of our nature hath made almost inseparable companions of ciuill peace and prosperitie
as our vntowardlinesse may hinder the ciuill day so may it the spirituall also if wee loath the heauenly food as many prophane persons doe or as many take an occasion from it to rent the seamelesse coate of christ and fall to sects and schismes and how many churches that might haue beene happie haue beene by these meanes most vnhappie wee haue not wanted gaules of this kinde which haue fretted our spirituall day as our ciuill is much dimmed by the voluptuousnesse of our times
you see then there is good reason of the second branch of the prayer prosper lord let not thy blessings lord be receiued in vaine let either sort his blessed effect religion in the church and peace in the

haue shewed what you must doe in solemnizing of a festiuall there remaine two things which will touch in a word the first is when this must bee done then by whom both these containe the manner how we must doe this dutie these things must bee done ioyntly and they must be done vniuersally
iointly that is noted in the word now saue now send now prosperitie we must fall to our prayers euen when we are singing prayses

it is very true which the sonne of syracke obserueth
in the day of prosperitie there is a forgetfulnesse of affliction and in the day of affliction there is no remembrance of prosperitte this is the vsuall course of men

but he giueth a good admonition when thou hast enough remember the time of hunger and when thou art rich thinke vpon pouerne and need let vs not forget our prayers when wee are at our prayses when the church is triumphant there shall bee then only ioy and prayse shall be our only worke but while the church is militant dolor voluptas inuicem cedunt there is a vicissitude of faire and foule weather prosperitie and aduersitie therefore as wee must praise god for the one so must wee pray against the other at the same time wee

must doe both
but who are they that must doe it the text hath no more but wee but if you looke vnto the beginning of the psalme you shall find a commentarie vpon that word you shall find that this must be done vniuersally israel must doe it the house of aaron must doe it all must doe it that feare the lord if all be the better for the day the dutie of solemnizing the day belongeth vnto all to the ecclesiasticall to the ciuill state both must acknowledge what they receiue both must acknowledge the day whereon they did receiue it
the day wherein the blessed sunne did arise vnto vs all the fruits of whose raigne are this great calme from stormes of warre and plentifull publication of gods sauing truth wee must all acknowledge both these blessings
as we must all acknowledge them so must we all take full comfort in them we must not defraud the day of our ioy seeing the day brings comfort vnto vs it brings comfort to our bodie and comfort to our soules therefore our bodies and soules must reioyce in it
in it but not forgetting him that made it that is god as for the day wee are most beholding to him so in him must we ioy most

but our comfort must not make vs forget our danger danger from without danger from within danger from our owne vntowardlinesse danger from the maliciousnesse of our enemies this double danger must make vs seeke to him that made our day that he would make it a perpetuall day that hee would hinder whatsoeuer impediment we may iustly feare from our enemies and not suffer vs to be an impediment of our owne blisse

shut vp all with the very words of my text
our times are such as that we haue good cause to vse the first words this is the day which the lord hath made and if we must say this this must draw from vs that which followeth the religious solemnizing of the day we must exhort each the other and be perswaded by our mutuall exhortation to vow the expressing of our comfort wee will reioyce and bee glad in it and deprecate whatsoeuer imminent danger with saue now wee beseech thee lord lord we beseech thee send vs now prosperitie
amen

in furtherance of this common pietie to refresh our memorie and quicken our deuotion haue chosen this storie which containes an vnpartiall censure of an inordinate zeale inordinate zeale in two apostles who are therefore vnpartially censured by our sauiour christ
and this storie haue the rather chosen at this time to speake of in this place because here is the hope of church and common weale the seed aswell of the gentrie as of the clergie
and it is for such that the factors of rome doe trade to make aduocates of the one and of the other actours of their holy fathers most barbarous designes

wherefore it is very behoofull that they aboue others bee not only inured to detest but informed also vpon what ground they should detest such sauage such hellish counsels and attempts

now better informed they cannot bee then if they be furnished with sound rules of a good conscience which they may oppose to all deceitfull romish ones wherewith the vnlearned are insnared and they peruerted that are vnstable
the romanists boast of their manifold studies of diuinitie and indeed they haue manifold would they were as good as they are many but their cases of conscience are that vpon which they principally relie and wherewith their kingdome is most supported and no maruell for they are euen for the studie and their power of the keyes is chiefly managed by these cases
it is most true that all parts of their diuinitie are full fraught with sophistrie but when we come to this part ouer and aboue what impietie what iniquitie what impuritie doe we find others occasionally may vnder take other points wish they would prouided alwayes that they doe it soundly discreetly considering what a precious what a tender thing a good conscience is it is not euery mans skill aright to handle it
but haue now to doe with a point of iniquitie with an vnlawfull reuenge of persons afflicted for religion
we haue here a reuenge proposed by such afflicted persons and we haue christs doome passed therevpon that such reuenge is vnlawfull see it in the text
first the affliction the samaritans would not receiue christ and this affliction was for religion christ was not receiued because his face was as if he would goe to ierusalem
it was great inhumanitie not to entertaine a stranger but the reason improues it as high as impietie if we therefore fare the worse at the hands of men because wee are well disposed to serue god
being so farre vrged zeale cannot hold surely iames and iohn could not as was their name so were they sonnes of thunder were they called and the exhalations they breath are very hot
and yet marke though they are bold to propose yet are they not so bold as to resolue they propose their desire their reason
their desire is fire a cruell weapon and they would not haue it spare a iot it must consume their enemies make a finall and a fearefull spectacle of these vngodly samaritans
a sharpe desire
and yet they sticke not at it and why it is not singular they haue though not a rule yet an example for it elias did so that is the reason he dealt so with the old samaritans when they wronged him and shall these new samaritans escape better that thus wrong christ this they propose
but they doe not resolue as if they were conscious to themselues that they may erre they submit their desire to god and to christ
they desire fire consuming fire but it is from heauen they would haue no other then god would send nay they would not haue that except christ be pleased master wilt thou if thou say nay we haue done behold nature and grace and how grace doth stop the furie of nature

grace doth somewhat but the fountaine of grace doth it much more they put the question to christ and christ giueth them an answere a cooling answere for he reproues their zeale and disproues their reason and he doth both in word and deed

he reproues in deed for he turned about his gesture was angrie not only in deed but also in word and his word commented vpon his deed he checked them
but to reproue and shew no cause is to hold the hands but not to rectifie the heart christ doth not so hee will not only haue them forbeare but also to be perswaded that they ought so to doe
therefore he confuteth their reason
their reason was elias his example christ telleth them that example is misapplied you know not of what spirit yee are euery mans temper must be according to his calling you are called to bee my apostles therefore must you take your temper from me and my temper is answerable to the ends of my incarnation well might elias answere his name it signifieth the power of god and he shewed gods power in taking vengeance he came to destroy mens liues but iesus must answere his owne name and his name signifieth the saluation of the lord therefore is he become the sonne of man that he may saue the liues of men
so christ refuteth their reason in words
but not only in words he doth it in deeds also he that gaue them a good rule giueth them a good example he went vnto another towne· yea partly the rule and partly the example put these hot disciples into a better moode for not christ only but they also left that and went into another towne
you see the contents of this scripture and withall that they may bee reduced vnto two heads the reuenge and the censure of the reuenge there are two parts the preuocation of the samaritans and the passion of the apostles
and in the censure christ first reproues and then disproues not only in words but also in deeds
the particulars are many therefore you may not expect that speake much of any one so much may suffice as will serue this present occasion thereon to ground a sound case of conscience and thereby to stirre vp due thankes for our wonderfull deliuerance
to this end will resume the points and touch at them briefly and in ther order
and first at the affliction
the samaritanes would not receiue him

the persons that afflicted were samaritans and the samaritans were ancient enemies of the iewes from the dayes of rehoboam whose kingdome was rent into two that of israel whose metropolis was samaria and the other of inda these kingdomes were at oddes and in the israelites did the first quarrell begin against the iewes
after the israelites were carried away captiues by the kings of assyria and a colonie mixt of many nations succeeded in their roome the quarrell was inherited together with the countrie
it appeares immediately vpon the iewes returne from the babylonian captiuitie for

then the iewes would not admit the samaritans to build the temple with them because they held them for gentiles and the samaritans in reuenge did their worst to interrupt the building of the temple and although to partake of the iewes prosperitie they were contented to be reputed of their kindred yet in time of their aduersitie they disclaymed them and were suiters vnto the kings of syria and egypt that they might goe for gentiles though indeed they were neither iewes nor gentiles but mungrels mixt no lesse in religion then in nation taking somewhat of the gentile and somewhat of the iew as appeares in the samaritanismus described by epiphanius as impious a chaos as is the turkes alcoran
these were the men that offered the indignitie vnto christ
being so bad men they make the indignitie the worse though of it selfe it is bad enough
let vs see what it is

it is a sinne compounded of inhumanitie and impietie there is inhumanitie in the fact but the reason doth improue it vnto impietie
the fact was they would not receiue christ great inhumanitie not to receiue strangers especially for samaritans who as epiphanius reports receiued the fiue bookes of moses wherein hospitalitie is taught both by rule and by example
the example of abraham and lot are remarkable in genesis who were undefined span alphabet as saint paul willeth christians to be rom
giuen to hospitalitie
origen first and out of him chrysostome obserue the significancie of the phrase which importeth that we should be so hospitable as not to stay till strangers seeke to vs but preuent them by our inuitation
and indeed so did abraham and so did lot

neither had they only these examples but the law also leuit

thou shalt not wrong a stranger but loue him as thy selfe
eumaenes in homer presseth the reason of it

undefined span alphabet all strangers are of gods family the whole world is his house vnder whom euery man holdeth but a small territorie and although in regard of our owne tenure they that haue another are strangers vnto vs yet are we all tenants of the same yea of the houshold of the same great master and therefore no man should esteeme another a stranger
surely our sauiour christ shewes matth

that this reason which nature it selfe taught the heathen is true also in diuinitie in that come yee blessed for when was a stranger yee lodged me and solomon to the same purpose he that giueth to the poore lendeth to the lord

but if this reason goe too high nazianzene hath another more plaine to reason undefined span alphabet no man can denie harbour to others that thinketh vpon this that himselfe is a stranger hee hath his ground from gods law who therefore bids the israelites bee good to strangers because themselues were strangers in egypt

it was no small comfort vnto iob that hee could say the stranger did not lodge in the street but opened my house to him that went by the way

end this point with saint austines exhortation disce christiane sine discretione exhibere hospitalitatem ne fortè cui domum clauseris cui humanitatem negaueris ipse

sit deus certainly he against whom the samaritans shut their gates was christ they were so farre from inuiting him that they would not be intreated by him if they had beene but as daintie as the egyptians who held it an abomination to eat with the hebrewes it had beene too much but not to receiue them vnder their roose was plainly against the law of nations

it was so but haply they had some reason for their fact they alledge one and see quomodo cum ratione insaniunt christs face was as if he would goe to ierusalem the fact was bad this reason maketh it worse
some doe thinke that the samaritans did alwayes denie entertainment to the iewes but it is most certaine that they did it when they went to the feasts
to vnderstand it we must know that although god chiefly respect the substance of his worship yet in the old testament the iewes were tied to a circumstance of place also god commanding that they should there sacrifice where he put his name and that was finally the temple of hierusalem

after the returne from the babylonian captiuitie when the law was vrged of diuorcing such wiues as were iewes neither by nature nor by becomming proselytes

manasses a brother of the high priest was put to his choice whether he would be excluded from the function of his priesthood or forsake his wife he consulted sanballat a prince of samaria whose daughter he had married and by his aduice became an apostata
in recompence whereof first by the leaue of darius and afterward by the approbation of alexander the great sanballat built a temple vpon the top of mount garisim the highest hill of samaria

in emulation of the temple vpon mount sion which stood vntill the dayes of iohannes hircanus infamous for robbing of king dauids sepulchre who together with samaria raised that temple and although herod new built samaria yet did hee not the temple notwithstanding the samaritans esteemed the place in the dayes of christ no lesse then if the temple had beene standing
of this temple manasses was made high priest ouer all the sect of the samaritans

this being the originall of their temple erected contrarie to the law yet did they in time affect it for the reputation of antiquitie stiling themselues pertinentes ad montem benedictum as postellus obserues and therein they allude to the storie

where we read that the benediction was pronounced vpon mount garisim
you haue a touch at their humour iohn
where the woman of samaria telleth christ our fathers worshipped in this mountaine but most ample to this purpose is that famous contention betweene the samaritans and the iewes that dwelt in egypt heard and determined by the king of that countrie you may read it in iosephus and although then their forged antiquitie was discouered and condemned as the same iosephus reports yet ceased they not to stand to it and bee bitter to all that denied it
might trouble you with relation of the bloudie warre betweene them and the galileans about a passage through their countrie vnto ierusalem

but it will suffice to obserue that the samaritans quarrell against

the iewes for theophylacts conceit why christ was not entertained at hierusalem is cleane opposite to the truth was de loco cultus

which was a necessarie question then though not now undefined span alphabet as chrysostome obserues
but being then a necessarie question it was fit that christ should deliuer his iudgement and hee doth it openly his face was as if he went to hierusalem

there is a figure in the phrase in that the face is said to goe but there is significancie in the figure because it noteth christs plaine dealing and constancie therein which is also intimated in the former words undefined span alphabet simulation is a reall lie as a lie is a verball dissimulation both sinnes alike hated by christ and christians saint pauls rule with the heart man belieueth vnto instification

and with the tongue he confesseth vnto saluation was obserued by our sauiour and iustin martyr obserues in the primitiue church that they were so farre from impugning their aduersaries that they did not endeuour so much as to deceiue them but apertè confitentes mortem adiba~t
the same doth tertullian obseruewriting ad scapulam
but the old hereticks were of another mind might instance in sundrie of whom reade danaeus comment vpon saint austine de haeresibus will only mention the priscillianists of whom saint austine habent etiam in dogmatibus iura periura secretum prodere noli trust rather god with thy soule then men with either thy bodie or goods
and how like vnto them are the iesuiticall equiuocators that with a nice distinction of veritas iuramenti and iurantis haue learned themselues and others infamous hypocrisie and hauing separated the serpent from the doue shew whom they resemble christ or the deuill will say no more to them then what ierome said sometimes to iohannes hierosolymitanus

nolo verborum ambiguitates nolo dici quod aliter intelligi possit retectâ facie gloriam domini intueamur if we will not haue christ denie vs before his father

we must not denie him before men for corde creditur ad institiam we must learne of christ constantly to confesse the truth yea though thereby we incurre danger as christ did
for as christs confession was open so you see it was not well taken the samaritanes had no personall quarrell against him the nationall was enough hee approued not their place of worship and they would therefore haue none of his companie

men that are of diuers nations hardly sort more hardly if they bee of diuers religions the degree of hatred ariseth to the heighth of that for which they hate and higher matter there cannot be then religion therefore the deuill intendeth that quarrell specially because it is the root of all enmitie he knoweth if that take place there is nothing whereat malice will sticke it will set the father against the sonne and the sonne against the father where there is vnitie in religion religion is some stay to malice but there is nothing to stay it if religion set men at oddes for their inhumanitie they suppose they haue a faire excuse

if they can make god a partie to the quarrell
nazianzene hath handled this point excellently shewing that men being ashamed of

their villany flye undefined span alphabet
and what cloake haue ambitious couetous malicious massacres at this day

but the specious name of the catholicke chuse vrge this poynt no further but remember you that this quarrell betweene the iewes and the samaritans was the cause of that warre wherein the romans did vtterly destroy them both
and how much of christiandoome became a prey many hundred yeares since vnto the sarizens and of late yeares to their heires the turkes he hath read little that doth not know god grant that the continuance of this malice bring not that which remainueth into the same bondage which the kingdomes already lost doe miserably indure
but enough of the samaritans prouocation

come now to the persons of the apostles and those were iames and iohn
will not dispute whether they were the persons that were sent to prepare for christ the scripture is silent will not define it
let it passe for a probability because some of the ancients haue thought it likely
but that which rather obserue is these two disciples aboue the rest had a strong conceite of christs earthly kingdome which made them carnally both ambitious and zealous of their ambition wee read elsewhere where one of them desired to sit on christs right hand and the other on his left here they shew themselues zealous but their indignation is carnall and so is the weapon where with they doe expresse it
my obseruation is one grosse conceite breedes another it did so in them it doth so in the church of rome who dreaming of a temporall power which christ hath giuen vnto his church is forward to execute temporall paines vpon whomsoeuer is not conformable vnto her will

but leaue the persons and come to their passion
wherein notwithstanding marke that though they are bold to propose yet to resolue they are not bold
they are bold to propose their desire their reason
their desire is fire a sharpe weapon especially seeing saint paul for dissention in religion prescribeth other which they would not haue to spare they would haue it consume their enemies

fire is their weapon quid mirum filios tonitrus fulgurare sayth saint ambrose it may be the very place put them in minde of the element because it was in the region of samaria that god executed a fearefull vengeance by fire

kings
or haply because this element is in the scripture made the ordinary attendment vpon gods iudgement therefore they especially affect that weapon iohannes magnus reporteth that carolus an ancient king of the gothes amongst his great lawes ordained this for one that if any man were thrice conuicted to haue denied entertainement to strangers his house should be set on fire aedibus proprijs iuste priuaretur qui earum vsum inhumaniter negavisset
surely whereas there are foure elements the earth the water the ayre the fire euery one of the three first are hospitall the earth entertaines beasts and men the water fishes the ayre birds only the fire is inhospitall and therefore though they might haue wished for an to founder the village or a floud to drowne it or a venemous ayre to poyson the inhabitants of it as that king thought so did these apostles think that

the other elements were too compassionate and only this vnmerciful element to take vengeance on these merciles men
sure they would haue no mercy shewed them for they would not only haue fire out consuming fire

seneca obserues well non vt in beneficijs bonestum est meritameritis ita in iniurijs illic vinci turpe hic vincere inhumanum and the rule of the law is fauores ampliandt restringendaodia and god is the patterne hereof whose mercy doth indeede permit him to doe vs good vltra condignum but his iustice neuer strikes vs but citra condignum

god is more admirable in sparing then punishing because cedit iure suo in the one exigit in the other read hosea
wisd
it is our riches to exact our debts but gods to forgiue his
what bowels then had these apostles that would so repay wrong with reuenge a iesse wrong with so sharpe a reuenge for it was but a common discourtesie which for many yeares the samaritans bad vsed towards all the iewes and that out of no other malice then such as proceeded from a rooted ignorance they were then rather to be for their ignorance then thus to be hated for their malice
but see now the truth of king dauids answere to the prophet gad when he was offered his choice of three plagues famine

pessilence or the sword am in a wonderfull straight let vs fall now into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let not mee fall into the hands of men for men are bowelles euen iames and iohn which asking fire shew themselues to be worse then fire for as chrysostome obserueth fire can stay it selfe if god commaund though it be the nature of fire to burne as appeareth in the case of shadrach meshach and abednego but men though it be contrary to their nature as appeares in that it is painefull to be furious and rage cannot hold though god lay his commandement vpon them
the voluntary agent whose property it should be statuere actiont suae modum becomes a naturall et agit ad extremum potentiae suae
vnto whom say no more but this wouldest thou man that god should so deale with thee and send fire such a fire so soone as thou deniest entertainment vnto him thou wouldest not see then how euery man desireth mercy for himselfe the tenderest mercy but for his enemy iustice the extreamest iustice and because it is so seneca's rule is good irascenti tibi nihil volo licere quia dum irasceris omnia putas licere
in a word the apostles offend twice first in that being pastors they desire a corporall reuenge secondly in that being christians they desire so sharpe a reuenge
nazianzene thinks they wished for the fire of sodome

sharpe it is but it is not singular though they haue no rule yet they haue an example for it elias did so
in this chapter is report made of the transsiguration of christ wherein appeared moses and elias moses the meekest of men elias a seuere man they saw them both but see whom they remember they might haue remembred moses and so haue intreated christ not to take iust displeasure at so bad vsage if he had beene feeling of his owne wrongs but while he is calme they storme and they colour their passion by elias his example so prone is our nature to imitation and in imitation to pitch vpon

the worst
the knowledge of rules is too painefull few will study them and know good and euill by them men take a shorter course and thinke that well done wherein they are like vnto others so liueth the most part of the world and careth not much for any farther enquiry into their actions
but when they fall vpon examples according to which they square themselues their liues commonly are exemplifications of the worst
it is the obseruation of a very leud writer but heerein hee hath deliuered a remarkable truth when men read the liues of good men they read them with content and cannot without detestation read the liues of those that are bad yet when they are but to expresse whom they wilbe like they forget their owne vpright iudgment and yeeld themselues to their inordinate passions
certainely these apostles not so much out of iudgement as out of rage chose rather to bee elias then moses and wherein are they better then the samaritans for the samaritans ranne vpon the same ground that they did they called for fire because elias did and the samaritans had the same argument they would not receiue christ because their fathers had not vsed to to do it certainely in the
of iohn the woman of samaria alledgeth our fathers worshiped in this mount in defence of mount garisim against sion but this is but apish imitation on all hands and not the true vse that is to be made of stories

you haue heard their desire and the reason thereof which they are bold to vtter vnto christ
but they that are so bold to propose are not bold to resolue it was but undefined span alphabet it was not undefined span alphabet that was in them you may gather it by the voyce of grace wherewith they correct the voyce of nature
there are but two meanes whereby men may accomplish an action potentia and potestas ability and authority they deny themselues both
first ability they will haue fire but it is from heauen they will haue none but such as god can send and such workes of wonder they acknowledge to be his workes and though they be performed at the word of man yet he worketh by his owne finger and therefore it is not to be doubted but if he doe it it shalbe well done and if it be not well he will not do it
neyther doe they onely deny that they haue ability but authority also which they referre to christ master wilt thou as the ability is gods so they know that god worketh not but mediante christo and therefore haue they recourse vnto him though they confesse whether their owne heart carried them yet they doubted of the goodnesse thereof as they had cause for immediately before they were chid because they forbid one to worke miracles that did not follow christ that they did out of zeale as they did this they saw they erred there they thought they might erre heere also wherefore they come in with lord wilt thou iusta voluntas hominis quae ea tantum vult quae deus vult eam velle iniusta vero quae vult illud quod deus non vult eam velle and saint bernard quid odit

aut punit deus praeter propriam voluntatem cesset voluntas propria et infernus non erit
wee may not take in hand corporall no nor spirituall weapons without this preface lord wilt thou and wee must pray

teach me

lord to doe thy will for thou art my god
the two meanes whereby the apostles qualifie their speech will teach vs to qualifie ours

they put the question to christ and christ shapeth them an answere and his answere consisteth of a reproofe of their zeale and disproofe of their reason and he doth both in words and deeds
first in deeds
he turned about his obseruation will not hold that saith this phrase is neuer taken but in bonam partem it signifieth sometimes the euidence of christs displeasure christ as hee was truely man so was he herein like vnto him that those obiects that wrought vpon his soule gaue some signification in his bodie of sorrow when he wept of exultation when he reioyced and of displeasure when he was wrath but his passions were free from concupiscence wherewith ours are defiled our passions are like water that hath a muddie residence which when it is stirred euery part groweth fowle with mudde but christs like cleane water in a pure vessell which is neuer the fowler for the motion
this being obserued christs turning to them might well bee such as gaue notice that hee was offended with them
neither did he reproue them in gesture only but in words also his words commented on his gesture and they were words of reproofe verè diligit christus suos sed seuere as well as he loueth them he spareth not to let them know their faults hee is farre from king dauids indulgence of whom it is obserued that he neuer said to his sonne adoniah why doest thou so but christ as when there is cause he comforts so when there is cause hee checkes also
neither must wee looke that the light of his countenance should alwayes shine vpon vs except there be in vs constant obedience
but reproofe without disproofe is to hold the hand without mending the heart christ intends the good of his whom he reproues and therefore disproues that which misled them that when they see their errour they may not only forbeare but also be willing so to doe when they see there is good reason why they should
christ then disproues their reason their reason was elias did so therefore why not wee christ telleth them the example is ill applied you know not of what spirit you are
and indeed examples are tickle proofes and conclude nothing except both agree in the same common rule or principle
now that they neuer examined christ therefore telleth them they know not of what spirit they are

the spirit doth often signifie not only the person of god and diuell but also the motions that in vs are wrought by either of them so the first meaning of christs words may bee you doe not obserue who stirreth you to this worke you thinke it is god but it is the deuill
or if you will take the word spirit only for an holy spirit then christs meaning is you doe not consider that euery ones temper must be sutable to his calling elias had one calling you haue another elias was to goe before christ and turne the hearts of fathers to their children that when christ came he might not smite the earth with cursing and he went before in the person of iohn baptist who was a sower man
but they as if christ were

to be elias would haue him to breake forth in fierie wrath
which is the more blameable in them because when christ sent them abroad he willed that if any citie refuse to entertaine them they should only shake off the dust of their feet and leaue the rest of their punishment vnto gods iudgement who will in time handle them worse then the apostles wished for it shall be easier for sodome and gomorra

which perished by fire then for that citie
and could they forget christs sermon which he made on the mount wherein he willed them to loue their enemies to pray for them
the reason whereof is because they know not how soone of wolues they may become sheepe the samaritans whom they would haue consumed with fire were the first strangers that receiued the gospel they were the first in the dayes of christs flesh as appeareth in the storie
iohn
and after christs ascension they were the first likewise as appeares in the acts

it is for god who only knoweth who will conuert and who not to giue such doomes as elias did and till his pleasure is knowne our vocation that are christians especially if we be christian pastors is to incline rather to mercie then to iudgement and because these adostles did not so christ challengeth their zeale of ignorance nescitis cuius spiritus

though the passion came immediately from the heart and so was zelus amarus which saint iames condemnes yet christ blameth their vnderstanding because it did not guide their heart aright wherein hee implyes that they are ill aduised and that they would not haue done it they had better considered of it by which it appeares that estis is taken for esse debetis you are is put for you ought to be for they were not what they should be
that will appeare better in christs more distinct reproofe the sonne of man is not come to destroy but to saue mens liues which words may haue a threefold sense
the first is to distinguish iesus from undefined span alphabet each answereth his name the one destroyeth the other saueth the apostles must not turne the sauiour into a destroyer that is to parallel christ and the the deuill
and this sense is implyed in the word undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet which are coniugates with undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet
a second sense there is wherein this phrase distinguisheth betweene christs first and second comming and sheweth that though undefined span alphabet christ shall come for to destroy when he commeth to iudgement yet undefined span alphabet hee was not alreadie come but to saue therefore they were not to confound these two commings and to doe acts of the later at his first comming when he commeth not only to giue himselfe for men but expects their repentance also

the last sense is an opposition of christ to elias each is to answere his name elias his name signifieth the power of god and indeed all the time of his ministerie what was it but a manifestation of gods wrathfull power in executing vengeance vpon sinners his words his deeds runne all that way but christs name was iesus and iesus is a sauiour god hath not sent his sonne to condemne but to saue the world

and it is a true saying that he came into the world to saue sinners therefore as king dauid answered the sonnes of zeruia when they would haue had him slay shimei

because he cursed the lords anointed what haue to doe with you yee sonnes of zeruia that yee should this day bee vnto me as satan shall there any man die this day in israel so doth christ coole his apostles and shew that their desire must be correspondent to the end of his incarnation
yea the very phrase filius hominis imports a tendernesse in christ

saint paul obserues it in the hebrewes he became man that he might be a mercifull high priest
and this sweetnesse of his nature and mildnesse of his spirit was signified both by the title of a lambe which was giuen him at his death and the shape of a doue which lighted on him at his baptisme

and indeed what likelihood that hee would burne a towne of the samaritans for not receiuing him that prayed for hierusalem euen when the iewes were readie to crucifie him yea father forgiue them was his reuenge when they scoffed him hanging on the crosse
christ that came to saue all sorts of people was pleased to suffer wrong of them all that so none should thinke they deserued better then other
there were then but three sorts of people in the world two extremes iewes and gentiles and one composed of them both samaritans the iewes and gentiles euill intreated him at hierusalem the samaritans vpon his way thither christ was bitter to none of them but let them all haue proofe of the meeknesse of his spirit though his disciples were not so
peter was busie with his sword at hierusalem and iames and iohn are desirous to haue fire at samaria
but as at hierusalem hee shewed peter so here at samaria hee sheweth iames and iohn the errour of their zeale and learneth them this lesson which nazianzene hath in his tetrasticks undefined span alphabet

most sweet is this assertion of christ and it is the chiefest comfort of our soules for if thou lord marke what is done amisse lord who shall abide it surely if our master were as apt to smite as his seruants

our lord as his ambassadours if christs anathemaes were as quicke as mens what would become of the world what combustions what destruction should we see but god bethanked it is not so
and wee shall doe well to learne of him especially pastors must learne to be like the great shepheard of our soules

christ doth not only disproue in words but in deeds also they went vnto another village hee taught his disciples before so to doe if they persecute you in one citie flie to another the precept wrought not

he giueth them a patterne facile est verbis philosophari doce me vitae tuae exemplo for as nazianzene undefined span alphabet

and indeed whereas christ was not ignorant before hee sent how the samaritans would vse him yet was hee pleased to haue a repulse that he might teach his disciples how to beare it for christs life no lesse then his doctrine was a gospel and hee instructed no lesse by his deeds then he did by his words and he taught no lesson more then he did patience

but haue stood long enough in opening the meaning of this text let me come now to the principall vse which intend to make of it which is twofold the first is to ground thereon a good resolution of conscience
the second to stirre vs vp vnto thankfulnesse for our wonderfull deliue rance

for the case of conscience we must obserue that generous minds vndertake not detestable facts except their conscience first be poysoned
secondly that the diuell is not contented that we sinne in passion for so in cold bloud wee might retract and take a better course hee desireth therefore that we may be wicked habitually so he shall be sure to haue vs his at all times and that wee will neuer sticke at the most hellish attempts
for if the conscience be once so seasoned that it will take euill for good and good for euill the angell of darknesse rule therein transformed into an angell of light this false light will so possesse our vnderstanding that the most hellish darknesse of our affections shall neuer be discerned by vs yea the worse wee are the better wee shall please our selues for euery man resteth secure in the testimonie of his owne conscience and he questioneth no farther then to resolue that
the gunpowder traitors before they were deliuerered of that monster had scruples whether it were lawfull
they consult their ghostly fathers for it is a common rule histiaeus vestem consuit quam induit aristagoras as the persian in herodotus speaketh of the samianes reuolt no treacherie without a priests head who worketh notwithstanding by other mens hands they are put out of all doubt that such attempts are so farre from being sinfull that they are meritorious
if any man doubt that this is their doctrine let him reade either bellarmine or suarez or which is more authenticall bulla coenae domini and he shall see in what state they hold all that come within the compasse of their censure
to trie the vprightnesse of this censure haue chosen this storie wherein you shall haue christ himselfe sit iudge and guiding our conscience in conceiuing of this case aright
in the reuenge you may see the traytors passion but with remarkable difference but in the censure the sophistrie of their ghostly fathers which resolue them of the lawfulnesse of such reuenge
and although the storie may seeme lesse pertinent because herein they which afflict are good and they euill that are afflicted yet indeed the argument holds more strongly for if it be not lawfull for the good in this case to persecute the bad much lesse it is lawfull for the bad to persecute the good if iames and iohn that were pillers of the church no lesse then saint peter are disliked for desiring such vengeance against the samaritans that were otherwise execrable people much lesse may samaritans desire it against iames and iohn

let vs then suppose that these traytors were as catholike as christ and his apostles and wee as hereticall as the samaritans you see christs carriage in this case whereby you may apprehend his iudgement of this treason hee would not allow a prayer for fire would

he then allow the consumption it selfe he would not allow fire from heauen and would he allow fire from hell he would not allow oculum charitatis perturbatum passionate reuenge or reuenge in hot blood and would hee allow oculum charitatis extinctum aduised hatred and reuenge in cold blood hee would not allow it in iames and iohn whom he dearely loued and would he allow it in iesuits in rebels persons hatefull to god and men he would not allow it against samaritans and would he allow it against professors of his truth it cannot be doubted he would not allow it

and now must briefly let you see that papists are most like vnto samaritans though they would fasten that infamy vpon vs two things obserued in the samaritans first that their temple was but of a later edition much yonger then that of ierusalem and built without any lawfull warrant and yet notwithstanding they did countenance it with the names of greatest antiquity and what doe papists offer to the church but new deuices many hundred yeares yonger then the truth and yet would they out face the world that they haue their originall from christ and the apostles their pedigree is as true as was the samaritans

as for our church this is our comfort that though we are not matches for christ and his apostles yet wee professe our selues their followers and for the truth thereof refetre our selues vnto their writings by which onely we desire to be tried
and yet these samaritans deadly hate vs that are orthodoxe but blame our doctrine as they that haue weake eyes or deafe eares accuse the of darknesse

or musicke of vntunablenes undefined span alphabet
and if they could be contented to call for fire from heauen we are contented to indure it god we desire may be iudge betweene vs and if in dislike of our doctrine he will send a fire we refuse it not though it consume vs
but they dare not trust god they will trust themselues and not expecting helpe from aboue they will seeke it from beneath
and yet it is markeable that whereas they boast of miracles and the wonders of their saints that make the blinde to see the deafe to heare the lame to goe and dead to reuiue as their legends tell vs yet of all their saints not one euer would worke a miracle to destroy vs heretickes heere they leaue their idolaters to doe what they can forge and performe by their hellish heads and hearts whereof wee haue had many woefull experiments

the traitors as iulian comparable to aetna
but let them take heed the same god that hath here reprooued iames and iohn will not spare for to censure them hee hath done it in our eyes by bringing to light and that strangely what they thought hidden only in the depth of their owne hearts and hath turned their mischiefe vpon their owne pates
and that the rather because their guides abuse his name and calling themselues iesuites are plainly undefined span alphabet
they are a snare on mizpah hosea

gaue themselues that name euen as the iesuites haue giuen themselues theirs and both vpon the like pretence of maintayning their country their liberty learning discipline and what not that was good whereas notwithstanding the same author obserues that neuer were there worse miscreants in a city and that did more contrary to that which they profest he obserues also their end that by gods iust iudgement they were brought to as great extremity and tortured with as manifold misery as may befall wicked men
will not prognosticate only wish them grace that tread their steps to take heede of their ends which is rather to be wished them to be hoped for so little remorse appeared in them vpon the detection of so foule a fact
king dauid when he had rashly vowed the vtter destruction of nabal and his family and that in a case to this for denying entertainment when he was pacified by abigail and his passion ouerpast thus recalled himself blessed be the lord god of israel that hath sent thee vnto me blessed be thou that hast stayd me from shedding innocent blood and reuenging my selfe with mine owne hands
and these apostles when christ she wed his dislike werequiet went vnto another towne sparkles of grace which shew that the eye of their charity was not extinct though it were troubled and that though they were mooued beyond measure yet they could come vnto themselues againe
and indeede it is a rule that the longer a good man pauseth vpon his sin the greater it seemes vnto him because the mist of concupiscence that blinded his eyes is more and more dispelled and the more he seeth the more he sorroweth for his sorrow for sin is proportionable to his sight thereof
but in the wicked it is cleane contrary an vnexpected calamity them in their sinne may haply open their eyes and they may haue a glimmering sight thereof and make pharaoh's or simon magus his confession confesse the sinne but no sooner is the calamity but their lethargy casts them into a dead sleepe againe

some of these traytors were so dead in their sinne that they awakened not at all and of those that did the sense was quickly gone
certainely their aduocates that now apologize for them extenuating the sinne of the actors and excusing by the seale of confession the aduisers shew how little grace there is in that sect how vnlikely they are vnto king dauid and vnto iames and iohn
howsoeuer they did let vs be of the old patriarke iacobs minde and say of them as he sayd of his sonnes simeon and leui they were brethren in iniquity my glory enter not into their secret and my honour be thou not vnited to their assembly let vs not auenge our selues but giue place vnto wrath knowing that vengeance belongeth vnto god and hee will repay but if wee haue bitter zeale let vs not boast wee lie against the truth as saint iames speaketh
hoc nomine ijs quibus iniurias accepimus sublimiores simus ostendamus quid illos daemones doceant quid christus nos erudiat
in a word

let euery man be slow to wrath seeing the wrath of man doth not accomplish the righteousnes of god
and thus much of the case of conscience

a second vse that we should all make of this storie thus applied is to be stirred vp hereby vnto heartie thankfulnesse for our deliuerance
if wee did congratulate our first restitution to the gospel by queene elizabeth how must we also our continuation thereof and preseruation therein in the dayes of king iames that hee hath not suffered the destroyer to haue his will against vs he hath saued our soules and saued our bodies the destroyer aimed at the ruine of both
their first intent was to make vs drinke of their golden cup of poyson to make vs fall downe and worship their idoll but not speeding of that because it pleased god to continue our soueraigne a constant defender of the truth they attemped a second ruine the ruine of our bodies
but iesus hath saued vs from both he hath saued vs from being corrupted with their heresies he hath saued vs from being destroyed by their malice
so that wee may say blessed be the lord which hath not giuiug vs as a prey vnto their teeth
wee can neuer more feelingly receiue the eucharist then vpon this occasion there is present our iesus he inuiteth vs to partake of him and wee that haue seene let vs also taste how good the lord is and praise him because wee finde that all are so blest that put their trust in him end

the summe of all is
the church is subiect to the crosse and christians must looke to suffer and must not be ashamed to suffer for christ but in suffering they must remember not to recompence euill for euill but to ouercome euill with good so did christ so must christians both in word and deed
lord that by thy words and by thy deeds hast taught vs to spend the heate of our zeale in the constant profession of thy truth not in the bloody persecution of our foes giue vs grace to possesse our soules in patience and let the bloud of our deadliest enemies be precious in our sight so shall we beare the character not of the destroyer but of the deliuerer and hauing happily escaped all plots of our destruction in thy house with songs of prayse blesse thee iesu the only constant author no lesse of our temporall then of our eternall saluation

a sermon preached at st andrewes in welles one doing penance for jncest
epigraph

psalme
verse
these things hast thou done and kept silence thou thoughtest that was altogether such a one as thy selfe but will reproue thee and set them in order before thine eyes

the argument of this psalme is an heauenly assises whereof we haue here the apparance and the indictment the apparance made at it and the indictment read in it
the apparance is great whether we respect the iudge or the iudged the iudge god the iudged the church of the iewes both are set forth god in maiesty whether you respect his owne person or attendants the church with her prerogatiues as she is consecrated to god and hath couenanted with him and the conclusion is that this church notwithstanding yea the rather for her prerogatiues shall be arraigned before that iudge
but what is her arraignment surely the transgression of the law so much of the law as containeth gods seruice for this she shall be arraigned and receiue iudgement also as we are taught in my text

in my text then we are to obserue two things first how farre the iewes are guiltie
secondly how god proceedeth against them
how farre they are guilty appeares in the first words these things which are relatiue and repeat the enormous sinnes that are distinctly specified in the words that goe before
for these sinnes god proceeds against them after much patience which the iewes abused vnto such vengance as against which they shall haue nothing to except
gods patience is gathered out of his silence held my tongue the iewes abuse hereof god testifieth to their face thou thoughtest that am altogether such a one as thou art
this abuse is insufferable therefore god threatneth vengance will reproue thee such vengance as against which they shall not be able to except will set thy sinnes in order before thine eyes

you haue heard the substance of these words which must now enlarge and apply as this present occasion doth require
the first point then is the indictment which sheweth how farre the iewes were guiltie it is expressed in the first words these things hast thou done whereof euerie one is remarkable
these things are relative words and repeat the challenge that is made vnto the iewes in sundry former verses the summe whereof is that they were guiltie of transgressing the law
the law so farre as we haue to doe with it is partly ceremoniall and partly morall within these two is concluded the seruice of god
the ceremoniall cherisheth the morall and the morall quickneth the ceremoniall yea the ceremoniall is a sensible description of the morall and the morall is a discreet limitation of the ceremoniall when they goe together they worke both a sincere and a sober seruice of god sober in regard of the ceremonie sincere in regard of the moralitie
but we must marke that the ceremoniall and the morall law differ as the soule and body of man the body is of small vse if it be seuered from the soule so is the ceremoniall law if it be seuered from the morall
secondly the body is inferiour to the soule euen so is the ceremoniall law inferiour to the morall so that if it be a fault to neglect the ceremoniall it is a much greater to breake the morall law

lo then the indictment stands vpon two branches a seperation and a transgression a seperation of the ceremoniall law from the morall and which is worse a manifold transgression of the morall with these two sinnes god chargeth the iewes
both are great sinnes the seperation is for god in his seruice commanded that our soules should concurre with our bodies that our affections should speake vnto him as well as our tongue that we should bow before him the knees of our hearts no lesse then the knees of our bodies when we lift vp our hands vnto god we should lift vp our soules also and our eyes should not behold heauen but our faith should pierce vnto the throne of god
finally there is no ceremoniall law which should not attend some morall as the shadow doth the body or the body should the soule

the sonne of syrach hath made a whole chapter that teacheth this lesson
but the iewes put a sunder what god had conioyned

they shewed much zeale for the ceremoniall but were carelesse of the morall law expressed much submission of their bodyes but little deuotion of their soules and drew neere with their lips but their hearts were farre from god
of this god complaineth esay
and doth passionately vary tearmes to expresse his dislike thereof they solemnized their feasts and offered sacrifices and assembled themselues in his house

but what saith god to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices who required your presence to tread in my courts hate your solemne feasts
the cause of all is your hands are full of blood
in the last of esay god is much sharper he that killeth an oxe is as if he slew a man

he that sacrificeth a lambe as if he cut off a dogs necke he that offereth an oblation is as if he offered swines blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol
marke the reason they haue chosen their owne wayes and their soule delighted in their owne abominations

you see then that in seruing god we may offend him grieuously if we seuer those things which he hath coupled for our seruice then will be plaine hypocrisie and hypocrifie is by a prouerbe noted to be double iniquitie
and iustly is it so noted for therein we do first interpretatiuè deny that god is the searcher of the heart in that we doe not approue our heart to him
secondly we doe expresly preferre the diuell before god in that we giue the better part meane our soule to the diuell and reserue onely the worser part that is our bodyes for god
this should all that present themselues in gods house seriously thinke on especially you that make shew of a solemne penitent but such a shew as betrayeth that there is no broken heart within you nor contrite spirit seeing there appeareth so little euidence thereof in the outward man
be you assured that so repenting for sinne you doe but add vnto your sinne you are a transgressor of the law in regard of your separation of the ceremoniall from the morall law
but there is an other transgression of the law which is the direct and immediate violation of the morall part thereof this is the greater sinne and doth more apparently deserue such a name for the former though it be a sinne yet it is a cloaked sinne it maketh some faire shew in the eyes of men how vgly soeuer it is in the eyes of god but this walketh vnmasked and appeareth as it is
secondly the former is malum quia prohibitum euill vpon no other ground but because by a positiue law it is forbidden it is onely extrinsically euil the other is prohibitum quia malum by no meanes to be done though there were no positiue law that did forbid it the euill thereof is intrinsicall for it is the violation of the image of god according to which man was made and according to which he should liue

in the particular case that concernes this penitent god that gaue a rationall facultie vnto the soule of man whereby he should order the sensitiue in the vse thereof would haue a man shew himselfe to be better then a beast and how doth a man differ from a beast that hath

vnbridled lusts and neglect not onely sacred wedlocke but the degrees of affinitie and consanguinitie within which god and nature require that his lusts be stinted this should you that are the penetent seriously thinke on and measure the grieuousnesse of your sinne by this these things as well the transgression of the morall as the seperation thereof from the ceremoniall

but the grieuousnesse of sinne is argued not only from what is done but also from the doing of the same
aliud est peccare aliud peccatum facere saith st avgvstine it is one thing to sinne another thing to be giuen ouer to sinne and his distinction is not idle for it is grounded not onely vpon st iohns phrase

but also vpon st iames his gradation men are first inticed by their lusts

then lust conceaueth and brings forth sinne and sinne being perfected brings forth death and this perfecting of sinne is properly the doing of sinne all men sinne but they that haue grace take heed of doing sinne feare and shame are both shaken off by those that goe so farre they endeauour not so much as to hide their sinnes
of these iewes our psalme saith they sate they spake they ran they wrought euill they consented one with another and were professors of a wicked life
and little better is the case of this penitent who for many yeeres hath openly in the eyes of the world notwithstanding the clamor of many that iustly did detest it liued in abominable incest which doth much aggrauate his sinne

there is a third aggrauation in my text taken from the person that doth commit the sinne thou hast done these things and the circumstance of the person doth much improue the foulenesse of a fault
no man should sinne against god but they that are most bound should forbeare most
now the iewes had a double obligation one by nature the other by the couenant they were gods creatures and god vouchsafed to contract with them
not to performe the dutie which we owe especially when we haue solemnly vowed it maketh vs guiltie in a high degree
and euerie one within the church if he doe sinne is so farre guiltie his vow in baptisme will presse him no lesse then the condition of his nature
and this must you that are the penitent ponder in your soule that you may answerably hereunto feele the burden of your sinne

doe not amplifie these things without cause they must be the rather marked because the deeper the iewe was in guilt the greater was gods patience
notwithstanding their double offence their seperation and transgression their double obligation of nature and vow their double sinning in that they did not onely act but professe sin yet did god hold his peace he proceeded not against them but with great patience
gods patience is noted by his silence the word signifieth to be deafe and dumbe and putteth vs in mind of a double voyce a voyce of sinne and a voyce of iudgement
that sinnes haue a voyce you may read gen
where abels blood doth cry and in the storie of sodome

the voyce of whose sin came vp to heauen in habakkvk the stones and timber of the king of babylons house built with blood

doe cry finally

in st iames the wages of the hireling kept from him doe cry and come into the eares of the lord of hosts

and as sinnes so iudgements haue a voyce micah hath a notable place the voice of the lord cryeth vnto the citie the man of wisdome will see thy name heare ye the rod and who hath appointed it and the lord is sayd to make his iudgement to be heard from heauen
when then god saith was deafe and dumbe he meaneth that though the cry of the sin were loud yet he did not heare it he was deafe neither did they heare from him though there was iust cause he was dumbe in these two points stands the patience of god

we learne that when we are free from plagues we must not conclude that we are without sinnes crying sinnes the cause of our peace is often times not our owne innocencie but gods patience it is not because our sinnes hold their tongues but gods iudgments hold theirs notwithstanding our guilt he is silent
and here appeareth a great difference between god and men men are as soone moued as they are prouoked few can hold their hands scarce any their tongues so sensible are we of wrongs and so reuengefull according to our power not so god it is one of the characters of his nature to be long suffering euen when he is grieuously offended he can hold his tongue not onely his hands
behold an euidence hereof in this penitent whose incestuous life god hath forborne so many yeeres though he might haue rewarded him according to his deserts when he first fell into this foule offence yet hath god lent him many yeeres and expected his repentance

but what vse doe men make of gods patience surely the iewes did but verifie the old saying veterem ferendo iniuriam inuit as nouam the more god forbeares the worse we waxe god holds his peace that we might speake is deafe that we might heare

but enormous sinners make vse of neither they abuse the patience and long suffering of god and like iesabel though god giue space to repent they repent not

we should heare our sinnes that god might not heare them we should heare them speaking to the eare of our consciences whereinto if they did enter they would not ascend higher into the eares of god
and seeing god is dumbe that we might speake we should speake to god by repentance and then god would not speake vnto vs by vengance according to that of the apostle

if we did iudge our selues we should not be iudged of the lord

but what doth the iewe he grosly abuseth this patience of god in stead of so hearing and speaking he thinketh that god is like vnto himselfe
behold the world turned vpside downe
god made man after his owne image and see man would faine square god after his image whereas the creature should resemble the creator the creator is drawne to resemble the creature
an absurd conceit is it in reason how much more in religion when undefined span alphabet is turned into undefined span alphabet the patterne into the exemplification but yet might it be excused if so be man were vnderstood as he was made of god for we vse in diuinitie

out of the obseruation which we make in the nature of man to draw descriptions of the nature of god because whatsoeuer is in the effect is but much more emminently in the efficient so we talke of the truth the righteousnesse and holinesse of god guessing at them by those sparkes of vertue which appeare in man
but the conceit of these men is not so good for thus must the words be knit thou thoughtest that was like vnto thee which hast done these things and such a thee is a sinfull thee so that god is not onely resembled vnto man but vnto a sinfull man outragious blasphemie it was a great sinne which adam committed when he affected to be like vnto god though it were in an holy attribute the attribute of his knowledge how fearefull a sin then is it not onely to debase god to be like vnto men but also to be like vnto him in a hellish attribute the attribute of sinne
there are three steps of atheisme

it begins with tush god doth not see and is there vnderstanding in the highest it goeth on to tush god doth not care scilicet is superis labor est ea cura quietos solicitat the lord will doe neither good nor euill as the prophet speaketh
it commeth at length to we account the proud blessed

and they that tempt god are exalted
of these atheists the first turne god into an idol giuing him eyes that see not and eares that heare not
the second make him an idle or carelesse god as if he did onely looke on and leaue euerie man to shift for himselfe
the last doe plainly turne god into the diuel for their blasphemie is not onely priuatiue denying god to be what indeed he is but also positiue fastning vpon god what is cleane opposite to his nature so that it is not without cause that our vulgar english hath thou thoughtest wickedly for it is a most wicked thought

we must then take heed how we entertaine sinne seeing we shall grow worse and worse by degrees
there are inborne principles of honestie and pietie which are sensibly felt when we first fall to sinne the further we goe the lesse are they felt and when we grow senslesse of them then fall we to apologize for sin and there can be no stronger apologie then to make god our consort for it is a principle stampt in our nature that god is the soueraigne good whatsoeuer then is either from him or in him must needs be good so that if a wicked man can make god either the author or patterne of his sinne he need no sayrer colour nor stronger argument wherewith to resolue either himselfe or others that bitter is sweet darknesse light death life and good euill
and the diuel knoweth that we will sinne securely when we are resolued that by sinne we doe god good seruice he that reads the stories of the heathen gods shall find that one of the greatest prouocations that the world hath had vnto sinne hath beene the worship of such gods as their owne poets describe theirs to be stained with all kind of sinnes
the fathers that wrot against them ivstin martyr clemens alexandrinvs evsebivs lactantins arnobivs and saint avstin insist much vpon this point when they defend christian religion against the gentile
and who can tell whether god in this place doth not taxe such gentilisme in the iew and intimate that their idolatry

was a cause of their impuritie for it is plaine in the prophets that they worshipped idols of all nations you may read enough in the life of solomon to iustifie this point

but this was not the sinne onely of the old testament it quickly entred vpon the new no sooner had the apostles planted the christian faith but impure heretickes poysoned the religion at the root and by wicked notions of god and goodnesse seduced many simple ones vnto all dissolutenesse of life as we read in irenie and epiphanivs
yea no sooner was the gospel restored in these latter dayes but anabaptists and libertines trod the very same steps and turned heauen into hell and god into the diuell
as for our selues beloued our positions are sound and good but our conuersation should be answerable otherwise the apostle will tell vs that we denie god euen when we professe him deny him in deeds when we professe him in word yea whereas gods image is not verball but reall if we will goe for gods children and doe the workes of the diuel how farre are we from this sinne of the iewes you that are the penitent should especially lay this to your heart for this brings your sinne vnto his heighth and if you thinke how prophane it is to beare our incest with periurie you may haue grace to acknowledge your guilt guilt of supposing god to be like vnto your selfe for such doing can hardly goe without such thinking especially if a man continue long therein
when a sinner is come to this passe god can hold no longer he ceaseth his patience which the iewes abuse and proceedeth to vengance against which they cannot except
he that toucheth god in his wisedome as doth the first kind of atheist toucheth him neare but god beares it
he that toucheth him in his prouidence as doth the second kind of atheist toucheth him nearer yet can god endure that also
but he that toucheth him in his holinesse as doth the third kind of atheist toucheth him nearest his wrath for such a touch must needs breake out
as the will is the supremest facultie of the reasonable soule so holinesse the perfection of the will is the chiefest of vertues therefore man should be certainly god is most tender of it if any impeach that he will certainly reproue them

reprofe is either verball or reall god reproues verbally or in word by his ministers of that we heare as often as we heare from them the doome of sinne for it is praeiudicium ante iudicium they tell vs what we are and how we shall faire and god will make good their words when he entreth into iudgement
but when we are not the better for the verball then god commeth to the reall

and then we shall find that dei dicere is facere the voyce of the lord is a glorious voyce mightie in operation it breaketh the cedars of libanus

and diuideth betweene the sinnewes and the marrow it not onely rips a man vp to the verie heart root but is able to crush him all to pieces king david describeth the effects of it psal
when thou lord with rebukes doest chasten man for sinne thou as a moath makest his beautie to consume this he

vttereth more at large in the psalme yea read all the psalmes that are penitentiall and you shall find vpon the rebuke of god what a comfortlesse soule what a healthlesse body king david had
and if the children of god feele such effects at gods rebuke which notwithstanding haue euer some sparkes of comfort how doth it crush nay grind forlorne wicked ones if the voyce of sion the rod of a man the correction of a father be so terrible that david cryeth out lord rebuke me not in thine anger

neither chasten me in thy heauy displeasure how dreadfull is the voyce of sina the iron rod the destructiue wrath of god to whom shall wretched man flye what shelter shall he take there is no vmpier to qualifie the doome nor any defender to beare off the stroake certainly it is a fearefull thing so to fall into the hands of the liuing god
you that are the penitent are yet but vnder the verball you are not come to the reall reproofe happy shall you be if you make so good vse of this as to preuent that but be sure that the neglect of correction doth vndoubtedly prognosticate destruction to a sinner such destruction as shall not onely be iust but also take away whatsoeuer exception for god will set mans sinnes before his eyes

the hebrew hath nothing but will order or marshall before thy face the septuagint supply out of the first clause these things hast thou done undefined span alphabet thy sinnes st hierome out of the second clause thou thoughtest me like vnto thy selfe supplyes thy selfe proponam tibi te will set thee before thy selfe they are easily reconciled for the person is vnderstood in regard of his sin so that thee and thine iniquitie is all one
in professed wicked men there is not the distinction that is in the regenerate of ego

peccatum the old and the new man such a one is not a double but a single man

but to come to the point the word ordering or marshalling doth giue vs to vnderstand that we delight in doing of sinne but not in beholding of it behold we can the seeming profit and pleasure that doth accompanie it but the breach of the law or wound of our soule we endure not to behold because there is pleasure in the act and remorse in the remembrance thereof but what we cast behind vs god will set before vs

the word marshalling importeth two things first that the sinnes are many but confused so that we doe not discerne either the great number or the vnequall measure of them whereupon it followeth that we cannot iudge either how grieuous or how vgly they are but god will so dispose them that we shall take notice of euerie one and euerie one according to his pitch
good things well digested are the better discerned and yeeld the more content and euill things displayed will the more vndeniably conuict vs of folly and more vncomfortably distresse vs with our want of grace these two conuiction and confusion doe necessarily accompanie the marshalling of our sinnes and if one sinne of murder wrought so vpon cain one sinne of treason vpon ivdas that the one could not rest the other hanged himselfe

in what case thinke we shall the wicked be when god shall set all their sinnes before them

it is good then for men to vnburden themselues as neare as they can of all sinne seeing there is so much euill in the sight of any one sinne and we cannot auoid the fight of any especially if it be such as this penitents sinne an enormous sinne and a crying sinne
see it therefore now and let repentant teares wash out the characters thereof least remaining of record you be forced to see it when there will be no meanes of blotting it out

a second thing that this word imports is that the sinnes which we entertaine for friends shall suddenly turne to be our foes they shall appeare as an army furnished with the instruments of death so we learne of st peter brethren beseech you

as strangers and pilgrimes abstaine from fleshly lusts which fight against the soule
we thinke that by them we sight against god but god is impenitrable the arrowes that we shoot rebound backe and wound our selues
and no maruell for sinne is the sting of death and we cannot commit sinne but we receine that sting and when god shall come against vs as against and call who is on my side who our owne sinnes

as her eunuches shall stand out and at his command cast vs downe to be trampled vnder feet and to be made meat for dogges to be insulted vpon by the fiends of hell and to be gnawne on by death

but where shall this martialling be surely in our owne bosome in our owne conscience that shall then be a true and a cleare glasse representing our sinnes and representing them armed against vs
and this shall adde much to our miserie it shall not be then with vs as it is in this world here we behold our naturall face in a glasse

and by and by goe away and forget what manner of person we were but this glasse shall still be before vs and our eye shall still be on it
and why it is nothing but the worme that neuer dyeth we can no more be rid of it then we can be rid of our soule the conscience is an essentiall power of the soule and this worme by an irreuocable decree is made a perpetuall companion of a guiltie conscience the wicked shall carrie it with them from the and shall keepe it with them so long as they shall burne in the flames of hell

this is a powerfull motiue and should worke in you that are guiltie a care to disarme so powerfull an enemie to plucke out the sting before the wound be vncurable so many sinnes as remaine vnrepented of are as so many treacherous souldiers howsoeuer they doe now speake friendly to you yet when they are least feared they will giue deadly strokes you shall feare them when you shall haue no remedy against them

what say to you say vnto all nay god himselfe saith it in the close of this psalme heare this all ye that forget god iewes and gentiles whatsoeuer you be if you be adulterers drunkards vsurers blasphemers any way wicked liuers consider this saith god least suddenly take you away and there be none to helpe you for if we be guiltie of such

sinnes and encourage our selues in them by base conceipts of god god will not faile to reproue vs and marshall such wickednesse before vs to conuict vs thereof and confound vs therewith

god giue vs all timely repentance that we may preuent so fearefull a vengance

verse
brethren if a man be ouertaken in a fault you which are spirituall restore such a one in the spirit of meekenesse considering thy selfe lest thou also be tempted

we are all compounded of the old and new man and euerie one feeles the solicitations of both
these solicitations exercise both our head and our heart our head to discerne betweene them our heart to make a good choyce vpon a right iudgement
and that we make such a choyce it should appeare in our works they should argue the death of concupiscence and the life of grace in that we beare fruit not to the flesh but to the spirit
now the fruit of the spirit is either pietie or charitie it testifieth that our selues are carefull to be good and being good we are not vnrespectiue of others
not of them that are good for it keeps vs from being ambitiously insolent not of them that are bad for it makes vs compassionately mercifull
the exercise of this last branch of charitie the opening of our tender bowels towards such as offend is the argument of these words which haue now read vnto you

here we haue offendors described and compassion enioyned offendors not of all sorts but such as ought to be the subiect of compassion offendors that are ouertaken in a fault we are enioyned to shew compassion

to these to restore them in the spirit of meekenesse
and touching this compassion we are moreouer taught first who must shew it and secondly what must moue them therunto
they that must shew it are here called brethren and spirituall each name importeth a reference they haue vnto the offendor the first a reference of their persons they are their allies and therefore may not shut their bowels against them the second of their guifts the better they are the more good they must doe such are the persons that must shew compassion
and they must be moued thereunto out of an apprehension of the common danger danger is common to all thou mayst likewise be tempted and no man must be vnobseruant hereof he must consider his owne selfe
so haue you the contents of this text which meane now farther to enlarge as this spectacle doth occasion and shall be most behoofefull for vs all

begin first at the description that is here made of an offendor where you shall see first his fault and then the cause thereof
the fault is undefined span alphabet a fall a fall taken by stumbling
the fall is not corporall but morall yet by a corporall you may vnderstand a morall fall for he that falleth in regard of the sight of his body commeth lower and withall ordinarily taketh a bruise euen so is it in a morall fall god by creation made a man dominum socium
if you looke to this visible world he made him dominum as it appeareth genes

where soueraigntie is giuen ouer the beasts birds fishes and euerie other creature made for the vse of man
but if you looke to the inuisible world then was he to be socius a confort with the angels in the blessed state of heauen
yea in this microcosme the fabricke of the nature of man which is as it were an epitome of these two other worlds the better part had the guidance of and commanded ouer the worse the soule ruled the body
but so soone as man sinned he came downe domintos became servus and these base creatures began to tyrannize ouer vs who were ordained their lords hence goods meats drinkes and other corruptible things are become idols and we fall downe and worship them and what will not a man doe transported by the vanity of this world as for the societie we had with angels the blessed angels of heauen we haue lost that and are become the serpents brood not onely beasts but also diuels
finally earth hath gotten the vpper hand of heauen the body of the soule and we serue euery one his seuerall lusts so that though we consist of a soule and a body yet the scripture calleth vs carnall as if so be we had no spirits
in our worldly state euerie man laboureth to range himselfe with the best and we account them base that being of noble blood affect not the companie of their equals but in our spirituall state we are not sensible hereof we are not ambitious but base euerie one stoopes below himself and loues to grouell rather then stand vpright we loue comming downe

but this comming downe is not all the euill of our fall it is accompanied with a bruise our nature by it doth not onely become more base

but more feeble also for euerie sinne giueth a wound it impayreth grace in euerie power our vnderstanding groweth more dimme our will more impotent and our affections lesse capable of controwle
sinnes are like rebels that not onely reuolt but also keep castle against their soueraigne whence they are not easily remoued euerie mans experience yeelds profe hereof and warrants this truth that sin doth not onely disgrace but also disable a sinner

but sinnes are not all equall and therefore produce not all equall effects the stoicks paradoxe is long since condemned and whether we looke to that wherein we sinne our dutie to god or our neighbor or that wherewith we sinne meane the degrees of our wills that concurre in our acts we shall find great odds and confesse that one sinne is greater then another and that all fals are not alike whether we look to the disgrace of the person or the weakning of our nature
not to goe from my text or rather from this present occasion incontinencie hath diuers degrees fornication adulterie incest all communicate in incontinencie but so that adulterie is worse then fornication and incest worse then adulterie
fornication violateth the good order that should be betweene single persons through vnruly lusts adulterie addeth thereunto a confusion of families and taketh away the distinction of heires and inheritance but incest moreouer abolisheth the reuerence which is ingraued by nature to forbid that persons whom nature hath made so neere should one vncouer the others shame as speaketh the law and not onely that but adds that for such incontinencie the land did spue out the canaanites

so that when you come to consider your fall you must consider not onely the nature but also the degree of it and your repentance must be answerable vnto your fall looke how farre you haue debased your selfe so farre must you be humbled and be afflicted with sorrow as deeply as you haue wounded your selfe with sinne
thus much you are taught in that your sinne is a fall

but it must farther be learned whence these fals come and we find in the text the occasions and causes of them
the occasions are implyed in the word undefined span alphabet which signifieth a stumbling at some thing that lyeth in our way we are apt to fall by nature because we are mutable but we doe not commonly fall except some occasion be giuen
and the world is full of occasions
the diuell hath euerie where his stumbling blocks he knoweth whether our corrupt nature bendeth and worketh accordingly he hath a wedge of gold for couetous achan a crowne for ambitious aesolon a dina for shechem finally he knoweth what will worke our affections and our dispositions with that he plyeth and with that he wooeth our consent to sinne and these things the scripture cals stumbling blocks and are the occasions of fals
we all walke in the middest of them and are to take good heed vnto them but yet so that we doe not conceiue otherwise of them then they are strong motiues they are but they are but motiues perswade they may compell they cannot therefore they are not enough to giue a fall

except the true cause be added to the occasion and we may not so dwell on the occasion as not to looke forward to the true cause we may otherwise blame others while we should be blaming of our selues and we are too apt to excuse our selues by making others guilty of our faults
but we must passe on from the occasion to the cause and the cause will tell vs who doth most deserue the blame
the cause appeareth in these words if a man be ouertaken whereon st hierome giueth a good note praeuentio dici non potest cum quid praemeditatò fit so that this phrase importeth a difference of sinners whereof some fall through malice some through frailtie
through malice they fall in whom the principles of conscience are corrupt who wittingly and willingly commit sinne with greedinesse neither before the fact feeling any reluctancy neither after the fact conceiuing any sorrow

these account euill good and good euill light darknesse and darknesse light sweet sower and sower sweet these are not within the compasse of my text for they are not ouertaken
this phrase reacheth onely those which sinne dum aut latet veritas aut compellit infirmitas as bede speaketh either they are sophistically circumuented or vnawares transported and so take a fall
we should weigh the validitie of the perswasions and bethinke our selues what we doe before we set our selues a doing we should enquire what gods law doth forbid or allow before we giue or withhold our assent
but our affections vsually outstep our discretion and bring either false or rash intelligence whereupon we yeeld and slip verie often dum latet veritas for want of making diligentenquirie but more often dum vincit infirmitas while we are too indulgent to our affections
and indeed howsoeuer in errors of faith and mistakes of truth those that are without the church or being within are not orthodoxe

become vaine in their ratiocination as the apostle speeketh and their ignorance is apparantly the child of negligence
yet in the default of manners and breach of the morall law we haue little colour of ignorance all the blame lyeth vpon the impotencie of our affections the thiefe the drunkard the lyer the blasphemer all must yeeld that they knew what they should doe but obeyed their corrupt lusts in doing the contrarie
and no other plea hath this incestuous person though her tongue should be silent yet her teares doe speake that this is her plea for the sacrifice of her broken and contrite heart sacrificed for that which she hath done testifieth that she knoweth well that she hath done amisse but did it being ouertaken for sorrow after a fact is the iudgement that the penitent passeth vpon his own fact in weeping for it she doth condemne it
our lesson is that we must be watchfull ouer occasions lest by them we become causes of our owne fall and if we sinne god grant vs grace to sorrow lest otherwise as we displease so we dispise god such despisers are not to be accounted in the number of those that are ouertaken and so they can be no fit obiect for compassion which is the next point of the text

touching which compassion we are here taught that it is a restoring of a penitent in the spirit of meekenesse
meekenesse is undefined span alphabet

and

a meeke man is not undefined span alphabet but undefined span alphabet the apostle doth not forbid anger but commendeth indulgence there is a rod and a spirit of meekenesse that for the impenitent but for the penitent this
and certainly without meekenesse there is little good to be done with penitents for generosus est hominis animus magis ducitur quàm trahitur especially in reformation of the inward man where not so much coaction as perswasion preuaileth therefore if any thing will win the wayward it is meeknesse so thought st ambrosh tolle hominem a contentione audacia et habebis eum subiectum by meeknesse the prince of this world is soonest ouerthrowne undefined span alphabet he is likely to recouer a patient soonest that handleth him gentlest
now if it be so in reclayming of a sinner that meekenesse is so requisite how requisite is it in dealing with a penitent sinner if st bernards practise be commendable in iudging of sinne either to excuse the fact or say the temptation was verie strong how tenderly must we respect the humiliation of a sinner and take heed of a pharisaicall pride which satiateth its owne vncharitablenesse vnder pretext of censure and proceedeth contrarie to gods rule vltra rather then citra condignum with the most when it should be with the least
st pavl did remember and so should we all that we are the seruants of that god which desireth not the death of a sinner members of that saviovr which will not breake a bruised reed nor quench smoaking flaxe finally temples of that holy ghost which is tearmed in my text the spirit of meekenesse and indeed this vertue is a graffe not of nature but of grace and it argueth the spirit dwelleth in vs when such fruit springeth from vs yea our whole soule must become meekenesse and this vertue must take vp euerie power thereof
for such phrases are emphaticall and note not onely the originall but the extent of a vertue it doth argue that the whole inward man should be seasoned with it and concurre to the acting of it

but the spirit of meekenesse must not be seuered from restoring for compassion should not cherish sinne but rectifie a sinner otherwise it is curdelis misericordia it is as if you should take a man that with a fall hath broken a ioynt and lay him downe vpon a soft bed but not take care to set his ioynts this were to leaue him in perpetuall torture or at least a maymed creature the righteous must smite but their stripes must be a precious balme the church must censure but it must be for correction not destruction a sinner must be restored to that from which he is fallen
it is an error long since condemned in the nonatians who thought that the church had no power to restore belieuing penitents to restore them to that state wherein they were before their fall the very words vsed in my text refuteth them which comming from undefined span alphabet signifying compleate and perfect and undefined span alphabet comming from undefined span alphabet nuper sheweth that it signifieth a perfect restitution vnto that which the person was before
the fall did disgrace and disable so the restoring must recouer inwardly and outwardly inwardly in the peace of conscience and new strength to resist sinne outwardly in the communion

of saints and the participation of sacred things and charitable society in the course of life in regard of all these the person must be as if he had neuer fallen

finally this restoring in the spirit of meekenesse must be without respect of persons and without exception of faults so saith the text undefined span alphabet if he be a man that hath fallen
happily we can be contented to shew meekenesse to our kinred our friends not to strangers with whom we haue no such acquaintance
but we must exclude none that may be ouertaken and any may be ouertaken that is a man
saint avstin and other of the fathers worke vpon the name man and shew that implyeth frailtie according to the prouerbe

humanum est errare and indeed the scripture is cleare for it the frame of the imaginations of the heart of man is euill and that from his youth continually

as we may exclude no person so must we except against no sinne if a man be ouertaken undefined span alphabet in any kind of sinne our bowels must not be straighter then christs merits what his blood hath cleansed the church may not hold vnpardonable therefore ouer great austerie was well condemned in the councell of nice which left power in the bishops vpon iust cause to mittigate the penance which was enioyned by canons with great seueritie to the terror of the wicked

you haue heard what compassion must be shewed the text moreouer teacheth who must shew it and vpon what ground
touching the partie that must shew it st hierome hath a good rule on this text homo potest se in voraginem perditionis conijcere non potest sine auxilio se eripere we may cause our owne ruine of our selues but vnto our restitution we need the helpes of others of others amongst whom we must acknowledge an agent and the instruments the chiefe agent is god he onely blotteth out all our offences as himselfe speaketh in esay and it is he that healeth all our infirmities

yet he is pleased to vse means or instruments and they are of two sorts medium impetrationis and medium operationis that is the church offended this is the minister
in publike scandals god ouer and aboue the teares and sighes of the penitent will haue the whole church to mediate and deprecate his wrath and he will haue the minister spondere veniam to promise pardon and absolue in his name so that this text implyeth a power which god hath giuen both the pastor and people inabling each in his order to forgiue sinnes according as we are taught math


but marke here the words whereby these persons are described least they be proud and suppose their compassion to be arbitrarie which they may shew or withhold at their pleasure they are taught the contrarie by their names which testifie that it is necessarie for them to shew compassion
the first name is brethren

this name implyeth an argument of compassion for a man may not turne away his eyes from his owne flesh this is true if he were but a naturall man but the spirituall cognation is greater and therefore bindeth more strongly

by how much we owe more regard to our supernaturall then to our naturall father
adde hereunto that their is no shew no pretence of vncharitablenesse in our supernaturall cognation naturall brethren maligne each the other either because the affection of parents is vnequall or because they shall not haue equall part in the inheritance but god embraceth all his children with the same loue and they are all called to be heires of the same kingdome therefore they should all haue alike tender bowels one towards another
as the name of brethren calleth for compassion so doth the name of spirituall also by spirituall is ment he that is strong in faith and hath not yeelded to temptation he that is led by the spirit and hath not fulfilled the lusts of his flesh the more he is so spirituall the more compassionate he must be

vera iustitia compassionem habet falsa indignationem
it is a shrewd argument that our righteousnesse is pharisaicall and not christian if we rather insult then shew pittie who more spirituall then god then christ then the angels the best of men cannot match the meanest of them in the holines of spirit and yet the angels reioyce at the conuersion of a sinner

and how doth christ the good sheepeheard take comfort in the recouerie of the lost sheepe and as for god you read his disposition in that countenance and cheere wherewith the father receiued his prodigall child
where there is lesse kindnesse there is lesse of the spirit as in the diuell who calumniateth amplyfieth sinnes aggrauateth iudgements and we are too like him if our bowels be crueltie
you see who must shew compassion and read their duties in their names

but if their names will not worke enough the ground that the text addeth inforcing this dutie doth more strongly presse them and the ground is considering thy selfe least thou also be tempted
undefined span alphabet our eies happily are watchfull but are more fixed vpon others then vpon our selues we take delight to pry farre into other mens faults and a pleasing thing it is to flesh and blood to be learned in such arguments
but it is but a propertie of vultures and rauens that quickly sent carrion and hast vnto it the holy ghost here taketh off our eyes from other obiects and fastens them vpon our selues we are the book which our selues should most study we should know none so well as our selues
but when we are brought so farre as to study our selues we study like the pharisee read nothing in our selues but our owne perfections if god hath giuen vs any guifts we need no spectacles to read it the characters are alwayes of the largest sise yea we oftentimes read more then is written and giue thankes to god for that which he hath not bestowed or not bestowed in that measure which we suppose we haue
because of our ouer great docilitie to study this argument the scripture passeth by it and reads vs another lesson the lesson of our infirmities looke we must vpon our selues yea and to our selues also but that which we must behold and heed is least thou also be tempted consider quia homo es habens naturam mutabilem saith theodoret no man in this world is so spirituall but he is also carnall

st hierome with this text censured the heretickes of old and we may censure some that liue at this day who thinke that a righteous man is such a tree as can beare no bad fruit but posse peccare is the portion of euerie mortall man and he that standeth may fall for we all walke in the middest of snares aut sumus aut fuimus aut possumus esse quod haec est euen he that hath ouercome temptation knowes how hard a thing it is to be tempted
and if it be hard then should not we be hard hearted towards them whom it foyleth
which obseruation is not vnnecessarie because our nature is as prone to rigor as it is to sinne we are to haue an eye to both and indeed nothing will make vs sooner auoid the temptation vnto rigor then the acknowledgment that our felues are prone to sinne it is st avstins rule nil sic ad misericordiam inclinat ac proprij periculi cogitatio he that knowes he may need mercie hath a good inducement to shew mercie
wherefore as to the comfort of the penitent may promise her that her teares are undefined span alphabet though she sow in teares

she shall reape inioy so let me aduise you to forgiue and it shall be forgiuen vnto you
he that is mercifull doth good to his owne soule saith solomon

wherefore despise ye not a man returning from his sinne be courteous one towards another and tender hearted forgiuing freely as god for christ sake forgiueth you

st pavl doth teach vs this lesson in this text the text is documentum exemplum the matter of it informeth vs yea the phrase is a good patterne vnto vs in deliuering an argument of mercie he vseth not a word that doth not sauour of mercie
homo noting the pronesse of our nature to sinne undefined span alphabet the occasions of sinne praeoccupatus the surprisall all in fauour of the penitent
and what meaneth the name of brother spirituall the spirit of meeknesse consider thy selfe thou mayst be tempted are they not as water cast vpon the fire of our zeale to temper it if it grow too hot then looke we on the words all call vpon vs that as we are eye witnesses and eare witnesses of this penitents confession contrition so we should let god and the angels see how full we are of compassion compassion that must moue vs all to pray to god for her that god by the power of the keyes may loose her from those bands wherewith her sinne her crying sinne hath tyed her

corinth

verse jt is reported commonly that there is fornication amongst you and such fornication as is not so much as named amongst the gentiles that one should haue his fathers wife
and ye are puffed vp and haue not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from amongst you
for verily as absent in body but present in spirit haue iudged already as though were present against him that hath so done this deed
jn the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ to deliuer such a one to satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saued in the day of the lord jesus

the present occasion led me to this text and this text that haue read vnto you well fitteth the present occasion for we haue to doe with a sinne and a censure euen such a sinne and such a censure as is contained in this text
the sinne is first exprest then it is amplyfied
it is exprest first in regard of the kind it is fornication secondly in regard of the degree that fornication is incest yea it is incest of the worst sort that a man should haue his fathers wife
the incest being so bad it is not onely exprest but also amply fied in respect first of the haynousnesse it was such as was not so much as named amongst the gentiles secondly in respect of the notoriousnesse the fame thereof spread farre and neare it is commonly

reported
now sinnes call for censures great sinnes for seuere censures they doe but the corinthians were deafe they heard not they were not moued with the cry of this sinne though it were verie loud they sinne in not reforming sinne st pavl therefore telleth them whence their sinne sprang and wherein it stood
it sprang from too much they were puffed vp and too little for they sorrowed not from these roots sprang their senslesse carelesnesse they put not away from them the man that had done the sinne
but st pavl had a more quicke eare and a more tender heart as a lawfull superiour he supplieth their negligence and censureth the incestuous person whom they spared as it appeares in the rest of the text wherein we see what the censure was and whereunto it serueth
the censure was excommunication but it is set out in very high termes for it is called a deliuerie vnto satan the words imply more then they expresse
excommunication consists of two parts a priuatiue and a positiue an excommunicate person is excluded from the communion of saints and subiected to the prince of darknesse the latter part is here exprest but the former is presupposed and is therefore omitted because it was mentioned before in the corinthians fault this is the censure which st pavl inflicted
and the inflicting of it is performed by two acts the first is st pavls he doth iudicially pronounce it in his owne person
but here is some thing markable in his person which is said to be absent and present wheresoeuer he was as an apostle he was neuer out of his dioces neither was any of his dioces any where out of his reach for though he was absent in his body yet was he with them in his spirit
vpon these prerogatiues of his person though he were as farre off as ephesus is from corinth yet did he giue sentence against the incestuous corinthian so saith he undefined span alphabet haue already iudged
what he pronounceth iudicially that doth he require the corinthians to denounce solemnly this act is implyed when as st pavl would haue the man excommunicated at corinth he would haue it there denounced that himselfe had excommunicated him
and he would haue it denounced solemnly first in regard of the place for he would haue it done in the face of the church the corinthians being gathered together and his spirit with them
secondly he would haue it done solemnly in regard of the proceeding for he would haue it done with the authoritie and by the efficacie of our lord iesus christ with his authoritie in his name by his efficacie by his power
so that although st pavl haue a hand in this censure and the corinthians also yet would he haue neither of them reputed other then delegates from and instruments of christ he giueth the warrant and he maketh good the censure
lay all these parts of the doome together and you will find that it is tremendum iudicium a very dreadfull sentence for how dreadfull a thing is it for a man to be cast out of the church to haue him that hateth him made lord ouer him meane satan to haue this done by an apostle in the assembly of the whole church authorized by christ and by christ inabled to inflict this censure certainly

this must needs be a most dreadfull iudgment you would thinke him that is vnder it to be a most forlorne wretch
but yet despaire not of him the last clause of my text will tell you that the sentence is not mortall but medicinall
now you know that a medicine hath two properties first it doth paine then it doth ease and if you will beleeue the prouerbe nulla medicinat'am est salutaris quàm quae facit dolorem the more it doth paine the more it will ease
certainly it fareth so with a ghostly medicine it doth paine it serueth for the destruction of the flesh but it will ease thereby the spirit shall be saued
and this saluation you shall then feele when it is most behoofefull in the day of the lord iesus christ
we beleeue that he shall come to iudge both the quicke and the dead and thrice happy may an enormous sinner thinke himselfe if he can haue boldnesse then to stand before the sonne of man
and herein standeth his hope that this iudgment will preserue him from that this lesser from that greater this temporall from that eternall if an enormous sinner make that vse of it which christ intendeth
so that these last words must be marked as a mitigation of that sharpnesse which was in the sentence and a consolation of the true penitent
and so haue you the briefe of my text
that we may all be and this penitent recouered let vs in the feare of god listen to that which shall now be farther but briefly obserued and applyed out of this both sinne and censure

begin with the sinne the kind of it is fornication fornication though it be often vsed to note the vnlawfull coniunction of single persons which otherwise may lawfully marrie yet doth the word import properly the generall nature of all incontinencie or vnlawfull coniunction the sinfulnesse whereof that may the better set before you must first acquaint you with certaine vndeniable principles
the first is that though it be common to man and beast to couple male and female in their seuerall kinds for procreation yet because the body of a man is inhabited by a reasonable soule euen these sensuall acts should be reasonable by participation reason should haue such power ouer the body that a man should not come vnto this coniunction out of a disorderly lust but a regular couenant not aduenturing vpon it but admitted thereunto by marriage he must testifie that he is a man and not a beast
the second principle is the same reason of state that preseribeth proprietie in all other things doth require it especially in the choyce of mates in those which are to come together so neere as to become one flesh for proprietie is the whetstone of loue and care neither of which would be so great as they should be except they were grounded in wedlock in which is a mutual appropriating of the wedded bodyes each to the other whence it is that their loue is so intense and their care so prouident of and for each other and their children
the third principle is wedlocke is not onely such a couenant as springeth from reason and policie but also it is pactum dei it is founded in religion man and woman were at first

matcht by god himselfe and he matcht them as his children bearing his image finally

he matcht them that they might bring forth an holy seed such as might be of his church and as the parents consorts with angels so much did religion adde vnto wedlocke before the fall
but after the fall christian religion added much more whence ariseth a fourth principle by regeneration euen our bodyes are made members of christ and so become temples of the holy ghost and therefore there is great reason we should keepe these vessels of ours in honor and in their coniunction haue a due regard of this their heauenly condition
in these euident principles we may behold how farre god hath improued our bodyes which otherwise were made but of dust and for sinne deserued to become dust againe but we must cloath our flesh and blood with the aduancements of it and by them measure the sinfulnesse of fornication
and then you shall find first that it debaseth the bodyes of men and rangeth them with beasts for wherein is his body better then a beasts whose sensuall acts are not guided by reason secondly it abolisheth the greatest ciuill proprietie that is in a state for wedlocke layeth the foundation of a state and giueth the first beginning to societie undefined span alphabet thirdly it robbeth the fruit of our bodyes as much as lyeth in vs of the best which is to be the holy off spring of holy parents which is the pledge of gods couenant and the childrens hope that they haue a right thereto neither are we excused from this guilt though god in mercie doe otherwise prouide better for our children
finally it renteth vs from the body of christ and dispossesseth vs of the holy ghost if not defacto at least merito it is more of gods mercie then our desert if it proue not so seeing christ abhorres all impuritie and the holy ghost will not abide the desiling of his sanctuarie

well therefore may fornication be called undefined span alphabet a dishonoring lust then which no other heapeth so many indignities vpon our bodyes and by consequence vpon vs
in regard hereof it is that st pavl saith all other sinnes are without our bodyes but he that commits fornication sinneth against his owne body fornication strippeth it of all the prerogatiues directly which no other sinne doth neither is their any carnall sinne more opposite to reason policie religion
this must you the penitent marke and from this take the first measure of your sinne

but my text doth not onely speake of fornication in generall but of a degree thereof and that degree is incest
though no coniunction is lawfull without marriage yet may not all persons be ioyned together in marriage

god hath set downe certaine degrees both of consanguinitie and affinitie betweene which there may be no matches moses giueth the reason because there is a reuerence due vnto these persons and we passe the bownes of religious modestie if we match with them
and indeed had not god imprinted this reuerence the necessarie cohabitation of parents and children brethren and sisters would yeeld too much opportunitie and be too strong an incentiue

vnto this vnlawfull coniunction especially if you adde thereunto the authoritie which parents haue naturally ouer their children

saint avstin yeeldeth another reason habita est rectissima ratio charitatis we naturally loue our kin
but god would haue charitie spread farther which would be kept within verie narrow boundes if we were not by this restraint put to make matches with more remote persons and forbidden to multiply the ground of loue in one the selfe same
but amongst all these degrees which god hath forbidden they are principall which are in the right line the prohibition of them is the most ancient the most strict the most vniuersall first the most ancient for it began immediately vpon the creation of the woman for hauing made a woman to ioyne with the man god gaue this rule therefore shall a man forsake father and mother and be ioyned vnto his wife

it is true that we commonly vnderstand that text of the neere coniunction of man and wife and that sense will well agree with it but the caldy paraphrase addeth to our purpose that a man must forsake his fathers and his mothers bed st avstin and others haue so vnderstood it as if it did forbid matches in the right line and thinke the word therefore doth import as much for therefore did god create a woman to ioyne her to the man because he would not haue them couple which are procreated one from another
secondly it is the most strict prohibition for though god forbid as well the collaterall degrees as those that are in the right line yet hath he dispenced with the collaterall in two cases one of necessitie when there were none but adams children brothers and sisters must needs match and then did god dispence with the first collaterall degree of consanguinitie
the second case is a mysterie if a brother dyed without issue the next of kin was to rayse vp seed vnto the deceased brother and this was a dispensation in the first degree of affinitie
such dispensations in collaterall degrees god hath granted but dispensations with persons in the right line he neuer granted any therefore called it the most strict prohibition
thirdly it is the most vniuersall prohibition for that of collaterall degrees in gods law reacheth but vnto the second the ciuill law goeth a degree farther then gods law the canon law now reacheth to the fourth degree it hath forbidden to the seuenth and further no law that is extant euer went in forbidding collaterall degrees
but in forbidding those in the right line diuine and humane ciuill and canon laws forbid them without any stint no degree be it neuer so remote can make the coniunction of such persons lawfull therefore they say truly that if adam did reuine againe he could ioyne with none of mankind except eve reuiued againe no more could eve except adam reuiued
whatsoeuer you haue heard of consanguinitie is true also of affinitie because by wedlocke man and wife become one flesh and so their parents their children their brethren their sisters are as neere to the one as to the other affinitie maketh them as neere as if they were of one blood

take one rule more which commeth neere this penitents case by analogie it is all one for a sonne to take his fathers wife as the corinthian did and for a father to take his wiues daughter which you the penitent did both couples are alike neere kin and so in true iudgement your case is as his was neither skilleth it that you tooke her not to wife but abused her body onely for if you abuse her body whom you may not take to wife your fact is nothing the lesse incest your marying would haue argued a resolution to continue the incest
you haue committed complicatissimum peccatum a very manifold sinne there is in it fornication you knew her body without mariage adulterie you knew her your wife being liuing incest you knew such a person as you could not match with by any dispensation from man neither from god was there euer any granted
wonder not then that the apostle doth not onely expresse but amplifie also this sinne

the first amplification is in regard of the haynousnesse of it it was not so much as named amongst the gentiles
mistake not the words it is not meant that the gentiles neuer were infected with this sinne in the entrance and close of the of leuit
it appeareth that the aegyptians from whom israel then came and the canaanites whose countrey they were to possesse were foully stayned therewith and thereupon did god take an occasion to lay the prohibition thereof vpon the israelits

that they might not follow the corruption of those gentiles
but saint pavl meaneth that euen such as were but onely gentiles haue out of the light of reason detested and forbidden it which appeareth in their morals lawes and histories the iniquitie thereof being euident not onely out of the law of moses but of nature also otherwise the canaanites could not in equitie haue beene punished for being guiltie of it
and no maruell if the heathen detested it when the verie beasts doe abhorre it

aristotle in his historie of liuing creatures hath written of a camell and a horse which were brought to their dammes but no sooner did they discerne them by falling off of the cloathes which had beene cast vpon them to conceale them but that the camell was presently so enraged that he kild his keeper and the horse left not running vntill he had broken his necke
the phrase of the apostle is remarkable that which was not so much as named amongst the gentiles was done by a christian whereas the rule of pietie is that those sinnes should not be so much as named amongst christians which are done by the gentiles christians should not walke as other gentiles doe because they know god and are brought so neere to god as to be heires by hope of the kingdome of god finally they haue as many tyes layd vpon the lusts of their flesh as they haue prerogatiues vouchsafed to their bodyes whereas the gentiles they know not god theyare aliens from his couenant yea they worship the diuel which is an impure spirit and therefore no such wonder if they be giuen ouer to filthy lusts but

omne animi vitium tanto conspectius in se crimen habet quante maior qui peccat habetur

it is verily a pittifull case when sinne groweth to that heighth in the children of god

as that iuda iustifieth israel and both iustifie sodome when christians become worse then heathens in their liues and conuersations
you that are the penitent take this to heart and measure the burden of your conscience thereby

the second amplification of the sinne is from the notoriousnesse thereof it is commonly reported the sin is so publike that it cannot be coloured that it needeth no proofe all the world taketh notice of it
this is a faire ground of a censure secret sinnes the church doth not iudge it leaueth them to god to mens consciences but notorious sinnes must not escape vnpunished they are ripe for iudgement when their infamie draweth them to light

sinnes in generall are called workes of darknesse but especially the sinnes of incontinencie obserued it and the more foule the incontinencie the more closely vseth it to be carryed and the more it feareth to be discouered
so that for a worke of darknesse to be notorious argueth the impudencie of the sinner

it was that for which god challenged israel they declare their sinne like sodom they hide it not shame and feare are both cast off when sinne hath an harlots forehead
because you the penitent haue committed a grieuous sinne and the cry thereof is come into the eares not of god onely but also of his church it was meet you should be made a penitentiall spectacle meet that your sinne should be not onely exprest but amplyfied also and that in regard of the haynousnesse and notoriousnesse thereof otherwise we should deserue the blame which st pavl layeth vpon the corinthians that did neglect to censure the incestuous person in their church

of their neglect in censuring such an offendor let vs see first the cause and then their fault the cause was first too much they were puft vp instatio is presumptae either innocertiae or scientiae men are puffed vp with a presumption either of their owne holinesse as the pharisee thanke god am not like vnto other men or of their guifts of edification as here the corinthians which you perceiue by former chapters
the first kind of presumption maketh men too forward vnto separation ouerweening of holinesse will bid men stand farther off am more holy then thou but ouerweening of other guifts is ambitious of followers it will beare with all faults so it may be admired
certainly this puffing vp breeds much confusion in the church our owne times testifie
but because that point is not to this penitents case passe it ouer onely giuing this note by the way that none are more proud then they which know themselues least they boast when they haue cause to blush yea and god doth often permit grieuous fals in them or amongst them to take downe such vaine mens pride

this first cause which called bred another cause which called too little fellow feeling they sorrowed not
seldome shall you haue a proud man compassionate he is so taken vp with the contemplation of his owne worth that he doth not heed other mens

cases no wonder therefore if he mourne not
but it beseemes christian pietie to bewayle other mens fals first because of our reference to them they are members of the same body with vs and how should one member not feele the wound which is giuen to another the mysticall body of christ ought not to be worse disposed then is the naturall body of man
secondly because of our danger from them for at least their guilt toucheth vs a murderous hand maketh the whole man goe for a murderer and one wicked member of the church maketh all the church goe for guiltie vntill it haue cleared it selfe as we learne by the expiation of the vnknown murder
thirdly there is a scandall that their sinne bringeth vpon all of their profession gods name is blasphemed by it
and lastly

vengeance by the sinne of one man commeth vpon a whole church one achan troubleth all israel

these considerations should draw teares from euerie mans eyes it should make vs wish with ieremie that our heads were full of waters and our eyes a fountaine of teares

our eyes with davids should gush out with riuers because men keepe not gods lawes
neither should priuate men onely so lament but the whole church also you haue a patterne in the storie of naboth

it was pretended that naboth blasphemed god and the king and thereupon the whole citie proclaimed a fast the like we read esdras and of a publike lamentation for the sinne of some of the people
these reasons and examples must worke in vs and force vs to weep for the grieuous sinne of a brother

we must weepe yet here we must not stop not wèeping was the cause of the fault but it was not the fault of the corinthians their fault was as st pavl telleth them that they did not put away the incestuous person
christians as they must be sorrowfull to see grieuous offendors so must they be zealous for their chastisement if they haue sufficient power and faire proofe otherwise they make the sinne their owne
but if so be the proofe be not full

or they haue no lawfull authoritie to chastife then it is sufficient for them to mourne
shall fall vpon this point againe when come to the censure therefore will say no more of it here
onely must put you that are the penitent in mind that if others must be so sorrowfull for you then must you be sorrowfull for your selfe and you must be as carefull to rid your selfe of sinne as we must be to rid the church of a sinner

but let vs come at length to the censure
st pavl as told you had a more quicke eare and a more feeling heart then the corinthians had he proueth it true which he affirmeth of himselfe who is weake and am not weake who is offended and burne not

yea he seemes to disproue the common prouerbe segnius irritant ammos dimissa per aures quam quae sunt oculis commissa fidelibus for what the corinthians neglected hauing it in their eye with that he was much disquieted though he had notice of it onely by his eare and therefore doth he censure it as appeares in the last part of the text where you shall see what the censure was and whereunto it serued
the censure is

excommunication but it is exprest in verie high and fearfull termes it is called a deliuerie vnto satan
the words imply one thing and expresse another for excommunication consisteth of two parts a priuatiue and a positiue the priuatiue is that which seperateth from the communion of saints and separation presupposeth a former communion
the article of our creed teacheth vs that there is a communion of saints there is an inward and an outward communion inward by faith hope and charitie outward in the participation of sacred things in the visible assembly
from the inward none is separated but by himselfe falling from his faith hope and charitie and so depriuing himselfe of the bond of vnion which is the spirit of god
from the outward none should be separated except he first doth separate himselfe from the inward and doth also manifest that separation to the scandall of others and dishonor of religion the man that goeth so farre in separating himselfe by sinne the chvrch must separate him by censure

we must hate the garment spotted with the flesh
we must not keepe companie we must not eat with those that are inordinate we must not let the world thinke that christianity doth allow of such sinnes
the aduersaries are apt enough to traduce vs without a cause how much more if there be a cause the impurities of old heretickes were layd to the christians in generall and now the anabaptists and familists are made our staines there may be some colour of casting such shame vpon vs if we endure such persons therefore we must put them away from amongst vs they must vndergoe the priuatiue part of excommunication

besides this priuatiue part which is implyed in the censure because mentioned before there is a positiue part which is here exprest it is the deliuerie vnto satan
the phrase hath in it some thing proper to an apostle and some thing common to all bishops
it was proper to the apostles so to deliner vnto satan as that he should haue power ouer the incestuous persons body to torment him and such power the apostles not onely had but executed as appeares in the stories of elymas ananias and saphira they could strike men with death they could possesse them with as well as dispossesse them off foule spirits and of this power doe many of the fathers vnderstand these words and the like which we read tim

but besides this power there is another common to all bishops with the apostles which is to expose the soules of those which are obstinate sinners to the malice of the prince of darknesse by suspending them from the preseruatiue against it which is the visible communion of saints for the inuisible will not hold long if the visible be iustly because extra ecclesiam non est salus satan raigneth and rageth in them and on them that are excluded from the communion of saints
a word here to you the penitent consider with your selfe how bitter banishment it is to him that dwelleth in a goodly countrey hath a good house faire possessions and those well stockt and stored yet he must part with all these and hereby guesse you at the euill of the priuatiue part of

excommunication for a christian within the chvrch is in the kingdome of heauen he is of the houshold of god he is owner of those greene pastures and waters of comfort which are mentioned psal
he is prouided plentifully of all ghostly food and rayment if the losse of those corporall things be grieuous how grieuous must the losse of these spirituall be and touching the positiue part of the excommunication suppose that he that were banished were also put into the hands of a tyrant and he that hated him should be made lord ouer him should haue power to vse him as a slaue and afflict him with tortures you would thinke his case much more miserable and yet is it not so miserable as his which is deliuered ouer to satan vsed by him onely to serue filthy lusts and daily to breed new matter for the vexation of his owne soule yet this was to be the case of this incestuous corinthian and you deserue that it should haue been your case both of you being such impure persons to whom should you be committed but to the vncleane spirit

goe on
this censure which you haue heard of was inflicted by st pavl and the acts of inflicting it are two first it is pronounced by himselfe iudicially and then he requireth that it be solemnly denounced by the corinthians
first touching his owne iudiciall pronouncing here is something remarkable in his person for he was absent and present absent in body present in spirit
there is a morall rule contained in these words and a miracle
the morall is this distance of place doth not extinguish the relation that is betweene persons though a king and his subiects a master and his seruant a husband and his wife a father and his child be farre a sunder yet may they giue order one to another concerning their affaires so may a pastor to his chvrch
especially an apostle might who wheresoeuer he were was neuer out of his dioces for his dioces reached ouer all the world and so st pavl being at ephesus in asia was in regard of his relation at corinth also which is in europe thus was he present euen when he was absent

these words containe also a miracle papae quanta est virtus doni saith st chrysostome what a strange guift of the spirit was this which maketh men that are a sunder to be together and informeth men of those things which are done a farre off so that none of his dioces could any where be out of his reach
such an assistance of the spirit had elizevs

who being in israel could tell what was done in the king of syria and being in his owne chamber saw gehezi take bribes of naaman when he was farre out of his sight
such a guift had st pavl and thereby could be present where he was absent as he speaketh here and he tels the colossians

that when he was absent yet he did he hold their order and stedfastnesse of their faith in christ as his knowledge so also his power reached to any distance for the punishing of offendors

this being obserued concerning his person we are now to see his worke he doth pronounce iudicially haue iudged already
where we

must first obserue that when iurisdictions are subordinate if the inferiour be carelesse the superiour must take cognizance of the disorder and supply the others negligence otherwise churches and will come to confusion this is the course that st pavl taketh in his place

secondly the word iudging doth import that he did not deale passionately or rashly but aduisedly and as beseemed a iudge he tryed the cause by the law of god and doomed not what he found not forbidden therein
and indeed apud deum non sacerdotis sententia sed reorum vita quaeritur there must be some generall law which men are bound to obey and mens liues must be tryed by that law and as they are found so they must be censured otherwise god doth not regard he doth not approue the censure

last of all marke that st pavl doth not onely say haue iudged but haue iudged already he doth not put off his iudgement vntill he commeth to corinth but proceeds without delay you shall find the reason in the preacher

because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sonnes of men is fully set in them to doe euill a timely chastisement of one is a soueraigne preseruatiue of many

you haue heard how iudicially st pavl pronounced the sentence the next thing that you must heare is that he requires the corinthians to denounce it solemnly he will that they haue a hand in it partly to redeeme their negligence and partly to expresse their detestation of sinne in both respects it was behoofefull that they should denounce what he had decreed denounce it by the mouthes of their pastors as what is decreed by vs in the consistorie is published by the minister of the parish where the sinner dwelleth whom our decrees concerne

but to denounce is not enough they must denounce it solemnly
first in regard of the place it must be done in the face of the chvrch you being gathered together and my spirit with you that is in the presence of the chiefe pastor and all his flocke at corinth notorietas facti must haue notorietatem iuris

a publike sinne must haue a publike doome that others may behold and beware
but this is done tantum conscia ecclesia the congregation is but witnesse to the doome not iudge of the fact the power of the keyes is giuen to the chvrch quoad undefined span alphabet not quoad undefined span alphabet that it may haue the benefit of them not the managing the managing is committed onely to the pastor as appeares math

and ioh

as the denouncing must be solemne in place so must it be in proceeding also for they must proceed cum potestate potenti with the authoritie and efficacie of our lord iesvs christ
st pavl doth pronounce the corinthians doe denounce neither of them must arrogate more to himselfe then is committed to him in regard of authoritie they are but delegates in regard of efficacie they are but instruments of christ he is the author and actor of the censure

so that the proceeding must not be in mans name or with mans power but in the name of our lord iesus christ and with the power of our lord iesus christ
this maketh the proceeding to be solemne in deed christ is present at it his commission is our warrant and his cooperation maketh good our censure
whose soeuer sinnes ye remit

they are remitted vnto them and whose soeuer sinnes ye retaine they are retained
whatsoeuer ye bind on earth it shall be bound in heauen
so that we must doe all ad nutum summi pastoris as we are directed and authorized by the chiefe pastor
and you that are the penitent must heare and feare the sentence as if it came from christ's owne mouth and were to be performed by christ's owne hand
put all the parts of the censure together and you will confesse that it is horrendum iudicium for you must set before your eyes heauen and hell the blessed state of those that are in the one the woefull state of those that are in the other then behold a man taken out of the blisse of the one and throwne into the woe of the other by an apostle and in the presence of all the saints nay by christ himselfe by his voyce by his hands you must suppose that all this is done

st avstin when he considered it thought it was grauius quam gladio feriri much more grieuous then to be beheaded burned stoned

many euidences there are of gods seueritie against impure lusts

as namely he would not that a bastard should come into the congregation of israel vntill the tenth generation but against incest he is more seuere

for he would not onely haue a generall curse pronounced against it whereunto he commanded all the people to say amen but touching the moabites and ammonites the first spawne of incest that we find in the scripture though they were the posteritie of lot whom god loued for aeraham's sake

yet doth he command that they shall not enter into the congregation of israel for euer israel is forbidden to seeke their peace at any time
rvben is a second example marke what his owne father iacob said of him when he blest the patriarkes ruben thou art my first borne my might

the beginning of my strength the excellencie of digni and the excellencie of power these were the preeminences of his but he forfeited them all for incest as appeares in the verie next words of his father vnstable as water thou shalt not excell because thou wentest vp to thy fathers bed then defiledst thou it
he went vp into my couch
a third example is absalon he abused his fathers concubines therefore he came to an infamous end he was hanged by the haire of his owne head he dyed childlesse and so his name did rot

the land of canaan spued out the old inhabitants for incest and god threatneth the destruction of israel for that a man and his sonne would goe in to one maid

by gods law no lesse then death was the punishment of incest
leu
the lawes of the land are more mercifull vnto you the penitent that suffer you to breathe and leaue you to the censure of the chvrch
but if you mind what you haue heard touching that censure and drinke in st avstins conceipt therof you shall find cause enough

to feare and freedome from death may seeme vnto you worse then death

but yet your case is not desperate for there yet remaines one point in the text which may yeeld a mitigation to your feares and a consolation to your soule
the censure is not mortall but medicinall as appeares in the end whereunto the censure serues
now a medicine you know doth first paine then it doth ease yea it doth therfore paine that it may ease so doth this ghostly censure it serues for the destruction of the flesh there is the paine but there followeth ease vpon it the spirit be saued
first of the paine
as the flesh signifieth sometimes the substance sometimes the corruption of the outward man so may the destruction signifie either the mortalitie or the mortification thereof mortalitie if the censure proceed from the power which is proper to an apostle but if it signifie the power which is common to bishops with the apostles it noteth mortification it signifieth the crucifying of the flesh with the lusts thereof the putting off the old man and the dying vnto sinne
and indeed this we intend by our ecclesiasticall censures we intend that you should root out the sinne for which you doe penance and so destroy your flesh
this is painfull to flesh and blood but vt valeas multa dolenda feres you must brooke the paine that you may enioy the ease that followeth thereupon the spirit shall be saued
the spirit noteth the soule or the grace thereof the sauing of the soule is the preseruing of grace therein if the soule loose grace it looseth it selfe in regard of all and it were much better for it not to be at all then to be without grace so that the saluation of our spirit is no small part of our happinesse
which must the rather be esteemed because if our spirit fare well it will make euen the flesh that is destroyed in regard of the corruption to be farre better in regard of the substance for it shall be purged from dead works to serue the liuing god

but when shall we reape this out of paine in the day of our lord iesus christ
though a peniten euen in this life shall find some case in his conscience yet the full benefit of ecclesiasticall censure is reserued to the day of the lord because all this life we must be mortifying our flesh especially enormous sinners must be so imployed the greatest of their ease in this world must haue a mixture of paine but in the day of the lord they shall haue ease without all delay
but what day of the lord is meant here euerie mans particular day of death or the generall doomes day an account must be made at both and if we vse the ecclesiasticall censure well we shall find that this iudgment preuents that this temporall the eternall
for as christ at his first comming came not to destroy but to saue so his ministers that dispense the gospel vse their power not to destruction but to edification
but thinke the day of the lord signifieth properly the last day christ will publikely manifest before the chvrch tryumphant the effect of the keyes which he hath committed to his ministers to

be exercised publikely in the chvrch militant he will then reueale how all stand bound in heauen which were neuer loosed on earth and all whom the chvrch hath loosed in earth shall then appeare to be loosed in heauen

end
the successe which st pavl had when he inflicted this sentence was that the corinthians became verie sensible of their fault and the incestuous person of his st pavl himselfe doth witnesse this cor
where he amplyfieth both their godly sorrowes and his congratulating indulgence towards them both
oh that like successe might blesse my paines that may giue as good a testimonie to this congregation for their hatred of sinne as st pavl gaue to the corinthians and to this penitent the like mittigation of his censure as st pavl to that incestuous person
so may this penitentiall sheet of his be turned into a white robe of righteousnesse his teares into ioy and all we that are humbled for him in the church militant be with him exalted in the church tryumphant
amen

a sermon preached in the cathedral chvrch of wels at what time two did penance for incest a man and his wives davghter
epigraph

levit

verse
likewise if a man taketh a wife and her mother this is wickednesse they shall burne him and them with fire and there shall be no wickednesse amongst you

no sooner doe you heare this text but am ure you vnderstand this spectacle you vnderstand what sinners these persons are what doome this law doth passe vpon them
and indeed their sinne and gods doome are the maine parts of my text
but more distinctly
in the sinne we must note first the fact then the haynousnesse thereof
the fact is vnnaturall adulterie adulterie because one man taketh more women then one that is plaine adulterie
and this adulterie is vnnaturall because there is the neerest reference betweene the women the one a mother the other her daughter to take two such women is verie vnnaturall it is no lesse then incest incest in the highest degree
such is the fact
and verily such a fact is most haynous it is wickednesse
wickednesse is a common name to all sinne but it must here be vnderstood in a speciall sense for abominable for intollerable wickednesse
now such as the sinne is such is the doome the sinne is haynous and the doome is grieuous
but in the doome take notice of two things first it is impartially seuere impartially doth god deale he spareth neither man nor woman neither him nor them
and he dealeth seuerely with them both they shall burne him and them with fire and you know fire is a painfull tormenter and an vtter destroyer of that which it tormenteth

great seueritie and yet no greater then was necessarie to keepe the state from being guiltie that there be no wickednesse amongst you

no wickednesse not absolutely none that is impossible in this world but no tantum nefas as the vulgar expresseth the sense well no heynous wickednesse must be amongst you amongst you that is suffered by you which will make the state guiltie and prouoke gods wrath against it
you haue the briefe of my text which purpose god willing to enlarge god grant that what shall say thereon may make these penitents truly sorrowfull for their fault and vs that behold them carefull not to be ouertaken with the like fall
come we then to the particulars

but before distinctly vnfold them must in few words cleare the phrases wherein the fact is exprest
obserue then first that to take a woman in this law is to vncouer her nakednesse as moses expresseth himselfe

cap
or as we commonly speake to haue carnall knowledge of her
secondly isha in the hebrew tongue signifieth as well a woman as a wife and therefore some translate it if a man take a woman some if a man take a wise it is not materiall which way you render it because it is an vndoubted truth that whom a man may not marrie with he may not know carnally out of mariage if he doe it is incest no lesse incest if he make her his strumpet then if he tooke her to be his wife
thirdly it is all one for the daughter to be the wife and the mother the strumpet or for the mother to be the wife and the daughter the strumpet the incest will euer be of the same degree because the persons are both wayes of the same neernesse
note these two last points the rather because these penitents may happily thinke they are not within the compasse of my text whereas if it be vnderstood as the truth is and haue shewed you my text speaketh directly of them and the fact here mentioned is their fact

the fact is but one but there are two sinnes in it whereof the first is adultery it is adultery for one man to take more women then one
as god made but one eve of one adam so in mariage he coupled but one eve to adam and he coupled them so neere that they two should be one flesh that is that the man should not haue power ouer his body but the woman nor the woman should haue power ouer her body but the man and the obseruance of this is the keeping of pactum iehouae the couenant of the lord which had accompanying it magnum benesicium and magnum mysterium a great blessing for their seed was semen sanctum a holy seed and god promised to be the god of those children which were borne of such parents
the great mysterie was that liuing in such wedlocke they were a perpetuall monument vnto themselues of the heauenly mariage of christ and his chvrch

marke now especially you that are penitents what the sinne of adulterie is first it maketh them two againe whom god made but one for a man cannot be one with two women because whose

he is he must be hers entirely and he cannot be entirely more then one womans so that his first sinne is that he diuideth that which is indiuisible meane coniugall affection
secondly he bestoweth that which is none of his owne for his body in this respect is his wiues she onely hath right vnto it and to this vse of it
thirdly in breaking gods couenant of wedlocke he defraudeth his children of the couenant of grace
for obserue it in the storie of abraham he had children by two wiues sara his first and his lawfull wife agar his second and vnlawfull wife but what saith the scripture cast out the and her child

for the child of the shall not be heire with the child of the free woman

besides the great mysterie you may gather this morall that although god may out of his mercie receiue that child whom the parents as much as lyeth in them cast away yet gods couenant is made with the parent for no children but those that are begotten in lawfull wedlocke
finally adulterers defraud themselues of that blessed memoriall of christ's eternall coniunction with his chvrch the contemplation whereof should be our greatest solace seeing we haue a blessed interest therein
there were euill enough in the fact if it were onely adulterie seeing adulterie hath so manifold euill in it but there is a greater sinne which is incest for the women are of verie neere reference the one is a mother the other is her daughter neerer kin they cannot be and being so neere it is vnnaturall that they should be knowne of the same man he that knoweth them both committeth incest in the highest degree

but will more open vnto you the nature of incest
know then that god purposed by wedlocke not onely to multiply mankind but also to preserue charitie
naturall charitie is founded in consanguinitie but consanguinitie the farther it spreadeth the more doth charitie grow cold
to repaire and as it were quicken it god instituted affinitie which doth undefined span alphabet make domesticks of strangers and naturalizing those that are forreiners to our stocke
and indeed it is much like graffing for as in that art the sien is taken from a sweet cherie or apple tree and entred into another growne wild for example a or wild cherietree and art doth worke as nature in making them one so is it in affinitie it maketh persons as neere as nature it selfe doth and charitie out of this should grow as strong as if the persons were of one blood euen as beames of the sunne which growing weaker the farther they goe by reflection into themselues recouer their former strength so doth the charity of consanguinitie when it is waning waxe againe by the helpe of affinitie
where by the way note that whereas we call persons and so brothers and sisters we must not vnderstand it of meere positiue law but it is a secundarie law of nature vnalterable sauing onely by god and this law of god is grounded vpon it and affinitie doth in some sort

equall consanguinitie as grafted branches doe those that are naturall
but because where consanguinitie is a good ground of charitie there needeth no repaire neither will god haue any therefore hath he forbidden mariage within certaine degrees some collaterall more in the right line and they that match within these degrees are said to commit incest

adde hereunto that god would haue a distinction kept between persons he would not haue the same person a father and a sonne an husband and a brother in regard of the same persons such peruersenesse in matches can neuer be approued of reason much lesse of god
see then your fault you that are the incestuous persons you haue first gone against gods ordinance which prouided for the propagating of charity and your sinne is iniurious to the societie of mankind and if it might preuaile families must needs continue strangers each to the other and they must confine their wealth and their loue euerie one to their owne howse
secondly in confounding consanguinitie and affinitie you haue made a peruerse confusion of a father and an husband and of a daughter you haue made a wife at least a strumpet
and this is your second sinne and of this and the former consisteth your sinfull fact and haynous sinne
it is wickednesse

wickednesse is a word common to all sinnes but it must be here vnderstood in a speciall sense as the word sinner is often in the scripture in the old testament the amalekites those sinners

in the new testament the gentiles are also called sinners as also publicans harlots not so much because they had sinne in them as for that their sinnes were enormous
all incontinencie is wicked but incest is wicked undefined span alphabet in the highest degree

but to open the word here vsed by the holy ghost a little more fully
the word is zimmah which signifieth any act of our mind or thought of our heart but because the thoughts of the imaginations of our hearts are commonly euill therefore an euill thought or purpose is often intimated vnto vs thereby
thirdly because he that is a slaue to his affections can hardly be master of his actions for undefined span alphabet out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speake therefore it signifieth a reuealed thought a thought reuealed in our actions
finally the word being put without any limitation doth signifie an execrable an intollerable wicked both thought and act and so it is here to be vnderstood

but marke that though the sinne be an act yet it is denominated from the thought and why the principall part thereof lyeth in the purpose of the heart not in the outward performance by our body which may also be obserued in the storie of the deluge all flesh had then corrupted his way but god pointeth at the fountaine of this corruption in these words

euerie imagination of the thoughts of mans

heart were euill

and that continually
simon magvs offered money to the apostles that he might by them be inabled to giue the holy ghost to whom soeuer he layd his hands vpon but marke what st peter saith to him pray that the thought of thy heart may be forgiuen thee for perceiue thou art in the gall of bitternesse and the bond of iniquitie

men that doe that which is right in their owne eyes are commonly drawne thereunto by following the counsell of their owne heart we must therefore listen to the aduise of solomon

keepe thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and death

a second note that this word doth yeeld is that we must be so farre from acting that we must not so much as purpose sinne not suffer our selues so farre to be baited by our owne lusts

as to conceiue sinne in the inward man undefined span alphabet sinne in the priuie closet of our soule
excellently nazianzene to this purpose undefined span alphabet let no man set vp idols of wickednesse in his soule undefined span alphabet nor carrie about him pictures of wickednesse in his heart for undefined span alphabet the inward lust is the greatest part of fornication and incest and therefore doth the holy ghost so often forbid the lust of concupiscence
in a word laudantur homines vituperantur undefined span alphabet as men are inwardly disposed so are they morally reputed good or bad and herein doth morallitie differ from policie

but haue not yet touched at the haynousnesse of this sinne
incest then must be reputed in the number of the most enormous sinnes a sinne that hath his originall from the impure spirit which is antiquus adulter the ancientest adulterer not onely spirituall but corporall also and taketh delight no lesse in the corruption of our bodyes then of our soules you may see it in the confessions of sundry witches who report the manner of their festiuitie at their impious meetings and read it in the description of their mysteries wherein they doe initiate their followers
tertvllian in his apologie and other fathers make mention of it
and how many impure hereticks did he rayse in the primitiue chvrch this and the chapter doth tell vs that the aegyptians from whom the israelites came and the canaanites into whose countrey they were to goe were nations ouergrowne with this haynous sinne but marke what it addeth god did detest them for it and the land did spue them out

and no maruell

for it is undefined span alphabet a man that is giuen ouer to this degree of lust hath lost all soueraigntie of reason and is become a verie beast yea worse then a beast for beasts abhorre this coniunction as heretofore vpon a like occasion shewed you out of aristotle
and therefore although these extrauagant lusts did raigne in the heathen who learned them of their impure gods yet was not the light of reason so farre exstinguished in all of them

but that many acknowledged the haynousnesse of them the poet did dira canam procul hinc natae procul este parentes said one

of them

when he was to speake of a daughters lying with her owne father the philosophers did plato saith that by an inward vnwritten law the sacred law of conscience men doe abhorre these vnnaturall mixtures of mankind
the ciuill law calleth it a funestation of a mans selfe and indeed the persons are dead in sinnes and trespasses that make such a coniunction
and how can that be but abominable in gods iudgement which the blind reason of vnregenerate man hath acknowledged to be so abominable

will conclude this point with two aggrauations of the sinne which arise from the persons of these offendors the man is a father and a father should be a good example to his children and by his authoritie should hold them in when they would run riot if he doe not he offends grieuously how grieuously then doth that father offend which giueth an ill example to his child allureth her to such detestable sinne yea doth act the sinne with her if incest be of it selfe haynous your fatherhood maketh it much more haynous
and as for you that are the daughter no small accesse is made vnto your sinne by being the daughter of your mother for sinnes are improued by their persons that act them
if it had beene an enemie that had done me this wrong could haue borne it saith david but it was thou my familiar friend whosoeuer had wronged your mothers bed it had beene a wickednesse but to be thus wronged by her owne daughter wherein it is hard to say whether she haue more cause to lament in regard of her owne or of your person it cannot but adde much to your sinne
these things should you that are the penitents take to heart and adde them to the measure of your sinne for of haynous they make it much more haynous
passe at length from the sinne to the doome giuing you by the way this note that god addeth doomes to sinnes grieuous doomes to haynous sinnes that we may be held in by the feare of the one when we would not forbeare vpon the fight of the other for such is our weaknesse that though a sinne be represented vnto vs as most vgly most odious yet sensualitie doth so preuaile that we are caried away with the pleasure without any regard of the filthinesse thereof if any thing stay or stagger vs herein it must be paine which often maketh vs to bethinke our selues and take heed when we are euen ready to rush into sinne
but touching the doome here in my text we must first take notice that there is no respect of persons with god both must be punished the man and the woman and punished alike
you would thinke that the case of the one were more fauourable then the other the temptedst more fauourable then the temptors the daughter may plead the power which her father had ouer her whom she durst not resist and thereby seeme to deserue fauour
but this is no plea at gods barre for children must remember that they haue an heauenly as well as an earthly father and that they may not offend the one to pleasure the other

a second thing obseruable in the doome is that both the women are subiected to the same punishment which may seeme verie rigorous for what hath the lawfull wife deserued therefore some vnderstand the words by a synecdoche and by the women vnderstand either of them that shall be found guiltie whether it be the mother that defileth the daughters bed or the daughter that defileth the mothers bed
but it may be that both may well deserue death if the mother be the wife and consent that her daughter should goe in to her father or if the daughter be the wife and consent that her mother should goe in to her husband such consent yea if it be but conniuency and patience it is abominable wickednesse

how farre the mother was priuie to this daughters sinne know not but if she were in any sort she deserueth to be punished no lesse then her child and the child with the father are to be punished most seuerely they are to be burnt with fire

and here consider first how well the doome is fitted to the sinne the doome is fire and so is the sinne also
if haue beene deceiued by a woman saith iob this were a fire that would burne to destruction

and solomon speaking of adulterie moueth this question can a man take fire in his bosome and not be burnt he that is a fornicator in the body of his flesh saith the sonne of syrach will not cease till he haue kindled a fire

finally st pavl giueth this rule it is better to marrie then to burne burne in the lust of incontinencie
seeing then this lust is a fire god doth punish a sier with a sier a sinfull with a painfull fire

but the iewish rabbins or antiquaries doe obserue that the iewes had two kinds of burning of malefactors one was by opening their mouthes and pouring in moulten lead this was called combustio animae saluo corpore it tooke away the life of the partie and yet left no marke of the fire in the outward lineaments of his body the other was by laying of fewell round about the body which set on fire did presently consume it into ashes and is the burning meant here in my text for it saith they should be burnt with fire

and indeed this kind of burning of incontinent persons is verie ancient

before the giuing of moses law ivdah would haue practised it vpon his daughter in law tamar the prophet micah alludeth hereunto in his first chapter and ezekiel in his
st iohn in his reuelations speaking of the whore of babylon

prophesieth that she shall perish by fire so that fire seemeth to haue beene the punishment of whores not onely if she were the priests daughter but whosoeuer she were the allusion else would not be so frequent
and yet we read that adulterers were to be stoned to death whether after stoning they were also burnt is worth the inquirie for sometimes they were both practised vpon the same malefactors as it is cleere in the storie of achan

in the former degree of incontinencie specified before my text the holy ghost is silent and doth not specifie any particular kind of

punishment by meanes whereof interpreters doubt what punishment was to be inflicted some conceiue that stoning mentioned in the beginning of the chapter must be extended to all that follow the iewes they limit it thus where the law saith they shall dye the death and their blood shall be vpon them there stoning is meant but if it be onely they shall dye the death then the partie was to be strangled

but will not trouble you with these antiquities onely this will obserue vnto you that the specifying of a particular punishment here and not in the former degree of incontinencie may well import some extraordinarie haynousnesse in this sinne especially if you consider the sharpenesse thereof they shall be burnt with fire
viui comburentur saith the vulgar they shall be burnt aliue now you know that fire is a bitter tormenter and an vtter consumer it afflicteth extreamly while the partie liueth and it vtterly abolisheth the being of the body together with the life both which proue the punishment to be verie sharpe verie seuere it giueth no rest while we are and abolisheth vs as if we neuer had beene
but this was a politike law of moses what is that to vs we haue no such law and that law doth not bind our state true it doth not and happy is it for you that are the penitents that it doth not you should not be here to doe penance if you had such doome as gods law requireth you are therefore bound to thanke god for the clemencie of the state and make good vse of this time of grace remembring that though you scape the corporall fire there is another fire which you haue cause to feare which st ivde telleth vs was figured out in the perpetuall burning of sodome and gomorrha the fire of hell and assure your selues that if the land of canaan spued out those impure persons heauen will receiue no such and if they that transgressed moses law perished ciuilly without all mercie most wofull shall their destruction be that are reserued for that fire which shall deuour the aduersaries the fire of hell
you shall doe well therefore to quench that fire before you come at it and there are three waters with which you must quench it the first is the water of your teares you must imitate king david who all the night long washt his bed watered his couch with his teares there he sinned and there he bathed himselfe so must you
but mans teares are too weake a water to wash away either the guilt or staine of sinne which are the fewell of that fire you must therefore moreouer vse two other waters the water of christs blood to wash away the guilt and the water of his spirit to purge out the corruption of your sinne
if you make good vse of these three waters that fire will neuer seize on you otherwise assure your selues that though we spare you god will not spare you he will one day punish you most seuerely

and it were good that our law did not spare so much as it doth considering the growth and of impuritie it were to be wisht that our temporall sword did strike as deepe as the sword

of moses did it may when it pleaseth the state and it shall not doe it without example of other countreys

or if that may not be obtained at least it were to be wisht that the old canons of the chvrch were reuiued and ghostly discipline exercised more seuerely for certainly the scandall is great which such sinnes bring vpon the chvrch and they that slander vs without a cause when they haue iust cause how will they open their mouthes against vs our care then should be to stop their mouthes but principally we should prouide that there be no wickednesse amongst vs which is the end of the doome and the last point of my text
will touch it briefly
the iudgement was seuere but it was necessarie
necessarie for the state which is to preserue it selfe free from guilt there must no wickednesse be amongst you
no wickednesse that is impossible in this world for viuitur non cum perfectis hominibus they that haue most of the spirit haue of the flesh and the field of god till haruest will haue tares as well as good eares and the good eares will haue chaffe as well as good graine and the good graine will haue bran as well as flower
we may not looke then for any state wherein there is no wickednesse
the law therefore requireth onely that there be nullum scelus no haynous wickeduesse no tantum scelus as the vulgar speaketh enormous transgressions there must be no crying sinnes the state must haue a vigilant eye vpon such sinnes and execute vengeance vpon notorious sinners they must not be amongst vs
but they will the serpent will be in paradise yea lucifer was in heauen the arke had a cham and amongst christs disciples there was a ivdas be then they will amongst vs
but the meaning of the law is they must not be indured by vs they must not scape vnpunished if they doe they will proue contagious such sinnes are like fretting gangreenes they are like vnto leauen they infect all about them and if they doe not infect they will make guiltie and for sparing such a one god will not spare a whole state

and there is good reason for qui non vetat cum potest iubet god taketh them for abettors that will not when they may reforme inordinate liuers
therefore the state must put away from amongst them such inordinate liuers

hierusalem below must as neere as may be be like vnto hierusalem aboue

of that aboue st iohn saith extracanes impudici no vncleane person commeth thither neither must any be indured here so soone as they appeare they must be made expiatorie sacrifices and their death must free the state from guilt
but draw to an end

a word to you that are the malefactors

ad paenitentiae remedium confugite qui praeuenti estis tam graui peccato seeing you haue beene ouertaken with so foule a fault neglect not the remedy which god hath left you heartie and vnfained repentance for your sinne the rather because you haue to do with a most mercifull iudge who doth not onely moderate the punishment but commute it also commute

the punishment which you should suffer in hell with a punishment which the chvrch inflicteth here on earth
consider the qualitie consider the quantitie of these different punishments and you will confesse that it is a most mercifull commutation
cast then your eyes backe and consider what you haue done how haynous your offence hath beene and cast your eyes forwards likewise and consider what you haue deserued how great a danger you haue incurred by inioying a short and beastly pleasure thinke vpon both these often and thinke vpon them seriously so shall you yeeld god the greater glorie for the mercie which he vouchsafeth you and he shall worke the greater comfort in your soules by assuring you of the remission of that sinne wherewith you haue so greatly prouoked him

and to vs all this say eligamus priùs affectus castigare quàm propter ipsos castigemur let vs plucke out our eyes cut off our hands rather then by retayning them to be cast into let this spectacle remember vs often to set before vs the shame of the world and the horror of a guiltie conscience which befall enormous sinners in this life
and if that will not hold in our corrupt nature let vs set before vs the worme the fier
or rather undefined span alphabet let vs begin here our life in chastitie

that we may one day be in the number of those virgins that follow the lambe whether soeuer he goeth

and let magistrates and ministers both be iealous ouer the state with a godly iealousie that as by the ministry of the word and sacraments it is espowsed to one husband

so it may be presented as a chast virgin vnto christ when those heauenly nuptials shall be solemnized wherein standeth our euerlasting happinesse

this god grant for jesus christs sake by the operation of the holy spirit
to which one god in three persons be rendred all honour and glorie now and for euer amen
marriage is honourable amongst all men and the bed vndefiled but fornicators and adulterers god will iudge

verse
cursed is he that lyeth with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother and all the people shall say amen
cursed is he that lyeth with his and all the people shall say amen

when god had deliuered the children of israel out of aegypt he was pleased to enter into a couenant with them at mount sinai the manner of it is set downe exod
but the israelites quickly brake with god and god entred into iudgment with them he made them for the space of fortie yeeres to wander in the wildernesse and in that space he so consumed them that of men remained aliue onely iosva and caleb
after so long displeasure god returned againe in mercie to them he vouchsafed to haue his couenant renewed againe the forme of the renuing he prescribeth in this of deut
a most solemne forme for therein were to concurre three remarkable acts
first the law was to be fairly written vpon great plaistred stones that the people might see whereunto they were to bind themselues for god would haue them enter into his couenant aduisedly
secondly there was an altar to be erected and thereon they were to offer whole burnt offerings and sacrifices of which were to be reall acknowledgments that they did wholly deuote themselues to god and giue thankes for that god of his goodnesse would againe renue his couenant god would haue them enter into his couenant religiously
thirdly god commanded that the twelue tribes should sort themselues into two diuisions sixe should stand vpon the descent

of mount gerezzim and sixe vpon the descent of mount ebal both diuisions with their faces towards the mid valley where the arke of god the type of his visible residence amongst the israelites was borne vp by the priests
in this theater as it were did god require that the israelites should heare the articles of agreement betweene god and them both blessings and cursings and professe their conformitie thereunto
god would haue them professe themselues party to his couenant openly in the sight both of god and men
in this third act you shall find a rehearfall of sinnes first in particular then ingenerall and a doome pronounced against the committers of those sinnes both by priest and people
of the particular sinnes my text specifieth two and specifieth withall the doome that belongeth to either of them
the sinnes are vnlawfull matches one collaterall a brothers lying with his sister and because a woman may be sister more wayes then one here is an exegesis the word is expounded whether she be daughter of the mans father or daughter of his mother
the second vnlawfull match is in the right line a mans lying with his law
of these matches you haue these penitent spectacles here presented before you

the text goeth on and tels these penitents and whosoeuer else shall presume to be like vnto them what is their doome it is set downe in one word but that is a sharpe one they are cursed
but farther obserue concerning this doome who doth pronounce it and who doth approue it
they that pronounce it are the leuites so we read verse and they are willed to pronounce it with an audible voyce so audible that all israel may heare
they that approue it are the people they are required to say amen in token that they all assent to that which they heare all the people must say amen
you haue the briefe of my text purpose god willing now to enlarge it pray god may so doe it as that we that stand may take heed least we fall and these that are fallen may learne to rise againe

begin with the sinne wherein we are first to make you see that the text doth fit this occasion for neither of the matches therein specified seemeth to agree with theirs that are vnder the present censure
not the collaterall for my text speaketh of a sister by consanguinitie and these penitents were brother and sister onely by affinitie not that in the right line for my text speaketh of a mans lying with his mother or his wiues mother but this man here is censured for lying with his wiues daughter
and so you may thinke that neither of these couples come within the compasse of my text and therefore are neither of them guiltie of the sinne neither need feare the doome
to take away this doubt you must take notice of two rules in diuinitie
the first is that affinitie makes persons as neere in the law as consanguinitie doth
the reason whereof is plaine affinitie is grounded vpon mariage and by mariage two become one flesh and consequently their kinted whether ascendent or descendent or collaterall become alike neere on each side to the other your wiues father and

mother brethren and sisters sonnes and daughters are vnto you by her as neere as if they were of your owne blood
this being true you perceiue that it was no lesse vnlawfull for this man to couple with his wiues sister then with his owne sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother

the other rule is that more then is exprest in gods law is to be vnderstood when by analogie it may fairly be deduced
god himselfe is our direction to take notice of such analogie for if you compare this chapter with the of leuit
you shall find that this verie instance of a man lying with his which is mentioned here is omitted there whereupon you may well conclude that some particulars which god forbids are not named in the letter though they are within the meaning of the law and that the meaning is as wide as analogie will suffer
will shew you in a word what this analogie is it is that persons which are not forbidden expresly and in the letter of the law are there forbidden implicitely and in the meaning of the law where others in the same distance of consanguinitie or affinitie are expresly forbidden
as for example the law forbids expresly a nephew to marrie with his aunt it saith nothing of an vnckles marrying with his neece yet these being as neere in degree as the other we may of them reasonably conclude that they also are forbidden in the meaning of the law the exception of the romanists is friuolous
to our purpose by the letter of my text a man may not marrie with his which may be either his wiues mother or his fathers wife if not with his which is his fathers wife then in the meaning of the text he may not marrie with his wiues daughter because these women are equally distant from him the one in the first degree of the right line ascending the other in the first degree of the right line descending for his fathers wife is accounted as neere to him as his owne father and his wiues daughter as neere as his owne daughter by the first rule
secondly if according to the letter a man may not marry with his that is his wiues mother then likewise may he not marrie with his wiues daughter according to the meaning of the text for these women also are equally distant from him his wiues mother being from his wife and consequently by the first rule from him in the first degree of the right line ascending his wiues daughter in the first degree of the right line descending
thus haue brought the second couple also within my text by the foresaid rules
you may see that this couple is also within the verie letter of the law leuit

what haue said concerning the vnlawfull coniunctions of these couples holds true as well out of mariage as in it yea if they may not marrie much lesse may they loosely ioine together
hauing found that both these couples are the subiect of my text it followeth that now shew you that they are guiltie of sinne

to make this cleare obserue that quadam sunt mala quia prohibita

some things are morally euill because god hath forbidden them so was the eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill there was no ill in the tree for all that god made was good verie good onely god was pleased to exercise mans obedience in forbearing
were there nothing else in these matches but that god hath forbidden them it were a sinne for any one to venter vpon them because we owe absolute obedience to gods commands and if he require we must forbeare from those which otherwise are good things
you that are the penitents must acknowledge this for the first degree of your sinne that you haue fayled in your absolute obedience to gods commands

but your sinne is yet greater for there are some things prohibita quia mala therefore forbidden because they are morall euils either absolutely or at least in reference to some good for the compassing whereof they are commanded
looke vpon your ten commandements therein will giue you an instance of either
god saith thou shalt haue no other gods but me it is absolutely euill to goe against this commandement therefore it admits no dispensation it can neuer be done without an heynous offence
likewise god saith honor thy father and thy mother now if this commandement be broken an euill is committed which frustrates the end whereat god aymed in this commandement sc by subordination of persons to preserue good order in all societies
and this commandement is dispensable when the breach of it serueth to a higher end so levi said to his father and to his mother haue not seene him neither did he acknowledge his brethren

nor knew his owne children for they haue obserued thy word and kept thy couenant
to apply this distinction of vnlawfull matches those in the right line seeme to partake of that kind of euill which is absolutely so the prohibitions concerning them are indispensable
though beilarmine seemeth to doubt of the extent of the axiome prohibetur ininfinitum coniunctio inter ascendentes descendentes and the rabbins goe not so farre as we doe yet certainly there is no instance to be giuen that euer god did dispence with matches in this kind
we haue many monuments of his detestation of them which vpon like occasion haue remembred vnto you

whence appeareth the haynousnesse of your sinne that hath lyen with your daughter which is much improued by your wicked attempts to marrie with her
wherein you haue heaped vpon it three foule sinnes
first briberie by which you haue vnlawfully procured sureties to engage themselues in deepe summes that there was no lawfull impediment of your match
the second sinne is periurie to gaine a licence you deceiued the court with a false oath
the third is blasphemie for whereas it is god that ioyneth persons in mariage you would haue had the minister that representeth god to haue ioyned you together flat against gods command there is not the least of these accessories which doth not highly improue your principall sinne and make you to be most sinfull
a lesse burden then this you

must not feele vpon your conscience
and your daughter must take vpon her selfe so much guilt as is common to you both

as for you that haue lyen together brother and sister your sinne commeth within the compasse of that euill prohibited which though it be not absolutely such yet is it euill in reference to that end which god would compasse by the prohibition and that is
first god would haue men shew themselues reasonable in that they can set bounds vnto their naturall lusts which appeares in nothing more then in this point of coniunction wherein lust is most hardly held in and therefore is the holding of it in a speciall argument of the soueraigntie of reason
the holding it in at least within those moderate bounds which god hath set to it
a second end of the prohibition is the inlarging of our charitie which is not done so kindly nor can be done so vniuersally as by matches witnesse the practice of all the world
therefore hath god forbidden the coniunction of those that are already by consanguinitie or affinitie made neere that while we are driuen to seeke farther our charitie might spread it selfe
and although your match is not so euill but that god hath by dispensation allowed it in some persons because the thing is not absolutely euill but euill in opposition to the end which he purposeth in his commandement which being sufficiently prouided for god is not farther tyed by his owne counsell yet is it verie euill for that you haue let loose the raines to your owne lusts contrarie to gods restraint and haue straitned the bounds of charitie contrarie to gods extent which are two soule offences
for in the first you derogate from the soueraigntie of reason and shew your selues therein brutish and not to haue any command of your lust
in the second you are enemies to humane societie in that you care so little for the aduancement of that by which it doth principally subsist meane charitie
and these faults are the more grieuous in that you are christians for it is a grieuous thing for him to be lesse that should be more then a man and for his charitie to be narrower then is required by reason which should be as wide as true religion doth prescribe
lay this burden vpon your consciences and let the sense of these euils yeeld you the true weight of your guilt and sinne

it is disputed by those that fauour licentiousnesse and make merchandize of good manners whether the prohibitions in leuiticus be a part of moses iudicials and so determined with the policie of the iewes or part of his morals that ought to bind all nations and that in all ages
they cannot deny but the prohibition of some degrees is iuris naturalis and therefore forcible to bind others besides the iewes
but that the prohibition of some other is not so they thinke first because god hath dispensed with the collaterall degrees which he could not doe if they were iuris naturalis
the ignorance of the distinction which before gaue you of euill absolutely and euill in reference vnto gods end maketh them so thinke
for god may dispense with the latter euill with the former he cannot except he will

deny himselfe
another argument of their conceit they draw from examples of the patriarks that haue made such matches and haue not beene reproued
but viuendum est non exemplis sed legibus their examples shew the permissiue not the preceptiue will of god but we must liue by the preceptiue not by the permissiue otherwise we shall make the patriarks patrons of all kind of sinnes
wherefore in this point resolue non est distinguendum vbi lex non distinguit all must be conceiued as iuris naturalis where the law exempts none
and that all are so proue by this reason taken out of the of leuit
god saith there that the sinnes for which the land spued out the canaanites amongst others were these vnlawfull matches to the canaanites these matches had beene no sinnes if they be sinnes onely by the iudiciall law of moses for the canaanites were not tyed to that law and therefore did not sinne in transgressing it it was some other law that made them guiltie and what could that be but the law of nature

adde hereunto that in the ciuill law you shall find the same sinnes forbidden euen before the romane state was christian
forbidden therefore out of the light of naturall reason which is the law of nature
it is no impeachment to this truth that in the chapter of leuit these sinnes haue a ciuill sanction annext to the law which forbiddeth them for theft is in the of exodus forbidden by the morall law and in the chapter is punished by a politike law so in the of leutie these matches are punished by a politike law which in the are forbidden by a morall
let therefore the chvrch of rome to multiply her gainfull dispensations let carnall persons to excuse their vnruly lusts pretend that many of these prohibited matches are restrained only by moses his iudiciall law and are free for christians yet all the authorities and seeming reasons wherewith they labour to maintaine this their conceit will not be able to counteruaile the reasons alleaged
except they can shew a dispensation from god whosoeuer so ioyne together cannot excuse themselues from sinne if not from sinne then not from the doome thereof which in my text is a curse cursed be he that lyeth with

cursed be he that lyeth here must shew you gods method
first he doth onely forbid these sinnes leuit

then because he knew that few are so well disposed as to abstaine from that which is forbidden them therefore in the of leuiticus he armeth the magistrate with the sword against them he will haue all those that presume against this commandement to be punished with temporall death certainly those that offend as two of these penitents that haue matcht in the right line haue done
as for the other two the phrase that is varied maketh some to cauill though it be but a cauill that they stand vpon though they were not to dye by the sword yet the rabbins confesse they were to be whipt and certainly the current of the chapter sheweth that some temporall punishment was inflicted we cannot

not thinke lesse of those phrases they shall be cut off in the sight of their people and cut off from amongst their people they shall beare their iniquitie they shall dye childlesse

but because many by their greatnesse or by their close carriage may scape the magistrates sword though they commit these sinnes therefore in this chapter there is a worse doome pronounced against them from him whom they can neither illude nor escape that is from god and his doome is exprest in this word cursed
a curse is the reward of sinne now sinne is punished by god either in this world or in the world to come
in this world we find in the next chapter how many wayes god doth vse to curse man curse him in his person curse him in his posteritie in his cattell in his corne abroad at home
and indeed there is nothing whereunto a man can put his hand wherein god may not yea often doth not lay a curse vpon a sinner yea and maketh many of them prouerbiall curses as he threatneth the iewes and others in the scriptures
were there no more euill to be expected then this you that are the penitents should thinke your case bad in that your conscience can prognosticate you no good successe all the dayes of your life no not in your worldly affaires so long as you stand charged with this guilt

but there is a farre greater curse and that is to be indured in the world to come

when christ shall say goe ye cursed into euerlasting fire prowded for the diuel and his angels
and indeed the diuel is the first person vpon whom god pronounced a curse and his ease is the sampler of the curse which is eternall
the scripture expresseth it thus take the vnprofitable seruant bind him hand and foot cast him into vtter darknesse
we are told that men shall be infected with a worme that neuer dyeth

and afflicted with fire that neuer goeth out finally they shall be an abhorring to all flesh
and we see in the reuelations how angels and saints congratulate the torments inflicted vpon them by gods iustice
say nothing all this while of their losse of the light libertie comfort companie of angels and saints and which is beyond all of the blessed sight of god
when you this you that are the penitents you may conceiue what terrible words are these which david speaketh

cursed are all those which erre from thy commandements they that are cursed of god shall be rooted out
but least you mistake you must conceiue that this word doth signifie meritum and iudicium the merit of sinne and the paine which shall befall an irrepentant sinner
gods first intention is in this word onely to lay before our eyes what he may in iustice inflict vpon vs if he should enter into iudgement with vs so soone as we prouoke him that so he may strike a terror into our consciences and timely humble vs that we may seeke a remedy euen that remedy which he hath prouided for vs
and what is that by faith to lay hold vpon christ who to keepe off the curse from vs

was pleased himselfe to become a curse you that are the penitents shall doe well to make your benefit of this day of grace and so tremble at the consideration of that which you

haue deserued as to shelter your selfes vnder the comfortable wings of your blessed sauiour before the stroake of gods vengeance light vpon you
for as the word cursed doth import the merit of a sinner so doth it also his iudgement if he continue irrepentant
if repentance preuent not god will reward euerie man according as he deserues

anguish tribulation and wrath shall be vpon euerie one that doth ill which christ setteth forth in a liuely embleme when he cursed the fig tree in the gospel
remember also that gods curse is an vnresistable curse you may learne that of balaam

he assured balak that none can alter it when it is gone out of gods mouth and be you sure it is as vnchangable as it is intollerable
there is much cursing in the world there be many whose mouthes are full of cursing and bitternrsse

some are so impious as to curse god himselfe as ioes wife would haue had her husband haue done and as that wicked one did leuit

and others mentioned reuel

some are so monstrous as to curse though not god yet men

euen with the same tongue they blesse god st iames wisheth them to consider how much they are then senselesse creatures because out of the same fountaine there commeth not sweet water and bitter also
but of these curses we must hold these two rules to be true the one is solomons a causelesse curse shall not come

yea god will blesse them whom the vniust doth curse
the second rule is that they that delight in cursing shall haue enough of it

he that cloatheth himselfe with cursing as with a garment at shall run like water into his flesh and like oyle into his benes he shall be thorowly drencht with it
but we must not conceiue so when a man is curst of god for as his curse commeth not without a cause so it will vndoubtedly sort its effect
and though our cursing of him sheweth but our vneffectuall malice yet his cursing of vs will make vs see his effectuall iustice
finally for these two causes are maledictions added to the transgressions of the law
first that we might acknowledge that it belongeth to gods iustice to see sinne punished
secondly that when we feele any calamities we may know from whom they come and why

hauing shewed you what the curse is that belongeth to your sinne you must now see by whom it must be pronounced and at the verse we find that it was to be pronounced by the leuites
and indeed the act being not politike but ecclesiasticall as you may gather out of that which haue obserued before the person must be suitable
but whereas the name of leuite comprehends the priest also we must vnderstand here the priest and not the ordinarie leuite for vnto the priest belonged the office of blessing and cursing in the name of the lord it is not for euerie one to intermeddle with that worke
it is true

that if the oppressed curse the oppressor in the bitternesse of his soule his prayer shall be heard of him that made him

but yet mens patience should be such as to blesse them of whom they are cursed and to doe good to them of whom they receiue hurt
to curse god rather permits then commands them as he doth parents except they be led by the spirit of prophesie

as noah and others for prophets had this power by an extraordinarie vocation
but the priest onely hath it ordinarily by the power of his orders as by the termes of blessing cursing planting building rooting vp destroying it is exprest in the old testament and it is expressed in the new by those of opening and shutting heauen binding and loosing mens soules remitting and retayning mens sinnes in a word it is that which we call the power of the keyes
so that the minister doth no more then he hath good warrant for when he doth exercise this iurisdiction and the people should feare it because he doth it in the name of the lord no lesse assured that god will confirme it then he is assured that god doth command him to doe it
although we doe not deny but our first intention should be to blesse

and our power is giuen vs for edification and our desire is to be vnto you the sauor of life vnto life yet when the peoples sinnes call for it importuning vs then we must come to the curse vse our weapons of destruction and be vnto the people the sauor of death vnto death
for seeing we are not onely slow vnto obedience and need the spurres of gods alluring blessings but also refractarie and inordinate we need the strong bridle of gods curses to hold vs in when the world the diuel and the flesh carrie vs headlong vnto perdition
were it not so that men are headstrong to their own peril we shold not need to deliuer vnto them the terrors of the law but onely the glad tydings of the gospel but sinne sorceth vs to subordinate the curse to the blessing that by the terrors of the curse we may remoue from you the impediments of the blessing
and happy shall you be if you make such a vse of it

as the priest is commanded to pronounce the curse so is he commanded to pronounce it with a lowd voyce he must not be afraid to vtter it and his voyce must be so lowd as that all israel may heare the must not suffer any to be ignorant of it that which concernes all must be made knowne vnto all and the greater things are the more nestly they must be prest
we cannot doe you greater wrong then conceale from you that which concernes you so neere and if we doe not worke powerfully into your consciences the terror of this curse we should bring a curse vpon our selues

for cursed is he that doeth the worke of the lord negligently

but hasten to the last point that will tell vs who is to approue this curse that is pronounced by the priest and there we find that they are the people all the people shall say amen
amen to the curse
if it were the blessing no doubt but all would say amen but all must say amen to the curse also
god will haue vs set our seale as well to his iustice as to his mercie and confesse that we subscribe to both
we that is prince priest and people all must shew their loue vnto that which is good and detestation of that which is ill

it is true that sixe of the tribes stood vpon mount gerizzim to blesse and sixe vpon mount ebal to curse
whereupon it is wittily obserued by the ancients that the sixe tribes that blessed were the children of iacobs wiues and represent those that ingenuously serut

god out of loue to his goodnesse the other sixe tribes that stood vpon mount ebal to curse were the children of his all sauing rvben that had lost his birthright and zabvlon the youngest of his wiues children and these represent those that serue god in a seruile manner and onely for feare of the curse
and verily the members of the visible chvrch differ so and shall fare accordingly diuersis diuersa retributio all are not alike neither shall they sare alike christ shall say to some come ye blessed and to others goe ye cursed
though this be true yet doubt not but all the twelue tribes sayd amen as well to the curse as to the blessing for both concerned them all as it appeares in the next chapter
but that which chuse to obserue vnto you is a remarkable obligation vnto obedience
we read that when the israelites were returned from the babylonian captiuitie

and fell to inordinatenesse in their marriages that nehemiah did not onely make them put away their wiues but also to come to the oath and curse that they would not relapse any more into the same sinne
in the storie of asa we read the verie like practise

when that king had reformed idolatry he by oath made the people bind themselues to god not to returne vnto it againe
strange obligations a man would thinke but they take their example from god himselfe here we find the originall patterne of such obligations
yea you shall find that god not onely in generall layeth such tyes vpon men to hold them in from sinne but also in a personall inquirie of the suspected adulteresse after the priest had sayd vnto her these words if thou be guiltie

this water of iealousie that causeth the curse shall goe into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot the woman was to answer amen amen
now if god in a personall tryall thought it sit to make the woman lay a curse vpon her owne soule if she were guiltie what wonder if to preuent sinne he would haue his people enter into this generall curse
god knoweth that there are such remainders of good principles in our conscience if we be but naturall men how much more if we be christians that we can discerne sinne and the haynousnesse thereof and also the desert or punishment due vnto it
yea as it appeares by davids answer to nathan

in another mans case we are verie likely to be forward in our iudgement
god therefore taketh vs when we are most likely to speake as we thinke that so he might leaue no place vnto tergiuersation when he enters into iudgement with vs for our sinnes neither might wo complaine of his seueritie if he punish vs as we deserue seeing with our owne mouthes we haue pronounced without all exception of our selues or others this iudgement on our sinne

but as told you that maledictus doth signifie either meritum what we deserue or iudicium that which is inflicted so must amen be vnderstood as an acknowledgement of the truth of our desert and a wish of that which is to be inflicted
the acknowledgement we must make absolutely but the wish we must make conditionally if we doe not

repent and if we doe not repent amen is an vndoubted prophesie that we shall be curst indeed

will conclude god would haue this imprecation made when the people were come into the holy land to signifie first that as he had made good his word vnto them in bringing them to the good land which he promised so they were to make good their word vnto him and liue as they profest
secondly by the malediction pronounced in the holy land they were to conceiue that neither their place nor their calling did free them from the curse if they liued otherwise then they ought
and by this formall malediction they were to conceiue not onely in generall how hatefull sinne is vnto god but also that these sinnes here specified are in the number of the most haynous
which you that are the penitents must take speciall notice of for though your sinnes are vnequally haynous and therefore deserue not an equall curse yet are they both verie haynous and the curse is verie grieuous that either of them deserues
pray god that by that which we haue heard we may all be perswaded to keepe our vessels in honor and not in the lusts of concupiscence as doe the gentiles which know not god and for you that are the penitents pray that you may duly consider what iudgements you now feele and may farther feare for your sinnes that you may haue grace to make vse of the churches censures and be humbled as you ought by them that so timely preuenting by religiously trembling at the judgements of god that hang ouer you and may make a fearefull desolation of you you may returne to god in grace and he may returne to you in mercie he may be reconciled vnto you and you may haue peace with him for euer
to this prayer made for our selues made for these penitents let vs all penitents and spectators let all the people say amen

a sermon preached in the cathedral chvrch of wels one doing penance for having two wives
epigraph

malachi
verse
and did not he make one yet had he aboundance of spirit and wherefore one because he sought a godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deale treacherously against the wife of his youth

man being in honour continued not but became as the beasts that perish so we read in the psalme and experience teacheth that whatsoeuer good he hath since medled with he hath made it as changable as himselfe yea he hath euer changed it as he did himselfe from better into worse of good he hath made it starke naught
but this disposition of his hath transsormed into it selfe no vertue so much as that of chastitie
read leuit

see there how brutish it is become there is nothing there forbidden which was not practised by men and if practised we may conclude that man hath degenerated into a verie beast
well in such a case in so base a disposition what is the remedy what is the best way to bring man to himselfe again that he may recouer that honor whereof he hath depriued himselfe surely there is no better way then to set before him his originall and to perswade his conformitie thereunto
for as in the articles of faith it is safest to beleeue what was first deliuered so in the rules of our manners it is best to obserue what was first commanded
the reason is plaine god gaue the first beginning both to our faith and to our manners and from our most wise and most holy god nothing could proceed that was not most righteous and most true
out of this principle doth malachi worke the reparation of a breach which the iewes had made vpon the seuenth commandement
the breach was polygamie or multiplying of wiues whereof the

reparation is a reducing of them to the first institution of marriage and this is done in those words that now haue read vnto you

herein we haue first a text of the law and did he not make one then a sermon of the prophet made thereon yet had he the residue of spirit and wherefore one because
but more distinctly
in the text of the law we will consider first the matter that is contained in it then the manner how the prophet doth vrge it
the matter sets before vs a worke and a workmaster
the worke is the making of one the workmaster was he both clauses are darke because the words are short
to cleere them we must supply out of genesis and there we find that this one was one adam and the he that made him was the lord god god made one out of one male he made one female by creation and by coniunction he made that female to be one againe with that male out of which he tooke her
this is the matter
the manner of the prophets arguing the text is powerfull that which in genesis is a plaine narration is here turned into a question and in such questions the holy ghost doth report himselfe vnto the consciences of those that heare whether to their knowledge he speake not truth
so must you vnderstand those words did he not make one

hauing proposed his text the prophet maketh a short but a full sermon hereupon for it consists of a doctrine and an exhortation
the doctrine openeth the reason of gods worke and the prophet argues in effect thus god made but one was it because he could make no more or because he would make no more certainly not because he could not for he had aboundance of spirit then it was because he would not
and indeed all gods workes ad extra as the schooles call them the workes of creation prouidence redemption are all arbitrarie they come from his will but such a will as is not blind it is guided by his wisedome and his will prescribes nothing whereof his wisedome cannot yeeld a reason and sometimes he is pleased to shew that reason to vs who otherwise are bound to rest satisfied with the signification of his holy will therefore the prophet goeth on in his arguing wherefore one what is the reason of this will of god and he answereth by the direction of gods spirit that it was expedient it should be so two wayes expedient
first expedient in nature god sought for seed he would haue men multiply and increase which could not be except he had made one and if he had made more then one it could not well haue beene
secondly it was expedient in grace also for though god would haue men multiply yet would he not haue them multiply otherwise then beseemed the children of god he sought a holy seed
for these ends was god pleased thus to order his workes and vpon this doctrine of the ends doth the prophet ground an exhortation it consists of two parts because in the case of mariage we owe a double respect one to our selues another to our mate
the respect we owe to our selues is that we must watch ouer our better

part take heed to our spirit
the respect we owe to our mate is we must not violate the faith plighted to her let no man deale treacherously with his wife especially if she be the wife of his youth that is he married her when he was young the longer they haue beene marryed together the more should they be from dealing falsely one with the other

you see the particulars of the text and of the sermon that we may better vnderstand them and their fitnesse for this occasion will open them a little more fully pray god may doe it profitably also
come we then to the text of the law to the matter contained therein
will not trouble you with the diuers translations and varietie of interpretations suitable thereunto leaue that to the schooles our chvrch hath made a choyce and that choyce agrees well with the originall we will rest contented with that and according to it frame our obseruations
told you that the words set before vs a worke and a workemaster yet neither doth plainly appeare they are onely pointed at here but exprest gen
whence supplyed the name of adam and the name of god whereof the first is the worke and the second the workmaster so that then the words will sound thus god made one adam
let vs take these parts asunder

the name of adam is not to be vnderstood vulgarly but as the holy ghost vseth it and so it comprehends both sexes so we read gen
god created adam male and female made he them in the of genesis more plainly god made man male and female and called them adam so that the name adam being but one is commonly two the male and the female
as they are one in name so are they in nature also we read gen
that god made the female out of the rib of the male for he would haue her to be like him

and he confest her to be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
nec illud otiose saith st ambrosh it is worth our marking that god did not make the woman of the same earth whereof he made man but he made eve of the rib of adam to giue vs to vnderstand that there is but one body in them both and that one body the onely fountaine of all mankind

the platonists androgunos is but a corruption of this truth

as man was by creation made two but of like substance and so continued still one both in name and nature so by a second work they were made yet more one that is by marriage

for that maketh two one flesh two say the septuagint adde that word vnto moses his text and christ approues it in the gospel

st pavl therein followeth christ and the words of marriage are the man shall cleaue to his wife therefore doth the apostle call the wife undefined span alphabet the husband undefined span alphabet cor
lesse then one there could not be and be a naturall propagation and more then one there should not be and that propagation be orderly

but this onenesse is principall or accessorie the principall is onenesse

of coniugall power and coniugall affection coniugall power for though in other things the man is superiour to the woman the husband to his wife

because as the apostle teacheth she is of him and for him and therefore is called undefined span alphabet

yet in coniugall power they are equall
man hath no power ouer his body no more hath the woman ouer hers each is in the others power and that in solidum they haue coequall command each ouer the other
so likewise their coniugall affections should be coequall they should embrace each the other with entire and vndeuided loue no reseruation of that kind may be endured by the bond of wedlocke on either side the mans or the womans

it is true that licentiousnesse hath distinguished where the law hath not distinguished and libertie hath beene granted to men to share their bodyes and their affections amongst many women but women are denyed that libertie and haue euer beene required to confine their affections to one man and communicate their bodyes to no more then one which distinction of licentiousnesse hath specious grounds first they say the ends of marriage are lesse preiudiced if the libertie be granted vnto men then if it should be granted vnto women are they preiudiced then preiudiced but nothing should be granted that doth preiudice those ends
away then with that apologie for lust
there is another taken from the example of the patriarkes and indeed so the iewes vnderstand this text as if it were an allegation of the fathers to proue polygamie and read it thus an non vnus fecit did not our father abraham take many wiues and yet he had aboundance of spirit aboundance of the spirit and grace of god he know what he did and he did nothing amisse why should not we imitate him but supposing that reading to this obiection in the next words the prophet shapes an answer he sought an holy seed that is as the fathers say non fecit propter libidinem sed propter orbitatem he did it not to satissie his lust but that he might haue an heire according to gods promise
and if you looke vpon the storie of the patriarkes abraham and iacob you shall find that though they had more wiues then one yet neuer had they them out of lust no nor out of their owne choyce abraham tooke hagar but he was importuned to doe it by his wife sara yea and sara too would haue the child reputed hers as borne vpon her knees iacob chose but one wife and that was rachel leah was put vpon him by deceipt and the two mayds by the opportunitie of his wiues

the after times were worse and of all the kings of israel were most licentious they tooke too much after the heathen kings but their fact can be no good president because expresly forbidden by a speciall law deut
some excuse them by a dispensation as likewise the patriarkes but being vrged to shew it they are saine to supply the silence of the bible with a conceipt that the first that swarued from the law had his warrant by inspiration and that others tooke their allowance from his example
but the excuse is dangerous

and vngrounded we may not make so bold with gods law rather may we thinke that the best of the patriarkes were but men and that they were carryed away with the error of their times and that god in mercie bore with that as with other their imperfections but we may not venter to say his iustice did allow it
a dispensation is an allowance of iustice notwithstanding the law but a permission is a forbearance of mercie which doth not proceed against sinne according to the rigour of the law either to checke or to correct it
we may grant the patriarkes the benefit of such a mercifull permission but a legall dispensation we cannot grant them without better proofe
as for gods giuing of savls wiues into davids bosome sam

we are to vnderstand nathan of those whom savl neuer knew otherwise they will iustifie incest in the right line which david so abhorred that he would neuer keep companie with those concubines which absalon had abused much lesse would he admit into his bosome any woman which his had knowne

vnto this principall onenesse we must adde the accessorie of honor and concord
onenesse of honor for vxor fulget radijs mariti vt luna solis when a man marryeth a woman with his body he doth worship her and endow her with all his worldly goods that is she becomes as noble and as rich as he is reseruing alwayes the supremacie vnto man meane reuerence to his person which is the fountaine of her honor and obedience to his command in dispencing the goods which she holdeth from him in chiefe
onenesse of concord is a like affection and disposition in prosperitie and aduersitie which can neuer stand with polygamie the mother of iealousie and iealousie is the mother of discord as you may gather out of the storie of sara and hagar rachel and leah and the wiues of elcanah samvels father the best mens families haue not auoyded it

all this while that haue spoken of the onenesse in marryage you must not mistake as some haue done for there are two kinds of polygamie simultanea and successiua the hauing of more wiues successiuely or at one time
some haue chastitie as some haue shrunke it

the montanists as appeares by tertvllian in his booke de undefined span alphabet and the nouatians as we learne out of theodoret held that if a man buried one wife he might not marrie an other
and the chvrch of rome cannot excuse it selfe from this error in that it forbiddeth the blessing of second marriages in the chvrch and suffereth not any that hath had a second wife to enter into holy orders or that hath married a widow which is interpreted polygamie
but this kind of polygamie was neuer forbidden by any law it is not onely allowed rom
but commanded also tim


the councell of nice hath made a canon in defence of it and the fathers iustifie it
it is then onely polygamia simultanea the hauing of many wiues together that is condemned by my text by the old

testament

by the new and by the fathers as they haue occasion to speake either of the institution of marriage deliuered in genesis or the interpretation of our sauiour christ in st mathew which polygamie had its originall from lamech one of caines posteritie
and this must you the penitent obserue as that which giueth the first light vnto you of your sinne you haue offended against the onenesse of marriage

as you haue offended against the onenesse the worke so haue you against the workemaster he is the second part that pointed out in the text of the law for he is the cause of this onenesse

in wedlocke there are three persons to be obserued first the male secondly the female and thirdly god that ioyneth them together looke vpon the storie in genesis there you shall find that adam non arripuit euam sed expectauit deum adducentem he did not carue for himselfe

but stayed for gods consent and therefore our sauiour christ saith

that god conioyned in marriage and solomon saith that it is pactum dei the couenant of god so that the lawfull coniunction of man and wife is not onely gods ordinance but gods act also he doth it by himselfe or his minister the verie heathen thought so that had a seuerall god president not onely of the substantiall parts but also of euerie circumstance of their marriage
will not trouble you with enumeration of them
obserue then the interueniencie of god in wedlocke which doth improue it though not to the state of a romish sacrament yet to the condition of a sacred thing and so we should esteeme it
and the act of god in ioyning adam and eve must be accounted a reall law the sampler whereunto all other wedlockes were to conforme themselues as exemplysications our sauiour christ teacheth vs so to vnderstand it

and our prophet doth here worke vpon it as being such
but why doe call to witnesse these sacred authors the light of reason taught it the philosopher aristotle giueth it for a law in his politicks and in his oeconomicks the romane emperour

in his digests

in the code thought it reasonable to put it into their lawes

the canonists make it their ground against marriage after diuorce and our law hath prouided for it

seeing so many lawes attend gods legall fact it cannot be denyed but that polygamie is a sinne against this it cannot be denyed but that polygamie is a sinne against the as well as against his law
whence you the penitent may make a farther discouerie of your sinne you haue offended against the onenesse in marriage not onely that which god hath commanded but also that onenesse which god himselfe by his owne act hath made

and if this anabaptisticall libertie of hauing many wiues so offend for anabaptists in this dotage of the world and their abettors haue beene the authours and practisers of these masterlesse lusts how odious is the communitie of wiues and the familists worke of darkenesse

surely

though he that is ioyned to a harlot as the apostle speaketh be one flesh yet that onenesse is not of gods making for he maketh none one but according to the law before specified

and let this suffice for the matter of the text come now to the manner

the manner is powerfull for malachi deliuereth it in forme of a question which layeth the matter close to the conscience did he not make one is as much as can you deny it doth not the law expresly say it this is an vndeniable truth so that he worketh vpon a known principle and giueth vs to vnderstand that principles of faith and good manners should be familiarly knowne the catechisticall points should be euerie bodyes study and they should be ready with vs vpon all occasions to resolue our consciences they are the best guid of our iudgements when we come to try the conclusions that learned men deduce from them yea if we hold them we need not be perplexed in conscience if we haue not skill enough to iudge of the controuersies that doe arise concerning those conclusions
it is true that christ biddeth vs search the scripture

and st pavl willeth vs to let the word of god dwell richly in vs and those that are of full age should by reason of vse haue their senses exercised to discerne good and euill
but if our breeding haue not beene so good nor our capacitie so great we must be sure to hold the foundation the principles of religion must not be strange vnto vs if we take not so much paines as to be well skild in them our state to is but comfortlesse

this would haue them take notice of who neither themselues know their catechisme nor take care that their children and seruants according to the law be bred vp therein the prophets sermon could little haue profited these iewes had they not been acquainted with his sext and because the common people know not much of their catechisme they profit little by our sermons for the truth hereof report me to your owne consciences as the prophet here doth for the vndoubtednesse of his text
haue done with the text of the law come now to the sermon of the prophet

told you it is short but full for it hath the two parts of a sermon whereof the first is doctrine and here is a indicious one
to make it plaine you must conceiue that the prophet argues vpon his text thus god made but one was it because he could make no more or because he would not it was not because he could not for he had aboundance of spirit or as some read excellencie ioyne them together and the sense will be full anoundance of excellent spirit
the words may point out either gods power or his store and signifie that neither his power was enfeebled by the creation of one nor his store exhausted
and indeed touching his power how should that be enfeebled which is infinite sine numero sine mensura as st bernard speaketh it is not restrayned with any bounds it is true that his will doth not alwayes extend as farre as his power but his power neuer commeth

short of his will

for he doth whatsoeuer he will both in heauen and in earth neither is any thing impossible vnto him
neither is the abundance of his excellent store any whit lesse consider but the infinite number of angels which he made before he made man daniel saith that thousand thousands ministred vnto him

and ten thousand times ten thousands stood before him or looke to that which was done after he made that one looke how many millions of men there haue beene since he created that one

so many spirits hath he created for he is the father of our spirits

and when we dye the preacher saith they returne to god that gaue them vs

obserue that whereas man consisteth of a body and a soule there could be no question but god had stuffe enough to make more bodyes all the doubt was of the soule therefore the prophet toucheth at that and not at the other and giues vs to vnderstand that it was as easie to gods power to breathe more spirits of life as of the dust of the earth or ribbe of man to make more bodyes
obserue secondly that the addition of excellencie is ioyned with spirit to shew the dignitie of the soule of man
beasts haue soules no lesse then men but theirs compared to ours are verie base our soule comes from heauen theirs from the earth we must not vnderualue this precious guift of god nor let any vnruly lusts tell the world that the soule that dwelleth in vs is not much better conditioned then that of a beast
you that are the penitent take notice of this take notice how your fact hath debased your soule
it is cleare then that god did not make but one because he could make no more whereupon it will follow that the reason why he made but one was because he would not and indeed all gods outward workes are arbitrarie they depend vpon his will neither could any thing haue forced them against his will whether they be workes of the creation of the prouidence or of the redemption whatsoeuer outward worke he doth commeth freely from him

hauing found out this generall cause a man would thinke the prophet might haue rested here for who should aske an account of gods will which prescribes to all things and whereon our faith may securely rest because it is a most holy ground it is the rule of righteousnesse a man may boldly securely submit to it without disputes obey it in the greatest articles of our faith as the mysterie of the trinitie of the incarnation we rest vpon his bare word and we should doe ill if we did enquire beyond it such busie curiositie in the highest straines of religion bred the old heresies and is the mother of many controuersies that now disquiet the chvrch
but yet this we must hold that in all outward workes gods will is guided by his wisdome

and he doth all things according to the counsell of his will as the apostle speaketh
and although sometimes he is pleased to try our faith by his absolute commands yet oftentimes especially in moralities he vouchsafeth to condescend to our infirmity and cherish

our obedience by yeelding a reason of his doings and so settles our disputing wits as he doth in this place by the prophet whose resolution of the doubt is verie full for he not onely refutes error but declares the truth wherein he goeth so farre as to set downe not onely the generall but the particular cause also of gods making one and so maketh our vnderstanding happy for felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas farther our vnderstanding cannot goe and when it commeth so farre if euer it will be quiet and obey readily

let vs come then vnto the reason which god is pleased to yeeld it is in effect this
it was expedient it should be so in regard both of nature and grace
in regard of nature quaesiuit semen god would haue mankind propagated in regard of grace quaesiuit semen sanctum he would haue mankind propagated as beseemed his children for these ends was god pleased so to order his worke to make one and but one

but let vs take these branches asunder
first he sought seed and is that hindred by many wiues a man would thinke it is farthered rather for the more wiues a man hath the more children may he haue
a man would thinke so but it is not so for god hath proportioned the strength of one man to the vse of one woman and if he so confine his lust he shall haue more strength of body and length of life to propagate his seed such seed as may be fit for propagation
but the man that is giuen to many women doth sooner decay the state of his body becomes barren before his time or begetteth children that are naturally eunuches for the children of lustfull persons doe seldome proue fruitfull
as for women that communicate their bodyes to many men their case is much more such looke into the stewes and you shall see that those common harlots are as barren of children as they are excessiue in lust neither are they more fruitfull that carrie their sinne more closely
adde hereunto

that saying of the sonne of syrach bastard plants take no roots if two become one and that one be not of gods making they cannot looke for gods blessing the more of such ones the more vnhappy ones
therefore that gods blessing which in the creation he gaue to man saying multiply and increase might be poured out vpon man in full measure he made but one

as he said a seed so he said a holy seed he would haue men multiply but so as beseemes the children of god as was most expedient for the state of grace
and here the phrase is to be obserued that which we render holy seed is in the originall the seed of god it may allude to diuers stories
first to that of the creation

god made man after his image after the image of god made he them both male and female

therefore st lvke fetcheth adams pedigree from god god eleuated the nature of man whom he made answerable to the couenant whereinto he entered and man became not onely a sociable creature but also a member of the chvrch and god would haue them multiply as such bring forth children after his image answerable to the honor

which in the creation he hath done them
a second allusion of this phrase may be to the storie of the separation which after the fall was made betweene the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent the seed of enos and of cain
the seed of enos that continued in the couenant

and had the seed of god as st iohn speaketh abiding in them were called the sonnes of god and they were to continue on a posteritie like vnto themselues partakers of the same grace heires of the same promises the chvrch was to be perpetuated in their seed
but as adam tooke a fall and then brought out children after his owne image not gods so these sonnes of god coupled themselues with the daughters of men and of them were borne giants such mongrels such monsters as lost the seed of god and therefore were swept away with the flood
god reuiued his seed a third time by noar in sem and of sems posteritie chose abraham

whose posteritie he made a kingdome of priests a holy nation and forbad them to profaine the holy of the lord in mingling themselues with the cursed of cham to continue their prerogatiue
the storie of ezra and nehemiah shew how the iewes transgrest this commandement and how much those good men were offended therewith and prest the reformation thereof our prophet that liued about those times may allude thereunto

but whatsoeuer did occasion the phrase the issue of polygamie must needs be an vnholy a bastard a cursed seed
god in his couenant promiseth to be our god and the god of our seed but it is of our seed lawfully begotten

therefore in the law he commandeth that a bastard shall not come into the congregation of israel vnto the third generation

the booke of wisedome amplyfieth this point the children of adulterers shall not come to perfection and the seed of the vnrighteous bed shall be rooted out the like you may read eccl
but because those bookes are apochryphall

here what iob saith of adulterie it is a sinne to be condemned it will deuour vnto destruction and it would root out all my posteritie
and no wonder that god dealeth so with bastards for which of vs if he haue land entailed entailes it otherwise then vpon heires lawfully begotten if we thinke bastards vnworthy to inherite our lands here on earth shall god thinke them worthy to be heires of the kingdome of heauen will not condemne all bastards to hell know iephta found fauour with god and so no doubt haue many others but that commeth to passe by gods extraordinarie mercie ordinarie promise we haue none that they shall doe well

yea obserue and you shall find that they seldome keepe a meane if good verie good and if they be bad they are verie bad and parents of such children haue reason rather to feare the worst then hope the best for though god at doth often pardon sinnes yet he giues no encouragement to sinners
you that are the penitent take this to heart your second match being plaine adulterie the children borne in such wedlocke must needs be bastards and being

bastards they are not the holy seed yea they are a seed that is cursed so cursed for your fault that as much as in you lyeth you strip them of all blessings on earth and in heauen they are fauoured by the law neither of god nor men
and so great wrong done to them should goe to your verie heart you haue sinned against your children not onely against your owne body

and let this suffice concerning the doctrine that is in the prophets sermon come now to the exhortation which he deduceth therefrom
the exhortation is double according to the double respect which we owe
the first is to our selues keepe your selues in your spirit or take heed to your spirit

we must take care of our whole man the outward and inward for touching the outward the apostles rule is

we must keepe our vessels in honour we may not defile the temples of god we may not take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot we must be chast propter carnem christi as ignativs speaketh because we are bone of christs bone and flesh of his flesh

but as we must take care of our bodyes so must we much more take care of our soules for it is in vaine to keepe the body chast and to retaine an adulterous heart for an adulterous heart though it be peccatum sine teste it hath no man to witnesse it yet is it peccatum

god will doome it for sinne yea if a man stop not lust in his heart

he will not be master of it in his body for ex abundantia cordis out of the aboundance of the heart the mouth speaketh out of that commeth adulteries and fornications
but qui adinngit spiritui adimit carni the better the soule is the better will the body be therefore is temperance properly called undefined span alphabet a keeping of a man in his right wits because so long as a man hath his wits about him he is master of his lusts but no sooner hath dalilah brought that sampson asleepe but the philistims will be vpon him and depriue him of his strength he will be ouertaken with this lustfull epilepsie and prophane the temple of the lord

but to open this point a little farther we must obserue that as we haue sensuall and reasonable faculties so it was gods pleasure that those actions which are elicitae or come naturally from the sensuall faculties should also be imperatae ordered and limited by the rationall therefore is the rationall facultie called undefined span alphabet the guid and gouernour of our life and he deserues not the name of a man whose sense is not subiect vnto reason

but the spirit doth not onely note the reasonable soule but in an argument concerning the chvrch it meaneth that soule as it is regenerated by grace and then it putteth vs in mind that the care of our soules must be more then reasonable it must be spirituall and not onely the best wit of man which is corrupt as appeares in the vnchast chastitie of the heathen but the sanctifying grace of god must set bounds to our lusts which will suffer them to passe no farther then they are

allowed by gods law
a man is an excellent creature if he be but a man if he keepe his reasonable spirit how much more excellent would a christian man be if he could continue a christian and preserue in himselfe the spirit of grace

may not omit the word keepe it willeth vs to set a watch because we are apt to run riot whether the spirit signifie reason or grace we must watch

if reason we must watch that we admit not into our imaginations nor suffer our wits to discourse vpon lustfull fancies we liue in the middest of temptations and none are more insinuating then those that are pleasurable we must take heed therefore that our reason be not betwitched by them they will cunningly euchant vs and transforme vs into beasts before we are aware wherefore we must keepe a watch ouer our reason and not onely ouer reason but ouer grace also that we grieue not the holy spirit that we quench him not that we doe not dispite him

for the holy spirit of discipline will not abide in a soule that is disposed vnto sinne adspicis vt veniant ad candida tect a columbae the spirit delighteth to dwell in persons himselfe being chast in those that are chast
wherefore we must keepe our spirits that for our vnchastitie the spirit of god forsake vs not

you haue the first branch of the exhortation the second followeth

this biddeth vs be carefull of that respect which we owe vnto our mate let no man deale treacherously with his wife
a wife a little before my text is called a mans companion and the wife of his couenant now you know that fraud in fellowship is abominable especially if that fellowship be established by couenant as wedsocke is and no fellowship vpon straiter couenants then wedlocke for therein there is a double couenant pactum hominis and pactum dei the persons contracting doe plight their faith each to other that is pactum hominis then god he commeth in as a partie to knit the knot and will haue this mutuall stipulation made in his sight and in his name so that both stand bound to god not onely to themselues neuer to loose this knot till death them depart
he then that deales treacherously with his wife by taking another while she liues is guiltie not onely of sinne against her but also against god and he should be so guiltie though he were diuorced diuorce may goe so farre as to part their companie for a time but it dissolues not the bond of matrimonie no though both sides be willing to haue it dissolued they may renounce their owne right they cannot renounce gods without his consent the obligation which he layeth vpon them cannot be cancelled he that marrieth a second wife euen after diuorce deales treacherously for marriage implyes indiuiduam vitae consuetudinem so strait a tye that whom god hath conioyued

no man can put asunder and diuorce was granted onely for the hardnesse of the iewes hearts therefore they that are diuorced must be reconciled againe or remaine vnmarried to any other
and if it be adulterie vpon diuorce to marrie againe how much more is it

adulterie to marrie without a diuorce and this is your case which are the penitent
know you had a faire pretence your wife was lewd she ran from you she was seuen yeeres absent you heard she was dead faire pretences and they doe you this good that they keepe off from you the stroake of seuerer iustice
but though they diminish your fault they doe not altogether excuse it the death of your wife was not hastily to be belieued you should haue legally proued it before you ventred vpon a second match
and as for her forsaking you it was a foule fault but you ought not to haue recompenced euill with euill and become an adulterer because she was an adulteresse if you will partake of her sinne you must partake of her punishment at least in part the full punishment of adulterie is verie great temporall eternall in this life moses law did cut off adulterers by death

and if the adulterer be a polygamist our law also excepting in some cases inflicteth death vpon him

the apostles canon doth excommunicate him
neither is an adulterer onely punishable in this world his case is much worse in the world to come for the apostle threatens it with eternall death except they repent

god himselfe will iudge adulterers and they shall neuer enter into the kingdome of heauen

make you then good vse of this your ecclesiasticall penance that so you may preuent gods eternall vengeance
there is one clause more in this second branch of the exhortation whereat will touch and so end
the person against whom the iowe offended is here called the wife of his youth he marryed her in his younger yeeres and now in his elder set his affection vpon some other
it is thought that the iewes returning from captiuitie brought with them their wiues poore in state worne and withered in their bodyes with carking and caring and that thereupon to relieue their wants and satisfie their lusts with richer and fairer women they fell to these second matches
and indeed pouertie and deformitie are shrewd temptations to worldly and carnall men but this phrase teacheth that the woman whom a man loueth in youth he must loue her in age the longer they haue beene wedded the more must be their loue and it is a greater fault to play false with an old wife then with a young bride
men must euer keepe in mind the promise they made at their marriage take thee to my wedded wife to haue and to hold for better for worse for richer for poorer in sicknesse and in health till death vs doe part

but end and solomon shall make my conclusion

drinke waters out of thine owne cisterne and running waters out of thine owne well let the fountaines be dispersed abroad and riuers of waters in the streetes let them be onely thine owne and not strangers with thee let the fountaine be blessed and reioyce with the wife of thy youth let her be as the louing hind and pleasant roe let her breasts satisfie thee at all

times and be thou rauisht alwayes with her loue
and why wilt thou my sonne be rauisht with a strange woman and embrace the bosome of a stranger for the wayes of man are before the eyes of the lord and he pondereth all his doings
let vs all walke in the spirit and not in the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof

so shall god blesse vs and our posteritie here on earth and after this life we shall be reckoned in the number of those virgines which follow the lambe wheresoeuer he goeth
amen

epigraph

timoth

verse let the woman learne in silence with all subiection
but suffer not a woman to teach nor to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man but to be in silence
for adam was first formed then eue and adam was not deceiued but the woman being deceiued was in the transgression

this epistle is a booke of ecclesiasticall canons therein st pavl doth instruct timothie bishop of ephesus how he should guid his censures in regard as well of the discipline as the doctrine of the chvrch
amongst others in this chapter we haue two canons which serue to correct the of christian women
their was twofold they did glorie in the monument of their shame and they aduanced themselues aboue the condition of their sex
the monument of shame is apparell for there was no need thereof while we were cloathed with innocencie but when the conscience of our sinne made vs loathsome in our eyes then did we betake our selues vnto this couert to hide our vile selues from our counfounded senses we put on cloathes
vpon this ground st pavl tels women may adde men also for we liue in an age wherein it is hard

to say whether in cloathes men grow more womannish or women more mannish but here st pavl tels women that if they will be gaye and fine indeed they must attire themselues according to that fashion whereinto god at first put them not according to that which sinne hath forced vpon them they must adorne themselues not with the burnished and embelished elements or rather excrements of this lower world but with the graces and vertues that come from heauen so shall they haue a conuersation well suited with their profession and make themselues louely in the eyes as well of god as men
this is the summe of the first canon the canon that corrects womens glorying in the monument of shame which is their apparell

to this st pavl adds a second which corrects their aduancing themselues aboue their sexe and it is contained in those words which now haue read vnto you
the better to vnderstand this canon we must resolue it into a rule and the reason which the apostle giues for the same
in the rule we shall see what it is and who prescribes it
the rule is a precept which first doth range and then doth qualifie women answerable to their ranke
in the schoole of christ there are masters and schollers women are placed amongst schollers they must learne yea so are they placed amongst schollers that they may neuer hope to be masters for undefined span alphabet they can haue no licence to teach the ground whereof is a generall maxime they may not undefined span alphabet vsurpe vpon men if absolutely women may not be superior to men then may they not be in ecclesiasticall things for teaching imports a superioritie
women being thus ranged must be qualified answerable to their ranke being schollers they must haue the qualities of schollers those are two filence and obedience silence they must vse their eares and not their tongues about sacred things they must be more forward to heare then to speake they must learne with silence and vnto their silence they must adde obedience they must not giue but take instructions and put in practise what they are taught they must learne with all subiection
this is the rule
but who prescribes it so harsh a rule had need of a verie good author women will otherwise be hard of beliefe and surely this hath a good one it is st pavl his stile in the preface of this epistle shews his warrant he is an apostle of iesvs christ he deliuers it not in his owne name but in his masters as his steward so much is intimated in the word undefined span alphabet whence comes undefined span alphabet which signifieth a steward so that we cannot him but we question christs truth
the authoritie of this rule then descends from heauen and if it doe the bare promulgating of it requires that we credit it

but as god doth all things not onely according to his will but the counsell of his will euen so his words are decrees not onely of his will but also of his counsell they haue a reason and for strengthening of our faith the holy ghost though he be not bound yet is he often

pleased to expresse the same he doth it in this place
and the reason of this rule is taken first from the creation then from the fall

from the creation thus doth the apostle argue woman must be subiect vnto man for adam was first framed and then eue the precedencie in being giues a prerogatiue of commanding
but this was a reall ordinance and woman it should seeme tooke no notice of it for eve began quickly to be a teacher of adam
she did so but with verie ill successe for she was seduced she discouered the weaknesse of her iudgement and that not in a matter of speculation but of practise for she was in the transgression she brake gods bonds and cast his cords from her by her and not by adam or rather by her taking vpon her to teach adam came sinne into the world
hereupon the apostle concludes that because woman hath giuen so wofull a proofe of her vntowardlynesse in teaching of man she must forbeare for euer to meddle with that function and man must maintaine that authoritie which god hath giuen him ouer a woman
these are the contents of this second canon whereof suitable vnto this occasion will now speake briefly and in their order
begin with the rule
told you it is a precept wherein we must see first how women are ranged
the name of man and woman which in the originall are undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet haue a double signification they are vnderstood ratione either sexus or coniugij they note in generall male and female or in speciall such of either sexe as are ioyned in wedlocke
the apostle in this place makes vse of the generall signification but so that his doctrine may be applyed also to the speciall for if in generall women be so subiected vnto men wedlocke makes no alteration in this case but doth much more subiect a wife vnto her husband and in their measure must all the particulars of this text hold in the oeconomicks though here they be handled as they are to be vnderstood in the ecclesiasticks
to come then nearer my text
the chvrch is a societie and therefore consists of different parts there must be in it superiours and inferiours this is taught vs by the resemblance that is made between it and a kingdome wherein there is a soueraigne and subiects betweene it and a citie wherein there are magistrates and commons betweene it and an army with banners wherein there are captaines and souldiers betweene it and an house wherein there is a master and his family finally betweene it and our naturall body wherein there are directing and obeying parts
st pavl handling this last resemblance cor
shewes the ground of this subordination of persons as in all societies so in the chvrch to be undefined span alphabet the comlinesse and commoditie of the societie

this being a generall course which god hath set down in societies

it must be enquired first what be the different parts of a chvrch and then who are assigned to either part
the parts are exprest in my text and so also are the parties that are assigned to beare those parts
the parts are teachers and learners all members of the chvrch come vnder this diuision for they are either pastors or people ghostly fathers or ghostly children stewards or the houshold of god such as guid or are guided vnto heauen

this being plaine that there are but these two parts the second enquirie is what parties are assigned to beare them and here we find that god imposeth the person of a learner vpon the woman and of a teacher vpon the man
though the knowledge and the feare of god are common to men and women for women also are in the couenant and must not be ignorant of the articles thereof especially seeing god hath vouchsafed them to be spirituall both kings and priests yet the administration of sacred things is the peculiar of men
in the beginning of the world god layed this function vpon the first borne that was male after the deliuerance out of the aegyptian captiuitie god in steed of the chose the tribe of leuie vnto this seruice to be performed onely by the males thereof after christ was inaugurated to the office of a mediator he chose twelue men to be his apostles and to them gaue order for the continuance of the ministerie in that sexe
it is true that god extraordinarily in both testaments raysed vp prophetesses according to that of ioel cap

and while the foundation of the chvrch was laying by women he enformed men of his truth yea by a silly woman gaue entrance vnto christianitie in a whole kingdome but the instances are rare and they are workes wherein god shewed himselfe to haue power to dispense with his owne ordinance and dispose at his pleasure his owne guifts but they may not be drawne into example by vs to the preiudice of a well setled ecclesiasticall policie the generall ordinance must hold except women that breake it can shew a dispensation
ordinarie and priests sprang vp amongst the heathen with the corruption of religion who as they had female gods so had those gods for their attendants suitable persons of their owne sexe yea sometimes their had in the poets tales you shall find enough of such trash
the heretickes receiued it from the infidels corrupting holy orders as they did gods sacred truth and had their prophetesses accompanying them yea the petuzians ordained episcopas and presbiter as feminine both bishops and priests
licinius as eusebius reports by a tyrannous law forbad women to assemble in the chvrch with men and commanded them to haue their seuerall congregations to make themselues teachers of their owne sexe but his edict is censured for ridiculous and whether within the chvrch or without the chvrch the calling of women to this sacred function hath beene deemed a prophanation of holy orders the councell of carthage hath a short but a full canon to this purpose

quamuis docta quamuis sancta admit a woman be

neuer so learned neuer so holy yet non presumat she may not presume to meddle with a sacred function it is not to be hoped that any woman will euer be of so vnspotted a life as was the virgine marie nor so well acquainted with the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen yet shall you not find in all the life of christ or after his death during the time which she liued with the apostles that she intermedled with any part of pastorall function
whereupon st bernard was bold to put off an imposture of a priest that made the virgines image to speake vnto him when he entred into a chvrch to performe his deuotion with this wittie answer your ladiship hath forgotten that st pavl forbids women to speake in the church

but if women be allowed to be onely hearers in the seruice of religion it may be thought they haue little to doe whereas indeed it is farre otherwise for not onely st pavl in this epistle sets them out other worke but solomon also prou
hath read an exemplarie lecture of good houswiferie vnto them in which chapter also they may find some libertie that they haue to teach for there is brought in teaching and instructing her sonne solomon and it may be gathered out of the second epistle to timothie that timothy was bred vp in religion by his mother eunice and lois it being out of all question that women are so farre allowed to teach as to instruct them which vnder their husbands are committed to their charge
but the apostles interdict forbids them within doores in the presence of their husbands and likewise abroad in the companie of others especially if they be men to attempt any such thing
if they doe it abroad they vsurpe vpon the pastors function as within doores vpon their husbands for though the place where they meet be not properly a chvrch yet by reason of the vse whereunto they put it their meeting becomes a conuenticle and such acts of a woman are in the eye of the law derogatorie to the authoritie of the pastors as in the eye of reason to the authoritie of man vpon whom it is not lawfull for a woman to vsurpe as followeth in my text
and indeed the generall inhibition that forbids a woman to vsurpe authoritie ouer a man is the ground of this particular they must not be teachers but hearers for teaching carrieth with it a kind of authoritie

but more distinctly to rip vp this generall rule which forbids women to vsurpe authoritie vpon men the word undefined span alphabet imports two things authoritie and exemplaritie words that are authenticall are words of command and such as inferiors must exemplifie and the priuiledge of speaking such words belongs vnto man
for whereas all authoritie is included in three heads rex propheta sacerdos all three are setled in man man hath a kingly power in his house to giue order vnto all businesses which concerne the same and he is appointed a prophet to his family to informe them of the knowledge of god know him saith god of abraham gen
that he will command his children and his houshold after him and they shall keepe the way of the lord
in the law parents are commanded euerie one to teach his children

and st pavl cor
requires women if they will learne any thing to aske their husbands at home which as it taxeth the ignorance of such men as are not able to teach so that they may be able it whets their industry to be more carefull to learne
finally a man is sacerdos the sacrifice of prayer and must be offered by him for his whole family

this did iob practice day by day he sent for and fanctified his children and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all

this which is true in a priuate family is much more true in a which is but a multitude of families and the authoritie in publike must be in persons of that sexe to which it belongeth in priuate
if women intermeddle they doe undefined span alphabet vsurpe vpon the authoritie that is proper to man and then what followes the philosopher will tell you that undefined span alphabet the rule of women is the baine of a family no lesse then tyranny is the baine of a common wealth the reason is plaine they haue more of the heart then the head and their affections their discretion yea whereas in the head there is wit and wisedome women are commonly more wittie then wise for wisedome requires the pondering of circumstances but the forwardnesse of their affections will not suffer women to pause so long whereupon it followes that their resolutions are rash and wilfull which cannot prognosticate any good euents
cornelius agrippa hath tried the best of his wits to aduance them in abilities aboue men but he doth so collude in handling the argument that women may well feare a iudgement will be giuen against them if they come to the barre furnished with no better euidence
happily some woman may be as wise as abigail and some men as silly as natal yet then neither doth man lose his prerogatiue nor woman acquire a title aboue him she may deale with him per viam consilij but not imperij counsell she may command him she may not in a word women are not to giue directions to men nor men to take their patternes from them the contrarie rather must preuaile both in priuate and publike especially in ecclesiasticall functions men are to giue women their directions and women are to take their patternes from men for so much the distinction that sorts them into learners and teachers doth import
and so haue you heard how this precept doth range women who must hence learne with what place they are to content themselues in the schoole of christ
as the precept doth range them so doth it qualifie them learners they are and they must haue the qualities of learners which are these two silence and obedience

first women must learne in silence
there is a double silence one of the tongue and another of the wit st chrysostome obserues that in his dayes women came to chvrch as they goe a gossopping met there to talke and prattle together vnto whom he giueth this item that they must not there so much as conferre of heauenly things much

lesse may they tattle about worldly affaires they must spare their tongues and vse their eares be swift to heare and slow to speake
suppose many women labour of the same imperfection now adayes who shall doe well to take notice of this memento of st chrysostome and make better vse of their teachers paines then they are wont to doe

but there is a silence of the wit as well as of the tongue as women must heare with attention so must they also heare with sobrietie of iudgement they must not haue busie heads and moue curious and needlesse questions seldome will the tongue be quiet if the wit be so working the truth whereof is most apparent in this age of ours then which none euer bred more idle disputes tending to quarrelling rather then edification the end of learning
the minister is gods steward and is to giue euerie one his portion of meat in due season in our houses we will hardly endure that enerie one of our family should prescribe vnto himselfe his own dyet and not be contented with what is prouided by such as we put in trust to serue them but we are bolder with gods stewards then we will suffer our family to be with ours and none are more sicke of this disease then women they want the first qualitie of a learner to wit silence when they come to heare they should come furnished with that but not with that onely they must be furnished also with another qualitie which is obedience women must learne with all subiection
women were wont in st pavls dayes to weare in the chvrch the symbole of subiection which was a vaile who himselfe approues of the expediencie hereof and saith that it was to be done propter angelos

to note their subiection to the pastors who were representatiuely vnto them as christ whose spowse women must shew themselues to be
and indeed married women are called of wearing a vaile

and of rebecca you read in genesis that so soone as she came within sight of isaac she couered her selfe with a vaile and so presented her selfe in token of subiection vnto him
st pavl ephes

paralels the subiection of the wife to her husband with the subiection of the chvrch to christ so that they must submit themselues not onely to learne but to obay and be ruled by them whom god hath made their teachers for wheresoeuer god placeth one vnder another his purpose is by the one to order the other

but you must marke that it is undefined span alphabet with all subiection which may be vnderstood either of the things wherein or the parts wherewith they doe obey
touching the things you heard before that a man is rex propheta sacerdos in all these three functions women must be ordered by men and men must giue directions vnto women
and as in all these things they must be subiect so must their subiection be as well in affection as in action it must partake not onely of the outward but of the inward man they must be subiect as reasonable not as vnreasonable creatures

but we must not mistake the subiection of the wife to the husband

and of women to their pastors is not serua but libera it is not slauish but ingenuous
when god made the woman for man he made her as

man is so to esteeme of her she must be similis though not aequalis honoris she must partake in the same kind of honour though not in the same degree that man doth and as turtullian saith of a king that he is solo deo minor hath in his kingdome none aboue him but onely god so is a woman in a family solo marito minor she should command all in the house but her husband
this the romans intimated when at the first bringing of their wiues into their houses they greeted them with these words vbi ego dominus tu domina and vbi ego herus tu hera
we meane as much by these words whereat many stumble in the solemnization of matrimonie with my body thee worship which import nothing else but that the husband doth communicate to his wife whatsoeuer degree he hath either in the chvrch or
and indeed for a husband to esteeme his wife at a lower rate is barbarous inhumanitie she is and must be accounted one with himselfe and as his consort

and as in wedlocke the husband must so temper his superioritie ouer his wife so must pastors claime no other superioritie ouer them then christ doth ouer his chvrch
implicit faith and blind obedience of the romanists are no parts of the subiection women must be learners but they are not bound to receiue more then pastors are authorized to deliuer vnto them in the name of christ farther to subiect them is to tyrannize ouer them as popish priests doe ouer their followers
you haue heard of what ranke women are and how farre they are subiected vnto men but here we must take heed of two rockes whereof one is an error the other is a slander
the error is the opinion that doth out of this text impugne undefined span alphabet the gouernment of women to which purpose there was a tract published by some distempered humor in queene maries dayes which had also the concurrencie of french diuines who to countenance the salicke law doe gladly entertaine such an opinion but both should know that generall rules haue their exceptions and those set downe by god himselfe besides the generall rule honour thy father and thy mother which shews that euen mothers also haue their place in gouernment
moses hath giuen vs a particular resolution of this case dent
from the mouth of god himselfe which is that where heires males faile in a line the females may succeed in an inheritance
and if in the inheritance then in all things belonging thereunto though it be a royall soueraigntie and the french that are so stiffe for the salicke law hold that in signiories which depend on the crowne of france onely in regard of homage and are otherwise free passe vnto the heires females by succession otherwise how came britannie to be incorporated into the crowne of france and burgundy into the house of austria it is true that in electiue states men are absurd that make choyce of a woman but in states that are inherited municipall lawes pages missing

she was undefined span alphabet in the transgression she past the bounds which god set her and broke a law which was ordained to be a rule of her life

ioyne she was deceiued with she was in the transgression and then you shall see how the serpent instils sinne into man we are not constrayned but allured to doe ill we swallow euill that is branched with the shew of good so did eue and so doe all

but how doth the apostle deny that adam was guiltie as well as eue we must obserue that he doth not deny that adam was in the transgression for then he should contradict himselfe who saith elsewhere that by man came sinne into the world yea he should contradict adams owne confession

who acknowledged to god that his wife gaue him and he had eaten of the forbidden fruit
some therefore answer that not adam but eue was first in the transgression posterior in factura prior in culpa saith st hierome and because she was so forward not he but she was to beare the blame

some cleare the place by vnderstanding the words comparatiuely as if eues sinne were so much greater then adams that adams deserued not the name of sinne in comparison of hers she was deceiued by the serpent he by his wife by how much more vnreasonable it is for a woman to be guided by a serpent then for a man to be guided by his wife by so much was her sinne more soule then his
but neither of these two answers fits the argument it lyeth rather in undefined span alphabet eue was deceiued and not adam she made tryall of her wisedome in reasoning with the serpent adam did not she deceiued adam adam did not deceiue her consider her passiuely consider her actiuely she shewes her selfe vnfit to be a teacher wherefore she must be contented to be a scholler semel docuit saith st chrysostome omnia perturbauit she taught once and disordered all the world let her neuer be allowed to teach againe and indeed god so doomes her gen
thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule ouer thee
if this subordination be not kept the course of nature will be depraued saith st hieromi and faults will be multiplyed in the world
but we may not mistake and thinke that sinne was the first cause of womans subiection and that she was made inferiour quia est parilitate because she abused that coequalitie which she had with man which was the opinion of some ancient and moderne diuines that conce it is refuted by the first reason
but as man before the fall was to husband the ground which after the fall was imposed vpon him to be done with the sweat of his browes so women were to obey before but after the fall their obedience was made more harsh and vnpleasant yea and a verball ordination is added to the reall

but will conclude with reference of all this vnto our present occasion adam and eue liue still their weaknesse liues in their posteritie if you doubt it behold here spectacles of it mistake eue is away but here are many of adams children eue shewed the frailtie of the whole nature of her sexe and if her daughter were here would

let her see how like she is to such a mother but because she is not will direct the rest of my speech vnto these sonnes of adam
those that are blind seeke such guids as can see and they will be sure they haue better sight then themselues before they will commit themselues vnto them we chuse the best lawyers for our cases the best physitians for our bodyes but to supply the defect of our soules to guid our iudgement and our conscience in religion we trust we know not whom certainly you haue and shewed your selues vnworthy to be men that could be so weake as to become schollers to a woman cannot tell how better to resemble your humor then to the distemperate appetite of girls that haue the their parents prouide for them wholsome food and they get into a corner and eat chalke and coales and such like trash so you that may in the chvrch haue graue and sound instructions for the comfort of your soule in conuenticles feed vpon the raw and vndigested meditations of an ignorant vsurping prophetesse
you may happily thinke that your fault is but small but it is no small fault to violate the orders set down by god for women to lift themselues aboue their ranke or men to fall below theirs it is lesse lawfull to doe so then for men to weare womens apparell or women to weare mens put you on their vaile and be you their glorie and let them put it off and be the glorie of god contrarie to st pavls rule or if you be loath to make such an exchange let euerie man keepe his ranke and be forrie that you haue broken it yea be sorrie that you haue raised a scandall against your soueraigne and your pastors
conuenticles make shew that you haue not freedome of religion and thereby you derogate from the honour of his most christian gouernment and you haue wronged your pastor by your conuenticle casting an imputation vpon him that he cannot or he will not instruct you as he ought
these things are included in your fault and you are to be sensible of these things confesse them and aske god and his chvrch forgiuenesse for them

and god grant that you and we all may remember that it is our greatest honour to obserue gods order and that no woman presume to be an eue no man abase himselfe to be an adam to imitate either of them in that wherein they inuerted their ranke but that euerie one may abide in that whereunto he is called of god

a sermon preached at st andrevvs in welles when one did penance for blasphemie
epigraph

levit

verse
and thou shalt speake vnto the children of jsrael saying whosoeuer curseth his god shall beare his sume and he that blasphemeth the name of the lord he shall surely be put to death and all the congregation shall certainly stone him as well the stranger as he that is borne in the land when he blasphemeth the name of the lord shall be put to death

are gouerned by two kind of lawes fundamentall and occasionall
fundamentall call those by which the commonweale was first framed
occasionall such as are from time to time added vpon emergent occasions you may resemble them by our common and our statute lawes
if men did liue as they ought according to the former meane the fundamentall lawes there would be no great need of the lawes which called occasionall
but because they doe not ex malis moribus bonae leges the enormous behauiour of some one hath occasioned many a wholsome law to hold in others that would sall into the like sinne
and god by moses giues an excellent patterne to all good gouernours of making such occasionall lawes in cases ecclesiasticall ciuill and criminall ecclesiasticall numb
ciuill numb
criminall numb
and in this chapter

we haue now to doe with a criminall case the case of blasphemie concerning which we find reported in this chapter an haynous fact seuerely punished by gods commandement and an excellent prouisionall law grounded thereupon to preuent the like sinne
the fact with the punishment thereof you may read in the verses that goe immediately before the law is set downe in these that now haue read vnto you
wherein we will consider two things first what this law contayneth secondly to whom it was giuen
it contaynes the two maine parts of a law for it opens the sinne and prouides a punishment

in opening the sinne it sheweth vs against whom and how it is committed
the person against whom is god
but the name of god is taken either for one that though he be not yet is reputed to be such or for him which is god indeed which is the true god
both are here mentioned the reputed god in these words his god the true in those other the name of the lord
the sinne against either of these persons is committed by mentioning and vilifying them those two things must be vnderstood in either of these words curse and blaspheme
if this sinne be committed here is a punishment prouided for it the text will teach vs what it is and vpon whom it must be inflicted
what it is we learne here first in generall he must beare his sinne by sinne is meant punishment the offender must beare it the gouernour must put it vpon him least the state suffer for him
in speciall the punishment is here set downe that it must be ecclesiasticall and ciuill ecclesiasticall for he must be cast out of the tents which was a kind of excommunication
ciuill it must be vltimum and ignominiosissimum it must be no lesse then death he shall dye and that death must be most ignominious two wayes ignominious first for that he was stoned to death which is mors eminùs illata they that executed him stood a sarre off as if they did abhorre him
secondly he was to haue no eye to pittie him for euery one was to be his executioner all the congregation shall stone him
this is the punishment
and this punishment must be inflicted vpon all without any indulgence no person must be excepted quicunque whosoeuer doth blaspheme must suffer
and because amongst the israelites there were natiues and aliens both are giuen to vnderstand as well he that is borne in the land as the stranger that the law concernes them if they presume to blaspheme they must suffer yea and suffer so they must surely dye certainly be stoned they must looke for no commutation no mitigation of their punishment
this is the law
and this law was giuen to the children of israel so saith the entrance into my text thou shalt speake vnto the children of israel israel was gods peculiar people and it beseemed them to be the more zealous for his glorie
haue broken vp the text that this penitent may be made sensible of his grieuous sinne and we may be warned to take heed of the pages missing

man reaped where he did not sowe gathered where he did not scatter
these are affirmatiue blasphemies
and vnto these you may referre false prophets false apostles hereticks yea and schismaticks too which come vnsent speake vnwarranted make god the author of their owne deuices these are all more or lesse affirmatiue blasphemers yea and they also that without warrant curse in the name of god or by god any other person or thing

besides these there are negatiue and they are those which either wholy deny or much lessen the perfections of god

some put out the eye of his wisedome they say tush the lord doth not see and is there any vnderstanding in the highest some bridle his power

what god is he that can deliuer out of my hand saith the proud sennacherib
god is the god onely of the hils say the king of syria captaines
epicures strip him of his prouidence scilicet is superis labor est ca cura quietos sollicitat god will doe neither good nor euill
these and such like

we may call negatiue blasphemers and the rule is undefined span alphabet they that would be bad would haue nothing good in god

vnto these you may referre them that giue to the creature that which is proper to the creator that implyes a denyall for if they be common to others they are not onely his it is blasphemie to auer it
and such blasphemers are all that make and worship false gods yea and christs also
finally by reason of reference vnto god sacred persons and things are exposed to both kinds of blasphemie the affirmatiue and the negatiue
wherefore the dragon is said to blaspheme not onely the name of god but also his tabernacle that is his chvrch and the inhabitants of heauen
well whether the blasphemie be affirmatiue or negatiue by this time thinke you conceiue that it is a fearfull thing and if you doe not certainly you will if you take notice of these three points which issue all of them out of that which you haue heard
first whereas sinne may be committed either onely against the law or also against the this is committed immediately against the and you know that though he make bold which breaketh the law of the prince yet his presumption is most intolerable that layeth hands vpon his person
and what thinke you then of him that dares set himselfe against him that is king of kings and lord of lords

secondly a mans tongue was made to glorifie god therefore david cals it his glorie and the best member that he hath
and how intolerable is it for a man to abuse that to gods dishonor which was giuen him to set forth his prayse not his tongue onely but any part of his body for a man may blaspheme by writing by painting by caruing sundry other wayes whereas man whole man and onely man of all creatures in this visible world was made to vnderstand

gods word and his workes that as he had the benefit of them so he might giue him the glorie of them both

thirdly the mischiefe that man doth himselfe by this spirituall folly

he that casts a stone vp saith the sonne of sirach it will fall downe vpon his owne head

our sinnes our righteousnesse neither helpe nor hurt god as speaketh elihu in iob if we reuerence god the comfort is not his but ours as the discomfort is not his but ours if we dishonour him
doe we blaspheme affirmatiuely god will vindicate his owne glorie

and make vs see how much better he is then we dreame of him
looke vpon the places the wicked thinke that god is like vnto them

what saith god there will reproue thee and set thy sinne before thee
so likewise in malachy they thought that god fauoured men the more the worse they liued but god tels them that in the day when he made vp his iewels they should returne and see the difference betweene them that feare god

and them that feared him not
and the vnthriftie seruant was refuted before his face for his master gaue to the thriftie seruants each what he had gayned vpon his masters goods

but as god doth thus refute affirmatiue blasphemies so may you perceiue in the verie same places that the blasphemer doth defraud himselfe of that which god proues to be his perfection and leaues him to be more vile then he thinketh god to be
so likewise what gayneth the negatiue blasphemer but this that he putteth himselfe out of the protection of those attributes whereof he would but cannot rob god
god will euer haue an vnderstanding eye though not to watch ouer him but to enquire into him he will haue a hand of power not to relieue but to plague him and he will neuer cease to be prouident but the blasphemer shall neuer be the better for it
what shall we say then to these things surely considering our duty considering our danger we must thinke better vpon and take more care to fulfill that petition of the lords prayer hallowed be thy name
that we may performe our dutie that we may auoid the danger let vs all and you especially that are the penitent daily ioyne with the angels

and beare a part in their hymne singing holy holy holy lord god of hosts heauen and earth are full of thy glorie
for shall not mortall man adore that name which is so reuerenced by cherubins and seraphins it is his honor to be admitted to it and a horrible contempt if he doe it not yea doe the contrarie

the kind of blasphemie is not here exprest neither doe thinke it sit to enquire into it seeing the holy ghost is silent such sinnes are better concealed then reuealed therefore doe not publish this blasphemers sinne
and wish you not to be inquisitiue after it
our concupiscence is like tinder it will quickly take fire especially the catching fire of hell
st paul hath a good rule such things should not so much as be named amongst christians
yea blasphemie was so detested of old that whereas it had a name yet they did expresse it by an

antiphrasis and vsed the word blessing in stead of cursing
would our tast of words were as good as theirs was

haue done with the proper blasphemie

come now to speake a word of the occasionall
here take st austins rule rarò inueniuntur qui blasphemant lingua multi qui vita few haue gone so farre as this penitent who hath properly and directly blasphemed god
but there are more then a good many that haue obliquely and occasionally blasphemed yea and doe daily euen all those whose conuersation is not answerable to their profession
for they without the chvrch who heare vs professe that we are the children of god and haue for our guid the word of god when then they see vs doe that which common reason doth condemne as wicked they conclude like children like like liues like lawes they open their mouthes against god and against his holy word
wherefore we must by stop the mouthes of and let our light so shine besore men that they may see our good workes and glorifie our pather which is in heauen or else we shall goe for occasionall blasphemers as did dauid and also did the iewes

and let this suffice for the sinne

come now to the punishment
and here we must see first what it is and then on whom it is inflicted
the punishment is set downe here first in generall he shall beare his sinne
by sinne is meant punishment the holy ghost by so speaking intimates the knot that in iustice should be betweene them none should be punished but for sinne and no sinne should be vnpunished
which is also true when this word signisieth a sacrifice for the originall of a sacrifice was sinne and sinne in the old testament was not expiated but by a sacrifice

as you must obserue these two things in the word sinne so are there two like things a ceremoniall and a morall in those words he shall beare his sinne for thereby in this place the holy ghost signifieth that a blasphemer may not redeeme himselfe from punishment by any ceremoniall sacrifice the law hath prouided no sacrifice for so crying a sinne whereas pettie sinners might be ransomed by sacrifice a blasphemer may not so vnburden himselfe he must beare his owne sinne

for blasphemie is one of those sinnes which are committed with a high hand

as the phrase doth debarre the blasphemer of this ceremoniall reliefe so doth it put him ouer to the ciuill magistrate and yeelds a good morall note which is that we must vnburden the state vpon the malefactor for sinne committed by one that is a member of the by reason of the communion that is betweene the parts of the politique body maketh all the body guiltie

if it be haynous which iustinian the emperour obserued well in his preface to the law which he made against this sinne for this sinne saith he doth god send famine pestilence the sword vpon a neither can it put off the guilt and preuent the punishment but by laying them vpon the malefactor making him to beare his owne sinne lest they also beare a part of it
a good remembrance for magistrates to

quicken their iustice in such cases and teach them that they cannot be mercifull to a blasphemer except they will be cruell to their countrey

but shall touch at this point againe before end and therefore will goe on

the punishment is not onely set downe in generall but in speciall also the speciall punishment is
first it is ecclesiasticall for the malefactor must be carried out of the tents so god commanded a little before my text and in the end of this chapter it was so practised
and when in the holy land they dwelt in cities in stead of tents which they vsed in the wildernesse they obserued the same course for they cast blasphemers out of the citie as appeares in the storie of naboth king

and of st stephen act

who were calumniated for blasphemers

now this was a kind of excommunication and so vile persons were cast out

to note that they were vnworthy not onely to liue but euen to dye also amongst the people of god lest the place of their habitation should be polluted by them
the same god that would not indure that persons though but ceremonially polluted should abide in the campe could much lesse endure the flagitious amongst his people

his tents are holy and onely for holy persons
and we that beleeue in our creed that the chvrch is holy should remoue from amongst vs all profane all blaspheming persons
whereby you the penitent must vnderstand what you deserue at the hands of the chvrch
and let this suffice for the spirituall punishment

come now to the temporall
and that told you is vltimum and ignominiosissimum supplicium
vltimum for it is no lesse then death the partie must be put to death god held him vnworthy to breathe whose impious mouth breathed out such hellish contumelies against god
by gods law seuerall sinnes haue seuerall punishments and the punishments are proportioned to the sinnes we may argue strongly when god is the that if the punishment be great vndoubtedly the sinne is haynous god doth often punish citra but neuer vltra condignum
blasphemie therefore is indeed a deadly sinne that must be so accounted by gods iudgements not onely in foro poli in case of conscience but also in foro soli at the tribunall of a mortall iudge whose eye cannot discerne as doth the eye of god surely that must needs be verie foule which must be so foule in his eye
euen in this also may you the penitent take the scantling of your sinne

the punishment is not onely vltimum but ignominiosissimum most ignominious and that whether you looke vpon the execution or the executioners
the execution for the malefactor was to be stoned to death and that was mors not cominus but eminus illata the executioners stood aloofe as if they did abhorre to touch the person with their hands and therefore pursued him with stones
adde hereunto the circumstances wherewith they were to doe it no sooner did they heare the

blasphemie but they rent their cloathes stopt their eares gnashed with their teeth threw dust in the ayre cryed out with their voyces and ran against the malefactor with a kind of furie yea and they afflicted their soules with fasting also these circumstances shall you find in the execution of st stephen and naboth misaplyed indeed but yet suppose they set forth the right manner of proceeding because we find some of them in the storie of hezekiah

when he heard the blasphemie of rabsache and the princes of iudah are taxed for that they neither sorrowed nor rent their cloathes when iehoiakim the king burnt the prophesie of ieremie

in the storie of naboth it appeares that if the father were stoned for blasphemie all his children also dyed with him
but that seemeth to be a straine beyond the law because by the politike law of the iewes the child was not to dye for the sinne of his father and yet in the storie of achan you haue a precedent of a larger extent for his sacriledge was punished not onely in his owne person but also in his whole family all the liuing were stoned to death and their dead bodyes with all their goods were afterward consumed by fire
a fearefull iudgement and yet was his sinne lesse then blasphemie for blasphemie is the highest degree of sacriledge
there is no proportion betweene earthly things consecrated to god and the nature the attributes the workes of god of how much sorer punishment then is he worthy that robbeth god of the latter then he that robbs him of the former heare this and tremble you that stand here guiltie of that great sacriledge
surely if the execution doe not make you tremble at the ignominie that is due vnto you the executioners may
let vs come then to them
and who are they we haue here set downe their number all the congregation prince and people none must thinke himselfe too good when the case so neerely concernes god not onely the most but euen the best also must stoope to that which is otherwise thought to be base as it is but an ignoble profession to be an executioner when gods glorie must be vindicated and the wrong done thereunto must be reuenged all must shew that they are sensible of gods dishonor
gods did say yea their owne which is enwrapt in gods for all are wronged by a blasphemer because god which is reproacht is honoured by them all and can any man be patient to heare him so blasphemed whom himselfe doth honour adde hereunto that this multitude of executioners was to strike the greater horror and confusion into the blasphemer for when he saw himselfe conuicted of all iudged of all how could he but giue glorie vnto god and confesse that his sinne was most haynous of a truth finally the number was to be a bridle vnto all god would haue euerie one really obliged neuer to dare to commit the same sin for which he had so publikely punished another and that with his owne hand

out of all that hath beene said concerning the number of the executioners

we learne this good lesson that though it be a pious thing for a man to forgiue his owne disgraces and reproaches yet it is impious to forgiue gods
god is well pleased with the former because he can make vs amends for our patience and is able to blesse when others curse vs but patience in gods wrongs can haue no excuse for what amends can be made him or what superiour is there that can counteruaile that wrong though this be an vndoubted truth see notwithstanding the peruerse disposition of the world how sensible are we of our owne wrongs how eagerly doe we endeauour to right our selues and our reputation by law yea and against law pretending the lawes of honour we pursue euen but seeming yea and oftentimes fained disgraces with duels vnto death to the vtter ruine of those which haue disgraced vs but of gods honour we are most senselesse let varlets and miscreants for they deserue no better name that haue such foule mouthes profane the sacred name of god hellishly rent in pieces as a vile thing the precious ransome of the chvrch the sacred person and parts of our sauiour christ how many be there that laugh at them but as mad fellowes and where is he that thinketh that the reuenge of this doth concerne him certainly farre off is our congregation from ioyning altogether to stone him

but lest you should thinke that this was a tumultuary proceeding must supply out of former words the order which was obserued therein
for the witnesses that heard the blasphemie were to be leaders in this proceeding they were first to impose their hands vpon him and set their hands against him
this ceremonie though practised in other iudgements as appeares in the and chapters of deuteronomie yet seemeth to haue its originall here and imports two things first the truth of their testimonie so that if the man dyed innocently not the whole congregation which followed but they which led the congregation were to be guiltie of his death
secondly the imposing of hands vpon the malefactor was the making of him as it were a politicke sacrifice for mundi expiatio est malorum occisio as the priest so the prince hath his sacrifice to offer as the chvrch so the common weale the execution of malefactors is a propitiating of god
and god in the of israel in cases wherein he refused the ceremoniall was well pleased to haue this sacrifice and to admit it as expiatorie of the
told you of the thing before but of the deuoting of the person to pacifie god could not speake till came to this place
you the penitent may hereby see how zealously the state should be bent against you and how much it concernes vs to see iustice done vpon you

hauing thus sufficiently opened the punishment come now to shew you vpon whom it must be executed quicunque vpon him whosoeuer he be that curseth or blasphemeth here must be no respect of persons high or low rich or poore be he what he may be he is liable

to punishment if he curse his god
though it be a yet if it be his the law saith plainly he shall beare his sinne

the words may be vnderstood either as a relation or as a commandement
as a relation what other nations doe how zealous they are for the honour of their gods
in the storie of the wonders which god wrought in deliuering the children of israel out of aegypt we find that when pharaoh would haue the israelites sacrifice to their god in the land of aegypt

loe said moses shall we sacrifice the abhomination of the aegyptians before their eyes and will they not stone vs how did nebuchadnezzar cause the furnace to be heated to consume those that would not worship his golden image what a doe kept demetrius the when st paul was thought to blaspheme diana protagoras was banished socrates was put to death for disgracing the gods of athens
the mahumetans lay on many stripes vpon them that disgrace their alearon
will omit the solemne bellum sacrum of the graecians
thus the words may be conceiued by way of relation and then see how god argues doe the heathen punish those who dishonour or curse those that are onely gods in their erroneous reputation much more then ought he to be punished that blasphemes the true god
thus doth god oftentimes shame his owne people for their impieties by setting before their face the pietie that is in infidels hath a nation changed their gods which yet are no gods

but my people hath changed their glorie for that which doth not profit
and againe

will a man rob god yet ye haue robbed me
so that the punishment cannot be denied to be iust by true religion which is held most iust by the glimmering light of reason

but the words may haue in them more then a bare relation they may containe a commandement also a commandement that whosoeuer curseth god though it be but his god that is a false god shall be punished for conscientia erronea ligat so long as any man in his conscience is perswaded that he is the true god he must worship him as if he were such
it is true that when he commeth to the knowledge of his error

he may then curse his false gods he may cast them to the bats and to the moles but so long as his vnderstanding is clouded with error his reuerence must follow the rule of his conscience
it is good diuinitie that is deliuered in the booke of wisdome touching idolatrous periured persons they shall be iustly punished

both because they thought not well of god giuing heed vnto idols and also vniustly swore in deceit despising holinesse it is not the power of them by whom they sweare but it is the iust vengeance of sinners that punisheth alwayes the offence of the vngodly
and no maruell for were it a true god they would vse him so their ignorance is not antecedent but concomitant and such ignorance doth not excuse the quantitie much lesse doth it excuse the qualitie of sinne

but to leaue his god and come to the name of the lord
here quicun{que must be repeated againe we may lesse admit exception of persons

amongst them that blaspheme the name of the lord then amongst them that curse their god

but here we meet with a markable distribution of quicunque whosoeuer whether saith the text he be a stranger or borne in the land
though morally all men are bound and may be perswaded by ministers and others to acknowledge and worship the true god yet politickly infidels cannot be compeld
and why it is a worke that needeth the assistance of supernaturall grace which is not annext vnto the sword
notwithstanding the ciuill sword may take vengeance vpon all euen strangers infidels that openly blaspheme the name of the lord though they may be tollerated in their false yet may they not open their mouthes against the true religion quicunque whatsoeuer stranger doth so he must be stoned
and if a stranger much more he that is borne in the land for he is tyed to honour god by a double obligation a natiue a votiue as a man as a member of the church
now the more obligations the more guilt the more guilt the more iust the punishment therefore quicunque whosoeuer borne in the land blasphemeth the name of the lord he must be stoned to death

must carrie quicun{que a little farther the root of blasphemie may be without vs or within vs without vs the diuel who may suggest it and then it is no sinne of ours though a sinne except we consent vnto it and delight in it
within vs it may be first ignorance secondly infirmitie thirdly malice there is great odds betweene these to
st paul blasphemed but he did it ignorantly he did not beleeue that iesvs was the christ
st peter blasphemed but he did it of infirmie he did it being ouertaken with feare of death
the pharisees they also blasphemed but they did it out of malice they did it against their owne conscience
now of these three rootes the two first leaue place for repentance st peter and st paul are ensamples thereof

not so the third it is the sinne against the holy ghost not to be forgiuen in this world nor in that which is to come

but howsoeuer there is this odds to yet in regard of the magistrates sword there is no difference quicun{que be the root ignorance be it infirmitie be it malice he must be stoned to death his body must be made an expiatorie anathema or sacrifice by the state whose soule notwithstanding vpon repentance may be saued in the day of the lord

and verily the blasphemer vpon whom this law was made blasphemed but in his rage as appeares yet he dyed for it
wonder not at gods seueritie he measureth no more to himselfe then he doth to parents

to magistrates
he that curseth his father and his mother the parents of his flesh must be vsed so and shall not he be vsed so much more that curseth the father of his spirit he that speaketh euill of the ruler of the people must be vsed so and shall not he that

speaketh euill of the king of kings and lord of lords the comparison maketh quicun{que in gods case to be most iust

to which root we shall refer your blasphemie that are the penitent know not in charitie we hope the best we hope that it commeth from a mixture of grosse ignorance and vnruly passions for these doe rayse euill thoughts and murmurings
that it doth so let it appeare in your repentance
st paul in conscience of his fall by ignorance gaue himselfe no better a title when he had occasion to mention it then maximus peccatorum the most grieuous of sinners euen when he lead a most holy life he could not forget his fall in the hight of gods grace
and of st peter the ecclesiasticall storie reports that at the crowing of the cocke the remembrancer of his fall euerie night during his life he did wash his bed and water his couch with his penitent teares
god make you so mindfull and so sorrowfull otherwise you will betray that your blasphemie sprang from malice and then be sure that the same god that commanded such seueritie to be executed here on earth will himselfe execute much greater vpon all those which through irrepentance goe to hell
yea haply he may euen in this world make you a spectacle of a forlorne wretch to the terrour of others as he did sennacherib

vpon whose statua there is this inscription undefined span alphabet let euerie one that looketh vpon me learne to be godly
such a spectacle say may he make you if by often recounting and bewayling of this crying sin you doe not quench the fire of his wrath and preuent his iudgements for god will not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine

the last point is that it must be done without all indulgence moriendo morietur he shall surely dye surely be stoned
we may not with eue turne surely into ne fortè lest the diuel worke vpon vs and we prouoke god as saul did in agags case and ahab in benadads

you haue heard the law a word of those to whom it was giuen and so end
in the entrance of my text you find that it was giuen to the israelites the israelites were the people of god and surely it concernes them if any to be most zealous of his glorie who is their glorie
but did it concerne them onely then it is dissolued because their is at an end
take therefore a rule that if a law which in the institution thereof was nationall to the iewes in the equitie of it be oecumenicall euerie christian nation is bound to giue it a reuiuor though they may varie the punishment as they find it expedient for their state
and indeed this hath receiued such a reuiuor in most christian states
iustinian the emperour of made it capitall
the wise gothes inflicted an hundred stripes for it and in disgrace shaued the delinquents head and beard and imprisoned him during life
fredericke the emperour cut out the tongue of all that offended in this kind
st lewis of france caused their tongue to be bored with a hot iron wishing that his owne tongue might be so vsed if euer he did blaspheme
philip of vuloys caused their lips to be slit
and touching our owne state haue nothing to say in excuse

thereof for that it hath all this while left this sinne onely to ecclesiasticall censure and hath not prouided some corporall punishment for it but that of solon who being demanded why he made no law against parricide answered that he thought none in his would euer be so impious to commit it
so thinke our state thought there would neuer rise such lewd persons amongst vs but seeing there doe it is high time we had some sharpe occasionall statute to represse them
if holy iob were so carefull to sacrifice for and sanctifie his sonnes ne fortè lest peraduenture they had sinned with what zeale should we be stirred vp when we see the fact is most apparent

conclude
let all blasphemie be put out of all our mouthes yea and hearts also and let vs pray god to set a watch before our lips and keepe the doore of our mouthes that his grace may rule in our hearts that he may be our feare and his prayse may be our talke that praysing him here on earth we may be admitted into the number of his saints which with heart and voyce prayse him for euermore in heauen
a penitent prayer for a blasphemer

most sacred and most dread almightie euerlasting god to whom the angels continually doe cry holy holy holy lord god of hoasts the glorie of whose admirable and comfortable wisedome reacheth from one end of the world to another mightily and sweetly ordereth all things
the vnworthiest of men the most grieuous of sinners humbly sorrowfully prostrating my deiected disconsolate both soule and body before thy holy eyes pray that the sighes and groanes of a broken and contrite heart may not be excluded from thine offended eares
lord haue beene deepe in the gall of bitternesse and in the bond of iniquitie sathan hath filled my heart therewith and out of the aboundance thereof my tongue hath sent forth many flashes euen of the fire of hell as a brood of the serpent haue set my mouth against heauen haue blasphemed the holy the reuerend name of my god and vilified his vnchangeable vnchallengable prouidence
haddest thou dealt with me as deserued fire and brimstone from heauen should haue consumed

me or the earth should haue gaped and swallowed me downe quicke into the pit of hell
deserued to be made a spectacle of thy iust vengeance that gracelesse wretches seeing my iudgement might feare my offence
confesse this lord confesse it vnfainedly penitently but woe is me if haue no more to confesse but these my euill deserts
thy towards me putteth me in better hope yea this medicinall confusion whereunto thou now puttest me puts me in good hope that thou hast not forgotten to be mercifull vnto me neither hast thou shut vp thy tender mercie in displeasure
lord doe not despise this goodnesse of thine that leads me to repentance that workes in me remorce of conscience
and from that penitent blasphemer that proued a most worthy apostle from his mouth doe take vnto my selfe that saying worthy of all men to be receiued that iesus christ came into the world to saue sinners euen such sinners of whom am chiefe
now then beseech thee let the power of my lord be great according as thou hast spoken the lord is slow to anger and of great mercie and forgiueth iniquitie and sinne
be mercifull beseech thee to the impietie of thy seruant according to thy great mercie let the vngodlinesse of my heart of my mouth be blotted out of thy remembrance let it not bring vpon me the vengeance deserue but create in me a new heart and touch my tongue with a cole from thine altar that which am vnworthy by reason of my scandalous crying sinne to meditate on or make mention of thy glorious maiestie thy diuine wisedome may haue a heart alwayes enditing good things and my blasphemous tongue may be turned into an instrument of thy glorie
so shall my soule be filled as it were with marrow and fatnesse when shall prayse thee with ioyfull lips and shall sing forth thy wonderous mercie all the dayes of my life
heare me father of mercie for giue me amend me and establish in me this holy purpose of my repentant heart to thy glorie and the comfort of enormous sinners for jesus christs sake by the powerfull operation of thy holy spirit
amen

a sermon preached at st andrews in welles a schismatiqve doing penance who had for many yeeres estranged himselfe from the commvnion of ovr chvrch
epigraph

corint
let no man deceiue himselfe if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a foole that he may be wise

a particular visible church is built vpon two foundations vnion and communion a louing vnion of the faithfull and an holy communion in sacred things both these must be preserued or else that church will come to naught
now there were amongst the corinthians that did vndermine these foundations some rent the vnion and the communion was corrupted by
st paul wrot this epistle to amend them both
and marke what a distinct course he taketh
he first setleth the vnion before he offereth to purge the communion
and there is good reason why for though the louing vnion of the faithfull be vnprofitable if it be without a holy communion in sacred things yet is a holy communion in sacred things impossible if you take away the louing vnion of the faithfull
therefore lest st paul should lose his labour in redressing of the communion he first taketh care of repayring the vnion

the first thing then that in the church of corinth he reformes is schisme and he spends foure chapters in reforming

thereof in throughly searching into the disease and applying thereto a soueraigne remedy
the words that now haue read vnto you belong to the remedy and you shall find them to be a principall branch thereof
let vs come more closely to them

of medicinall remedies some are preseruatiue some are restoratiue
the preseruatiue are for the sound the restoratiue are for the sicke
you shall find them both in my text and you shall find that they are catholica remedia such remedies as doe or may concerne vs all
the preseruatiue remedy is undefined span alphabet prouidence or the preuention of schisme you haue it in these words let no man deceiue himselfe
the restoratiue is undefined span alphabet repentance or the recouering of a schismatique it followeth in these words if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him be a foole that he may be wise
but more distinctly
in the preseruatiue we are to behold our naturall weakenesse and therefore to learne spirituall carefulnesse st paul supposeth that we are prone to deceiue our selues and therefore aduiseth that no man should doe himselfe that wrong let no man deceiue himselfe
in the restoratiue we must behold first the distemper of a schismatique and then the cure fitting to such a distemper
the distemper is a carnall a for the man thinkes himselfe wise but the is but carnall as appeares by the limitation or extenuation rather that is added to his wisedome he is onely wise in this world
such is his distemper whereof the first cure is an exalting humilitie
the first branch is humilitie he must become a foole but he need not be disheartened there followeth an exaltation thereupon he becomes a foole that he may be wise
these are the remedies
and they are as told you catholica remedia such remedies as doe or may concerne vs all
the preseruatiue doth undefined span alphabet let no man deceiue himselfe
the restoratiue may undefined span alphabet if any
that which hath befalne this man may be the case of the best of vs all
these are the particulars which shall now enlarge and apply vnto this present occasion pray god we may so doe it as that we all not this penitent onely may be the better for it

the first remedy is the preseruatiue and therein the first thing that pointed out is our naturall weaknesse
this st paul supposeth we may gather it out of that which he aduiseth for in vaine were his aduise if there were not a truth in that which he supposeth but farre be it from vs to thinke that the holy ghost doth require any thing in vaine let it stand then for an vndoubted truth that we are prone by nature to deceiue our selues undefined span alphabet from whence the verbe is deriued which is vsed by the apostle signifieth a leauing of the right way which putteth vs in mind that in this world we are but men
when we are admitted into the church we are set in the path which will lead vs to our euerlasting home but when we are in it we may goe out of it
it appeares too plainly in adam and eue and it is not to be expected that the children should be better then the parents

especially seeing our restitution commeth short of that measure of grace which they had in their creation

it being true that we may the question is how it comes to passe that we doe goe out of the way and leaue the straight path wherein we are set the scripture obserues two meanes the one without vs the other within vs that is the world this is concupiscence the world allures concupiscence inclines
adde hereunto a third that is the diuel he blancheth the world that it may allure more strongly and worketh concupiscence by perswasion that it may yeeld more readily and these betweene them consummate the deceipt whereby we are led out of the way

but betweene these we must obserue a great difference that which worketh the deceipt from without is but an occasion that which worketh it from within is the true cause thereof the world the diuel suadere possunt cogere non possunt they may sollicit powerfully but they cannot inforce vs vnwillingly to goe out of the way
physicall actions may be constrayned morall cannot may haue mine eyes forcibly layd open to see mine eares to heare and so the rest of my body may be constrayned to produce some worke but the powers of my reasonable soule can neuer be constrayned cannot be constrayned to iudge otherwise then my vnderstanding leads me nor to chuse that which my will refuseth therefore our vnderstanding and our will must be actors principall actors in this deceipt
and so st iames telleth vs

that he that is tempted is bayted and led aside by his owne concupiscence
st iohn insinuates as much when he telleth vs that all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life as if there were no deceipt in the world were it not that we did fasten our concupiscence vpon it

finally st paul telleth vs in his owne case peccatum decepit me that which deceiued me was mine owne sinne
and indeed he that first instilled sinne into vs gaue vs the seed of his owne sinne
the diuels sinne was for when he fell there was nothing besides himselfe that might deceiue him and that cunning huntsman is not contented to make vs a prey except he take vs in the cords of our owne sinne except we follow the counsels of our owne hearts and doe that which is right in our owne eyes to disobey god and leaue the path of life
it were easie to illustrate this in all sorts of sinnes but will keepe my selfe to this present occasion to the sinne of schisme
the diuel attempts two things against the truth of religion the first is priuation the second deprauation a declining vnto the or to the right to the by making men atheists to the by making them separatists he would that all should be fooles and say in their hearts that there is no god or that god is without prouidence that god knoweth not or eareth not for the things of this world
and if he cannot so stifle religion he endeauoureth for to leauen it whom he cannot draw to the left hand he will endeauour to draw to the right he will by corrupting of good

principles maketh them fall vpon many vngodly conclusions and vse zeale for god to estrange themselues from god wofull experience hath the church had of such paralogismes in the iewes who vpon this ground opposed christ in the gentiles that tooke this for a ground to quarrell with the iewes and the separatists of this latter age wherof we haue had more then a good many in this countrey haue stumbled at this stone lest they should serue god amisse they haue refused to serue god at all
nazianzen in his time though in another case yet sauouring of this sinne cryed out undefined span alphabet

vnwarie warinesse imposture of the that turneth pietie into impietie and ouercommeth reason by reason who can consider this and not acknowledge the weaknesse of our nature this weakenesse may be resolued into our beleeuing and rash beleeuing of seducing imposters that labour to instill their fancies into vs and rash of those whom god hath lawfully placed to rule ouer vs both which a man shall easily obserue in all schismatiques

but to acknowledge our naturall weakenesse is not sufficient the apostle aduiseth vs to beware of it and indeed therefore is our naturall weaknesse remembred that it might stirre vs vp vnto spirituall carefulnesse not to doe that which we are prone to doe let no man deceiue himselfe
we must take heed of the occasions that from without offer to deceiue vs of wolues in sheepes clothing of an angel of darkenesse turning himselfe into an angel of light try the spirits at st iohn yea try all things as st paul willeth vs

in iob we haue a prettie resemblance of the eare to the tast as the one doth try the meates which we are to take into our bodyes so should the other the words which we are to receiue into our soules

but in vaine shall we try them if we doe not try our selues first for we must try them by our iudgement by our will verum est index sui obliqui
a peruerse iudgement cannot discerne truth from falsehood neither can an vntoward will make a right choyse when good and euill are presented vnto it he cannot choose but be deceiued by others that is first deceiued in himselfe wherefore seeing our iudgement and our will must be the rule by which we must try others our first care must be to set them straight our vnderstanding must be a good logician our will a good moralist if either be defectiue we deceiue our selues and we are verie apt to be deceiued by others
it is a miserable thing for a man to be deceiued by others

but to be deceiued by himselfe is most miserable cum impostor minimum quidem decedat we shall euer carrie about vs the deceiuer in our bosoms and he shall haue that credit with vs as that we shall neuer so much as suspect his deceipt yea sathan and the world shall euer haue their agent with vs and make vs assacinates to destroy our selues
adde hereunto that this kind of deceipt makes vs vncapable of wholesome counsell for if our ignorance be onely priuatiue seldome doe we obstinate our selues against good instructions but if our reasonable

powers be depraued and possest with qualities opposite vnto those which we should receiue there is much lesse hope of our amendment
intus apparens excludit alienum

is most refractorie and most hardly will he be brought backe into the way that being deceiued of himselfe wittingly and willingly went out of the way whereof this penitent may be a liuely example vnto vs
and let this suffice concerning the preseruatiue

come vnto the restoratiue remedy wherein we are first to see the distemper of a schismatique told you it was a carnall
first a the schismatique thinkes himselfe wise
god that indowed vs with the faculties of sense and reason gaue these faculties a double abilitie a direct and a reflected
the direct is that whereby they receiue their obiect the reflect is that whereby they iudge of that receipt
will make it plaine to you by an example first of sense and then of reason
mine eye seeth a colour for example greene hauing seene it it passeth a iudgement vpon the sight and knowes that is greene which it doth see the like may be obserued in hearing smelling tasting and the rest of the senses
in like manner is it in our soule the vnderstanding apprehends some truth and hauing apprehended it it passeth a iudgement vpon it and knoweth that that is truth which it hath apprehended
the like may be said of good
but we must marke here a difference betweene sense and reason as created and as corrupted as created so non falluntur circa obiecta sua whether they wrought directly or reflectiuely they were able to worke without error not so as they are corrupted for now they are subiect to manifold errors
see it in our senses if the eye by any chance or suffusion be stayned it will mistake in the apprehending of colours and accordingly it will mistake in iudging of his apprehension for the reflected action is alwayes answerable to the direct so is it with the palat in relishing of meates and iudging of the rellish
neither is the condition of our reasonable faculties better then that of our sensitiue
the vnderstanding may misdeeme the will choose amisse and then the reflected actions how can they be sound especially in cases which concerne our selues and where the question is of our owne worth
ignorance and will so bleare our eyes that they will make vp a false glasse wherein we shall neuer see our selues as indeed we are undefined span alphabet men that make themselues iudges of themselues are sure to haue a verie fauourable iudgement for that which euerie man desires he is perswaded to be so because he is by nature a friend vnto himselfe and you know the prouerbe undefined span alphabet if we dote vpon a person all his imperfections seeme perfections in our eyes
you may obserue it daily in parents affections towards their children and husbands towards their wiues but it is not so true in any thing as in religion for if a man once conceiue himselfe to be deuout all his actions seeme presently vnto him to sauour of deuotion
and hereupon it commeth to passe that rather then he will impaire

any part of his reputation he will discredit euen gods truth it selfe if it seeme to lay any blame vpon him
and so we see that many men resolue that their ignorance is wisedome and though they know nothing yet that they know all things

this being obserued concerning the difference betweene our abilities as created and corrupted you will easily acknowledge two good rules that gregorie naz hath the first is undefined span alphabet there is great distance betweene seeming and being for seeing we are in the state of corruption we cannot conclude this seemeth so therefore this is so because undefined span alphabet it is an easie matter as you heard in the first point for a man to deceiue himselfe and thinke himselfe to be when he is nothing undefined span alphabet being puft vp with vaine conceit and vaine glorie
a second rule is undefined span alphabet there is no greater enemie to being

then seeming
many pretending faith saith st hilary are not subiect vnto faith he giues a reason they square a faith vnto themselues rather then receiue it from the church sensu humanae inanitatis inflati being puffed vp with a conceipt of humane vanitie they rellish nothing but their owne and to cleaue to that distast the truth cum sapientiae haec veritas sit interdum sapere quae nolis it is a true character of heauenly wisedome to relish many things which thwart our naturall will

these two rules will easily resolue vs that is a distemper and will make way for two good instructions to be entertained by vs the first is that though we should labour to be wise yet should we not be wise in our owne eyes and why when we are at the best we haue not so much reason to glorie that we are better then others as we haue to be sorrie that we are not so good as we should be certainly st paul thought so

that great apostle made this wise profession forget those things that are behind and make coward the marke for the price of the high calling of god in christ iesus
the second is undefined span alphabet if a man haue attained by gods grace a good degree of wisedome it is better in modestie to himselfe then to himselfe audaciously for the latter is undefined span alphabet an emptie conceipt or a vaine glorie a vice but the former is undefined span alphabet meekenesse of wisedome as st iames cals it a principall christian vertue
they that are infected with vice come vnder the censure of the prouerbe there is a generation pure in his owne eyes and yet is not cleansed from his filthinesse but the other are not so lowly in their owne eyes as glorious in the eyes both of god and men
and let this suffice touching the distemper the of a schismatique

the text doth tell vs that this is carnall for it hath an addition which doth extenuate the worth of the calling it wisedome in this world
the words are taken in a double sense noting either the qualitie of the wisedome or the place where this wisedome is
chrysostome vnderstands it of the qualitie and so that

wisedome is of no higher a degree then that which springeth from the naturall corruption of man and indeed it was such wisedome wherewith the false apostles did seeke to steale away the affections of the corinthians from the true the particulars you may read in that part of this tract wherein st paul doth rip vp the disease of schisme
vnderstand the place and then the wisedome may be of a heauenly pitch but the degree of it is not such as that a man may boast of it for such a degree is not vouchsafed vs in this world in heauen we may expect it in the meane time we must acknowledge that we come short thereof and therefore must not be wise in our owne eyes
venerable bede conioynes both senses saying that they are persons qui hic sapientes esse volunt ex se mira vanitate a schismatique affects to haue more vnderstanding then other men by a speciall insight of his owne into heauenly things and that in this mortall life which is subiect to so many mistakings
and if you ioyne these two together they will make vp that attribute which gaue vnto the and proue it to be carnall for that must needs sauour of the flesh which doth intermingle humane fancies with diuine truth or vaunt of more perfection then god vouchsafeth on earth
and yet such a conceipt haue all schismatiques the serpent that is called undefined span alphabet from his pretended knowledge makes them affect to be undefined span alphabet men of more knowledge then ordinarie
but al their knowledge is but undefined span alphabet knowledge falsely so called as appeareth in the effect thereof for as the eating of the forbidden fruit did a deadly knowledge in adam and eue euen so doth this busie knowledge of schismatiques proue pernitious vnto them
wherefore it is good for you the penitent to listen to the rule of the apostle rom
be not wise in your owne conceipt
and thus much of the distemper and the attribute thereof

come now to the cure
and indeed the holy ghost doth therefore set downe the distemper that we might see the need of the cure and seeing it might be the more disirous of it
the cure is an exalting humilitie
first humilitie he that is selfe conceited and thinkes himselfe wise must humble himselfe he must become a foole
a foole saith primatius non natura sed voluntate let him not be a naturall but a voluntarie foole

a voluntarie foole in two respects
first in his own eyes then in the eyes of the world st basil obserues the first si formidauerit iudicium domini if he stand in awe of that doome which god pronounceth by the prophet woe be to you that are wise in your owne eyes isay
and confesse with the psalmist was euen as a beast before thee
then saith st basil a man becomes a foole that is he doth acknowledge his owne folly his folly in that he mistooke seeming wisedome insteed of the true and did esteeme his owne iudgement better then the iudgement of the church which he was bound to obey
did before shew you that all schimatiques are subiect vnto a double deceit beleeuing and rash and what are these but branches of folly hastie beleefe what is it but plaine foolishnesse

and the greatest aduantage of impostors for the auditors ignorance giues a large scope vnto a seducers craft if he be apt to follow and to be perswaded before he is instructed and that is the true method of impostors they gaine an interest in our affections before they offer to informe our iudgement and a pliable will maketh a flexible vnderstanding and nothing is so easily beleeued as that which such a man knoweth least and when a man commeth to the sight of this imperfection what can he doe lesse then condemne it for simple folly neither may we iudge better of our rash when we in our mutinous and ambitious deliberation not seeing the ground of our gouernours ordinances whether in church or presently brand them for superstitious antichristian tyrannous and thinke them the best men that disgrace them most and our selues neuer more religious then when we are most rebellious
it is no lesse then proud folly so to reduce the credibilitie of lawes to the measure of our capacitie

the sonne of syrach hath made a great peece of a chapter in checking this folly the wisedome of a learned man commeth by opportunitie of leasure he that hath little busines shall become wise
but of husbandmen and craftesmen he addes this they shall not be sought for in publique counsell nor sit high in the congregation they shall not sit on the iudges seat nor vnderstand the sentence of iudgement
when a man comes to see this imperfection the imperfection of husbandmen and craftesmen taking vpon them to iudge scriptures and synods what can it be lesse in his eyes then vnexcusable folly

neither onely must we thinke so but professe it to be so for therein properly standeth his becomming a foole when he doth not refuse publicationem sui as tertullian calleth it a publike recognition of his imperfection undefined span alphabet making an open shew thereof and insulting thereupon as if he were not able to disgrace it enough
such a religious foole doth king dauid shew himselfe in his st paul in his epistles st ausline in his confessions it was not strange nor rare in the primitiue church for publique offendors to become such publique sooles
you that are the penitent hauing so good examples may well digest your humiliation and this religious folly needs not be grieuous vnto you

another sense there is of these words which is that as we must be contented to be fooles in our owne eyes in that we mistooke seeming wisdome for true so when we doe imbrace truth insteed of seeming wisdome we must be contented to goe for fooles in the eyes of the world for as that which is high in the eyes of the world is base in the eyes of god so that which is high in the eyes of god is base in the eyes of the world
the patience the obedience the charitie the humilitie of a penitent christian they are no better then plaine folly in the iudgement of worldly men they hold them senslesse that may liue at ease and with moses will thinke the reproch of christ better then the treasures of aegypt they thinke him senslesse that with abraham will forsake his countrey sacrifice his sonne they

thinke him senslesse that with st stephen will not onely forgiue but pray for them that treacherously and tyrannously doe spill inuocent blood finally they hold them senselesse who when they might cunningly excuse or boldly outface they will with king dauid and st paul penitently and humbly acknowledge their sinnes the beleeuing the practizing of the gospel passeth with the world for no better then folly
a man therefore that will submit himselfe thereto must be contented to beare the reproach of christ and goe for a foole

another point that we must marke is that as bladders are emptied of wind before they can be filled with good liquor so must a man emptie himselfe of his windy wisdome before he is capable of solid
or as a scholler that hath beene must vnlearne before he learne and his soule must be made tanquam abrasa tabula a paire of writing tables clearely spunged from vngrounded knowledge before grounded can be imprinted in it euen so we must endeauour for to purge out all our leauened wisdome before we can be informed with that which is sincere and not seeming but sound

lastly

seeming wisedome it that which is undefined span alphabet as st paul speaketh it is not lasting will we nill we it shall be done away seeing we cannot keepe it it is good that we rid our selues of it and willingly part with that which we cannot keepe but dangerously
the rather because the ridding of that is but the making way for that which is much better and we doe become such fooles onely that we may be wise
god will not haue vs rest in folly but passe by that vnto true wisedome he will not haue vs depriue our selues of humane prudence which is of it selfe a good guift of god but subordinate it vnto diuine god can well endure that wisedome that springs from reason so reason goe right and keepe her ranke but that which offends god is si vel secum vel cum deo pugnet if it be not consonant with it selfe or be disobedient vnto him this is indeed folly which we must put off to the end that we may become wise both men and christians
looke then how we are willed to hunger and thirst to mortifie to crucifie so are we willed to become fooles we are willed to dye that we may liue to hunger and thirst that we may be satisfied to crucifie and mortifie that we may quicken and crowne also our animall life by exchange of it for a spirituall and so doe we put off humane wisedome that we may put on diuine
god loues not folly per se but propter sapientiam neither may we hold that there is any religion without wisedome as there is no wisedome without religion

let the church of rome nussell her followers in ignorance and aduise them to become fooles that they may so keep them the orthodox church takes a better course and onely maketh the sense of their folly to set an edge vpon their appetite of true wisedome neither do we require more credit then we shew good warrant for in gods word such warrant as no reasonable man can iustly except against

but what is this wisedome might answer in a word it is nothing else but the true rules of religion deliuered as god hath commanded his church which rules are fit for vs to teach you that are the people and for you to obserue when they are deliuered by vs
but will reduce all vnto two heads specified by our sauiour luke salt and peace
salt notes a direction that must season your heads peace a temper that you must haue in your hearts you must know that as the church is a body so it consists of different members and each member hath his particular vocation euerie man must walke as he is called of god and you shew that you haue salt if you keepe your selues in your owne ranke and busie not your selues with those things that belong not to your calling
it had beene to be wished that this penitent had done so and not busied himselfe about the formes of liturgies the power of the keyes and such like the power whereof god hath commended to others it is well enough for you if you can be brought to vnderstand your catechisme and frame your life according to it and this is as much salt as god requires in you and it is well if following your honest vocation you can attaine so much

a second branch of wisedome is peace and peace doth note a charitable bearing one with another considering the manifold infirmities whereunto we are all subiect we must not be ouer hastie in condemning wheat for tares or refuse to grow in gods field because tares grow there also a point of wisedome which you the penitent shall doe well to carrie with you seeing an offence taken at seeming or true tares was one of the grounds of your schisme
finally vnto true wisedome it belongs to auoyd two extreames whereunto this age is subiect fierie and frostie tempers whereof nazianzene orat
treates at large
we must not be wise aboue that which is meet is the apostles rule rom
and it was a good rule of a plus sapit vulgus si tantum quantum satis est sapit a man that is not called to be a gouernour is the wiser the more sober he is in his wisedome
as you must not be ouer fierie no more must you be frostie this leaneth towards atheisme as the other doth towards schisme it is no lesse a fault sapere minus then plus quam oportet stupiditie is as blameable as curiositie

may not forget that some ioyne these words undefined span alphabet in this world with let him be a foole and obserue that in this life we must make this exchange it will be too late to do it hereafter which must put you in mind that are the penitent to giue god thankes that hath so timely called you to the knowledge of the truth which your age considered might haue fallen out otherwise if iustice done vpon the outward man had not awakened the inward and god knowes how vncomfortable your end had beene if you had persisted in your wilfulnesse vnto the end extra ecclesiam non est salus he presumes

too much of gods mercie that dareth to dye excommunicate by the iust censure of the church

but come to the last point which will touch in a word you haue heard the remedies told you they are catholica remedia such as doe or may concerne vs all
the preseruatiue doth for omnis homo mendax euerie man is a lyar we are all cast in the same mold and the serpent hath infused some of his serpentine qualitie into vs all and therefore euerie man hath reason to stand vpon his guard to watch ouer himselfe and take heed lest himselfe betray not himselfe into the hands of his enemies
as the preseruatiue is behoofefull for vs that going right we step not out of the way so because no man makes such straight steps that he doth not often decline we may not neglect the restoratiue is a distemper that easily creeps into them whose nature cannot be free from
it was a wise obseruation of socrates that if in a great assembly a proclamation should be made that all either taylors or shomakers or masons should stand forth none but those that were of such particular trades would sort themselues together but if a man should call forth all that are wise and vnderstanding he should perceiue that none would stay behind he addes hoc imprimis in vita damnosum quod cum hominum pars maxima stulta sit sapere tamen videatur the that is to be found in all sorts of men breedes most of the mischiefe that troubleth the world
therefore si quis is not particula dubitantis but supponentis he doth not so much doubt whether all be sicke of this disease as supposing them all to be sicke it calleth vpon them to vse the remedy
and indeed if the disease be common it is fit the cure be common also that we timely humble our selues by condemning our owne folly that god may exalt vs and giue vs true wisedome
conclude remembring vnto you the penitent a good saying of st basil mores hominis superbi si verè sanati fuerint solent esse sui despicabiliores
you will if you make a true vse of this humiliation professe with agar prou
surely am more brutish then any man and haue not the vnderstanding of a man neither learned wisedome nor haue the knowledge of the holy
hereafter deny your selfe and leane no more vnto your owne wisedome
and to vs all will remember a good saying of philo undefined span alphabet or is the last coat that a man puts off by grace adde tis the first that he putteth on with his nature the faster it cleaueth to vs the more should we endeauour to strip our selues of it and remembring that saying of the apostle he is not approued that commendeth himselfe but he whom god commendeth let us so renounce that which flesh and blood maketh vs doat vpon that we euer be ready to entertaine that which god prescribes so shall we be sure either at all not to deceiue our selues or if we haue beene ouertaken by carnall we shall not refuse to be fooles that we may be wise

god vouchsafe vs this preuenting prouidence and recouering repentance as that we may not either stray at all or if we stray that we may returne againe till we come to that place where there is no feare of straying no need of returning whither god our mercifull father bring vs through jesus christ our sauiour that is made the wisedome of god vnto vs by the gracious influence of the holy spirit of wisedome into vs
to this one god in three persons be rendred all honor and glorie

a sermon preached at farneham on st iames his day beeing the day of king iames his coronation
epigraph

iames
verse
blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tryed he shall receiue the crowne of life which the lord hath promised to them that loue him

this day directs vs to this epistle and these words thereof are not vnfit to refresh a solemne vse that to our great and common comfort hath beene made of this day
the vse was a coronation and a coronation is a principall point in this text but the coronation that was then beheld is past that whereof we are now to heare is to come yet this mutuall helpe they will yeild the one to the other that which is to come may call to mind that which is past and by that which is past we may the better conceiue that which is to come
yea by comparing them we shall perceiue that that which is to come is much more desirable then that which is past
for although flesh and blood may affect that which is past per se as if to be a soueraigne on earth vpon any condition were a soueraigne good yet a christian doth not he cannot as he ought digest those vexations which sowre euen a kingly state but propter aliud in hope to be a copartner of a greater a quieter crowne in heauen

this hope doth st iames cherish in these words he animates great personages to be constant notwithstanding all troubles knowing that their patience is not in vaine in the lord
that he speakes to great personages appeareth in the tenth verse let the rich reioyce when he is brought low where he teacheth two lessons first that great men may be brought low
secondly that yet they must reioyce

that great men may be brought low is not strange to reason therefore st iames doth onely represent that truth in a knowne yet a liuely resemblance of fading and withering hearbes and flowres
but that notwithstanding they are brought low they must reioyce is an harder truth reason whose principall it is that nothing delights in its owne destruction will not yeeld it
our apostle therefore workes an assent thereunto out of supernaturall grounds he sets downe two faire ones in my text whereof the first openeth the nature the second the end of patience
the nature of patience is briefly but fully set downe here ratione obiecti subiecti
the obiect is temptation but because thereof there are diuers sorts here is added a note of difference it is such temptation as maketh tryed men
the subiect is man but not euerie man it is undefined span alphabet a man of more then ordinarie place and worth and his worth is here distinctly set downe in two points wherein it principally doth consist and the points are answerable to the two parts of the obiect the first part of the obiect is temptation that layeth on load vpon the outward man in regard thereof he must undefined span alphabet he must hold out vnder his burden
the second part of the obiect is the tryall and that inquires into the inward man in regard thereof he must hold out out of that loue which he beareth to god
when such an obiect meeteth with such a subiect there ariseth the vertue patience
you haue heard the nature thereof now heare the end
the end is suitable to the vertue a happy end of so worthy a vertue the end is blessednesse and what would not a man doe to compasse blessednesse but what is this blessednesse though all desire it yet few are agreed about the nature of it quot capita tot sensus euerie man striueth for his owne
to compose this difference the holy ghost must interpose and define he doth it here behold a full definition in two words a crowne of life without life there is no blessednesse and no life is blessed without this crowne
you see the end one thing remaines the assurance that this is the end of patience that we haue here also in two verbes the lord hath promised it and the patient man shall receiue it
the warrant is good that hath gods word and here undefined span alphabet is he that warranteth it but his warrant is undefined span alphabet a promise so that the crowne must be claymed not by the law but by the gospel
undefined span alphabet he that is the lord may by vertue of his law command patience but undefined span alphabet putteth vs in mind how much we are beholding vnto the gospel by which he vouchsafeth a recompence

yea though he doth vouchsafe it and besides his promise the patient man hath no right vnto it he needs not distrust undefined span alphabet it is as true as the gospel he in all be sure of it

you see the substance of this scripture and see that it brancheth it selfe into pataence and a recompence whereof the patient man may not be proud and yet he is most sure
let vs now run ouer these points orderly pray god we may doe it profitably also
the first is the obiect of patience and that is called temptation here see how the phrase is changed of the rich man it was said before that he was brought low here it is said that he endureth temptation that was a vulgar phrase this is facred that might be vnderstood by reason this onely by faith you will confesse it if we doe a little rip vp the nature of it
god made man though vpright yet mutable the root of mutabilitie was freewill by which man may encline to either side notwithstanding this mutabilitie man did owe vnto god a constant and absolute obedience whether he would performe it it was to appeare his vnderstanding and his will were to be exercised the one with arguments the other with occasions which might discouer the one the resolution the other the election of man what way he would take the or the left the way of life or death
these arguments and occasions so administred are that which the scripture calleth temptation which though naturally they light vpon the outward man yet doe they formally aime at the inward man
examples you haue in the two principall temptations registred in the scripture that of the first adam gen
and that of the second adam math

in both which you may behold the serpents engines which were arguments and occasions which more or lesse are practised in all temptations and learne vs all this caueat to haue an eye to our vnderstanding and our will how they are wrought by how they entertaine these either arguments or occasions

but of temptations there are two sorts as they proceed from two different authors which aime at different ends the one author is god the other is the diuel each vseth a temptation but the common distinctions vsed by the fathers shew how vnlike their ends are
for the ones temptation is probationis the other is seductionis we owe a dutie to god god in tempting doth but discouer our performance of it the diuel he laboureth to peruert vs and corrupt whatsoeuer inclination to obedience there is in vs examples are verie frequent that open this distinction will instance but in one god called vpon abraham to sacrifice his sonne isaack the end of that commandement is reuealed plainly by the angel shewing that god would haue the world to see that abraham held nothing so deere vnto him which he would not yeeld readily vnto god the diuel he tempted vnto the same worke as it appeares in those that offered their children vnto molos but he did it to make men no lesse impious against god then vnnaturall to their owne children so that looke what difference there is between etheriall and elementall heat whereof the one is vegetiue

the other destructiue when it lighteth vpon hearbes and plants the same is there betweene the exploratiue and seductiue temptation when it lighteth vpon the wits and wils of men st paul ephes

cals the seductiue by significant names undefined span alphabet but the exploratiue is resembled to the touchstone to the pounding of spices the breaking of the boxe that containes sweet oyntments the fire that tryeth gold

but we haue not now to doe with seduction but with probation it appeares in the word undefined span alphabet which told you was the note of difference whereby st iames doth restraine this temptation to that which maketh tryed men
but of this there are two kinds for god tryeth by prosperitie or aduersitie when our worldly state is at best we are euen then put to the touchstone and god tryeth what manner of persons we are the storie of salomon is a cleere proofe but we haue not to doe with this temptation neither our temptation is that which bringeth a low it is the temptation of aduersitie st peter calleth it a fierie tryall st paul hebr
brancheth it into two parts shame and the crosse whereof the one disgraceth our person the other strips vs of our goods and life these both befell christ and they are the portion of christians we haue examples enough hebr
but we will not fall vpon the common place onely these things will briefly note first that when we are in aduersitie we must not thinke that god delights in affliction but in probation were it not to proue his children he would not lay the crosse vpon them
secondly this proofe doth not presuppose his ignorance but mans god knew what would be in vs before euer he made vs but we are not so well as we should be knowne to our selues much lesse to others lest we or they should be deceiued god bringeth to light the secrets of our heart and maketh vs reueale them in our eyes when they are sollicited by adulterie in our eares when they are sollicited by in our hands when they are sollicited by briberie finally in euerie part of our body yea and of our soule too he maketh vs reueale to others or our selues what lurketh in the deceitfull and intricate laberinth of our hearts
thirdly god will not be deceiued by painted sepulchers neither will he receiue counterfeits into heauen he doth therefore timely vnmaske them here on earth and shew whether euerie man appeare in his owne likenesse whether he be a meteor or a true starre whether he be fruit of sodome or of paradice whether he be an angel of light indeed or onely by a metamorphosis this is implied in the word undefined span alphabet

and this is the end for which god tryeth vasa figuli probat fornax et homines iustos tentatio tribulationis our temptation is nothing else but the bringing of vs to the touchstone this is the note of difference which must be coupled with the temptation that we may haue the proper obiect of christian patience

but the obiect is not enough without the subiect come we then to that the subiect is man
blessed is the man the word in english may reach all men and indeed patience is a vertue that is required in all

and all sorts of men are in other passages of scripture exhorted thereunto
euerie man must be salted with this fire and euerie sacrifice seasoned with this salt marke
st ambrose hath a good simile drawne out of this word salt which is that salt is no more requisite to keepe flesh from putrefaction then tribulation is to keepe man from sinne and a man must cease to be a member of christ that will not in a persecution be conformable vnto him seeing this is an vndoubted rule that thornes grow not more naturally from the ground to make adam eat his corporall bread in the sweat of his browes then calamities spring from earthly men to make the children of god to eat their spirituall bread in the bitternesse of their soules nullus sieri potest abel quem cain malitia non persequatur st paul hath a generall rule gal

speaking of ismael and isaack as he that was borne after the flesh persecuted him that was borne after the spirit so is it now yea it will be so euen till the worlds end

but my purpose is not to extend st iames his word beyond his meaning as he hath limited the text so will the commentarie the word by which he notes the subiect is undefined span alphabet which notes no common man but one of more then ordinarie place and worth it is more then undefined span alphabet as in hebrew ish is more then adam for ish and undefined span alphabet doe often note a great or a noble personage and that here the word is so to be taken it is plaine for it is a relatiue that calleth backe to the word undefined span alphabet which is in the tenth verse
this man here is he which before was called the rich not in a vulgar sense but in the language of the holy ghost who by rich vnderstandeth noble
in the old testament it is so and it is so in the new the place eccles

is a knowne place curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the rich no not in thy where rich and king both signifie persons in authoritie for so is the place generally applyed
in the new testament st mathew calleth ioseph of arimathea a st marke an as if rich and honorable were synonyma's
but the ant thesis that st iames maketh betweene undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet puts it out of all question for what is the opposite to a man of low degres but a man of high enough of the word

the point intimated by the word is that no member of the church ariseth to so high a degree of worldly state but christ calleth vpon them to take vp his crosse and follow him kings themselues in baptisme are signed with the signe of the crosse in token that they shall not be ashamed of christ crucified but shall continue his faithfull souldiers vnto their lines end they eat the body and drinke the blood of christ in token that they must communicate in his sufferings yea kings moreouer since the dayes of constantine the great haue borne the crosse on the top of their crownes to note what else but that they will take their parts thereof
that which the prophet isay speakes of christ imperium habet super humeros

is a phrase borrowed from earthly kings who are called in the hebrew tongue as if you would say portatores the erymologie of the word is set

downe by god himselfe numb
where he designes those that shall helpe moses to beare his burthen and iethro obserues it in the of exodus
the prouerbiall speech which elizaeus vsed of elias my father my father currus auriga israel reacheth not onely prophets but princes too both sustaine a double part in the societie of men they direct and they beare and one part of their burden is the crosse euen plaustra conuitiorum whole loads of reproaches and contumelies what the king of aram said to the captaines fight not against small nor great but onely against the king of israel seemes to be the charge which the bishop of rome giues to euerie pettie souldier in his host they were wont in their writing to vndertake a luther or a caluin a beza or a iewel or some man of their ranke but now there is not the basest pamphleter that hath not some venomous dart to shoote at the lords anointed whom in better times of the chvrch the greatest patriarches did not mention without that lowly respect which god hath made due vnto sacred maiestie
but what is to be done in the mid'st of these vnbridled tongues and pens kings themselues must resolue that they are vncti non tantum ad regnum sed etiam ad luctam men of their place must be men of such worth as here is described by st iames in such cases it belongs vnto them and to them principally to endure the crosse out of the loue of god

the first part of their worth is to endure undefined span alphabet which word implyes two things not to sinke in their courage for they must undefined span alphabet nor shrinke from their burden for they must undefined span alphabet that they must not sinke is the first

tribulationem patimur saith st paul sed non angustiamur whereupon a father quomodo angustiari potest qui dilatatur virtutibus vertue is like gold in the fire which looseth nothing of its weight but gaines in luster yea as gold when it is melted in the fire diffundit se in longum latum

it spreads farther and extends longer so saith bede doth the vertue of a child of god when he is exercised by the crosse more are the better for it and himselfe is the better setled to continue in it his vnderstanding is more cleared for the acknowledgment of the truth and his heart more strengthened for to sticke to it and this is properly undefined span alphabet to continue the same and not to be altered vnto worse by reason of the crosse but though we be nipt as corne with the frost of winter to stocke better and to beare a goodlyer eare of corne

as we may not sinke vnder the crosse so we may not shrinke from it there be many that be like st peter who said vnto christ master though all men forsake thee yet will not forsake thee will lay downe my life for thee yet when they are put to it they will as he did deny and forswear their master
the experiments that the primitiue church had in this kind were no lesse innumerable then lamentable the names of libellatici and traditores are infamous to this day wherof the one signed their renouncing of christ with their owne hand and the other with their owne hands gaue vp gods word to be burnt in the fire

those words of nazianzene undefined span alphabet

concerne verie many in all age
but we haue better examples to follow in the booke of daniel of the maccabees in the to the hebr wherein most memorable is that of moses who esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches then the treasures of aegypt and had rather suffer affliction with his brethren then to liue as the sonne of pharaohs daughter

but here are two cautions to be obserued the first is as we must not shrinke from the crosse so must we not offer our selues to it before we be called stand vpon thy guard saith st chrysostome and be ready to resist the assaulting enemie but do not rashly make thy selfe enemies hoc enim non est militis sed seditiosi it is enough for the souldier of christ to march forth when the alarum is sounded by the trumpe of the gospel

and st austin tolerare tentationes iubes nos domine non amare nemo quod tolerat amat etsi tolerare amat quamuis enim gaudeat se tolerare tamen mavult non esse quod toleret and we pray lead vs not into temptation
those frierly speaches then one of him that being released of his temptation expressed his griefe in these words

domine nen sum ego dignus modica tribulatione the other of him that being sollicited to adulterie by his owne lust refused the prayers of him that offered to intreat god on his behalfe out of a conceipt that his striuing with that lust would turne to his greater glorie sauour too much of cloyster superstition it may be impuritie also

the second caution is that as we must not vndergoe the crosse before we are called so being vnder it we must not rest vpon our own strength we must put on that same compleat armour mentioned
if we stand vpon this ground with st paul

can doe all things through christ that strengtheneth me we shall feele the truth of that which christ spake to st paul my grace is sufficient for thee

my strength is made perfect in weaknesse

deus non est sic saith st cyprian vt suos suos tantum spectet sed ipse luctatur in nobis ipse congreditur ipse in agone certaminis nostri coronat coronatur so that if any faile in temptation the reason must needs be not because he wanted strength which is present to all them that seeke it of god but because he wanted heart to put forth his strength according to that good rule in tertullian aliquando in lucta vincit quis non quia fortior sed quia cum timidiore congressus the enemie preuailes which could not preuaile if we did quit our selues like men for questionlesse the greater strength is on the christians side he might if he were not a coward undefined span alphabet endure the first part of the patient mans worth

but it is not the best part that looketh to the burden that is layd vpon the outward man but it is little regarded except it be done out of the loue of god that looketh to the tryall that is made of the inward man it is not enough for a man to endure though he endure temptation vnto the end he must enquire what is that that moues him to endure he may be moued vnto it by feare and so be patient but that is patience perforce he must not be held in thereby the vertue that god calleth for is loue

but the obiect of loue may be either god or the reward
the obiect of our loue must primarily and principally be the loue of god for we must haue an eye to our dutie which requires that we loue god though there were no reward belonging thereunto and then secondarilie we may haue an eye to the reward whereby god is pleased to sweeten our dutie
yea rather we must expect the reward and haue our eye principally vpon that which should be the first mouer of our dutie the loue of god
the reason why this vertue is required is for the propertie thereof the extensiue intensiue and protensiue the scripture obserues all three the extensiue it reaches all branches of vertue if we be moued by any other vertue our obedience will be partiall many are temperate that are not iust many iust that are not valiant many haue one vertue that want another but he that hath loue hath all in regard whereof the apostle saith that loue is the fulfilling of the law and st paul cor
maketh loue actiue in producing any vertue
as loue is so extensiue so is it intensiue also for all vertue is contained in loue gradu eminentiae in the highest pitch as the reasonable soule doth containe virtually and eminently the faculties of vegetation and sense so that he that is either iust temperate or patient out of charitie ascends as high as euer he can in any of those vertues last of all it is protensiue no vertue can hold out so long as charitie

for loue is as strong as death the coles thereof are coles of fire which hath a most vehement flame many waters cannot quench loue neither can the floods drowne it if a man would giue all the substance of his house for loue it would vtterly be contemned
we see then that the sinceritie as of pietie so of patience consists in loue whereby we must shew that we suffer without all respect of our owne either profit

or pleasure pulcherrimus coronae nexus quando puritas vita humilis pressurarum tolerantia sibi cohaerent
this condemnes the donatists of old and papists of this day who haue callendred martyrs whose impure liues and treacherous purposes if we rip vp we shall find that although in their sufferings they did undefined span alphabet yet they did it not out of the loue of god but for satisfying of their owne of their great masters hatefull lusts

you haue heard the subiect and the obiect which must concurre vnto this vertue of patience to make it true patience come now to the second maine part which is the recompence the recompence which is prouided for patience a recompence suitable vnto the patience a happy end of so worthy a vertue
god is a most gratious soueraigne though he might command the vttermost of our obedience actiue and passiue vpon that alleageance which we owe him yet doth he sweeten his precepts with sanctions propose a reward to such as do but their bounden dutie
and no maruell for the couenant between god and his church stands in mutuall stipulation of loue and here we haue mutuall experiments answerable to that stipulation the experiment of mans loue to god you haue heard in the patience now in the recompence you shall heare an experiment of gods loue

to man for the end of patience is blessednesse blessed is the man for he shall receiue he is said to be blessed in present but his reward is reserued for the time to come the holy ghost speaking of blessednesse must be construed according to the principles not of philosophy but of diuinitie philosophy vnder that name comprehends onely mans last end but diuinitie extends it moreouer to the meanes and that vpon a reason

the first is opposition to the curse blessednesse stood in the fruition of that soueraigne good which in the creation was proposed vnto man and for the attayning whereof sufficient abilitie was giuen vnto him sinne forfeited not onely the end but also the meanes and man became a curse no lesse in regard of that which he possessed then of that which he expected so that not onely to be excluded heauen but also to be vncapable of heauenly things is the curse of sinne and a blessing is that which remedieth this curse no lesse repairing our power to compasse this end then restoring our right and title thereunto
the second reason is the subordination of the meanes to the end which is a iust cause why the title of the end should be giuen to the meanes for god doth not appoint meanes but with assurance of the end therefore mox futurum habetur pro facto the scripture affirmes that to be already which shall be before long
the third reason is a compassion which god takes vpon mans weaknesse the wit of man readily acknowledgeth and the will ardently affecteth the end but most men doubt of and dislike the meanes especially this meanes of patience
the meanes therefore and especially this are often vrged and sweetned with this title blessed
blessednesse at the first ran in these tearmes hoc fac viues it required onely an actiue and no passiue obedience but since the fall we heare no lesse of the passiue then the actiue neither can we but by many afflictions enter into the kingdome of heauen we must be baptised with christs baptisme and drinke of his cup and if you marke the eight beatitudes in the first sermon of christ you see that they run almost all of them vpon a passiue obedience and place blessednesse in the crosse
a blessednesse then there is in suffering but few would affect it did they not hope for a better after it therefore st iames addeth what hereafter they are to expect and that is the crowne of life
this told you is a full definition of blessednesse a definition that better resolueth then those many but different that are found in philosophy blessednesse presupposeth life and the life is not blessed without a crowne

but the life and the crowne may either be considered in diuers times or knit together in one time if they be considered at diuers times then life belongs to this world and the crowne to that which is to come so that the apostle saith that the crowne to come is for the life that is past and a man that lookes for the crowne must haue a care of

this life

for he shall be crowned that striueth lawfully therefore christ in the reuelations saith esto fidelis tibi dabo coronam and againe hold fast that none take thy crowne

and st paul haue fought a good fight haue kept the faith from hence forth there is layd vp for me a crowne of righteousnesse haec vita est negotiatio they that here exercise their faith and hope by charitie shall find a reward in heauen

but if we ioyne life and the crowne and referre them both to the time that is to come then doth the crowne expresse the condition of the life in heauen for though the word life of it selfe vsed absolutely doe signifie a blessed life as appeares in many passages of scripture yet the crowne doth more distinctly represent vnto vs the manner of that life and it represents three things the perpetuitie the plentie the dignitie thereof the perpetuitie for as a crowne hath neither beginning nor ending so is it the liuely image of eternitie and in this respect it is called an immarcescible and immortall crowne and a kingdome that cannot be shaken

talia sunt dei dona saith chrysostome valida decore plena at in non ita est sed qui est in gloria non est securus qui autem securus non est in gloria in deo vtra{que concurrunt

secondly the crowne notes the plentie because as the crowne compasseth on euerie side so doth that which is plentifull satisfie on euery part and nothing is wanting in this life therefore the scripture in seuerall places runneth ouer euerie part of our body and power of our soule and sheweth how euerie one shall haue his content the eye in beholding god the eare in hearing the musicke of heauen the tongue in praysing

the last is the dignitie and that is principally noted by a crowne as it appeares by the vse that is made thereof on kings heads
and indeed what is eternall life but a coronation day the scripture indescribing it remembreth all parts of a coronation the robes long white robes of righteousnesse which we shall put on then the oyle of gladnesse wherewith we shall be annointed then the scepter which christ shall put into our hands to bruise therewith all nations the throne whereupon we shall sit with christ the feast whereat we shall eat and drinke with him finally in steed of a bishop or archbishop to performe these ceremonies we shall haue the great bishop of our soules iesvs christ and he shall doe it in the presence not of earthly peeres but of the heauenly both saints and angels

ad hereunto that this crowne is significantly called a crowne of life to distinguish it from the crowne of mortall princes which is but a dead crowne whereas this is a liuing
in a mortall kings crowne there is gold and flowers and pretious stones but all are dead the gold and flowers and pretious stones whereof our crowne consists are all liuing for the lord himselfe is the crowne in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crowne of glorie

and a diadem of beautie to the residue of his people and the people shall be a crowne of glorie in the hand of the lord and a royall diademe in the hand of god
and no maruell for the life to come is the marriage day wherein the spouse shall

receiue her crowne vpon her resurrection as christ receiued his crowne at his resurrection
st paul is plaine for it hebr
this phrase then of the crowne of life is more then a militarie phrase the souldiers in triumph wore insigne sine regno but here insigne ceniungitur cum regno and the name of crowne is vsed rather then any other ornament because ornamenta caetera membrorum sunt singulorum capitis ornatus totius corporis est dignitas

you haue heard what is patience and what is the recompence thereof one thing remaineth that the patient man may know vpon what ground he may expect this recompence that is set downe here by the apostle in two verbes undefined span alphabet and undefined span alphabet whereof each hath his nowne annext vnto it to undefined span alphabet is annexed undefined span alphabet expresly and betweene this nowne and that verbe there is a strong coniunction for the lord is so great a person as by the law may command our patience and yet so good a person is he that undefined span alphabet he hath promised a recompence
see then our title it is from god but grounded not vpon the law but the gospel
and indeed if you looke into st paul we shall find that undefined span alphabet is a word proper to the gospel especially in the epistle to the galathians so that we must not stand vpon desert but acknowledge gods mercie for as it is psal
coronat te miserationthus

it is true that st paul calleth it coronam iustitiae but there is iustitia fidelitatis as well as aqualitatis
the ground of merit euen in the creation was gods contract which he vouchsafed to make with his vassall notwithstanding the obligation of his naturall alleageance
this contract consisted of mutuall couenants which couenants were proportionable to the contractors mans conenant was of workes but workes proportionable to the abilities of man that is meane and finite gods couenant was of life proportionable to the magnificencie of god so that there was apparantly a proportion betweene the workes and the worker the rewarder and the reward but betweene the worke and the reward none at all
hence it is that betweene adams obedience and gods recompence thereof there could be no merit of condignitie which properly vnderstood compares and equalleth the worke and the reward without any other respect but merit of congruitie there might haue beene seeing god was pleased freely and graciously to propose to the worke so great a reward and to bind himselfe by promise to performe his couenant of life if man did performe his couenant of obedience
and this congruitie carrieth with it a iustice for god is no lesse iust when he keepes his word then when he equalleth a reward to a worke

but his first word was legall the word wherewith we haue to doe is euangelicall a word published by the prophets and apostles wherein there is mercie not onely in that god proposeth a reward to the worke but also for christs sake bestoweth the reward notwithstanding our defects in the worke for touching the worke of our passiue obedience st pauls rule is true non sunt condignae passiones saint

st bernard openeth st pauls meaning fairely and fully lest any man should restraine it out of a vaine conceit of any worth of his owne non sunt condignae saith he vel ad praeteritam culpam quae remittitur vel ad presentis consolationis gratiam quae immitticur vel ad futuram gloriam quae promittitur our momentaine afflictions which are but for a little time doe worke an exceeding eternall weight of glorie
vsura sortem excedit away then with all pride and let no romanists presume of more then gods free mercie for all our title is concluded in the lord hath promised

and what he promiseth shall be performed that appeares in undefined span alphabet there must be no distrust no distrust if the person be not mistaken to whom the promise is made that is to the patient man he shall be sure of it
there is a question an iustus possit excidere a gratia but of this which is in my text there is no question papists lutherans protestants all are agreed that he that perseuereth to the end shall be saued shall be glorified and would to god the world did take more care to perseuere then to dispute of the certaintie of perseuering

secondly undefined span alphabet the future tense intimates that beatitudo hic parari potest possideri non potest we must stay our time and in due time we shall not faile

undefined span alphabet let vs not be wearie of for in due time we shall reape if we faint not

the last point that note is that whereunto st iames applyes both the nature of patience and also the description of the end thereof it is to resolue humbled that they must reioyce and doubt not but by this time you will say they must reioyce let affliction be vnsauourie yet temptation rellisheth well for what generous nature doth not affect to haue his vertue most conspicuous especially that vertue which is the life of all vertue meane the loue of god
there is then matter of ioy included in the nature of the crosse

if in the nature much more in the end for this end is blessednesse and this blessednesse is the crowne of life looke how many words so many seeds shall say nay clusters of ioy
the moralist teacheth that pleasure is inseparable from blessednesse and how sweet life is aske but the naturalist whose axiome that is skin for skin and all that a man hath he will giue for his life
and as for a crowne all histories will teach vs that there hath beene no kind of festiuitie amongst the ancients whereof one token was not the wearing of a crowne
but if we consider moreouer that the blessednesse here mentioned is entire the life heauenly the crowne eternall then am sure there will be no question made of the ioy the ioy that attends the end of patience
let iulian seeke to disgrace the crosse and not endure it vpon his standard he shall find it in the verie entrals of beasts crowned to his confusion
let all the enemies of the church crowne vs here with thornes as they did our sauiour christ yet let vs be of good courage as his so ours shall be changed into a crowne of glorie
affliction is not destructiue nay that which is the path of death in the eyes of

men is vnto the godly the path of life the wicked thinke to doe vs hurt as iosephs brethren did when they sold him but as ioseph answered god meant it vnto good and so doth he worke our good out of the malice of all our foes sicut non minuitur patris dilectio quod christus passus sit ita ne{que nos minus diligimur quod tentamur if we suer with christ we shall raigne with him god will bring vpon dauid a blessing for shimei his curse and all that suffer for christ shall one day haue occasion to sing that part of the eighth psalme which belongs to you no lesse then to christ lord what is man that thou art so mindfull of him thou hast made him a little lower then the angels by affliction but hast crowned him with glorie and honour

the conclusion of all is kings are not free from nay they are most subiect vnto the crosse they must not be the worse for it nay their vertue must become the more resplendent by it so shall they be twice happy happy here on earth in that they beare the crosse vpon their crownes and happy in heauen where god shall set the crowne vpon all their crosses
god grant all states according to their degrees this patience that they may euerie one in heauen receiue his measure of the recompence
blessed are they that suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake

a sermon preached at
epigraph

iohn
make not my fathers house an house of merchandize

the whole chapter is a portion of this dayes liturgie and the latter part thereof containeth a preparation against easter for that feast drew neere as we read at the verse and we read there also that christ then went vp to hierusalem
first he went vp to be a good example vnto others of obeying the law secondly to giue a solemne beginning to that function whereunto he was not long before inaugurated at his baptisme
when for these ends he came into the temple at the verie entrance he perceiued the prophanation thereof and therefore the first worke that he vndertooke was to reforme that place
in this reformation he manifested potentiam potestatem power and authoritie power in his deed and in his word authoritie but a miracle in both
his deed was a miracle
st hierome commenting vpon the like reported math

affirmeth that it was the greatest miracle that euer christ wrought if that much more this for christ was now lesse knowne and worse attended therefore it was the more strange that being but one man in shew a meane man he should not onely set vpon but expell also out of the temple so great a multitude and that of no meane ones yet such was christs deed a verie miraculous deed
as there was a miracle in this deed so was there in his words for they were commanding and the command was no lesse effectuall then peremtorie dixit factum est all obeyed without disputing
measure these words as you did the deed by the of the person they also proue a great miracle

when christ with such words and deeds had amazed the iewes and prepared their attention tanquam dominus carrying himselfe as a king he then goeth on saith st cyril tanquam doctor at my text he puts on the person of a prophet he seconds his correction with instruction and diswades from that which prouoked his displeasure

so then the opening and forbidding of the iewes sinne are the two points whereinto we must resolue this scripture
the iewes did confound the temple with a market that was their sinne and that was it which christ could not endure
but more distinctly
the temple is a place of gods gratious presence of his presence for it is his house but that presence is gratious for he is there as the father of christ sancta sanctè they must looke to their feet that come into this house and put off their shooes that tread vpon that holy ground
the market is an house of merchandize men assemble there for worldly commerce terrena sapiunt dum terrena tractant as are the things so will their minds be those earthly therefore these
seing then these places be so different and our carriage must suit the place we cannot confound them without sinne and this sinne christ forbids make not my fathers house an house of merchandize
haue vnfolded and digested the contents of this scripture we must now looke into them more throughly pray god we may doe it fruitfully also
to begin then with the temple it is here called gods house
but we may not grosly conceiue of this phrase or dreame that he is included in a place
the properties of a place are to be definitiue and preseruatiue it limits and sustaines whatsoeuer thing is in it whereupon the schooles make a question whether it may agree to any spirit at all but it is out of all question that to god the father of spirits it can no way agree it could not before the creation for then there was nothing but god neither can it since for he impaired not his owne when he gaue being to the creatures
his essence then continueth vnlimited higher then the heauens deeper then hell longer then the earth wider then the sea as zophar the naamathite speaketh in the of iob god hath no bounds of himselfe but himselfe

as his essence continues vnlimited so doth it independent his name is shaddai therefore doth the scripture adde undefined span alphabet to his perfections undefined span alphabet and the fathers compound his attributes with undefined span alphabet mightie of himselfe undefined span alphabet true of himselfe undefined span alphabet sufficient of himselfe what god is none is besides neither is he beholding to any besides himselfe for whatsoeuer he is
seeing then the condition of gods nature doth exclude a place how may he be said to be in a house philo iudaeus answereth truly though briefly undefined span alphabet not for his owne but for his creatures good yea there is a necessitie that wheresoeuer a creature is there the creator must be also for all things liue moue and haue their being not onely by him but

in him

as the apostle speaketh
so that vorstius his limitation of gods essence to heauen doth imply a denyall not onely of the redemption for the sonne of god could not be incarnate on earth if that were true but also of the creation for if gods essence be not present with euerie creature then the creature subsisteth in it selfe and looke in what it subsisteth from that it had his being and so the creature will proue a creator which is a plaine contradiction

let it then stand for a fundamentall truth that gods essence is and we are euer not onely vnder his eye but also in his hand therefore it is as impossible for vs to subsist without him as to hide our selues from him
if we did meditate on such a presence it would breed in vs shame and feare shame to be guiltie before such a witnesse and feare to be obnoxious to such a iudge
but more think on god then make vse of this generall presence and no wonder seeing they neglect a greater shall say certainly a better meane gods gratious presence in the temple let vs now come to that from a place to this place the place of gods residence amongst his people

though then god be yet where the church is there is in a speciall sort his place which in my text is called his house
now the church is partly triumphant and partly militant therefore hath god an house in heauen

of which christ speaketh in st iohn and an house on earth which salomon speaketh of in his dedicatorie prayer

we haue to doe with this latter yet may we not forget that undefined span alphabet there is good correspondencie betweene the house in heauen and the house on earth as nazianzene gathereth out of the epistle to the hebrewes

and the apostle out of moses
hereupon is grounded the frequent communion of names heauen is called a sanctuarie and the sanctuarie is called heauen as if that were caelestle solum earth in heauen and this terrestre caelum heauen on earth which note the rather because this correspondencie maketh much for the increase of that reuerence which is due to the place

the place of gods presence in the temple was full of gratious maiestie
of maiestie for it was called hekal which signifieth a kingly palace and indeed god represented himselfe there as king for he was present in the cloud that conducted the israelites out of aegypt

and of the angel that appeared therein god said nomen meum est in eo therefore where that rested god was said there to put his name and it rested betweene the cherubins as vpon a throne of state to say nothing of the cherubs that were figured on the walles enuironing that throne seruing to set forth the maiestie thereof
but this is much more cleere in the visions of esay ezechiel daniel and st iohn all which put life into these dead types and set forth the liuing god attended with infinite numbers of holy liuing spirits whose awfull behauiour preach humilitie to vs vile sinfull wretches and teach how we should come into the presence of our glorious

god we should all be affected as iacob was in his vision and breake out into his words how dreadfull is this place

but as the place is full of maiestie so is that maiestie gratious for there is not onely the presence of god but god is there as the father of christ and indeed the cloud rested vpon the mercie seat which couered the arke of the couenant wherein were included the two tables conteyning the articles thereof and this plainly testifieth the grace of god in christ for christ is undefined span alphabet the propitiatorie the apostle calleth him so and if god doe not looke into the articles of the couenant but through him he is the mediatour betweene god and vs that is the sauing grace of god

adde hereunto that as that couenant is resolued into two parts undefined span alphabet gods stipulation and our restipulation so the principall parts of the temple were oraculum altare the oracle and the altar at both which god shewed himselfe to be the father of christ
the properties of a father are vigilant prouidencie ouer and tender indulgence toward his child and what is the oracle wherein gods will from time to time was made knowne to the church but an euidence of his fatherly care of it and what was altar whereat the people did daily present and god accept their deuotion but a full proofe how gods bowels were compassionate towards them so that both these parts speake nothing but grace grace gods grace in iesvs christ
the other parts of the temple were but accessories to these and therefore must follow the condition of the principall they signifie grace

and are also holy omnes fines templi in circuitu sanctum sanctorum the very outskirts were reuerent and bare ingrauen iehoua shamma

the lord is in this place as appeareth in the storie that goeth before my text for these merchants whom christ expelled were at most but in atrio populi the second court nay it is most likely that they went no farther then atrium gentium the outmost court of all and yet christ calleth that his fathers house so did it please god to hallow those remoter parts to put vs in mind how much more the nearer to his presence were to be reuerent in our eyes

but how could that or any part of the temple be christs fathers house seeing by the iewes owne confession it wanted both the arke and the cloud types the one of the father the other of christ surely though god after the babylonian captiuitie would not supply the iewes any more with those types to set a sharper edge vpon their longing after the truth as he would no more suffer them to be a free monarchy that they might wish for the sonne of dauid their heauenly and eternall king yet because the oracles which were giuen from the cloud continued in the scriptures and their sacrifices were accepted in reference to the former propitiatorie god still acknowledged the temple for his house and christ doth so esteeme it and our churches also vpon the same ground for that where two or three are gathered together in christs name he is amongst them god speaketh to

vs in his word and we haue leaue to speake to him in our prayers our churches say vpon this ground are undefined span alphabet places of state and grace we may well call them christs fathers house we may not them nor any thing that belongs vnto them church and both are holy and we must vse them holily

but hath god care of churches of temples made with hands built of timber and of stone of gold and of siluer or are not these things rather written for vs to rayse our thoughts to higher things these were but types they haue a truth they were ecclesiasteria places or sites of churches not undefined span alphabet as isidor peluciota doth well distinguish that which is truly a temple or a church is rationabilis domus as chrysostome speaketh christ is the temple as himselfe teacheth not farre from my text
but christs person is either naturall or mysticall himselfe or his church also himselfe is immediately and the church mediately the truth of this type
we must first behold this truth in christ for he is undefined span alphabet the originall sampler whereof we are but undefined span alphabet exemplifications therefore though we must be answerable vnto him yet equall vnto him we cannot be

christ then is a liuing temple his name christ importeth as much

you may gather it out of the prophet daniel when he was conceiued by the holy ghost then was the holy of holyes anointed
but st paul to the hebrewes hath taught vs

that whereas there are two natures in christ the godhead and the manhood he is a temple in regard of his manhood

yet undefined span alphabet as nyssene speaketh both parts thereof concurre to make this temple

but more distinctly let vs see the correspondencie betweene this spirituall and the materiall temple
the materiall temple was a place of gods presence and is not the manhood of christ yes verily for the godhead dwelleth bodily therein and they were personally ioyned together
the materiall temple was furnished with the oracle and the altar the manhood of christ is destitute of neither
not of the oracle for christ was sapientia verbum dei the wisedome and the word of god throughly acquainted with his secrets which he cleerely reuealed to his church and neuer had she so full

so exact an oracle
neither was he lesse an altar then an oracle habemus altare we haue an altar saith st paul speaking of christ yea he was vtrum{que altare the altar of incense for from his sacred brest ascended deuout prayers more pleasing to god then the sweetest odors and what holocaust was euer so propitiatorie as the sacrifice of his body which he offered vnto god to expiate the sinnes of the world well might his enemies fasten his body to the crosse as a place of execution but he on himselfe offered himselfe a sacrifice of propitation
neither could his oblation haue beene so acceptable

if by his eternall spirit he had not offered himselfe to god for the altar must be greater then the guift because the guift

is sanctified by the altar although we doe not dislike the fathers giuing of this honorable title in a qualified sense to the crosse yet doth it most properly belong to christs person

you see then there was nothing remarkable in the materiall temple which was not in the spirituall meane our sauiour christ

as these things were in him so by him they are all in vs

as many as haue vnion with his person haue communion in his grace and by that temples dwelling in vs we our selues become temples as cassian well collects
we must then see how well herein we answer christ and we shall find that we answer him in all points

his whole manhood made vp the temple and so doth ours

know you not saith the apostle that you are the temple of god speaking of our whole person
but lest question should be made of any part in the sixth chapter he distinctly expresseth both body and soule he that is ioyned vnto the lord is one spirit with him that is cleere for our soule
and lest we should our worser part know you not saith he that your bodyes are the temples of the holy ghost so that no question can be made of either part of our person both are liuing stones

and built vp into a spirituall house

and if we be spirituall houses then god is in vs of a truth

for so the apostle collecteth ye are the temples of the liuing god saith god and will dwell in them and walke in them
st peter is not afraid to say

we are made partakers of the diuine nature and the fathers that we are deified
although there be no personall vnion betweene vs and god as there is in christ yet such a mysticall one there is that philo iudaeus his words are verie true deus est animae bonorum incola malorum tantum accola though gods generall influence be wanting to no creature yet his gratious inhabitance is the prerogatiue of the church
and all they to whom god commeth so neere haue presently erected in them an oracle and an altar the spirit by the word reuealeth their eyes to see the maruailous things of gods law they are all undefined span alphabet they haue an vnction that teacheth them all things

yea they haue the verie mind of christ yea the same spirit that erecteth the oracle erects an altar also an altar of incense in their hearts which sendeth forth prayers intelligibiliter suaueolentes spirituall but acceptable vnto god as origen answereth obiecting to the christians that they had no altars
and how can we want an altar of burnt sacrifice when our broken and contrite hearts offer vp our bodies a liuing sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is our reasonable seruice of him

this is enough to let you vnderstand that we are if we are christians houses of god answerable vnto christ would it were enough also to perswade vs so to esteeme our selues as such grace requireth at our hands for what an improuement is this to our persons and what a remembrance should this be to euerie one to keepe his vessell in honour but more of that anon
must first speake a little of the description

of the market it is in my text called an house of merchandize

god that made vs men made vs also sociable and vsed our wants as a whetstone to set an edge vpon that propension but we should liue together as merchants ordered by commutatiue iustice whose standard is undefined span alphabet it requireth that men barter vpon euen tearmes otherwise one man will deuour another and the common weale cannot continue to preuent this mischiefe god hath appointed distributiue iustice the vertue of the magistrate who dispencing praemium poenam reward and punishment should set euerie man a thriuing but suffer no man to thriue to the preiudice of others
the euill of the dayes wherein we liue doe giue me occasion to complaine not onely that there is varietie of corruption in trades dangerous because some are but also of the decay of trades no lesse dangerous because there are so many thousands that haue no meanes to thriue at all
gouernours giue order for houses of correction and no doubt but if they were better vsed vagrants might be restrayned thereby but there must be moreouer an increase of trades that must employ the multiplying as they doe in this blessed time of peace while the gentleman depopulates the countrey and the vsurer and victualer are become the chiefe of incorporations what wonder if contrarie to gods law and the kings the whole land be filled with miserable poore
there is no true at least no full remedy for this euill but they to whom the care of distributiue iustice is committed must reuiue and quicken the commutatiue and make our land according vnto that good opportunitie which god hath giuen vs an house of merchandize
this by the way vpon occasion of the phrase where out you may gather that in the market the world taketh vp most of our thoughts and our dealing there is for worldly things
hauing sufficiently opened the description of the temple and the market the difference betweene them is euident to a meane conceit he will easily apprehend that the one place is heauenly the other earthly the one for the communion of saints the other for the commonweale in the one place we need be no more then men in the other we must shew our selues to be the children of god
and is it not a great fault to confound these things which god hath so distinguished surely it is and it was the iewes fault christ doth open it as he doth forbid it for if we may beleeue the rabbines the law was pronounced in the eares of malefactors while stripes were layed vpon their backes and it is most likely that while christ expelled the merchants with his whip he spake these words vnto them make not my fathers house an house of merchandize
let vs come then to this prohibition

the best places are subiect to abuse heauen was and so was paradise no wonder then if the temple be and seeing abuse can be excluded

no where we must be watchfull yea the better a place is the more doth the diuel solicit vs to abuse it because he will doe god the more despite and worke man the more mischiefe therefore the better the place is the more circumspect must we be it is a soule fault to dishonour god any where but specially in his owne house
in estimating our owne wrongs we aggrauate them by this circumstance

and shall we neglect it when we ponder the sinnes we commit against god nay rather the greatnesse of our contempt ariseth with the greatnesse of his maiestie which appeareth in that place and the more gratious he sheweth himselfe there the more gracelesse are we if we yeeld him not a due regard
now what doth that due regard require at our hands surely that we bring not so much as the world into the temple we may not doe legitima in illegitimo loco saith st austin we may not doe lawfull things in a place appointed for better vses caelum est caelum ingrederis

the temple is heauen as you are taught before when thou entrest the temple thou must suppose thou art entering into the kingdome of heauen
now in heauen there is neither eating nor drinking marrying nor giuing in marriage buying nor selling therefore we must neither thinke of nor meddle with these things while we enter into that place

haue you not houses of your owne saith the apostle or doe you despise the church of god if euer there it must appeare that though we be in yet we are not of the world for as god hath chosen a day wherein to represent the time so hath he chosen a place wherein to shadow the state that we shall haue in heauen our animall life shall then cease and we shall enioy no other then that which is spirituall
and this is that which we should haue a tast of at our comming into the temple yea to the verie thereof
to breed the greater respect of the inmost parts the outmost are to be honoured and would that the canons of the church and statutes of this land were obserued touching if we did put off the world when we come thither no doubt but we would be more free from it when we came within the church
but the church is lesse reuerend in our eyes because the churchyard is growne so contemptible for what more vsuall then therein to thinke of dealing in worldly things christ would not endure it as you may perceiue in my text would we had some of christs zeale feare not onely superstitious papists but iewes yea turks too will rise vp in iudgment against vs and condemne vs for this abuse for bringing the world into the temple

and if we may not bring in the world into the temple much lesse the flesh and the diuel wanton eyes and malicious hearts for what communion hath the temple of god with idols and euerie lust is an idol yea it is a verie diuel
and yet bedes complaint is true many come to church which are so farre from hauing any mind to heare or pray vt ea pro quibus orare debebant peccata augeant that they run farther in arrerages while they should be by repentance and faith cancelling their obligation they not onely dishonour that temple wherein

themselues are made temples of god but also adde to those ruins of their spirituall house for the repaire whereof they should resort vnto these places neither doe they silly wretches discerne the stratageme of the diuel he diuerts their attention from the oracles of god that they may not be put in mind of their dutie and casts their deuotion into a slumber that their drowsie prayers may not be able to pierce the heauens and then he knowes that if he can so ruine the oracle and altar of god in man the masterie will not be hard let him suggest what he will he shall be beleeued by them them that haue no better thoughts yea and obeyed too by them that neglect to call to god for grace
and indeed though he wish ill to the materiall temple yet his malice is most bent against the spirituall and he makes way to the abuse of the later by the abuse of the former knowing that their reuerence doth liue and dye together and he will easily make a house of merchandize of vs if he can bring vs to make a house of merchandize of the church

but though neither of the temples must be abused yet our greatest care must be of the spirituall for the type is inferiour to the truth yea and if the truth be abused the contagion thereof will reach vnto the type as we learne in haggai where the polluted priests are said to pollute the hallowed things

but the truth is either christ or christians both temples may be abused the abuse of christ and turning that temple into a house of merchandize is a peculiar sinne of the church of rome and well may we call the popes undefined span alphabet

merchants of christ witnesse this verie yeere which paulus quintus hath made a yeere of iubile that is of merchandizing christ for howsoeuer the bull haue a specious preface deploring the iniquitie of the times and the vengeance of god vpon the christian world and excites peoples deuotion to pacifie god and diuert his wrath yet seeing it giueth euerie man leaue to chuse his confessor and the confessor power at his pleasure to commute penance doe you not perceiue the mysterie of iniquitie the artificiall merchandizing of christs merits vnder the couert of the popes indulgence no doubt but god will so be well pacified and christian soules filled with heauenly comfort or rather the pope sheweth himselfe to be that whore of babylon that makes merchandize of the soules of men
and indeed both in hebrew and greeke a whore and a merchant meet in one name zona and undefined span alphabet to note that they vse their merchandizing but to giue an opportunitie vnto whordome so doth the pope make sale of these things but to draw men to resort vnto him and commit spirituall fornication with him fall downe and worship their lord god the pope
but god be thanked we haue better learned christ and are farre from turning that temple into an house of merchandize
would we were as farre from abusing our owne but we merchandize too much therein
merchandizing in the storie going before my text is resolued into buying selling and taking money to vse for there were that sold and there were that

bought and there was a banker and haue we not all these in our selues the world offers her wares vnto vs and our flesh hath a good will to trade with the world but we want meanes and the diuel is by as a banker and what wicked policies and mischieuous deuices doth he furnish vs with that we may not part without a bargaine seldome are we tempted with that which we affect that we haue not too good opportunities to fulfill the lusts of the flesh at least we shew that there is no want in affection euen when we are excluded from the act of sinne and that is plaine merchandizing in the sight of god and abusing of his temple that is dedicated to him so the ambitious the voluptuous the couetous doe turne their temple into an house of merchandize
and would this were all that we did onely merchandize in the house would we did not merchandize the house it selfe merchandize the materiall house for how venall are sacred both places and things the simonie that cannot be excused is growne to be a crying sinne all the sophistry that couetousnesse and ambition haue deuised will neuer wash away the guilt thereof that cleaueth to the consciences nor kill the that eateth into the estates of those profane merchants pereat pecunia tua tecum st peters doome vpon simon magus hath pronounced a curse against that sinne

if we may not merchandize the type much lesse the truth and yet how many sell themselues to worke wickednesse esay is branded for a profane person who sold his for a messe of pottage and no wonder for his was mysticall he therein sold his right to heauen and therefore he found no place for repentance though he sought it with teares a fearefull thing
and is our case lesse fearefull if we sell our selues our persons are mysticall they are temples of the holy ghost and are not we verie profane if we merchandize them doe we not run a desperate course and prostitute our sacred selues for things of nought a could say

nihil cuiquam vilius serpso a man setteth lesse by nothing then by himselfe nostri essemus si haec nostra non essent we would owne our selues if we did not desire to be owners of the world
how many sinfull things be there in exchange for which if we should be demanded our farme or our house we would haply answer non tanti emam poenitere will not buy repentance at so deare a rate yet for those verie things we can be contented to giue our selues and thinke silly ones that we are that we haue that verie cheap which costs vs too too deare too too deare say if we know the price of a temple of god and set our selues at so high a rate as the honour god hath done vs requireth at our hands were we but reasonable men we might not so our selues as to thinke any worldly thing worth our either ciuill libertie or our naturall life how much lesse then may we equall any of these yea all these things vnto that adoption of sonnes and consecration into temples which are vouchsafed vs of god well if we doe not as we ought prize gods fauour god will as we deserue punish our contempt

he that destroyes gods temple him will god destroy prosaners of the naturall temple haue had ill ends and the profaners of the spirituall may not looke for good what christ in regard of the naturall temple did visibly

that saith origen doth he euerie day inuisibly concerning the spirituall and beleeue that if he shewed such zeale for the materiall he will shew much more for the spirituall and if we regard not the iudgement which he executed with a whip he will one day set vpon vs with his sword and if he strooke such terror into the wicked in the dayes of his humilitie iudge you what terror he will strike into them in the dayes of his glorie and if we are ashamed of the disgrace of being cast out of the temple let vs feare the vengeance of being cast into hell

but told you that this was a preparation for easter and it is for easter that you are now to be prepared and you see what your preparation must be the materiall temple must be rid of all profanesse and so must the spirituall too purifie the place purifie your selues so may you with comfort eat of christ our passeouer which is sacrificed for vs and if all the of either house be sprinkled with the blood of that lambe the punishing angel will passe by vs and the plagues of aegypt shall neuer seaze vpon vs away then with these things away with sheepe and oxen the worldly thought away with turtles and with doues let not the world here possesse the heart let both remember and shew that holinesse beseeming gods house for euer

when christ spake these words they were so powerfull that all that heard them did readily obey them cannot hope for such a miracle

but will pray that we may all haue grace so to keepe gods sabbaoths

and reuerence his sanctuarie that comming into his house in the multitude of his mercies and in his feare worshipping towards his holy temple we our selues may more and more become temples of grace haue god dwell in vs vntill we are translated vnto him haue the oracle of faith vntill we are admitted vnto his blessed sight and the altar of deuotion vntill we attaine our euerlasting vnion this the owner of the house grant vs through christ in whom we haue this honour to be houses by the operation of the holy ghost the architect of these houses
to which one god in three persons we render all honour and glorie now and for euer amen

blessed are they that dwell in thy house lord they shall euer be praysing thee

psalme
verse
said will confesse my transgressions against my selfe and thou forgauest the iniquitie of my sinne
selah

this is one of the psalmes appointed for this dayes and it fits well the season for it is the second of those that are called penitentials and repentance is or ought to be the most of our exercise this time of lent
but when we goe thereabout it is our best way considering our ignorance and negligence to endeauour the exemplification of some worthy patternes and a more worthy then king dauid we cannot haue for regis admirabilem virtutem poenitentia fecit splendidiorem as theodoret obserues that king was a manifold worthy but his worth did shine in nothing more conspicuously then in the feeling acknowledgment of his owne vnworthinesse and his doctrinall practise of that kind is the argument that is handled in this psalme
let vs looke then into it
the title is a briefe of the whole for maschil being interpreted is a lesson of happy wisedome and no wisedome so happy as that which makes or keepes our peace with god
but these things are done the one by repentance the other by these causes with those effects are the foure parts whereinto we may fairely breake this psalme
my text is found in that part which teacheth repentance for thereof confession is a principall branch and the doctrine of confession is redoubled in this verse whereof haue chosen the latter clause

so then we haue now to doe with penitentiall confession and are out of this scripture to learne what it is and how it speeds
what it is we shall see in king dauids practise and in his successe how it speeds

but more distinctly
in the practise we are to consider the matter confessed and the manner of confessing
the matter is sinne his owne sinne
of this he had a sense manifested by an euidence the euidence is a confession a penitentiall confession for it layeth the blame where it is deserued he confesseth against himselfe and seekes reliefe where it may be found he confesseth vnto the lord
he confesseth doe say say too much for he was come no farther then dixi confitebor he did but professe his resolution the action was to come
thus farre the text doth open his practise
in that which remaines it reports his successe he sped remarkably well
well he in humilitie gaue glorie vnto god and god did gratiously relieue him
but marke here also the matter wherein and the manner how
he relieued him in that which he confessed in sinne the iniquitie of his sinne and this reliefe was a release it was the forgiuenesse of that sinne
but here obserue and wonder at the goodnesse of god king dauids practise was but a purpose but his successe is a performance so much is gods mercie more forward then mans dutie
and is not this a remarkable successe surely it is and so much is signified by selah for selah interpreted morally is a note of some great and some constant truth and such is that which is contained in my text
you see the particulars whereof this holy scripture doth occasion me to speake that we may all be the better for that which shall be spoken let vs by gods assistance with christian audience listen againe vnto them as they shall now be vnfolded briefly and in their order

begin at king dauids practise wherein the first thing obserued was the matter confessed and that is sinne
peccatum confitetur vt publicanus non iustitias vt pharisaeus he appeares befor god in the humilitie of the publican not in the pride of the pharisee he had many prerogatiues for he was a man after gods owne heart the father of faithfull kings the sweet singer of israel a liuely type of our sauiour christ but he fixed his eyes vpon none of these neither came any of these into his mind he remembreth nothing but sinne
and what doth this intimate but that his guid was not nature but grace for by nature we not onely desire to heare from others but also our selues would be heralds of our owne vertues yea and are contentedly deceiued by setting and seeing them in a false light to haue others admire them but specially our selues to dote vpon them
euerie man naturally is a laodicean and thinkes himselfe rich and increased in goods and in regard of his spirituall estate to want nothing
but what our sauiour christ replyed to that church is spoken to vs all thou doest not know that thou art poore wretched blind and naked

no man doth thinke on these things by nature and therefore when any man doth it is a signe of grace as it was in dauid that thought rather what he wanted then what he had rather how vile then how good he was

and indeed where grace is it fareth with our soules as it doth with our bodies if a man be sicke haue he neuer so stately reabes they cannot shelter haue he neuer so daintie fare it cannot rellish haue he neuer so soft a bed yet cannot rest his diseased body feeles nothing but the afflicting peccant humour
euen so when the remorse of conscience workes all our guifts be they neuer so great they appeare not they cannot couer our nakednesse they cannot satisfie our haunger and thirst neither doe they ease our torture though we haue them yet for the time we haue no vse of them we see we heare we feele nothing but sinne as experience teacheth them that haue beene assistants to soules distressed in this kind
but it is not onely sinne but haynous and ennormous sinne that is here remembred king dauid is as ambitious to his sinne as others are to amplysie their vertues for this word reuolt and rebellion the highest improuements that can be of sinne
you will acknowledge it if you distinguish inter legemet legis latorem euerie trespasse is a violating of the law but to set at nought the and set our selues against him what is it but if men satisfie particular lusts they commit but particular sinnes as in theft adulterie murder but treason is iniustitia it includes all kind of ennormities
what then could king dauid say more against sinne then to make it the character of the sonne of belial that breakes gods bonds and casts his cords from him peruersè imitatur createrem suum vt sibi ipsi lex sit vsurps the throne of god yea because there is no neutralitie in this case for he that is not with god is against him and auersenesse from god is attended with aduersenesse to him for rebellion is that whereat the diuel aymeth in reuolt sinne doth muster vs in the armie of the dragon and ranketh vs with the malignant brood of the serpent so much doth king dauid signifie by this word and by so amplifying teacheth vs that we may mince sin but as we consider the law which we transgresse so must we also the to whom our sinne doth reserre and we shall find that commonly it is of a higher nature then we suppose and is a plaine spirituall treason
oh that all adulterers and murderers would herein be dauids schollers and then no doubt but out of that detestation which they haue of treason they would profitably conclude how odious they deferue to be in the eyes of god themselues deserue to be for the sin which king dauid amplyfieth is his owne he makes bold in this case with none but himselfe

it is a strange peruersenesse of our conscience to be sharpe sighted a farre off when we view others but to be purblind at hand when we looke on our selues our perspectiues multiply the motes that are in

other mens eyes and make them appeare as great as beames but the beames that are in our owne eyes they so diminish that they scarce peare so bigge as moates how doe we detest that in others which we suffer in our own brests and how many would we send to hell for that our selues hope to climbe to heauen sic nemo in sese tentat descendere nemo is perswaded that all is well at home
but euerie man is best knowne to himselfe and therefore euerie man should study himselfe most and if he doe though haply others be bad yet will he find himselfe to be worse and confesse with st paul

peccatorum ego primus and say as this king doth in another place haue sinned haue done wickedly but what haue these sheepe done no mans sinne will appeare greater then our owne
and so much of the matter confessed

come now to the manner of confessing
the word vsed by the psalmist is borrowed out of the law leuit

and numb
and so alludes to the ceremoniall sacrifice wherein the offerer was to lay his hand vpon the sacrifice in acknowledgement of what he deserued and wherewith he was to be relieued
the words of my text containe the morall of that ceremonie which teacheth that we must manifest a sense of our sinne and in that manifestation must first lay the blame where it is deserued and then seeke onely to him in whom we may find succour
confesse we must that is the manifestation but the confession must be made against our selues who onely are and we must present our confession vnto the lord from whom onely we may expect succour
but a little more fully to rip vp these points
the septuagint hath undefined span alphabet which sheweth that in confession there must be a concurrencie both of soule and body and both must arraigne vs at the barre for it is verbum forense
if it were onely undefined span alphabet the euidence of the tongue were enough but undefined span alphabet imports that there is an inward sense of the outward euidence
and indeed st cyprian telleth vs concerning the inward sense that confession is undefined span alphabet conscientiae st austin that it doth pondus animi st ambrose he that confesseth ingemit dolore speakes with sighes and groanes that cannot be exprest
and indeed this inward sense must be the first step of confession and we must be resolued of that truth which is deliuered by nazianzene undefined span alphabet it is a principall thing in confession to be touched at the heart

but then ex abundantia cordis os loquitur and therefore st austin saith that to confesse is ex occulto et tenebroso procedere alluding to lazarus his comming out of the graue and to shew that indeed we detest sinne a true penitent will vtter it undefined span alphabet

so did manasses so did the prodigall child and so doth king dauid in this place
if any man be spare of speech in this kind tertullian will tell him that dissimulatio est consilium contumaciae it is to be doubted that he is not so out of charitie but he may be reconciled againe to his

sinne whereas confessio error is is professio deserendi and he that outwardly and inwardly doth confesse obligeth himselfe to forsake sinne both to god and man
obligeth himselfe say for the verbe undefined span alphabet is iudiciall and the obligation is the stronger by how much the stipulation is more solemne and if the arraignment passe before god and men there is no trauersing of such an indictment the indictment which our selues put in and our selues doe signe to be billa vera

but as confession signifieth a giuing in of euidence or rather the finding of the bill of indictment so we must particularly see against whom the bill is found
king dauid finds it against himselfe he layeth the blame where it was deserued and confesseth against himselfe
it was condemned long since for an heresie in vnchast martion to hold peccata non voluntate sed necessitate patrari with that maxime he thought to excuse his incontinencie
for the ground of this pretended necessitie men haue sought to opposite places some to heauen and some to hell the opinion is ancient that setcheth it from either adam was the author of the first he layd his sinne to god the woman that thou gauest me gaue me of the fruit and did eat
and no lesse ancient is that that fetcheth it from hell eue layd the blame vpon the diuel the serpent said she beguiled me and did eat
these masters haue had many schollars would they had not still but to the first the sonne of syrach spake in his dayes say not the lord hath caused me to erre for he hath no need of sinfull men he is a god of pure eyes and cannot behold wickednesse
and to the second st austin non est hoc tollere sed geminare peccatum the excuse is worse then the fault for as strong as the diuel is suadere potest cogere non potest he may verie powerfully commend it vnto vs but it is neuer entertained but by our good will
so that we may spare much vnnecessarie paines of climing into heauen to know what god hath decreed or descending into hell to inquire after the diuels power we must stay at home and there sind the right partie for man as soloman speakes peruerteth his owne waies and euerie man saith st iames when he is tempted is baited and led aside by his owne lusts so that the rhetoricall translatio criminis whether it be de compendio or per circuitum as st austin speakes on this text must haue no place in confession herein quo quis humilior eo laudabilior the lesse excuse the more grace

and if men in confession may not deriue their blame to others how much lesse may they vaunt of that which they doe amisse and yet how many are there which not onely some out their owne filthinesse but also glorie in their shame

the shew of whose countenance witnesseth against them who discouer their sinne as sodom did

and desire not to hide it of whom god complaines in ieremie were they ashamed when they committed abhomination they were not ashamed neither could they blush
too too many there are that set themselues down in the seat of the scorner and thinke that it is their highest commendation not onely to haue sinews of iron in their necke but plates of brasse on their to be not onely incorrigible but impudent

also whose sinnes that are indeed the workes of darknesse are become so shamelesse as to walke abroad at noone day
witnesse the blasphemies the impurities the violences that are so frequent obiects of euerie mans eyes and eares
but this is not to confesse against our selues for to confesse against our selues is to be humbled not to be exalted it taketh downe our pride and doth not hearten our shamelessenesse
this is the first branch of that euidence which we giue in and it was the first thing noted by imposing of hands vpon the sacrifice

but there was another meant also which was the pointing out of the meanes and person by whom we are relieued and that is god in christ which is taught in the second part of the euidence the confessing to the lord
to confesse to the lord is not to informe him of that which he doth not know but rather as st austin speakes affectum nostrum patefacimus in te domine confitendo tibi miserias nosiras we adde nothing to gods knowledge

but rather reueale our assection to
confessio fraudis nostrae est laudis dei which the verie word iadah in hebrew notes including in it both

but the affection that we reueale in our confession is double it is affectus timoris and confidentiae which looke to the two artributes of god that temper his prouidence in gouerning the world meane iustice and mercie for confessio peccatorum est testimonium conscientiae timentis deum as st chrysostome no man can doe it but he doth acknowledge and tremble at the lustice of god
yet not the iustice onely doth affect him but the mercie also for confessio poenitentis ad laudem pertinet ignoscentis because as we tremble when we consider god is iust so considering that he is mercifull we hope in him also thus to seare thus to hope is to giue glorie vnto god and to giue him glorie is to confesse vnto him
you expect haply that importuned by the romish commentaries on this place should fall vpon the controuersie of auricular confession but know that the pulpit especially in the time of lent is rather for ghostly counsell then for disputes and therefore forbeare onely giuing this note that our church doth not condemne it as simply euill and therefore hath in the liturgie restored it to its natiue puritie
onely it were to be wished that so farre as the church allowes it we would practise it for am perswaded that many liue and dye in enormous sinnes that neuer made any vse of it nor receiued any comfort from the power of the keyes
the confessing to the lord doth not exclude confessing vnto man so the due limitation be obserued
but enough of the confession
there is one point more to be obserued before we come to the successe and that is that this confession of king dauid was onely in purpose he was come no farther then dixi a sense he had of his sinne but he was not yet come so farre as to vtter it though he was disposing himselfe thereunto

but dixit was not onely verbum oris but cordis also promptitudinem

alacritatem hoc verbo notat saith st bernard he was willing and ready to make his confession he adds saul dixit peccaui sed quia non dixit antequam diceret corde priusquam ore as king dauid did non audiuit deus transtulit tuum he heard not so good newes from samuel as king dauid did from nathan the lord hath put away thy sinne

the lesson rising hence is pij non trahuntur ad tribunal dei sed sponte accedunt knowing that there is no shelter against god but onely in god we must preuent our summons and resolue vpon a voluntarie apparance
finally putting the purpose to the confession we see that the children of god vse not to continue in their sinnes but so soone as they are roused the principles of grace doe worke and they humbly shreeue themselues to god
and so haue you the first maine point in this text which openeth vnto vs king dauids practise
come now to the successe thereof which is the forgiuenesse of the sinne where we may first see the difference betweene on earth and the tribunall of heauen
on earth non est confessi causa tuenda rei confession is the cause of condemnation it is not so at the tribunall of god there though it be not the cause as papists straine it yet it is the meanes of absolution whereby you may perceiue that the word here vsed is a phrase of the gospell and not of the law for iudgements of men tread the steps of the law of god undefined span alphabet there is no reliefe for a poore sinner to be found in the law he that will haue it must seeke in the gospel
and yet the word here vsed is borrowed out of the law but it is the ceremoniall law and the ceremoniall law is if not wholly yet for the most part gospel
but more distinctly to handle this point we must obserue the matter forgiuen and the manner of forgiuing
the matter forgiuen is the iniquitie of his sinne
it is disputed what is meant here by quitie whether culpa or poena
some vnderstand poenam and thinke that an allusion is made in this word vnto the message of nathan wherein god doth remit the heauiest stroke of his wrath but yet retaines some part in punishing the child and permitting absolon to rebell and abuse king dauids concubines so theodoret deus non condigna poena dauideni puniuit
some vnderstand culpam and will haue this phrase to be an amplification of that as if superbia defendens or taciturnitas celans or impietas contra deum assurgens or some such great guilt were meant by this phrase
but as doe not censure these opinions which may well stand so thinke the phrase lookes backe vnto that word which was in the confession
the sinne confessed was peshang and this is but an analysis of this word for gnaon catai what is it word for word but the peruersenesse of my aberration catah is an aberration from the scope or marke whereat we ayme all men ayme at felicitie but most men stray from it because they are not led by that law that guides vnto it the violating whereof is called catah

but some doe stray out of meere ignorance and they onely breake

the law some out of stubbornnesse which will not submit themselues to the these mens sinne is called peruersenesse which god is said here to forgiue
so that dauid did not confesse more against himselfe then god includes in his pardon well may
god exceed our desire he neuer doth come short thereof if it doe concerne our spirituall our eternall good as he doth exclude no sinner that doth confesse so doth he except against no sinne that is confessed

you haue heard the matter of the pardon now heare the manner
and the manner makes the remission answerable to the confession
the confession had an inward sense and an outward euidence so hath the remission for god spake the word by nathan to resolue king dauids faith but he also gaue a tast of his truth by working ease in king dauids heart
both are included in the word but specially the latter for nasa signifieth to vnburden as if the soule were burdened with sinne

and indeed sinne is a burden a burden as king dauid speakes too heauie for him to beare undefined span alphabet heauier saith chrysostome then any lead
and no wonder for if euerie euill doe make a heauie heart much more spirituall euill cloggeth the spirits makes a man sincke inwardly and bow outwardly you can haue no better character of such a deiected soule then that which we find in the penitentiall psalmes
it is verie true that many walke lightly and skip frolickly as if they bare no weight though they be fraught with sinne but the answer is plaine nihil ponderat in loco suo while sinne resides in that part which commits the sinne it giues such content to the concupiscence that dwels therein as being the desired obiect thereof that it presseth not at all neither is it euer burdenous till it be brought vnto the conscience which onely hath an eye to discerne it a scale to weigh it and a sense wherewith to iudge of that weight and when god inhibendo those vanities which hinder the conscience from weighing and exhibendo putting the whole measure of sinne into the scales doth rouse vs then the most carelesse and the most senslesse shall be driuen to acknowledge that indeed it is a great burden
but the penitents comfort is this that as he feeles it so he hath one by whom he may be eased of it the putting on the hands vpon the sacrifice did ceremonially testifie as much but the morall thereof is in st iohn behold the lambe of god which taketh away the sinnes of the world qui tollit a plaine translation of nasa
but christ speakes it more plainly mat
come to me all ye that labour and are heauie loaden and will ease you
where also we find that it is the lord onely that forgiueth sinnes
they spake truly in the gospel that excluded all others

saying who can forgiue linnes but god onely st irenie giues the reason quomodo rectè remissa peccata nisi ille ipse in quem peccauimus donet remissionem he is the only egislator as st iames speaks and concludes that he onely hath power to condemne and absolue
therefore doth god esay and claime this as his peculiar it is the peculiar of his word to acertaine our faith and of his spirit to

vnburden our soules and insteed of the heauinesse that did oppresse to cheare vs vp with spirituall ioy

hitherto you haue seene a good correspondencie betweene the co fession and the remission but now you must heare of a great difference for dauid was come no farther then dixi he had a good purpose to confesse but of god which is the searcher of the heart he witnesseth that he was come to remisisti granted the parden before it was asked so doth st austin paraphrase these words vox mea in ore nondum erat sed auris dei iam in corde erat
and what is this but a proofe of that gratious promise which god himselfe hath made in the prophet esay

before they call will answer and while they speake will heare undefined span alphabet cryed out nazianzene when he this but he giues the reason of this celeritie est opus alienum when god is angry he goes against his owne but eius proprium est misereri it is as it were naturall to him to do good vnto men
you need no better proofe then the parable of the child man cannot be so forward to receiue good but god is much more forward to bestow it and what greater incouragement to confesse most humbly then to obserue that god deales with a confessing sinner most gratiously

and indeed we ought to obserue it for which was the last point to be handled on the text the successe is remarkable
it is signed with selah
not to trouble you with the vse of this word in musicke
the learned make hereof a double morall vse for it is either a note of so great thing and then they render it by the superlatiue degree or of some constant thing and so the caldee rendreth it in aeternum
both these morall vses sit our purpose for the two maine branches of my text are great and constant truthes
what is there in the confession that is not great is it not a great thing to see a man so to put off selfeloue and pride the properties of his corrupt nature and not onely acknowledge himselfe to be but also to humble himselfe as being a sinfull wretch to vse that rhetoricke wherewith he was wont to shift off his blame in amplyfying of his owne sinne in being so charitable as to all the more to accuse himselfe and the more to set forth gods glorie not to sticke euen in the hearing of men to be the publisher of his owne miserie this is great but due
but how much more great is it to see god the iudge of man so little to be moued with the heynousnesse of sinne as to send a prophet to comfort an humble sinner yea to send his spirit to ease the broken heart to take off the load from his rebels and lay it vpon his deare sonne and herein to preuent him who might well thinke himselfe happy if he spead after long attendance certainly these things are great the more great because not due

but as they are great so they are constant also for what king dauid did must be done by all and all in so doing may looke for the same salomon hath a generall rule

he that hides his sinne shall not prosper but he that confesseth them and forsaheth them shall find mercie

the apostles confirme it if we confesse our sinnes god is faithfull to forgiue saith st iohn and st paul if we would iudge our selues we should not be iudged of the lord
but the more is the pittie undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet there are many as tertullian speakes which either deferre

or abhorre this worke of confession vt publicationem sui as if they should be too well knowne thereby either to god or men praesumo pudoris magis memores quam salutis more respectiue of a little false credit then of eternall life whereby you may perceiue the truth of st chrysostomes note inuertunt homines dei ordinem diaboli instinctu deus enim pudorem dedit peccato confessioni siduciam but diabolus peccato sidiam confessioni pudorem the world hath too many spectacles of this peruerse dealing to whom we may vse the words of tertullian ne tu verecunde bonus qui ad delinquendum exporrigis frontem ad confitendum contrahis is it not a goodly modestie to be impudent in sinne and shamefast in the censure thereof

but to what end doth man auoid this shame surely to fall into a worse for he that will not be ashamed voluntarily shall against his will be put to shame certainly the shall at the last day when god shall reueale all secrets in the sight of angels and men
yea haply god will bring it to light in this world for some men haue their maske taken off here and their nakednesse discouered before they dye so that it is ill prouidence malis maximum when we must one of two euils to reserue our selues vnto the worst and whereas he which accuseth himselfe need feare no accuser to spare himselfe that he may haue many and those that are much worse to accuse him

but if a man be senslesse that he will not prouide what is best for himselfe yet let him not be so gracelesse as to doe wrong vnto god peccator cum sis

accede vt glorifices deum occasionem praebeas undefined span si dubitas accedere inhibuisti bonitatem and we shall find that god can worse brooke the contempt of the gospel then the breach of the law

wherefore let vs listen to the sonne of syrach

and not be ashamed to confesse our sinne let vs sowe in teares that we may reape in ioy for blessed are they which now mourne for they shall be comforted
let euerie one of vs haue that good testimonie of our conscience which iob had haue not hid my sinne

as adam conceiuing iniquitie in my bosome and we shall be able with king dauid to pray and pray with hope lord haue mercie vpon me heale my soule for haue sinned against thee
if we follow dauids practise and say as he did we will confesse our sinnes against our selues vnto the lord we shall be able vpon our owne experience euerie man to boast of king dauids successe and to say lord thou hast forgiuen the iniquitie of my sinnes

a sermon preached at
epigraph

lvke
verse
and immediately while he yet spake the cocke crew
and the lord turned and looked vpon peter and peter remembred the word of the lord how he said vnto him before cocke crow thou shalt deny me thrice
and peter went out and wept bitterly

these words were read this day in the church

and they are verie agreeable to the season an argument of repentance to the dayes of humiliation

now repentance is here deliuered not in a rule but in an example but such an example as deserues our best regard because the person is of principall note no meaner a man then st peter is here presented vnto vs in the forme of a penitent
let vs then looke vpon him
and if we doe we shall see him here downe and vp taking a fall and againe and indeed repentance is nothing but a rysing from a therefore we may well resolue st peters case and my text into his fall and into his rising
his fall peter denyed christ a sore fall because from a high rocke and that rocke was christ
that fall was sore but it is made sorer in that it was taken so soone and so often soone before the cocke crew not many houres after he was and
often before the cocke crew peter denied christ thrice being ouer shooes he would ouer eares and the he went the worse he was so peter came downe

but he got vp againe and the text will teach vs of his rising first what were the meanes and secondly what were their effects
the meanes were two one outward another inward the outward was a

timely signe the signe was the crowing of a cocke an ordinarie thing but here seruing to an extraordinarie vse
and that signe was timely immediately euen while he was speaking did the cocke crowe no sooner was peter downe but he was put in mind of his fall

neither was he onely put in mind by the outward meanes but he was also by an inward made sensible thereof euen by the helpe of christ christ turned and looked the workes seeme corporall but indeed they are spirituall for he that turned he that looked was the lord and he turned and looked as a lord both workes were spiritually operatiue witnesse the effects
the effects are as the meanes were in number two each meanes produced his effect
the cocke did crowe and what came of it presently peter remembred the words that the lord saio vnto him he acknowledged christ to be a true prophet and gaue glorie to his truth
this is the effect of the outward meanes
the inward meanes wanted not his effect also christ turned he looked and loe peter is presently changed
he was he now findeth his weaknesse for he went out he durst no longer abide by the temptation
peter was senslesse he now groweth tender hearted for he wept bitterly the floods of sorrow that his soule gusht out in streames of teares that trickled downe his eyes
there is one thing more in the text which may not omit and that is the correspondencie of the rising to the fall peter was quickly downe before the crowing of the cocke and he was as quickly vp euen as soone as the cocke did crowe
secondly peter had meanes to rise the cocke did crowe christ turned christ looked and peter did vse the meanes which he had for he remembred he went out he wept
finally peter endeauoured to make his repentance as afflictiue as his sinne had been offensiue for as he denied shamefully so did he weepe bitterly
you haue seene our penitent but not so throughly but we may all desire to see him againe and verily if with a reflecting eye we doe deliberately reuiew him in him we may profitably behold our selues behold what we are behold what we should be are in his fall should be in his rising god giue vs all such single eyes
resume the fall

peter denied christ

it is a rule of the apostles that with the heart a man belieueth vnto righteousnesse and with the mouth he confesseth to saluation whereby we learne that it is not enough for vs to stand in good tearmes with god except we also let the world know what good he hath done for our soules we may forfeit the former if we be not resolute in performing the latter christ doth assure it in the gospel saying that if any deny him before men he will deny them before his father which is in heauen
this ground must guid vs in iudging aright of st peters fall by it you shall find that it was a sinfull fact which that you may the better see will distinctly obserue the fact and the sinne

the fact was a deniall but it was negatio duplex a double deniall first negatio notitiae and secondly negatio consortij by former verses

we are directed so to vnderstand it first he denyed that he had any acquaintance with christ and secondly he denyed also that he had any dependencie on him
this was his fact

and this fact was sinfull for it contained a plaine contradiction to his calling and his conscience
to his calling peter was christs apostle could he be one of christs apostles and not know him a chiefe apostle and haue nothing to doe with him a flat contradiction to his calling
neither to his calling onely but to his conscience also for was not peter the man that matthew cap
confessed thou art christ the sonne of the liuing god and was well rewarded for that confession and had he not acquaintance with him a flat contradiction to his conscience
was not peter the man that matthew cap

said behold we haue forsaken all and followed thee and was warranted an exceeding gaine for a trifling losse and had he no dependencie on him so that the denyall containeth two notable vntruths wherewith st peter is iustly charged and charging him therewith we keepe our selues within the reasonable bounds which st bernard hath set peccauit petrus

it is out of question that st peter did sinne in denying but yet he did sinne non odiendo christum sed se nimis amando he bare no malitious mind against christ but was willing to sleepe in a whole skin
and that he might so doe he suppressed the truth in his heart and his tongue vttered these vntruths wherefore his faith was still vnfained and his loue vndoubted but constantia turbata est his constancie was shaken loue of christ and feare of danger had so shrewd a conflict that the feare of danger got the of the loue of christ so that though he continued inwardly a good man yet durst he not out of the good treasurie of his heart bring forth his good things

these are reasonable bounds but they are diuersly transgrest for some doe racke and some doe shrinke the sinne they racke it that in their tracts de apostasia sanctorum put st peter in for an instance but put him in vniustly because apostasie is christianitie dead at the root whereas in st peter it was onely withered in the branch
others there are that shrinke the sinne euen among the ancients some haue aduentured to excuse peter from all fault and which is worse they excuse him by a mentall reseruation or a secret euasion non noui hominem quem deum esse scio doe not know him as a meere man so much his words vttered as they thinke import whereunto he supplyed in his mind for he is more euen the sonne of the liuing god
but certainly st peter was no aequiuocator and such apologies can haue no apologie st hierome doth censure them roundly but truly they that so excuse peter doe necessarily accuse christ and make him a false prophet when he told the denyall of peter yea they accuse peter himselfe as if he wept bitterly when he had no iust cause to doe so
we may not lye for god much lesse for the saints neither may we discredit gods truth to salue their credit with officious lyes the legends of saints and the liues of popes are too often guiltie in this kind
wherefore let it

stand for an vnchallengable truth cribratus est petrus peter as christ was winnowed and found though not to be chaffe yet not to be without it he that walked on the sea while it was calme and when the storme arose began to sinke set forth valiantly with christ but when he was put to try his manhood petrus non erat petrus he could not endure the winds and the waues that beat vpon him the stone mouldred into sand

but enough of st peters denyall in him told you we were to see our selues which that we may the better doe will obserue vnto you three kinds of denyers the first are those that professe themselues to be worse then they are such were the libellatici that signed their denyall with their owne hand the traditores that with their owne hand in token that they did deny deliuered vp the scriptures and the thurificantes that redeemed their liues by sacrifising to idols with whom we may range many of our trauellors who being sound in iudgment prouide for their securitie by conforming themselues to such religion as they find currant in the places where they come a second kind of denyers are those which are worse then they professe themselues to be of whom the apostle speaketh they haue a shew of godlinesse but deny the powre thereof will giue you a tast of them how many be there that hold the articles of christs incarnation and passion whose faith if you doe measure by their liues you cannot belieue that they doe belieue for did they hold christs to be their sauiour and his death the ransome of their sinne would they so much profane these sacred mysteries as with the mention of them to obligege themselues not onely when they talke idlely but when they vngodly auerre or congratulate their ribaldry and their villanie then which impietie there is nothing more common we hold that we haue communion with christ that we are members of his body and temples of his spirit but how many doe indeed deny that which they would seeme to hold for did they not could they indure to make the members of christ the members of an harlot and turne the temple of his spirit into a verie stew yet so doe all impure and vnchast liuers though they thus farre professe that they know christ yet doe they deny him in their workes
if euerie man would goe to shrift to his owne conscience and make his catechisme the rule of his confession doubt not but his heart would often smite him at his own barre by his own verdict he would be found a manifold denyer

there is a third kind of denyers that neither professe themselues good neither haue any goodnesse in them this was wont to be a disease of vagrant and base persons but now many descended of good parentage and whose breeding hath been of the best sort are growne sicke thereof they are called yea and they glorie to be knowne by the fearfull names of roaring boyes and the damned crew the land groaneth vnder their atheisme for the repressing whereof an inquisition were mercifull iustice they sucke out the heart blood of all

religion and make sacraments and sacred things the familiar subiect of their hellish
amongst other abuses it were to be wisht that the state would take this crying one into most serious consideration for it is to be feared that our indulgence toward such incarnate fiends doth prouoke and will plucke downe gods heauie vengeance vpon the whole state

told you that in st peter we might behold our selues behold what we are and thinke by this time you see that many of vs are much worse then st peter was for of the three kind of denyers whereof there are too many in the world we find st peter in the first and the first if they be compared doth plainly appeare to be the least therefore we may well acknowledge our selues to be worse though we cannot deny that he was bad
he was bad it is plaine in his fall which as haue shewed you was a sore fall sore if there were nothing more in it then the denyall of christ but there was more the text doth aggrauate the fall two wayes first in that it was taken so soone before the cocke crew that is not many houres after he was
for christ told him what would befall him that his performance would come short of his promise that he would be so farre from dying for christ that he would flatly deny him
neither did he onely so him but him also he gaue him viaticum militiae spiritualis the sacrament of his body and blood which being the monuments of christs passion are the best hearthings against the crosse
secondly he had christs consolatorie speech be of good comfort haue the world
lastly he saw his exemplarie patience the captaine taught the souldier how he should be resolute in this spirituall warre
but notwithstanding all these behold peter denyed christ and denyed him very quickly more quickly then he should haue done if he had neither beene nor forearmed
you haue not heard all this first aggrauation for st peter was not put vpon the racke neither was he so much as questioned by a magistrate they were but scrui ancillae certaine drudges or base persons that did question him and these extnguisht all the vigour and courage that before appeared in him
this was quickly indeed he fell very quickly that vpon so small a temptation and hauing so good prouision did deny christ

what shall we say to it surely man is a mutable creature as he was made of nothing so would he turne to nothing againe neither doe we hast so fast to nothing naturall as we doe to nothing morall we sooner cease to be good then we cease to be
this defection began in adam of whom the psalmist man being in honor had no vnderstanding non pernoctauit he did not continue so much as a night but became like the beasts that perish
yea he became radix apostatica as saint austin cals him a root of that which cleaueth to all his posteritie
take an example or two
we read gen
of the separation

of the children of god from the daughters of men in the next storie that followeth is their confusion

in exodus god sorbids the making of images and presently after we find that the israelites made the

dauid hath made a whole psalme of this inconstancie of israel
and we ilanders are too like israel herein for how quickly doe we shift the fashion of our cloathes of our dyet of our manners

and of our religion also all our goodnesse is but like a morning cloud as hosea speaketh and as an early dew doth it passe away in this we are all too like st peter that we quickly faile

st peter did not onely fall quickly but he fell often also before the cocke crew he denyed thrice this is the second aggrauation of his fall
bis ad cundem is a prouerbe teaching that he deserueth little pittie that stumbleth twice at the same stone st peter stumbled oftner he added a third vnto two former fals
and verily so it is he that sinneth once if he be left vnto himselfe will sinne againe and againe yea of himselfe he will neuer leaue sinning
there are two reasons of it the first is iudicium dei a iust iudgement of god is it that he that once yealdeth to sinne should alwayes bend towards that whereunto he yealded and become prone to doe what he hath done amisse
the second is veneficium peccati is a kind of sorcerie in sinne which causeth that he that hath once tasted it will retaine such a smacke that he will desire to tast it againe the proofe is daily to be seene in those that are inordinate liuers in whom to dayes sinne doth but worke a longing to sinne againe to morrow
yea not onely to sin but to sinne worse and worse st peter did not onely deny christ but his second denyall was worse then his first and the third worse then his second
sinne is said to be the sting of death now you know that a sting doth enter by a sharpe point and maketh but a little hole at first but the farther it goeth in it cutteth the larger wounds euen so sinne the oftner it is repeated the more is a man corrupted
and no maruell for the principles of conscience will grow more stupid and he that sinneth a second time will be more senslesse of that which he doth then he was at first he that blusht at first will by little and little grow impudent and in steed of bewayling will fall to defending of his sault
yea and as the principles of conscience grow more senslesse so doth concupiscence grow more lawlesse and he that at first had but a squemish appetite will by little and little learne to sinne with greedinesse
especially if he be in passion as st peter was for that betrayeth all the succour which reason would offer if man through hardnesse of heart be not growne vnreasonable

there is one thing more which the fathers handling st peters fall remember and that is the cause why so worthy a man as st peter was tooke so grieuous a fall they obserue in him first confidence and secondly negligence confidence in himselfe he thought himselfe to be a iollier man then indeed he was and thought he could doe much more then indded he was able to doe we cannot be bold of our

strength in ciuill matters whereunto is required onely the generall assistance of god so st iames tels vs goe to all ye that say to day and to morrow we will goe to such a place or such a place and buy and sell whereas you should say if god will if we liue much lesse in morall or spirituall things which are not performed without a speciall grace

but st peter was so farre carryed away with the zeale of his loue that he cast not vp his accounts neither did he inquire into his abilities but thought he was able to doe as much as he would such presumption of his owne strength was god pleased to checke with the permission of his fall
and we doe commonly stumble soonest when we grow of our owne selues and mind more our perfection then our imperfection

a second reason of his fall was st peters negligence in seeking vnto god which commonly followeth vpon confidence in our selues christ bid him with the rest watch and pray lest be entred into temptation and withall gaue him a reason which was a secret reproofe of his confidence the spirit is willing but the flesh is weake but st peter did as little follow the counsell as he did heed the reason for he grew presently drowsie headed and drowsie hearted in steed of watching he fell a sleeping and his deuotion slumbred as well as his eyes and what wonder if he tooke a fall that for want of prouidence might so easily be surprised the best way of standing out in temptation is out of our distrust in our selues to commend our selues to the helpe of god
conclude this point with this religious caution haec nos protulimus non iustos culpando
would not haue any man mistake or thinke that haue amplyfied st peters fall out of any purpose to dishonour the blessed memorie of that glorious light of the chvrch the holy ghost related it haue insisted on this text for a better end first vt consideremus that we might take notice of the frailtie that to our sinfull nature from which the best are not alwayes nor altogether exempted
secondly vt horreamus that we may tremble we see how preualent temptations are when god is pleased to leaue a good man vnto himselfe
these be the vses that we should make of such examples and suppose that other mens cases may likewise be our owne we may fall as they haue done

as we may fall so we should rise againe st peter did and he is therein proposed as an example vnto vs you shall find it in the second part of my text
now come on vnto it
there are two carnall affections that are hinderers of our constancie in the christian faith loue and feare both of the world but of these two the forwardest to fall and feeblest to rise is loue feare renounceth not so farre and it leaueth more hope of amendment and why the loue of the world quencheth the faith that is in the heart but the feare of the world onely stayeth vs from confessing it with our mouthes so that the loue maketh vs sinne willingly but feare vnwillingly yea loue maketh vs inwardly to prize the world aboue christ but feare maketh vs

onely to deny christ that we may escape the malice of the world
whereupon it commeth to passe that of the three kinds of denyers of christ which described before though all may recouer yet they that fall through the loue of the world recouer more hardly and they recouer more easily that fall onely out of the feare thereof
and such was peters casu pray god that ours neuer be worse it will be likely that as he so we also will not so fall but that we will rise againe
but let vs behold his rising behold the meanes and behold their effects

the meanes were two whereof the first was outward a timely signe the signe was the crowing of a cocke an ordinarie thing but by our sauiour vsed to an extraordinarie end
it is familiar with god so to deale will instance onely in the sacraments water a common element yet designed to be a bath of regeneration bread and wine our daily food yet consecrated to make vs partakers of the body and blood of christ to shew his power god doth so honour the meanest of his creatures and for their vse teacheth vs to giue them their due regards
but must not forget that there is some analogie to be obserued in the creature when it is called to serue the power of the creator
christ here maketh vse of the crowing of a cocke but see how fitly it serueth his turne
the cocke crowing is as it were the harbinger of the sunne it giueth warning vnto men that the sunne is repairing vnto their horizon and ready to dispell the darkenesse of the night by shedding forth his beames vpon the face of the earth
now christ is the sunne of righteousnesse and whither he commeth thither commeth light spirituall light he was comming to peter after the as it were of his fall and of this he gaue notice to peter by the crowing of a cocke

but what is this to vs will not insist vpon signes in generall by which god is pleased familiarly to put vs in mind of our dutie or let vs see the state wherein we stand will keepe my selfe to the ali gorie which the fathers make of this signe
they tell vs that god hath granted to enerie member of his church two crowing cockes by which he doth awaken him when he falleth into a spirituall sleepe and they are concionator and conscientia the preacher outwardly and the conscience inwardly doe or should serue for morall crowing cockes
nathan was such a cocke vnto dauid
ionah vnto nineueh peter to the iewes that crucified christ when they called them to repent and returne vnto god
and christian people ought also to esteem their preachers such they must esteem them as crowing cocks whose vovce soundeth nothing but this

surge qui dormis awake thou that sleepest stand vp from the dead and iesvs christ shall giue thee light

they tell vs that our night is past and our day is come therefore we must cast away all workes of darkenesse and put vpon vs the armour of light

besides this outward crowing cocke euerie man hath another that

croweth within him that is his conscience it is said to be a thousand witnesses and the sonne of syrach doth tell vs that from it we shall learne more then from seuen watchmen that are set on a tower and verily many a man would sleepe vnto death were he not often rowsed by this cocke
wherefore though christ tooke extraordinarie care of st peter we may not thinke that he doth neglect vs that hath prouided that which outwardly and inwardly doth awaken and rouse vs he hath not left vs destitute of crowing cockes

but told you the cocke did not onely crow but crowed timely it was a timely signe that christ gaue to st peter immediately euen while he was speaking did the cocke crow
peter was denying him forswearing him cursing and in the verie heat of his sinning the cocke crew
we can haue no greater proofe that the mercie of god is free then when we see a man reclaymed euen then when he is most transported with his vnruly affection
and god hath magnified his mercie thus more then once it was st pauls case also he was breathing out threats and enraged to make hauocke of the church when a light from heauen shone about him and by a mercifull violence brought him to bethink himselfe
and haply if euerie one of vs obserue the course of his life he may remember that some good sermon working some religious inward motiues hath made him step backe while he was stepping rashly into the pitfall of the diuel
assuredly when we are once going there would be no staying if we were not by so prouident a hand and by so gratious violence seasonably held backe
wherefore we must acknowledge it as a speciall benefit of gods mercie that he then commeth in with his helpe when we are past hope
theophylact goeth one step farther bonitatem etiam cum ligaretur etiam cum negaretur non neglexit discipuli salutem how wonderfull is the goodnesse of christ when his enemies were binding him he tooke care to loose st peter out of the snare of the diuel yea while peter was denying him ashamed of his bands christ was not ashamed of peter but recouered him out of the iawes of the lyon as one of his deare sheepe a great improuement of christs compassionate bowels and incouragement vnto all that haue they been neuer so enormous sinners christ will be to them as he shewed himselfe to peter a most mercifull sauiour

you haue heard the outward meanes hasten now vnto the inward
the inward meanes are christs helpe he turned and looked that which he prayed for in this chapter that peters faith should not faile he performed now
it is disputed whether these acts were corporall and the iudgement of diuines are different but all agree that they were spirituall also if it be granted that they were corporall
austin argueth it from the title that is here giuen vnto christ which is the lord christ was now at the barre in the eye of flesh and blood a poore prisoner yet doth the holy ghost honour him with the name lord and calleth him that was crucified the lord of glorie the lord of life that present condition of his manhood did

not derogate ought from the glorie of his godhead that wrought answerable to its power when christ seemed to be altogether in the power of others it wrought vpon the soule and conscience of peter and did there presse him being so farre gon with petre vbi es bethinke thy selfe peter what is become of thee and what is done by thee

but let vs take these workes a little a sunder christ turned vnto peter then was christ before turned from him and indeed so he was propter arrogantiam saith basil by reason of his presumption who had vaunted that though all men were offended yet would not he be offended
when children begin to goe they vse to be so well conceited of the strength of their legs that they need not any help of their nurse to let them see their folly the nurse will leaue them to themselues that so smarting by a fall they may the better be brought to find what need they haue of their nurse
the best of vs are but babes in grace yet doe we thinke that we can stand of our selues yea and run the wayes of god also god doth refute vs by our owne experience and by this mistris of fooles maketh vs better knowne to our selues
but though he leaue vs for a time yet doth he not forsake vs for euer no more then a nurse doth the weakling child she maketh vse of one fall to keepe the child from many and god doth make vse of our sinning to make vs see how prone we are to sinne
and this is that which is meant by christs turning his turning to vs is nothing else but his renewing of grace in vs

it is a quickning conuersion such a turning as worketh repentance

as christ turned

so he looked that was spirituall and so this he not onely looked on but into peter and it was an operatiue looke
before told you that the crowing of the cocke did the approaching of the sunne now the looke of the corporall sunne when it shineth vpon the earth doth carrie with it a quickning influence it putteth life into the earth and all things are the better for the looke thereof
the same must you conceiue of the sunne of righteousnesse his looke gratious looke is such as that it infuseth grace into the soule and transformeth the person on whom he looketh
you will easily acknowledge this truth if you looke to the effects
come then to them

the meanes were two and so are the effects that proceed from them each meanes produceth its effect for christ doth not vse his meanes in vaine
the cocke did crow and presently petr remembred the words which iesvs spake

this was the effect of the first meanes
our memorie is a good storehouse but no good steward it layeth vp much but of it selfe dispendeth nothing it needeth some helpe to make vse of her store the speculatiue memorie doth but the practicke much more
how many be there whose memories are richly stored with excellent rules of life whereof in their life they make no vse their memorie doth not offer them when they haue occasion to be doing as if they had neuer knowne commandements

or creed they liue like infidels and like sonnes of belial
wherefore as the eye of the body needeth the light of the sunne to rayse and conuey the visible species vnto it euen so doth the eye of our vnderstanding need the light of the sunne of righteousnesse to stirre vp and present vnto it the principles of grace whereof it hath need in the ordering of our life without this actuall grace our memorie will neuer make vse of her habituall

but there is a double vse of memorie the one is praeueniens peccatum the other is subueniens peccato the best vse of memorie were to suggest good rules by which we might auoid sinne and doe nothing which is displeasing vnto god
but this memorie doth often faile vs and it is too common a fault to set our selues on worke before euer we thinke whether the worke be such as is fit for vs to doe seldome doth our memorie serue vs to preuent sinne and wretched were our case if we had not memoriam subuenientem a memorie that doth call vs to an account and to reueiw our actions if the cocke did not crow after we are downe and we were not thereby put in mind of our fall
but god be thanked we haue the benefit of this and it is the first step of our rising againe
it was to st peter he did not mind christs warning to keepe him vp but he called it to mind when he was downe then did he remember that he had beene and gaue glorie vnto christs truth he acknowledged that the euent had proued him a true propher
you are bound to the ministers not onely for their informing but for their reforming paines also not onely for teaching you what you should doe but also for laying to your consciences what you doe amisse we often tell you of your frailtie and that you are by nature prone vnto sinne but you heare vs with a deafe care euen as deafe an eare as st peter heard christ would christ would say vnto our memories ephata as he did to st peters and as he so we after we are downe would remember our selues and confesse that we are not challenged in vaine that we our selues are monuments of humane frailtie and they that tell vs when we are in the heighth of our selfe conceit that we will proue such doe not prophesie what our life doth not iustifie
if we be so ingenuous such a remembrance will set vs forward to performe the acts that are required in repentance which are the effects of the second meanes

the second meanes are christ turned and looked and what followed thereupon surely peter presently became another man he had beene verie bold but now he began to find his owne weaknesse praesumens petrus ignorauit se negando didicit se cognoscere while peter thought well of himselfe he was a verie stranger to himselfe but he grew better acquainted with himselfe after he had denyed christ in witnesse whereof he went out he would no longer conflict with that by which he had beene foyled
occasions of euill

are shrewd stumbling blockes he that will not fall must be afraid to come nigh them in this case basils rule is true nihil formidolosius quam nihil formidare none are in more fearfull case then they that are et in securitate periclitatur fides he wrackes his faith that is bold when he may decline to put it in danger that will touch pitch and thinke he cannot be defiled carrie fire in his bosome and thinke he cannot be burnt peter came into the high priests house onely out of the loue of christ and yet he fell and shall we be able to stand that out of a loue of the world thrust our selues into the temptations thereof would all that dote vpon the baites of sinne were as timerous as st peter was and would not so rashly hazard themselues men would not so often be ouertaken with the vanities of this life they would not so often relapse into sinne

peter went out not onely out of feare of that which might be done but also out of hatred of that which he had done he cannot be said truly to repent that continueth on his with that which caused his sinne whereof he doth repent godly sorrow for what we doe amisse is ioyned with a perfect hatred of that which did seduce vs otherwise we should wash our selues that we may be defiled againe and that we might surfet againe ease our stomaches of that which did surcharge them and so as it is in the prouerb returne like dogges to our vomit and like washt swine to our wallowing againe in the mire
peter did not so he went out in detestation of his sinne he abandoned the place that gaue occasion thereof
neither did he onely goe out but he hastened out so some interpret the word in st marke
and indeed feare and hatred adde wings vnto our feet and will turne our going into flying and he that is slow paced doth betray his towards sinne and that he doth neither hate or feare it as he ought
and verily such snailes are all vnwilling penitents they thinke there is no reason why they should make speed yea why they should stirie at all most are like vnto lot who when they were wisht to be gone because god would destroy sodome thought that lot did mocke them
and we are thought oftentimes to be but when we tell you that gods iudgement hangs ouer you and therefore it is high time for you to forsake your sinnes

they that are not so bad as lot yet will be as vnconstant as lot wife who went out indeed but yet looked backe to sodome so doe they giue ouer their sinnes but as those that are sorrie for that they haue parted companie with them you haue an excellent proofe hereof in the chapter of the reuelations where the destruction of spirituall babylon is related

the kings that had committed fornication with her the merchants that had bought of her commodities the mariners that had made long voyages to her all went out but being out they looked on not reioycing as the saints there doe but lamenting and mourning and crying out alas alas for that great citie
where sinne is there is babel for what is babel but confusion and what doth more confound then sinne and yet doe we no more willingly part from sinne then those persons did from babel

there is one cause more of saint peters going out and that was that he might haue more libertie to performe the second act of repentance and weepe bitterly
theophylact doth interpret the word in saint marke obuelauit se he couered his head
and indeed so were malefactors vsed in the easterne countreys you read it in the storie of haman and haply so much is meant in this chapter where our sauiours face is said to haue beene couered
in the they had also the like custome as appeares by that clause in the capitall sentence caput obnubito vaile his head so that saint peter did iudge himselfe by that ceremonie to be a sonne of death and as a sonne of death did he bewayle himselfe
adde hereunto that solitarinesse doth argue sinceritie in our repentance for ille dolet verè qui sine teste dolet he cannot be thought to dissemble that calleth no witnesses of his griefe but onely god and his holy angels
finally he that is solitarie will mourne not onely more sincerely but more freely also he that is alone hath nothing to restraine him but if euer he will then poure forth his soule before god grouell in dust and ashes bathe himselfe in his owne teares and with sighes and groanes that cannot be exprest often interrupt his penitentiall prayers in a word he will in the best fashion performe the last act which here we read of in st peters repentance he will weepe bitterly
percussit petram effluxerunt aquae peters heart in the heat of his denying seemed to be as hard as a rocke but when christ with his spirit toucht peters heart it melted into teares as the rocke did into waters when moses strucke it with the rod of god

but in this act of weeping bitterly we must obserue that the bitternesse was in the soule the teares came from the body
no doubt but peters heart was with sorrow while he was in the high priests palace and you know that strangulat inclusue dolor at{que exaestuat intus and it cannot be eased except the heart be vnburdened by teares
but we must take heed that we doe not seuer the soule from the body when we bewayle our sinnes yea the heart must begin to the eyes the bitternesse of the heart must goe before the weeping of the eyes otherwise we know that of teares the poet hath long since noted

hae simulare docentur hae quo{que habent artes many shed crocodile teares and hypocriticall which cannot be reckoned amongst true penitents
the body cannot weepe though we would neuer so faine the reason may be in the temper thereof but if there be a rationall sorrow in the heart god accepts the will insteed of the act and will impute teares vnto vs though we neuer shed them

this act of weeping bitterly is no indifferent thing but a prouident rather for weepe and sorrow we must for sinne either here or hereafter

and that we may not weepe hereafter either in iudgement when we shall be reiected or in hell when we shall be tormented we must weepe here and let the bitternesse of sorrow succeed in the place of the sweet fruit of sinne

the last note therefore that will giue vpon this act is the effect hereof for there are comfortable and vncomfortable teares esau did weepe when he had sold his but he found no place for repentance though he sought it with teares but st peters had a happier issue

filius tantarum lachrymarum perire not potuit he that wept so bitterly did not faile to speed of grace his teares did wash away his sinnes
the fathers compare them to a baptisme not meaning that they restore our adoption againe but onely that they release the suspension thereof neither meane they to preiudice the worke of faith which must goe before but to shew what god moreouer expects of vs and what he accepts in vertue of our faith
and verily the chvrch hath euer held that the lesse excuse we haue for our sinne after baptisme the more humiliation is expected from vs and vpon our humiliation

if we be faithfull we may promise our selues restitution into the fauour of god
thy sinnes saith st chrysostome are written in a booke and thy teares are as a spunge weepe and thy sinnes will be blotted out and there will no record remaine extant against thee
were it not for this reliefe the nouatians opinion would hold current and there would be few that could haue hope that after their fall they should rise againe

the last point of this text remaines which is the correspondencie betweene the rising and the fall which told you consists in three points

first peter was soone downe and soone vp the same night that he was wounded he was healed and cured the same night that he fell sicke many perish through their procrastination and their case becommeth desperate before they enter into consideration thereof no sooner did the cocke crow christ turne and looke but peter came to himselfe
but what doe we doe what vse doe we make of the time giuen vs to repent how little doth aduersitie prosperitie words stripes preuaile with vs we are so farre from repenting quickly that we doe not repent at leasure
and what is the reason we doe not make vse of good meanes whilst god doth grant them

vs the cocke did crow and peter did remember christ turned and lookt peter went out and wept bitterly he did not receiue the grace of god in vaine
it were to be wisht that we did herein resemble him and not frustrate either the outward or the inward meanes

but the minister may complaine haue laboured in vaine haue spent my strength in vaine yea god himselfe may complaine

all the day long haue stretcht forth my hand vnto an vnbeleeuing and gaine saying nation

or if we are not so gracelesse as to neglect the two former correspondencies certainly it is a hard thing to find the man that is like to st peter in the third and proportioneth his repentance to his offence
great faults should not be a little sorrowed for but we should afflict our soules for sinne as much as we haue solaced them therewith
certainly st peter did so
yea clemens romanus obserueth that st peter euerie night about the crowing of the cocke did rise and pray with teares vntill the morning
if he did lament so vncessantly in whom inward pietie did not faile but onely the outward constancie was shaken what should we doe that sinne so willingly and with so high a hand we should better obserue and obserue more dayes of humiliation then most of vs doe
bitter teares if euer are now most seasonable not onely the compunction for our owne sinnes but compassion also towards the distracted churches woefull calamitie doth importune vs for them
we make grieuous lamentation for a friend if his soule be departed from his body but who is much troubled for himselfe when god by sinne is driuen from his soule if but a neighbours house or some small village be laid wast by casualtie of fire as many as heare of it are moued with compassion and readily afford some succour but how many townes yea countreys members of the orthodoxe church are exhausted and made desolate by famine sicknesse the attendants vpon the of the sword and there are few samaritans that haue any bowels all like the priest and the leuite passe by yea and passe ouer these troubles as if they did nothing concerne them but onely to administer or fill vp the wast of their idle times
will onely remember you of gods censure of such stupiditie and pray god it may make vs all more sensible of our owne and of the churches case
in the day of the iewes calamitie did the lord god of hosts call to weeping and to mourning to baldnesse and to girding with and behold ioy and gladnesse slaying oxen and killing sheepe eating flesh and drinking wine let vs eat and drinke for to morrow we shall dye so said those senslesse wretches but it was renealed in mine eares saith the prophet esay by the lord of hosts

surely this iniquitie shall not be purged from you till you dye saith the lord god of hosts
he said it to them and in them to vs happie are we if other mens harmes make vs beware

but conclude
this text is an example and an example is the easiest doctrine for apprehension and most powerfull in operation so that if we doe not learne it there is something amisse in our head and there is something amisse in our heart if we be not the better for it

wherefore let vs all turne to him and humbly beseech him that we may be made mindfull of our frailtie and set in a good course of our penitencie that we may be as apt to rise as we are to fall and iudge our selues as seuerely as we gracelesly offend our god so may god accept our teares clense our soules and make vs all as he did repenting peter his faithfull seruants in this world and glorious saints in the world to come

a sermon preached at greenwich
epigraph

matthew
verse
and iesus when hee was baptized went vp straight way out of the water and loe the heauens were opened vnto him and hee saw the spirit of god descending like a doue and lighting vpon him
and loe a voyce from heauen saying this is my beloued sonne in whom am well pleased

in this dayes gospel our sauiour christ taught nicodemus

that except a man be borne againe or from aboue he cannot see he cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen and st iohn the apostle teacheth how a man may know whether he be so borne againe or no
he that beleeueth that iesus is undefined span alphabet the christ or anointed of the lord is borne of god
now a fairer proofe of that article or a more sufficient warrant for our saith therein the whole bible doth not yeeld then that which was deliuered at the baptisme of christ and is contained in those words that now haue read vnto you
for here you must my text doth will you so behold god the father anointing iesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power as st peter speaketh acts

and see with all how wel the text fitteth the time for this is trinitie sunday and what is the text but a report of the cleare the comfortable presence concurrence of the blessed trinity in sacring iesus to be the christ
here is pater in voce filius in carne spiritus sanctus in columba the sonne in our nature receiues the vnction the holy ghost in the shape of a doue becomes the vnction and the father in a voyce from heauen beareth witnesse to the grace that floweth from that vnction
in this great worke euery person beareth his part

but more distinctly in this sacring of iesus wee may learne from my text first what were the circumstances secondly what was the substance of it
the circumstances were two first the time when iesus was baptized secondly the place without the water or vpon the riuers side for iesus came straight way out of the water and loe

in the substance we shall see first quis who it was that was sacred it was euen the same person that was baptized the sonne of god in the nature of man it was iesus
secondly quo modo how this sacring was performed it was performed signo visibili verbo audibili with a visible signe and an audible word
the signe commeth first in the text we are told what it was and what it ment it was the shape of a doue and by it was ment the spirit of god
but touching this signe wee learne here moreouer vnde and quo whence it came where it pitcht whence the heauens were opened vnto him and the spirit of god descended where it pitcht the spirit that descended lighted on iesus
you see what was the visible signe
a visible signe of it selfe is but a dumbe shew it may amaze it cannot instruct therefore it must bee illustrated and it is here illustrated by an audible word the word is called vox de caelo a voyce from heauen and it was fit it should be so for from whence came the vision from thence was the reuelation for to come the vision was from heauen therefore the reuelation thereof also
but this is not all that we learne here concerning the word goe on and you shall finde cuius and de quo who it is that vttereth it and of whom
he that vttereth it is not exprest but fairely implied in filius meus my sonne iesus could not be the sonne but of god the father therefore is it god the father that speaketh the word
and the word that he speaketh concerneth iesus it teacheth vs first what he is to god the father and secondly what he doth for vs
he is neere because the sonne and deare because his beloued sonne adde to both the article undefined span alphabet that sonne that beloued sonne and then he will prooue neere and deare indeed
from him that is so great with god we may not exspect small matters that which hee doth is answerable to that which hee is he doth that which neuer any other person could doe he propitiateth gods wrath and by him we finde grace in the eyes of god these blessings of iesvs are contained in the last words
in whom am well pleased
there is one point more
all this commendations that is giuen vnto iesvs referreth to undefined span alphabet this this person that is in the middest of you that maketh so little shew and is so little regarded is hee whom so esteeme and vpon whom depends your soueraigne good will not you may not for his humilitie defraud him of his glory

you haue seene a glimpse of the sacring of christ though should not yet the text would require you to entertaine it with your best

regard for the visible signe the audible word both are prefaced with a particle of attention
loe loe the heauens were opened loe a voyce from heauen the word doth summon your eyes your eares to behold to attend these holy mysteries
and pray god so to sanctifie your eyes and your eares that while take a sunder this text and shew it you more fully in the parts the blessed trinitie may vouchsafe by them to instill into you some fructifying drops of our blessed sauiours heauenly vnction

amongst the particulars resolued the text the first was the circumstance of time when christ was baptized christ was baptized before he was sacred hee was receiued into the new couenant by baptisme before hee became a dispenser thereof
and the church neuer thought it fit to swarue from so good a patterne and conferre holy orders vpon any that was not first incorporated into the church yea it hath alwayes gon for a grounded truth that it is baptisme that maketh a man capable of other holy rites and that being vnbaptized he is vncapable of them
secondly the circumstance of time doth notifie the kinde of grace that was figured in the descension of the doue he descended not in but after the act of baptisme
had hee descended in the act it might haue beene thought that onely gratia gratum faciens the grace of regeneration or sanctification had beene represented by the doue but descending after some farther kind of grace is more ouer intimated
what that grace was let vs breifely inquire
some fetch hence the originall of confirmation and suppose that christ the head confirmed himselfe here vnto his body the church so that as in the church baptizati recipiunt spiritum sanctum they that are first baptized are after confirmed so christ would be confirmed after hee was baptized
there is no doubt but the right of confirmation is apostolicall notwithstanding the friuolous exceptions that by some are taken to it and it may passe inter pie credibilia that christ did vouchsafe in his owne person to sanctifie that as hee did many other sacred rites of the church
but yet it may not be denied that ouer and aboue here is ment another kind of grace a grace that is not common to euery member of the church as the grace of confirmation is but peculiar vnto a publique person such as christ was now called to be
and therefore call it sacring grace such a kind of grace seemeth to be intimated by the circumstance of time

the second circumstance is that of place the place was where christ stood after he came out of the water that was the banke of iordan which st iohn calleth bethabara the very name doth containe a monument of the children of israels first passage there into the land of canaan and then the place is not without a mysterie the choice thereof giueth vs to vnderstand that the historie of iosua was performed in iesus that the waters of baptisme were become a passage from earth to heauen from the condition of nature to the condition

of grace and that euen while wee liue in this vaile of miserie we are thereby enrolled among the saints

adde hereunto that bethabara was now a place of great concourse hierusalem iudaea all the regions about iordan and all sorts of men resorted thither to be baptized of iohn and it was meete that so great a worke as christs sacring should be performed in a great assembly
yea all the remarkeable manifestations of our sauiour his miracles his sermons his death are noted to haue beene publike they were not as st paul obserues to king agrippa done in a corner the vnbeleeuing iew or other that doubts or disputes of their truth is by the circumstance of place conuicted to doe it out of affected ignorance
and let this suffice for the circumstance

come to the substance of the sacring where first wee must see who it is that was sacred
wee finde that it was the same person that was baptized the sonne of god clothed with the nature of man
where note that iesus had two abilities an actiue a passiue one to giue another to receiue the spirit hee that was able for to giue was contented undefined span alphabet according to the diuine dispensation and humble condition whereunto for our sakes hee submitted himselfe to receiue the spirit
and indeed so it behoued him to fulfill all righteousnesse whereof this was a branch to shew that he was the truth of former types

we read in leuiticus how solemnely aaron was consecrated and seeing christ came to bee what aaron onely did signifie the high priest of god it behoued that he also should haue an inauguration but so much more excellent by how much the truth exceedes the type

and the lora the seruant
this correspondency is made the more probable because st luke tels vs that when this was done christ was about thirtie yeeres old and of that age was the priest to be when he entred vpon his charge the holy ghost by that law

and by this example of christ giuing vs to vnderstand that maturitie of age is a necessary requisite in all that will vndertake a sacred function

marke withall the regular humilitie of our sauiour though he were the lord of glory

no man saith st paul taketh the honour of priesthoed vpon him but he that is called of god as was aaron therefore iesus glorified not himselfe but was glorified by him that said vnto him thou art a priest for euer after the order of melchisedeck hee tooke not vpon him the office of a mediatour vntill he was thereto ordained checking the sacrilegious pride of those which presume of their abilitie and intrude themselues without imposition of hands into sacred functions they cannot be so able they should not be lesse humble then was our sauiour christ

st luke addeth that christ was praying when the holy ghost descended
as god doth promise so we must desire his guifts the greatest guifts with the most earnest desire christ would herein bee exemplary vnto vs to testifie the humilitie that beseemes our

nature and goe before vs in that which he commandeth he prayeth for that which he looked for from god

after this holy patterne haue all christian inaugurations and ordinations beene accompanied with publicke and deuout prayers
and if christ did not receiue the holy ghost from his father but by praying how can they but blush at their vnmannerlinesse that refuse vpon their knees to receiue the sacrament of the body and blood of christ finally we learne of christ praying that after baptisme we must not be secure for though all sinnes be forgiuen vs yet is not concupiscence wholy extinguisht neither haue we our full measure of grace we ought therefore to fall to our prayers and so prepare our selues to receiue the holy ghost which is our needfull guide and strength in our spirituall warfare

but because shall resume this second person againe in the end of the text we will passe on and see in the next place how he was consecrated
he was consecrated first in signo visibili with a visible signe which was the likenesse of a doue

the word likenesse is not vsed saith st augustine ad excludenaam veritatem columbae to denie that that which appeared was a true doue but ad ostendendum quod spiritus apparuit in specie substantiae to shew that the essence of the spirit is a sarre different thing from that wherein he did vouchsafe to manifest himselfe
it was then a true doue and the end for which it was vsed sheweth there is reason we should thinke it to be so it was to be signum analegicum an apt signe to represent what was signified and the shape without the substance of a doue could not so well signifie the properties of the holy ghost their correspondency is to the qualities that are obserued in a liuing doue

am not ignorant that many thinke otherwise and that the shape onely was sufficient
some aduocates of rome make vse of this shape without substance to confirme their transubstantiation and the subsistence of accidents without the subiect bread and wine but leaue them to feed vpon their fancies and will not contend about that which is no article of faith onely this would haue obserued

that undefined span alphabet in the text doth not alwayes note a resemblance but some times a truth and seeing the phrase will beare both opinions as well that which holds that it was onely the shape of a doue as that which defineth it was a true doue chuse rather the latter as most agreeable to the intent of the holy ghost and the difference that put betweene the workes of god and the workes of the diuell
as god is an omnipotent creatour so those things which he exhibits are reall but the diuell affecting to be thought what he is not maketh shew of that which he doth not his workes are spectra meere illusions

though this were a true doue yet was it not assumed into one person with the holy ghost as the nature of man was at the incarnation of christ st austin giueth the reason non venit spiritus sanctus liberare columbas he came not to redeeme doues ergo non est natus dé

columba therefore was not incarnate by a doue but he came to signifie the properties of christ therefore it was sufficient that by his almighty power hee created a doue of nothing and thereby gaue notice of his presence and residence in our sauiour christ which doue as it was made of nothing so after the seruice was done was dissolued into nothing againe
wherein amongst other things appeares a difference betweene this doue and the imposture of mahomet and superstition of rome both practised by a doue whereof the later in a romane councill proou'd but an owle

chrysostome giueth another note vpon this doue in principijs spiritualium rerum when god first foundeth religion he vseth sensible visions in commiseration of them which are not capable of incorporall natures but his purpose is that when once such things haue made faith vnto his truth we should continue our faith in his truth though he doe not dayly confirme it vnto vs by such things
which the romanists should obserue who after so many hundred yeeres plantation of the christian saith will still haue miracles a marke of the true church
finally we must obserue that signes come not propter se but propter aliud there is some other thing intended besides that which is presented so was it here the doue appeared but the spirit of god was meant thereby the spirit was the sacred oyle wherewith our sauiour was annointed
the holy spirit though in person but one yet is hee infinite in the varietie of operations and so may haue answerable of resemblances out of which the scripture maketh choice vpon seuerall occasions of such as come neerest vnto the argument in hand
and to this purpose must we referre signes they serue not onely for illustration but for limitation also they confine our thoughts which otherwise would bee confused and fixe them vpon that which is presently intended
the grace then of the holy ghost here meant is not indefinite because represented in a speciall signe the signe of a doue this signe drawes our thoughts from plunging themselues into that infinite varietie of grace that was in christ to contemplate that which beareth correspondency to a doue
in which contemplation we must keepe this rule to behold first qualis christus fuerit how christ himselfe was qualified then quales nos esse debeamus how wee as christians must be conformable to him

but let vs come to the speciall grace designed by the doue
some obserue the neatnesse of that bird aspicis vt ventant ad candida tecta columbae accipiat nullas sordida turris aues and they will haue the vertue here intimated to be sanctity and indeed such an high priest it behoued vs to haue as was holy harmelesse separate from sinners and higher then the heauens the angel at his birth calls him that holy thing daniel the holy of holies his person his conuersation both were most pure hee was in nothing soild with the filth of sinne
and what the church must be we learne in our creed where it is called the holy

catholique church holinesse beseemes gods house for euer and from this haue wee the honour euen on earth to bee called saints a christian should not be an vneleane person neither should he delight in filthinesse

some looke vpon the sweete nature of the doue which is louing and louely and indeede the name undefined span alphabet sounds that propertie the doue is so called quasi undefined span alphabet exceeding in loue

st austin obserueth this propertie

de columba demonstrata est charitas quae venit super dominum quo nobis infunderetur the doue was the embleme of charity that was in christ and from him streamed into vs and indeede greater charity could not be found in any then was in our sauiour christ who gaue his life for his friends yea for his enemies and he commends no vertue more then charity vnto vs he prayeth that we may bee like to him therein and tells vs that by this shall all men know wee are his disciples if we loue one another

the whole booke of canticles is nothing but a commentary vpon this propertie wherein the name of doue is more then once remembred

but will resolue this propertie of the doue into two which will make way vnto some others
the doue is without guile and without gall a simple and harmelesse bird which figure two excellent properties of the holy ghost sinceritie and mercy the one a vertue of the head the other of the heart and they are opposed vnto the two maine properties of the diuell who is noted to bee slie as a serpent and cruell as a lyon
our sauiour christ is especially recommended vnto vs in the scripture as being farre from these hellish qualities that of the head there was no guile found in his mouth

and no maruell for he was the truth he came into the world to beare witnesse of the truth st iohn calls him the faithfull and the true witnesse the more blasphemous are they that draw any act or word of his to patronize or colour their impious aequiuocations and mentall reseruations we should conforme our selues vnto christ bee true nathaniels without simulation or dissimulation

be as good as our word though it bee our owne hinderance
how farre then hath the world degenerated when christians to excuse their owne fraud will fasten fraud on christ

yet when commend plaine dealing doe not condemne discretion the good of the serpent wee may haue though not the euill plaine dealing may well stand with prudence and there is an innocent prouidence onely we must take heed that our tongues and our wits be not made snares and pitfalls but as christs word was not yea and nay but all the promises of god in him were yea and amen so must our dealing not be fraudulent but sincere

as christ was without guile so was hee without gall so farre from taking offence when it was not giuen that when it was giuen he would not take it witnesse the checke which he gaue vnto his disciples when they would haue had fire from heauen to destroy the churlish samaritans you know not saith he of what spirit you are

the

sonne of man came not to destroy

but to saue mens liues hee would not breake a bruised reede nor quench smoaking flaxe yea so tender were his bowels that in the middest of his tortures vpon the crosse

hee forgaue hee prayed for his crucifying enemies
it is this sweetnesse of christs nature that when the conscience of sinne holds backe doth encourage vs to come with boldnesse vnto the throne of grace the doue is not so free from gall as our sauiour is from reuengfull malice
and what should a christian be heare our sauiour christ discite a quia mitis sum

we should imitate christ in meeknesse we should not bee in the gall of bitternesse like simon magus neither should any of bitternesse spring vp in vs spiritus non generat accipitres sed columbas if so bee our nature be cruell it is signe it was neuer new moulded by the spirit of grace

whose propertie it is not to bee of euill but to euill with good

but here also marke that hee who forbids crueltie doth not forbid courage we may partake the good of the lyon but not the euill it was and it is a grosse conceipt of macheuilisme to thinke that these properties of the doue to be without guile and without gall haue beene the baine of christiandome while the enemies thereof haue taken aduantage of their simplicitie to insnare them and of their pittie to deuoure them well may imprudent simplicitie and cowardly pittie disaduantage the prudent the couragious can neuer disaduantage nay sinceritie in the end ouercometh infidelitie and pittie triumphes ouer crueltie none euer dealt more plainely then christ none was dealt withall more deceitful none vsed more pitie none was vsed more cruelly
and what was the issue he prooued the wisedome of his enemies plaine folly their fury turned vnto his greater glory
neither haue these properties prooued worse in christians it were an easie matter to prooue it out of the martyres story recorded both in the old and the new testament

yea which maketh the opposit vices more odious neuer was there any craftie wit that was not vnto himselfe a snare nor cruell heart whose hands did not giue himselfe the deadliest woundes the serpent the roaring lyon that set vpon christ what are they but monuments of the euill successe of their hellish qualities wherefore though the world please it selfe in wilinesse and bloodinesse let it alwayes bee the care and comfort of a christian neuer to speake what he doth not meane nor to doe what he would not be done vnto
would it were so but god knoweth it is farre other wise euen with those that beare the name of christians as if so be they were altogether ignorant that the doue is included in the name of a christian none are more fraudulent none are more cruell as they are euen amongst vs that are orthodox in opinion it were too much if these things were onely in practise how intollerable is it when they are become doctrinall and the deuill hath so farre insinuated himselfe into mens heads and hearts as that a generation should rise vp who should teach such cases of conscience as resolue men artificially

to lye and meritoriously to shed blood making men put off not onely christianity but euen humanity also the christian world especially the orthodox part thereof is in a desperate paroxisme by this meanes if god bee not pleased to put to his helping hand certainely if euer the deuill and satan both names opposite to the doue are now let loose the serpent if euer hath now made way for for the lion the bands of humane society were neuer so crackt if they be not quite dissolued and yet is sociablenesse a speciall property of the doue but a property growne strange amongst christians who by their degenerating malice haue brought the church to bee a doue indeed that is a bird subiect to oppression so the hebrew word signifieth to such oppression that a man might well wish for the wings of a doue to flye away into some wildernesse where he might not see these vnnaturall barbarismes or if that may not bee at least a man hath iust cause to wish for gemitum columbae the mourning of a doue to bewaile the miseries of gods church
and indeed the spirit figured by the doue is hee that worketh in the hearts of christians sighes and groanes that cannot be exprest and pray god he may worke such sighes and groanes in vs

that though the church now lye amongst the pot sheards and deformed shee may recouer againe the winges of a doue couered with siluer and all her feathers bee as yealow gold

though these be profitable obseruations which you haue heard of the correspondency of the holy spirit to the doue yet may not forget a note which goeth farther and as suppose is most naturall to the text columba docuit saith st austin christum baptizaturum in spiritu sancto the doue did signifie that christ would baptize with the holy ghost and that hee would communicate this power to none hee would transferre the ministry to men but reserue the efficacy of baptisme to himselfe both while hee was on earth and as he now reigneth in heauen
for certainely the sacring doeth note this his possession and dispensation of the holy ghost it is his spirit and hee onely giueth it he sanctifieth the waters of baptisme vnto their sacred vse and by his spirit added vnto them doeth regenerate those that are members of his church

hauing thus farre opened vnto you the visible signe what it was and what it meant must now shew you vnde whence this doue came and that wee are taught in these words the heauens were opened vnto him
much dispute there is how the heauens were opened many thinke it superfluous to haue the doue descend from an higher stage then the aire they hold it not likely the firmament should bee diuided to giue way vnto him but they little thinke of gods power and the maiestie that beseemeth this sacring
make no doubt but that as god could so hee did make all creatures doe seruice vnto christ hee that made the sunne to stand to honour iosuah and to honour ezechias made it goe backe many degrees would hee not

make those glorious bodies part a sunder to giue paslage to this sacring doue suppose he would especially seeing all acknowledge that it was a doue newly created by the omnipotent power of god and the text saith not that heauen but that the heauens were opened vnto him
yet must wee not transferre the motion of the doue to the spirit who being euery where changeth not his place

but god by that motion would giue vs to vnderstand that the grace of the holy ghost commeth downe from heauen according to that of st iames euery good and perfect guift commeth from aboue euen from the father of light with whom there is no variablenesse nor shadow of change not so much as of place himselfe vnchangeable breatheth where hee will
besides the phrase of opening the heauens sheweth vs that onely by christ paradise aboue is opened and the commerce renued betweene heauen and earth and as many as are baptized into christ are really freed from that curse which was symbolically sigured by our shutting out of paradise below and the shutting vp thereof by placing the cherubims at the entrance with a flaming branded sword
last of all the text saith that the heauens were opened to christ but chrysostome expounds it well illi sed propter nos to him but for vs all the benefit that christ reaped by his mediation and inauguration was but to bee a from whence grace should streame into vs he had the honour we haue the good

you haue heard whence the doue commeth

now shall you heare where it pitcht it lighted vpon iesus
irenie obserues well this is the fulfilling of sundry prophesies recorded in isay the spirit of the lord shall rest vpon him will put my spirit vpon him the spirit of the lord is vpon me
but obserue that it so came vpon him that it manifested it selfe by him so is the phrase elsewhere declared in the story of gedeon sampson saul and others for after this inauguration neuer any man spake as christ spake and hee did those workes that neuer any man did

but wee must not mistake the holy ghost did not now descend vpon iesus as if he had him not before hee that was conceiued by the holy ghost could not be without him no not for a moment euen as he was the sonne of man
yea and of grace of sanctification it is out of all question that from the moment of his conception hee neuer increased therein

some question there is touching the grace of edification which in the schooles is called gratis data some hold that he had the fulnesse thereof also when he was conceiued

but the words of st luke makes it probable that though the man hood of christ were so neere linckt vnto the of the spirit which is his as by personall vnion yet the did communicate the grace of edification vnto the by degrees as it was fit for him to manifest it and we may without impietie hold that some accession

of such kinde of grace was made to the at his inauguration though it did not then make him but declare him to bee the king the priest the prophet of his church

but a little farther to enlarge this point distinguish signum and signatum in regard of the signe the holy ghost came now vpon iesus that he might point him out to st iohn baptist for had not the doue pitcht vpon iesvs the voyce from heauen might haue beene misapplied but the signe put it out of all question who was meant
if you looke to the thing signified then doeth st ierome giue a most comfortable note the holy ghost lighted vpon iesus that he might inure himselfe more familiarly then before to dwell with the sonnes of men and make them new creatures for as st austin thinketh christ did now vouchsafe to prefigure his church wherein those that are baptized receiue the holy ghost and christ receiued the spirit aboue measure that of his fulnesse wee might all receiue grace for grace which iohn seemeth to confirme when he saith that he descended and stayed vpon him in the signe vntill the word was spoken but in the grace vntill the worlds end
vntill the worlds end shall christ be those oliue trees in zacharie which feed the lights that burne in the house of god for he was anointed not onely prae but pro consortibus suis not onely aboue but also for his church
and although in the members of the church grace may ebbe and flow yet in christ is it alwayes constant and at the full
finally note the improouement of christs honour it was great when the heauens opened and the angels ascended and descended vpon him but when the heauens opened and the holy ghost descended vpon him then was his honour much more great
haue done with the visible signe and come now to the audible word
the signe had beene but a dumbe shew without the word for those signes that are sacred doe not signifie natura sua by their owne nature but diuino instituto by diuine institution and who knows it but hee that commands it and by his word informes vs of his purpose therefore god neuer appoints any visible signe but hee addeth an audible word as appeares in sacrifices and sacraments which had precepts and promises annext shewing their vse and effects
this light added to those shadowes did guide men to see their reference and correspondency the neglect whereof caused the carnall iew and causeth the superstitious papist to maime the mysteries of religion and feed vpon beggerly rudiments and emptie ceremonies if wee will bee truely and fully religious wee must ioyne both and let both worke in their order our thorough edification

but marke that the signe was from heauen and so is the word from heauen also and god is author of both of the vision and of the reuelation no man may presume to be farther of gods counsell then he is admitted or to fasten commentaries vpon his texts without his instruction
should tire you and my selfe if should shew you how iewes and christians haue lost themselues in such presumptuous contemplations

but rather chuse to impart vnto you the correspondency of the gospel to the law
at the giuing of the law there was vox de coelo a voyce heard from heauen so is there also at the deliuery of the gospel that did containe a breife of the law and this of the gospel
but there was moreouer this difference betweene the voyces the first was the voyce of sinai the second the voyce of sion

the first was a dreadfull but the second was a still voyce
st cyprian concerning this second voyce mooueth this question was there euer heard such a voyce before whereunto the answere is ready certainely neuer so sweet so gracious a voyce you will confesse it when haue shewed you whose and of whom the voyce was

it was the voyce of god the father hoc non ego dico saith st

ambrose when thou hearest these words this is my welbeloued sonne know that it is not who speake them to thee neither hath any man spoken them no nor god by an angel or an archangel sed ab ipso patre vox caelo demissa it is the father himselfe that by a voyce doth notifie this vnto thee
the father say for suppose by the ministry of an angel the voyce were framed yet certainely it was vttered in the person of the father

the text doeth plainely intimate it in the words my sonne
but our sauiour christ doeth elsewhere confirme it with an vndeniable reason no man knoweth the sonne but the father and to st peter affirming thou art christ the sonne of the liuing god

hee replieth flesh and blood hath not reuealed this vnto thee but my father which is in heauen
many testimonies went before concerning christ of the wisemen of the shepheards of the angels but none euer came neere this if we receiue the testimony of men of creatures the testimony of god of the creator is much greater

what shall say then to these things but onely exhort you in the apostles words

see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turne away from him that speaketh from heauen especially when he vttereth so comfortable and gracious words as are those thou art my sonne

some difference there is betweene the euangelists in relating the words some making god to speake vnto christ some to the hearers concerning christ but the reconciliation is easie for euen when god bends his words to christ his meaning is not to informe christ of that which he already knoweth but to instruct vs in that which it is fit for vs to know as christ elsewhere and in another case obserues this voyce came not because of mee but for your sakes so austin doth well reconcile the euangelists

but let vs come to the contents of the voyce

that which the father speaketh is concerning his sonne he tells vs what hee is to him what he doeth for vs first what he is to him filius and dilectus his sonne

and his beloued duo grata vocabula saith st cyprian two most contenting words specially if you adde the article to either of them undefined span alphabet this sonne is more then an ordinary sonne

and this beloued is more then ordinarily beloued

looke vpon the words a sunder first the sonne
christ was the sonne of god two wayes considered principalitas nominis filij est in spiritu domini qui descendit the chiefe reason why christ was called the senne of god is because hee is god of god light of light begotten of his father before all worlds but sequela nominis istius est in filio dei hominis the same title belongeth vnto him euen as hee was incarnate whereof the ground is the personall vnion the being assumed into one person with the
in regard of the first consideration is hee called vnigenitus the onely begotten of his father in regard of the second he is called primogenitus the first borne of many brethren both wayes is christ neere vnto god but our comfort standeth in the latter that emanuel god with vs or in our nature is undefined span alphabet the sonne of god for that is fons origo adoptionis nostrae it is that which layeth the soundation of being the sonnes of god

as christ was neere so was hee deere vnto god
and indeed the words that note the neerenesse containe the grounds of the also and they were vnigenitus the onely begotten and primogenitus the first borne vnigenitus ergo vnicè dilectus the onely begotten therefore onely beloued primegenitus ergo praecipuè dilectus the first begotten therefore the especially beloued of god for this is a principle euery man loneth himselfe the more of himselfe hee findeth any where the more he affecteth if he bee not degenerate
a father loueth his onely sonne intirely because he hath no more and his eldest chiefely because hee is principium praecipuum roboris the first and chiefe of his strength
but this undefined span alphabet or naturall affection of men is but a sparkle and that much allaied of that which is in god originally and but deriuatiuely in vs
therefore we may easily conceiue that christ that is so neere in nature and grace must needes bee most deere vnto god that indeed he is vir desidertorum a man after gods owne heart and the true dauid that is beloued as the prophets call him
adde hereunto that setled loue where it is iudicious is more feruent
now christus is dilectus not recenti impulsu sed inolito probato it is as ancient as god euen coeternall that christ is the sonne of god onely it is in time delated to the but the length of it is aeternitie

see then how god expresseth his loue to vs when he so describeth the person that hee bestoweth vpon vs
and haue we then any thing which we should thinke too good to render vnto god abraham will teach vs better who spared not vnicum and dilectum silium his onely beloued sonne when god called for him and we see how his thank fulnesse prospered
certainely we would prosper much better if in this kindnesse we would striue to bee answerable vnto god pray god we may sure am wee haue good cause if there were no other motiue then is contained in filius and dilectus if we doe consider onely what the second person in trinity is to the first how much

more if wee consider what hee doeth for vs in him is the father well pleased

wee will resolue this note into two first wee will see in whom and then how the father is pleased

hee is pleased in his beloued sonne this opens a mystery thou shalt make a plate of pure gold

said god to moses and graue vpon it like the ingrauing of a signet holinesse to the lord and thou shalt put it vpon a blew lace that it may bee vpon the miter vpon the forefront of the miter it shall be and it shall bee vpon aarons that aaron may beare the iniquitie of the holy things which the children of israel shall hallow in all their hory guifts and it shall be alwayes vpon his forehead that they may bee accepted before the lord euen so christ being to bee consecrated now high priest hath the holy ghost descending vpon him that so the church may bee made acceptable in gods beloued sonne

neither was hee the trueth onely of the high priest but of the sacrifices also st paul hebr
applieth to this purpose that place in the psalme

sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast then prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sinne thou hast no pleasure then said loe come in the volume of thy booke it is written of me to ave thy will god in this sense doth the law vse the word ratza when it is applied to sacrifices

and saith that they shall be accepted for the offerer and make an attonement for him
vntill christ came there was no remedy against the curse of the law but typicall within the church and without fruitlesse

but christ incarnate brought a soueraigne remedy

when hee became the true propitiatory in him it pleased god that all fulnesse should dwell and by him to reconcile all things both in heauen and earth

st austin speaketh briefely but fully in te complacui is as much as per te constitui gerere quod mihi placuit in thee am well pleased not onely taking delight in that which thou art but also by thee accomplishing all the good that meane to the sonnes of men

but what did christ surely he did propitiate gods wrath and giue man grace in gods eyes these two workes are contained in undefined span alphabet they are the blessings that flow from gods good will towards men reconciliation is composed of both of gods indulgence and beneficence indulgence is not enough without beneficence

absalon shewed this to ioab when hee was restored from his banishment but not admitted into the king his fathers presence
a good patterne to bee imitated by men is god who dealeth so in his reconciliation with men whereas men vse some times to forgiue but seldome to forget also they thinke it too much to deserue well and enough that they doe not deserue ill
would it were no more

but let vs touch at these points a sunder first at the propitiating of gods wrath

the latter chronologers will haue this sacring of iesvs to haue beene performed vpon the day of expiation in september which if it bee true then the holy ghost doeth fairely insinuate that christ

came as the lambe of god to take away the sinnes of the world
how soeuer this is true that hee bare our sinnes in his body and by his stripes we are made whole that he cancelled our obligation and slew hatred when hee suffered the crosse

neither did christ onely propitiate gods wrath but also gaue man grace in gods eyes christ teacheth it in three parables of the lost sheepe the lost groat and the prodigall childe
the fathers obserue the allegory that st peter maketh in comparing noahs arke vnto the church and obserue moreouer that as the doue brought the oliue branch into the arke in token that the deluge was ceased and the world was become habitable againe euen so the doue that lighted vpon christ brought the glad tidings of the gospel it was the embleme of the acceptable yeere

it testified that god was now undefined span alphabet and that men had now communion with him againe

but here are two rules that must bee obserued first that these wordes in whom am well pleased must bee vnderstood exclusiuely

christ is the onely mediatour neither is there any other name vnder heauen giuen by which we may be saued but onely the name of iesvs so that he which hath the sonne hath life

and hee which hath not the sonne hath not life christ will yeeld this glory to none other
secondly that god is immediatly well pleased with christ but mediatly with vs if we doe not so vnderstand the words wee haue but little comfort in them wherefore we must bee assured that we are made accepted in gods beloued that the church is now called hephzibah my delight is in her saith the lord
by the sonne

wee haue all accesse vnto the father through the holy ghost

finally all this is to be vnderstood of undefined span alphabet hic this person which seemeth so meane appeares in the forme of a seruant yet hee is filius meus my sonne my beloued in whom am well pleased god is not ashamed of his sonne humbling himselfe in our nature neither doth he loue him the lesse
and why his obedience was voluntary it was to doe his fathers will it was to doe vs good much lesse should we be ashamed for whose sake he became so humble yea god forbid that we should reioyce but in the crosse of christ if hic and meus sort so well in gods iudgment they must agree much more in ours

but to draw to an end in this text there is undefined span alphabet a true epiphanie and indeed the church reades my text but out of st luke vpon the epiphanie day on which the tradition holds that he was baptized and this great manifestation of god was made vnto the world wherein all things are augusta maiestati christi congrua very solemne very heauenly no where is the mystery of the trinitie which is the first foundation of true religion nor the comfortable actions thereof which is the foundation of christian religion so ioyntly so vndeniably reuealed
the mystery of the trinitie is incomprehensible vnutterable ego nescio saith st hilarie professe my ignorance of it yet will comfort my selfe the angels know it not the world cannot comprehend it the apostles neuer reuealed it cesset ergo dolor querelarum let not

men murmurre or complaine that this secret is hidden from them let it suffice them to know that there is a trinitie in vnitie let them neuer inquire how it is for they will inquire in vaine
naztanzene giueth the reason undefined span alphabet while would contemplate the vnitie my thoughts are by the trinitie and while goe about to distinguish the trinitie am presently cast vpon the vnitie the one doeth call my thoughts vpon the other
and what wonder that a man should bee so puzled for quo intellectu deum capiat homo

qui intellectum suum quo vult capere nondum capit how should he bee able to comprehend the trinitie that comprehends not yet his reasonable soule the onely helpe which hee hath wherewith to comprehend it and is indeede the best resemblance of it

that which haue said concerning the trinitie is a good rule of sobrietie to hold in curious wits that will prie too farre into these diuine mysteries
and yet epiphanius doeth well checke the incredulitie of sabellius non credis tres personas diuinae essentiae doest thou not beleeue the trinitie in vnitie comitare iohanem ad iordanem attend iohn baptist to the riuer iordan there thou shalt finde them all three
and indeed here the trinitie is brought in some sort within the compasse of our conceipt for it is not set foorth as it is in se but ad nos not simply as the foundation of true religion but as the foundation of christian religion as euery person contributes towardes our saluation
when such an obiect is presented the word of attention is pressed seasonably and reasonably it is prest to the eye and prest to the eare these reasonable senses are summoned with reuerence and confidence to behold to attend these sacred mysteries
to behold them as they are deliuered in the historie for euen the historie it selfe being rare is able to allure our reasonable senses
did it nothing otherwise concerne him who would not willingly yea greedily heare the voyce of god the father see the holy ghost in the shape of a doue and see the sonne of god so humbling himselfe in the nature of man how much more should we desire it when there is not onely miraculum but mysterium in it euen one of the greatest mysteries of godlinesse
the heauens are opened that is a miracle but they are opened for vs the holy ghost descends in a doue but the doue is but an embleme of the holinesse that must be in vs that is the mysterie the sonne of god here appeares to bee the sonne of man that is a miracle but he appeares to sanctifie the waters for the regeneration of man that is a mysterie when the miracles present these mysteries doe they not deserue a loe deserue that the eye the eare both should be taken vp by which thou mayest be made partaker of them

but thou wilt say would trauell farther then iordan to see such a sight might my eye see the heauens opened might my eare heare god speake from heauen might bee so happy as to come to such an inauguration of my sauiour my eye should not be satisfied with

seeing nor my eare with hearing
heare what ambrose answereth to such an obiection eisde sacramentis res iam agitur quibus tunc gesta est nisi quod gratia pleniore the life of that mysterie continueth stil though it be not cloathed with the same miracle then was the trinitie seene with carnall eyes whom now we contemplate with the eyes of faith

yea st ambrose is bold to say that greater grace is offered vnto vs then to them that were present at the baptisme of christ for vnto them as being incredulous god perswaded faith by corporall signes but in vs that are the faithfull hee worketh grace spiritually
and it is greater grace so to behold god as the faithfull doe then as doe those that are vnfaithfull so that the loe doeth no lesse concerne vs then it did them

yea it concernes vs much more our eyes should dayly be lifted vp heauen and behold how the grace of sanctification descends from thence into vs and to behold how the benefit of adoption is dayly offered vs our eares should be opened vnto heauen
the holy ghost commeth to vs but who seeth him god professeth that he accepteth vs in his beloued sonne but who heareth him no bee we neuer so often summoned our eyes our eares are slumbring are wandring and presume not though wish might that what haue spoken will awaken and fixe them
wherefore let vs turne both vnto him that opened the eyes of the blind and eares of the deafe that he would vnuaile both our eyes and our eares that these mysteries be not presented to vs in vaine but that the heauens bee now so open to our faith that hereafter they may bee opened to our persons that the doue would make vs such doues that we may flie with peace into the arke of god that he which is the sonne and beloued would make vs beloued sonnes of god that hauing our sinnes purged our persons accepted we may haue an endlesse communion in glory with the holy spirit that affoordeth vs this communion in grace

a sermon preached at
epigraph

iohn
vers
for if our heart condemne vs god is greater then our heart and knoweth all things
beloued if our heart condemne vs not then haue we confidence to wards god

and verily this scripture deserues well to be looked into at this time
for we are at length awakened out of our dead sleepe in carnall securitie gods iudgements haue rowsed vs and we purpose god willing publickely and penitently to deprecate gods fierce wrath prouoked by our crying innes
god grant we may do it acceptably effectually
but that cannot be except we first keepe a scrutinie we throughly suruay euerie man his owne selfe this is the truest preface vnto and best preparation for a penitentiall fast
he that can vnflatteringly present himselfe before the vnpartiall eyes of his owne soule and the most holy eyes of god he whose heart is of that temper that it can receiue those religious impressions which such a sight will worke he and he onely hath made the first and the hardest step that must be troden by a penitent man
my purpose is and it is the scope of my text to guid our feet into that step and aduise vs to grow more familiarly acquainted with that whereunto the most of men desire to be verie strangers meane our consciences
conscience in my text is called by the name of heart and our heart importeth as much as the conscience of a christian

touching this my text doth teach vs what is her worke it is to censure or to sentence vs this you may gather out of the whole body of my text
but in so dealing she proceeds not alike with all
and why she findeth not all alike

some are and they are censured as persons they haue a conscience that condemneth them
are not guiltie and they haue a conscience which condemneth not
the difference of the persons maketh a difference of her worke
vpon this difference st iohn groundeth an inference
he argueth from our heart vnto god and giueth vs to vnderstand that as we deale when we reckon with our selues so will god deale when he calleth vs to an account
the worke of god and our heart are in this case alike
alike they are but yet they are vnequall and that in two respects first of power secondly of knowledge
will a little supply the words so you will perceiue that st iohn speaketh as much in two comparatiue maximes
our heart is great and indeed it can doe much in this little world of ours and yet it is no match for god god is greater then our heart he can doe whatsoeuer he will both in heauen and earth
this is the first maxime
our heart knoweth much of that which is in vs it is euer of our priuie councell but yet that much commeth short of all it is god onely that knoweth all things euen those things that are hid in the obscurest darkenesse
this is the second maxime
see now what iohn worketh out of these two maximes
first concerning persons that are guiltie
if our euill conscience that is lesse in power and more shallow in knowledge doe notwithstanding condemne vs how shall not god condemne vs who is both omnipotent and omniscient
secondly concerning those that are guiltlesse
if a man vpon due scrutinie can giue himselfe a quietus est certainely that man may come with boldnesse vnto the throne of grace
iohn expresseth the inference in these words if our heart condemne vs not then haue wee confidence towards god
but whom doeth all this concerne which we haue spoken of conscience surely the members of the church they are meant by this name beloued they must know that the workes and fruites which proceed from these workes doe concerne them neither haue they any priuiledge
by this short modell you may conceiue the substance of my text and apprehend vpon what meane to insist
god so blesse mee in speaking and you in hearing that whensoeuer wee are put vpon the triall god and our heart may bee comfortable to vs seeing we are assured by my text that they will deale very plainely with vs

the first particular was the name whereby conscience is here called and that is heart
vnder this name heart the scripture comprehendeth three things the will the conscience and the affections sometimes the holy ghost intendeth all three by the word at other times

some one in this place it vnderstandeth that one of them which is called conscience
and there is reason why that is called by the name of heart
the heart of man is his morall treasurie christ teacheth it in st

matthew a good man out of the good treasurie of his heart bringeth foorth good things and an euill man out of the euill treasurie of his heart bringeth foorth euill things whatsoeuer our conuersation is be it good or bad the roote of it is there and from thence as salomon speaketh proceede life and death

now where the fountaine is of our morall actions there god is pleased should bee the seate of morall directions and corrections too that no motion of the heart should farther be yeelded vnto then might stand with the counsell or afterhand content of the conscience
god would not haue vs seeke farre for these things either vp to heauen or downe to hell or passe the sea's they are neere vs in vs yea a very part a principall part of vs
and by whom will a man bee ordered in these things if not by himselfe and to whom could god more mercifully commend him then to himselfe this mercifull care cutteth off those poore excuses and vaine apologies which men might make if god had not chosen so sit a seate for conscience

but wee must farther obserue that the conscience is furnished with two powers a directorie and a iudicatorie it hath in it morall principles whereby to guide men which is the law written in our heart whereby wee discerne good and euill the learned call it undefined span alphabet which is nothing else but practique rules of life of which there are two sorts as there is the heart of a naturall and the heart of a christian man so these rules are either naturall or supernaturall

the naturall are those which are inborne and ingrauen in the hearts of all men the reliques of that image which in the creation wee receiued from god these informe the naturall man though weakely of pietie equitie sobrietie and concerning all these the very heathen haue deliuered many memorable sentences
but besides these a christian hath other rules his heart is new written with the spirit of god

according to the promise made in ieremie will put my lawes into their inward parts and in their hearts will write them and wee finde the performance thereof in the new testament preached by st peter act

and st paul corinth

and to the hebr cap

yea euery christian man feeleth the trueth of it in his owne soule hee feeleth those naturall principles rectified by grace and much higher superadded to them so that the christian man discernes much better then a naturall man can what is good and euill
this is the furniture of the directory power

the conscience hath besides this a iudicatorie power and there is furniture for that also which is nothing else but a skill how to trie mens liues by those former rules and doome them as it findeth them
and this skill is aswell in the conscience of a naturall man as of a christian man though it be of much greater perfection in the latter then in the former

but wee must know that it is not the hauing but the vsing of these rules is properly meant by our conscience
for as the schooles note well conscientia ne{que potentia naturalis ne{que habitus it is neither a natiue nor an acquired abilitie sed est actus conscience is a worke and indeed it is a worke which my text speaketh of and whereas conscience hath two workes the one going before our morall works the other following after though for your better vnderstanding will touch at the former yet keeping my selfe to my text will insist vpon the latter

these principles then whether naturall or supernaturall were bestowed vpon vs perpetually to assist and guide vs in our wayes
one of the heathen well resembled conscience to a paedagogue

for as the paedagogue by the appointment of parents is alwayes at hand with a childe to direct and restraine him who otherwise through impotency of affection would goe astray euen so is our conscience appointed ouer vs to hold the raines to guide and hold in our wilde and headstrong nature
and surely wee are bound to acknowledge the mercifulnesse of god manifested herein hee hath graciously prouided for the preuenting of sinne who is pleased not onely to giue vs a law but also to place in vs a perpetuall remembrance thereof vnto vs
and the reason why men sinne must needes be either because they doe not consult or doe contemne this guide so that either their sinnes are wilfull if they contemne or their ignorance is affected if they neglect this preuenting meanes afforded of god

but haue not now to doe with the consciences worke of direction that worke of hers that goeth before our worke but haue to doe with the worke of iudicature the worke that followeth our workes
god hath left it in some sort in our power whether we will or will not make vse of the former worke of conscience and some by his grace vse it some for want of grace vse it not but god hath appointed conscience a second worke which it is not in any mans power to put off the worke of iudicature wherein god doeth let vs see what it is to vse or not to vse the former worke
and here we must marke that as the law which is contained in the directory work of conscience hath two parts a precept and a sanction so the iudicatorie worke of conscience doeth two things it playeth the iury to arraigne vs and the iudge to doome vs
first it testifieth whether wee haue or haue not obserued the precepts of god
in that respect it is resembled to a registrie or an exact record exhibited at an assizes if wee doe not take notice of the counsell which our conscience giueth vs before hand wee shall finde that our conscience taketh notice of all that is done by vs and will make a perfect presentment thereof it will truely relate how farre we haue or haue not suffered our selues to bee led by her aduice and we shall not be able to except against the verdict of this iury

as it maketh a true presentment in regard of the precept so doeth it

pronounce a iust doome in regard of the sanction for it pronounceth what is our due and therein wee shall finde it a iudge not onely putting vs in minde of life and death but also sentencing vs thereunto
and indeed this is the last and the highest worke of conscience and for this cause nazianzene doeth fitly tearme it undefined span alphabet an inward and vpright tribunall

but to open this iudicatorie work of conscience a little more fully we must obserue that she dealeth not alike with al because she findeth not all alike
the physicians acknowledge corpus neutrum a body that is neither sicke nor whole but the conscience doeth not acknowledge any neutrall man that is neither good nor bad non liquets and speciall verdicts are not knowne to the conscience it findeth euery man either guiltie or not guiltie
secondly it confoundeth not tares with wheate nor sheepe with goates in the presentment not in the doome doeth it confound the right hand with the lest hell and heauen death and life
it hath an accusing and excusing voyce a condemning and an absoluing voyce these two sorts of voyces it hath and no more
finally we must expect no shift no delay in the worke of our conscience whether it play the iury or the iudge
but let vs take these workes a little a sunder
and first see that which is against vs the apostle vseth a significant word which is undefined span alphabet a compound word which sheweth that conscience doeth first undefined span alphabet know throughly before it doeth undefined span alphabet offer to condemne vs the very word importeth an orderly course of proceeding it doeth not goe against vs without a iust ground and so is free from the corruption which is in too many worldly iudges that resolue vpon a mans execution before they haue heard his cause
but our conscience is priuie to all our doings an of all that passeth from vs undefined span alphabet it knoweth and proceedeth vpon certaine knowledge
yea it will present it so to the eyes of our soule that it will not suffer vs to be ignorant of that which it knoweth it will make vs confitentes reos we shall plead guiltie against our owne selues
and here see how god dealeth with vs he maketh our hearts the chronicles of our liues a chronicle indeed for hereinto are entered both what we doe and when and wee can as hardly deny the record as we are vnwilling to belie our selues and therefore we should take heed what we doe seeing the euidence thereof will remaine with vs neither is it an idle euidence but the presentment of a iurie our conscience is as it were a whole iury empanelled to trie vs whether guiltie or not guiltie it is alwayes going vpon vs and presenteth vs as it findeth vs
and who would not bemoane his case that will he nil he himselfe must bee tried by himselfe and that his sinnes are so palpable in his owne eyes that himselfe must bring in a verdict against himselfe

this is wofull bee cause the conscience that is undefined span alphabet is also undefined span alphabet wee will not spare to doome our selues if we finde our selues guiltie wee will power confusion vpon our owne soules and

with confusion and horror breed that worme suddainly which will bite vs intollerably we will bitter and sower our relish with the foretast of hell mala conscientia tota est in desperatione

we will make our selues most forlorne creatures
in the conscience which is guiltie there are stings dreadfull which the patient feeleth but none other can bee acquainted with and it is a true rule that tribulationes tanto acerbiores quanto sunt interiores the spirit of a man will sustaine his infirmities but a wounded spirit who can beare especially the spirit which himselfe woundeth but hee is his owne afflictor who is asllicted in conscience
a man may flee from his enemie but who can slie from himselfe it is true that a conscious man would euery where thrust himselfe from himselfe but he findeth by wofull experience that he can neuer goe from himselfe no though hee would vnnaturally bereaue himselfe of corporall life yet the tormenter abideth by him and whether soeuer he draweth himselfe he afflicteth himselfe euermore
many men that seele themselues euilly conscious labour to put off the distresse thereof by solacing themselues with the pleasures and vanities of this life but their attempt is a poore and short palliation of a desperate disease

wherefore let vs take heed of an euill conscience that loadeth vs with so much intollerable euill
though a man grow so desperately wicked that he regardeth no body yet he hath good reason to regard himselfe hee that feareth no bodies eye should feare his owne and feare the power that he hath ouer himselfe though hee feare not the power of any other
though we hide our sinnes from others we cannot hide them from our selues neither will wee spare our selues though all the world would spare vs hee neuer wanteth an accusing iury nor a condemning iudge that is infested with a guilt
conscience
as the conscience dealeth vncomfortably with them that are guiltie so with them that are guiltlesse it dealeth very comfortably it doeth not condemne so speaketh st iohn
but in his phrase there is a litote minus dicitur sed plus intelligitur there is more meant then is exprest
and indeed it cannot bee otherwise for if the conscience be a worke as it condemneth him whom it findeth guiltie so whom it sindeth guiltlesse him it absolueth it doeth iustilie

and here also we must obserue that our conscience if it be good undefined span alphabet it knoweth all the good wee doe it recordes it yea and tendreth the record that we may solace our selues with the contemplation of it
and indeed conscientia recte factorum to bee conscious to our selues of well doing is no small comfort especially when goodnesse is little regarded in the world yea is commonly persecuted by the world it is no small matter to haue in our soules that which can sweeten all the crosses which are laid vpon our bodies
goodnesse hath pleasure inseparably linckt vnto it as in god so in godly men and our conscience will not suffer vs to be defrauded of this heauenly pleasure which keepeth a memoriall of our vertues and

sweetens our life with the relation thereof
it commeth not to absolue vs per saltum but doeth it vpon as good a ground and as faire euidence brought out for vs as the condemning conscience worketh vpon euidence brought against vs
it is then the first benefit of an absoluing conscience that it keepeth and sheweth soorth when it may best steed vs the record of our

neither doeth it onely tender it as a but also as a iudge sentenceth vs according to it as it keepeth in minde how well we haue obserued the precepts of the law so doth it award vnto vs the sanction thereof all the benedictions that god hath annext vnto it corporall benedictions benedictions spirituall temporall benedictions and benedictions eternall
although bee full of contentednesse yet the reward of maketh no small accesse vnto it a good conscience is accompanied with both it is accompanied with bonum in re and bonum in spe good in possession and good in expectation
wherefore blessed is the man that can enter into his owne heart and finde there so good euidence and so good a sentence

but how may a man haue such a good conscience st austin teacheth the method of it

vt habeat quis bonam conscientiam credat operetur he that will haue a conscience that shall giue in good euidence for him and pronounce a comfortable sentence on him must beleeue well and liue well faith doeth purifie the heart and a good life beareth the fruite that aboundeth to our reckoning when wee iudge our owne soule

but a man must not looke to haue this blessing of a good conscience suddainely

vade ad formicam piger got to the pismire thou sluggard she gathereth graine in summer whereof shee maketh vse in winter et formica dei surgit quotidiè currit ad ecclesiam gods emmet that is a man that will haue such a good conscience riseth early hasteneth to the church heares often prayeth often meditateth often and so doeth acquire this absoluing conscience colligentem in aestate videre potes commedentem in hieme videre non potes the outward meanes which he vseth are visible but the inward comforts which when time serueth he reapeth are inuisible
thus doeth saint austin moralize that simile of salomon and wee must not looke to haue such or absoluing consciences except we bee such pismires of god

but here are two rockes to be heeded at which many suffer shipwracke while they mistake the doctrine of a and a condemning conscience

first of a
some confound herewith a seared conand because they are senselesse they doe not thinke themselues gracelesse custome in sinne or the busie pursuite of their corrupt lusts silenceth their conscience that it speaketh not to them or stoppes their eares that they heare it not
but this doeth rather suspend the worke then alter the nature of their conscience it doeth not make it a conscience of a condemning one
how many

theiues and murderers are very frolicke not only when they act their wickednesse but when they are in the gaile when they are brought to the barre yea when they are casting off the gallowes
but wise men that see them in this humour censure it for vnreasonable stupiditie and desperatenesse they hold it not to be comfortable securitie
no more is that which wee see in sinners who while they drinke in iniquitie with greedinesse haue stonie hearts and brasen foreheads
if in the dayes of grace wee make vnto our selues the dayes of iudgement and sift our selues vnpartially according vnto gods word before we bee tried at gods barre and finde our selues discharged with a not guiltie and an euge serue bone well done seruant faithfull and true enter into thy masters ioy this is indeed a conscience

the second rocke is that many confound a tender conscience with a guiltie conscience and plod more vpon the heart of a man then they doe vpon the heart of a christian man they consider not the prerogatiue that the elect haue by being in christ into whom when they were ingrafted they were iustified from all sinne so that though afterwards they may become damnable through their fall yet damned they cannot be because their repentance and saith cannot bee in vaine neither must they measure the trueth of their state by their sense
god is pleased often times to humble his children by suspending the sense of their state but he doeth not alter their state because his guifts are without repentance and vpon their teares sighes and prayers wherewith god is pleased to be importuned he restoreth vnto them the sense of their state againe their eyes are opened to see that their obligation is cancelled and the booke crost wherein all their debtes were entred and that the blood of christ hath cleansed them from all sinne
you haue heard many things concerning conscience all which though they bee of good regard yet they containe not all that which wee must heede
for the worke of conscience is rather praeiudicium then iudicium it is but a reall prophecie informing vs how god will hereafter deale with vs
therefore saint iohn carrieth our thoughts from our hearts vnto god and will haue vs expect from god what wee finde in our owne hearts
and indeed our heart is nothing else but gods apostle whose message is the iudgement to come st ieromes trumpet that sounded still in his eares surgite mortui venite ad iudicium
besides our inward we haue an outward iudge besides the present there is a future iudgement
and verily it is a wonder that any man should doubt of a future iudgement that hath a conscience seeing the vse of the conscience is to forewarne vs of it the iudgement in our bosome must bee vnto vs a remembrancer of another iudgement that is to come and wee must the rather be mooued with the former because of the reference it hath vnto the latter

reference nay resemblance which is more for in the present

iudgement wee haue a liuely representation of the iudgement to come god will deale with vs no otherwise then our heart the iury at his barre will exhibite no other presentment neither shall wee heare any other sentence from that iudge the booke of gods prouidence will agree with the booke of our conscience and the doome of our conscience shall be ratified by gods doome
and this representatiue qualitie that is in our conscience must make vs the more to regard the absolute qualitie thereof
for though it bee much to feele the force of conscience without this reference yet is it much more if the reference bee included in our feeling thereof it will make vs more carefull to prepare our selues for god when wee are remembred so to doe by our owne heart

god then and our heart agree in one worke their worke is like
like it is but not equall you may perceiue it in st iohns inference that hee maketh according to the difference of the worke of conscience
one worke of the conscience is to condemne thereupon st iohn maketh an inference if our heart condemne vs god is greater then our heart and knoweth all things
wherein appeares a double inequalitie
the first is of authoritie
our heart is great it is king in this little world of ours for it doeth season all that commeth from vs our workes are good or euill so farre as our conscience is a partie to them they are good if she be good and if she be euill they are euill
the inclination of the heart is the inclination of the whole man so that no power of the soule or part of the body will hold backe if our heart or conscience doe set forward
our heart then is great great within the spheare of this little world
but god is greater then our heart who commandeth both ours and the great world
god is said to be greater not so much in regard of his eminencie aboue vs as his soueraignetie ouer vs in which sense the psalme saith that our god is a great god and a great king aboue all gods
and indeed power belongeth onely vnto him
are tearmed powers rather propter ministerium then dominium they can doe nothing beyond the influence they haue from god but gods power is absolute and the sentence hee pronounceth vnresistable whereas he can checke the sentence which our heart pronounceth
but to fit this point of gods power to that which wee said before of the power of our heart
gods power doeth season all the afflictions that come vpon vs and the apprehension that they come from him maketh them much more grieuous then they would be in themselues secondly if god bee bent against vs no creature will stand for vs you see wherein standeth the first inequalitie betweene god and our heart

the second inequalitie standeth in omnisciencie
it is true that our heart knoweth much

and as the apostle saith no man knoweth the things in man but the spirit of man
but that is as true which salomon saith

the spirit of man is as the candle of the lord searching the inward parts of man it is but a candle and that is a dimme light a candle of

the lord and that is a ministeriall light
two wayes is our knowledge dimme through and
ignorance is the cause that we cannot know our selues if wee would is the cause that we will not know our selues so well as we can therefore dauid prayed and wee must pray ab occultis munda me domine lord cleanse me from my secret faults

as for god his eyes are ten thousand times brighter then the sunne

dauid hath made a whole psalme of gods not onely

but also eye
god himselfe answereth the question in ieremie concerning mans heart who can search that intricate and wicked labyrinth the lord
the lord onely is undefined span alphabet the searcher of the heart and we are much better knowne to him then we are to our selues
this inequalitie being obserued marke now the apostles inference is our heart condemne vs god is greater then our heart and knoweth all things
if we regard the iudge in our bosome how much more must wee regard the iudge of heauen and earth if we stand in awe of the knowledge which wee haue of our selues how much more must wee reuerence the piercing eye of god nay if cain and iudas and such other wretches were so distressed and perplexed when they were but undefined span alphabet onely condemned by themselues and it is so fearefull a thing for wickednesse to bee condemned by its owne testimonie

how will they bee at their wits end when they shall bee undefined span alphabet arraigned before christ comming in the glory of his father and all his holy angels with him when the bookes shall be opened and the lury giue euidence vnto the iudge according to those things that are written in those bookes the miserie must needes be answerable and it is fit that our feare bee answerable to the miserie
certainely it is the drift of the apostle to worke an affection in vs sutable to the obiect that he setteth before vs
and we shall doe well to make that vse of it vse of the inference which he maketh arguing from a condemning conscience vnto a condemning god whom no iudge can equall in omnipotencie no iury in omnisciencie

my text intreateth not onely of a condemning but also of an absoluing conscience and it maketh a comfortable inference thereupon
and here we are first to obserue the absolute comfort of a good conscience that from thence we may ascend vnto the comparatiue

the absolute is boldnesse boldnesse in iudgement for so you must vnderstand it sutably to the argument
the word is undefined span alphabet freedome of speech
a guiltie man is tongue tied as you may perceiue in the parable of the marriage feast the man that wanted a wedding garment was no sooner asked friend how camest thou in hither but he was euen speechlesse
the eloquentest man will become mute out of the guilt of his conscience
it is no small comfort that a seruant can vtter his owne defence in the presence of his lord
the syriacke paraphrase rendreth the word by reuelationem faciei a guiltie man hangeth downe his head hee hideth his face so the scripture describeth cain
and indeed confusion is inseparable from guilt
the philosopher can tell

vs that blushing in children is nothing but the vaile of consciousnesse and men that doe not easily blush supply that defect by hiding their face
but innocencie needeth no such couert it shameth not to bee seene the cheerefulnesse of the countenance doeth speake vnto the world the guiltlesnesse of the conscience

st

paul calleth this boldnesse undefined span alphabet a gloriation because it is the onely thing wherein a man may glory yea and ioy too for a good conscience is a continuall feast

whatsoeuer mans state is in this world he can neuer be defrauded of this glorious ioy hee that hath a good conscience hath more comfort vnder the crosse then hee that hath an ill conscience can finde in the middest of all his pleasures for conscientiam malam non sanat preconium laudantis nec bonam vulnerat conuitiantis opprobrium
this is the generall comfort and therefore it is found aswell in the iudgement of the heart as of god

but from the absolute consideration hereof let vs come to the comparatiue
if we feele this boldnesse in the inward iudgement we shall feele it much more in the outward if the imperfect verdict of our owne heart so cheere vs what cheere shall wee conceiue out of the perfect verdict of god

but the boldnesse that we haue to doeth appeare specially in three things
first in prayer in that a good heart bringeth vs to god

in full assurance of faith and the answere of a good conscience maketh intercession for vs to god

secondly at the day of iudgement when a man of good conscience will not feare the wicked nor bee troubled hee standeth confident like a lyon while the other flie
a good conscience is that same oyle which the wise virgines had to trimme their lampes when they met the bridegroome which made them stand with boldnesse before the sonne of man
thirdly in heauen when they shall appeare before the throne of god there to attend with angels and saints
blessed are the pure in heart saith christ for they shall see god
argue then thus if it bee comfort to behold god by faith what comfort will it be to behold him by sight if it bee comfort to finde a quietus est when we call our selues to an account what comfort will it bee to receiue our discharge from god if it be comfort to mee to talke familiarly with my owne soule what comfort will it be for me to talke familiarly with god we must argue from the one to the other as from a finite vnto an infinite thing and so conclude the greatnesse of the one from the little taste that we haue of the other

to draw towards an end
the scope of this scripture is to teach vs what vse we must make of our conscience
we should consult it before we set our selues about any morall worke and assure our selues that it is a more faithfull counseller then are our lusts they draw vs whither themselues incline and what themselues abhorre from that they withdraw vs but the conscience will deale most faithfully with vs it will diswade vs from nothing but that which is euill and perswade vs to nothing but that which is good
and happy were wee if

we would make it our guide
naturall men were lesse vnhappy if they did so for they would lesse offend god and should bee lesse punished
christian men were much more happy for their guide would teach them more to please god that they might bee more blest
but if this doe not mooue vs let vs feare the aggrauating of sinne the more meanes the more guilt the more guilt the more stripes
and what vse will a man make of other meanes that neglecteth this domesticke that sitteth so close to him as his owne heart

and yet see report mee to euery mans owne conscience whether he bee ruled lesse by aime then hee is by his owne heart our conscience is furnished both with the law and with the gospel and how could we so enormously violate either if we would hearken vnto her if we would suffer her to direct our actions but this is rather to bee wished then hoped for all are not so prouident as to let their conscience preuent sinne
well howsoeuer wee neglect the first worke of conscience wee cannot auoid the second if wee will not take notice of it it will take notice of vs it taketh notice of all our doings whether they be good or bad proueth a comfortable or vncomfortable iury vnto vs neither is this all our selues are trusted not onely to giue in the verdict but also to take it whether it bee against vs or for vs
and as our conscience will not spare to doome vs according to the law if wee bee guiltie our selues shall pronounce what our sinnes deserue so will it not faile to assure vs of all the blessings of the gospel if it finde vs innocent and we shall rest assured of the trueth of our owne iudgement and why god will second our heart his worke will keepe correspondencie with ours whether it condemne or absolue
onely for the greater terrour of the wicked and comfort of the godly let vs not forget the inequalitie if wee sincke vnder our owne iudgement we shall sincke more vnder gods and if our owne doe yeeld boldnesse gods will yeeld much more

wherefore redde te tibi forget not the preuenting worke of thy conscience to bee ruled by it

neglect not the enquiring worke of thy conscience to prognosticate of thy future state according to it
let euery one of vs endeauour with st paul to haue an vnoffensiue conscience toward god and men that he may solace himselfe in that true peace thereof in this world and haue the consummation thereof with aeternall blisse in the world to come
amen

a meditation vpon psalme
verse
epigraph let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart bee acceptable in thy sight lord my strength and my redeemer

fa&st and pray lord doe fast and would pray for to what end doe sustenance from my body if it be not the more to cheere vp my soule my hungrie my thirstie soule but the bread the water of life both which find no where but in thy word partake not but by exercising my selfe therein
this begin to doe and faine would doe it well but in vaine shall attempt except thou doe blesse blesse me then lord blesse either part of me both are thine and would withhold neither part from thee
not my body would set my tongue on worke to speake of thee not my soule would exercise my heart in thinking on thee would ioyne them in deuotion whom thou hast ioyned in creation
yea lord as they haue conspired to sinne against thee so doe they now consort to doe their duetie to thee my tongue is ready my heart is ready would thinke would speake thinke vpon thee speake to thee
but lord what are my words what are my thoughts thou knowest the thoughts of men that they are altogether vanitie and our words are but

the blast of such thoughts both are vile
it were well it were no worse both are wicked my heart a corrupt fountaine and my tongue an vncleane streame and shall bring such a sacrifice to god the halt the lame the blind the sicke though otherwise the beasts be cleane yet are they sacrifices abominable to god how much more if we offer those beasts which are vncleane and yet lord my sacrifice is no better faultring words wandring thoughts are neither of them presentable to thee how much lesse euill thoughts and idle words yet such are mine the best of mine they are such cannot denie it but grieue at it should doe that hauing nothing else to offer god hauing nothing that is required of him this that haue should be such as he cannot like
what remedie none for me if any it is in thee lord that must find it and for it now doe seeke vnto thee
thou onely lord canst hallow my tongue and hallow my heart that my tongue may speake and my heart thinke that which may be acceptable vnto thee yea that which may bee thy delight
doe not lauish were it not enough that god should beare with that hee should not punish the defects of my words of my thoughts may presume that god shall accept of me nay delight in me forget who the lord is of what maiestie of what felicitie can it stand with his maiestie to vouchsafe acceptance vvith his felicitie to take content in the words of a worme in the thoughts of a wretch and lord am too proud that vilifie my selfe so little and magnifie thee no more
but see whether the desire of thy seruant doth carrie him how wishing to please consider not how hard it is for dust and ashes to please god to doe that wherein god should take content
but lord here is my comfort that may set god to giue content vnto god god is mine and cannot want accesse vnto god if god may approach himselfe
let me be weake yet god is strong lord thou art my strength
let me bee a slaue to sinne god is a lord thou art my sauiour thou hast redeemed me from all that wofull state whereunto adam cast me yea thou hast built me vpon a rocke strong and sure that the gates of hell might neuer preuaile against me
these two things hast thou done for me lord and what may not

hee presume of for whom thou hast done these things feare not to come before thee presume my deuotion shall content thee bee thy eyes neuer such eyes will bee bold to present my inward my outward man before thee be thy eyes neuer so holy eyes will not flie with adam to hide my nakednesse from thee for am able to keepe my ground seeing am supported by my lord doubt not but to prooue a true israelite and to preuaile with god
for all my woe for all my sinne will not shrinke nay will approach approach to thee for thou art my redeemer
the neerer come to thee the freer shall bee both from sinne and woe
blessed state of man who is so weake so strong so wretched and so happie weake in himselfe strong in god most happie in god though in himselfe a sinfull wretch
and now my soule thou wouldest be deuout thou mayst be what thou wouldest sacrifice to god thy words sacrifice to god thy thoughts make thy selfe an holocaust doubt not but thou shalt be accepted thou shalt content euen the most glorious the most holy eyes of god
onely presume not of thy selfe presume on him build thy words build thy thoughts vpon thy rocke they shall not be shaken free thy words free thy thoughts thoughts and words enthrauled to sinne by thy sauiour and thy sacrifice shall be accepted

so let me build on thee so let me be enlarged by thee in soule in body that the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart may bee acceptable in thy sight lord my strongth and my redeemer
amen

a meditation on psalme
verse
epigraph surely men of low degree are vanitie and men of high degree are but a lie to bee laid in the ballance they are altogether lighter then vanitie

although there is odds betweene man and man as they act their parts vpon the stage of this world some being noble and some ignoble some abounding and some wanting some commanding and some obeying yet were all made of the same mould and into the same is euerie man resolued in his due time herein betweene rich and poore there is no odds except this be the odds that the better are herein the worse so much worse as a lie is worse then vanitie
poore men what they are they appeare their state speaketh their vanitie they beare it ingrauen in euerie of their wants for what are wants but the steps of vanitie vanitie whereunto man is subiect by reason of his fall euen so farre subiect as that it ceaseth not incroaching on him till hauing exhausted that little which he hath it lodge him in the graue in hunger and nakednesse in contempt and heauinesse who doth not read vanitie but this is but the thereof the inside is worse the lord knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vaine and men vanish in their owne discourse which hath much folly little solidnesse witnesse the looking glasse thereof the talke of most men most vaine talke
the vnderstanding is not so vaine but the heart is much more vaine how idle nay how euill are the desires thereof so much as is manifest is able to confound vs but how intollerable is that which is not manifest certainely that is most vaine

but the vpshot of uanitie standeth in the vanitie of our hope our hope is felicitie at that we aime and of nothing are we more disappointed then of that for when we come to reape the fruit of our discourse of our desire wee find our selues deluded and our end is wretched

and indeed vanitie is not onely a bare want but an euill that accompanieth that want
if our vaines bee destitute of good humours yet are they not emptie wind will take vp the place of good bloud and where that is it tortureth with ach the crampe and sundrie diseases euen so vanitie is not onely a want of spirituall substance but it is withall a painefull wind a disquieting emptinesse
such vanitie followeth the nature of man if any one be a sonne of adam hee is subiect to this vanitie
and no maruell for from adam it was propagated and it is as naturall to his issue as their nature is that nature which they deriued from him after hee ceased to be a sonne of god
for where god is there substance is and where god is not there is no substance
this we grant we thinke no better of the common sonnes of adam

but the sonnes of noble men are they no better are they also vanitie their state promiseth better things then so there appeareth in them few steps of vanitie
if we looke on their it may seeme so for they haue food to satisfie their hunger yea sawce to their food that they may eate with pleasure their bodies are warme clad not onely so but their garments speake their wealth they are well garded with attendantes countenanced with alliance and aduanced to all degrees of honour helps they haue to preuent sicknesse before it come and when it is come they haue helps for to cure it
what doe they want and if they want not how are they vaine surely in this that all this is but a lie it seemeth it is no substance had it not all his first originall from nothing and how can it then but returne to nothing againe and what stay can that bee which it selfe is fleeting be our garments neuer so rich they weare but wee weare faster that are them they doe but hide from our eyes the euidence that we doe grow old they keepe vs not from growing old could we as often put on a new body as we doe a new garment then garments might be some remedie

against vanitie but we keepe on still and neuer shift our body it is neuer the yonger for our new coate
gay cloathing is but a lie

and as for food that is much more a lie
as a man is not the better for his garment so hee is nothing the worse but the delicate fare of great ones is so farre from being a preseruatiue against death that nothing speedeth it faster excesse in quantitie varietie in qualitie of meates at rich or rather in rich mens stomackes what are they but the rootes from whence springeth sicknesse and the armes as it were wherewith death layeth hold vpon them then is not meate a lie friends it may bee will steed vs better none lesse then great mens friends in whom especially enuie raigneth which is the forge of ruine so that the greater friends are the lesse commonly may they be trusted fidelitie is not a vertue of the court but of the countrie brand then such friends with a lie for their friendship is no better then a lie
but if they faile vs our honour will support vs hee that is in authoritie is his owne piller he may rest securely vpon his owne power no man lesse hee is like a faire castle ground well planted with ordinance and furnished with munition you would thinke it impregnable but it is subiect to a mine and often is ouer turned before he that giueth the blow can bee perceiued
many haue beene brought to their end by their secret cunning from whom they receiued greatest respect in the eyes of the world
if any dignitie be priuiledged it is the throne of kings but what are their thrones but the stages of treason hee is but a stranger in chronicles that doth not read that all kind of honour is cronicled for a lie

what remaineth onely seruants and will they stand by vs when others faile nothing lesse of all mens theirs is a most mercinarie fidelitie their seruice doth not their wages yea how often doe they sell their masters life in hope of better wages let them weare their cognizance their true cognizance is a lie
if clothes if meate if friends if honour if attendants if euery of these bee but a lie what is all worldly greatnesse is it any more then a lie nay how

great a lie is that to the making vp whereof concurre so manie lies so that the great men whose seemeth to lift them vp aboue ordinarie men gaine nothing by their aduancement but this that whereas ordinarie men appeare to be what they are that is uanitie great men are so but doe not appeare and therefore their state hath another but no better name it is a lie

the case of all then high and low is bad if it be no worse then this that it is uanitie that it is a lie
for what doe wee abhorre more in nature then vanitie which is the emptinesse of nature what in good manners more then a lie which is the counterfeit of good manners we thinke nothing ought more to be endeauoured then sollidnesse in being and sinceritie in appearing and abhorre nothing more then the contrarie to them both
so that to haue our state not onely paralleld with but to become vanitie and a lie we may deeme the greatest debasement that can be thereof
and yet it is not the comparison doth vs too much honour we are not worthy to bee matched with these though these bee of so small waight yet they vs in the scales of god if we both bee waighed our lightnesse will soone discouer the inequalitie
and indeed no wonder for vanitie is nothing in comparison of sinne and a naturall lie in comparison of a morall
to be mortall taketh away much of that substance which we had in our creation but to bee sinfull taketh away much more the maxime quod efficit tale illud ipsum est magis tale holdeth most true betweene sinne and vanitie for man becommeth subiect vnto vanitie through sinne and who doth not know how much lower sinne doth carrie vs then doth vanitie vanitie lodgeth vs in the earth sinne tumbleth vs into hell and that is lightest that carrieth vs lowest the more sollid euery thing is the neerer to god and the farther from god it carrieth vs the lighter it must needs be
and behold a paradoxe here grauia tendunt sursum and leuia deorsum so that they that are light in the scales are out of the scales very heauie they sinke downe into hell and they that are in the scales heauie are out of the scales verie light they so are as high as heauen

but it may be thought if men of low degree bee singled by them selues or men of high degree by themselues their waight is no greater yet if they bee ioyned each will helpe to augment the others waight and what they cannot a part they may doe going together at least counterpoyse if not ouerpoyse uanitie and a lie
no verily for as a cipher added to a cipher maketh but a cipher so vanitie is no whit the heauier by the addition of a lie nor a lie by the addition of uanitie
put high men and low men all sorts of men yea all persons into gods ballance and you shall find that if they haue no other waight then that which is in men they cannot hold waight no not with vanitie it selfe then which you would thinke nothing can haue lesse waight and indeed nothing hath but sinne wherin standeth the chiefe lightnesse of man

lord thou hast appointed a day wherein thou wilt waigh all both things and persons and trie how much they haue lost of that sollidnesse which thou hast bestowed vpon them confesse that had lost much yea all true sollidnesse
brought none with me out of my mothers wombe but it hath pleased thee againe to repaire it in part and promise it in whole
grant that of whatsoeuer degree am may thinke no better of my nature then it is and may value thy grace according to its worth make me which am a sonne of adam a child of god and so free me from vanitie
and if thou bee pleased to prosper me on earth yet lord prosper mee much more towards heauen and free my greatnesse from a lie
so shall not be light in thy scales with that lightnesse that descends to hell but heauie with that sollidnesse that ascends to heauen
amen

a meditation vpon hebr
verse
epigraph it is appointed for all men once to die and after death commeth iudgement

my soule what now thou art thou canst not continue long and what thou shalt bee it is good thou timely doe consider
thou now dwellest in a body made of clay and daily mouldring into dust thou canst haue no surer prognostication that it will haue an end then thy continuall experience that it is mortall
were there nothing but age that wrought vpon it it would wither but when sicknesse which speedeth sooner and spends faster conspires with age to ruine thy habitation how canst thou be vnmindful of the fall thereof how canst thou but euery houre expect it but there is a higher remembrancer one of whom thou mayst lesse doubt in this case then of either sicknesse or age and that is god hee hath decreed it all must die thou art one of that all and of all not one that can exempt himselfe from or except against gods decree
especially so iust a decree no lesse iust then peremptorie no lesse peremptorie then iust
god peremptorily threatned death before thou sinnedst and since thou hast sinned iustice can doe no lesse then giue sentence against thee the sentence of death
the soule that sinneth must die thou art a sinfull soule and therefore thou must taste of death
thou must not looke that those eyes of thine which haue beene the windowes of lust shall alwayes gaze vpon this besotting world thou must not thinke that those eares of thine by whose gates haue entred so much vanitie shall still be inchaunted with the flatteries of thy deceitfull friends thou must not thinke that this taste of thine importunate sollicitor of thy appetite shall still serue to pamper thy body with delicacies
these things haue had their time and it is but a time that is allowed

them they were and the more they doe the lesse shall they be able to doe dimnesse casts a vaile vpon thine eyes and deafnesse lockes vp the doores of thy eares and thy taste forgets to discerne thy meates
and iustly become they so infeebled that kept no measure in their strength what they should haue done they delighted least to doe though by doing it they might haue lasted long and what they should not haue done in doing that they tooke their greatest solace though in doing of it they wrought their owne decay
had not eue beheld the forbidden fruit more willingly then god hadshee not listned to the serpent more attentiuely then to his word had shee not tasted the tree of the knowledge of good and euill more sweetly then the tree of life had had immortall eyes eares and taste
but because shee abused them must loose the vse of them
but why doe deriue my fault vpon others why doe vncouer my parents nakednesse are my teeth set on edge onely because they did eate sower grapes my selfe did eate in them and after them my selfe haue eaten like vnto them doe not so much resemble them in nature as concupiscence what so euer they planted haue watered and watered that often which they planted but once
and as if feared that their ill husbandrie would not proue fast enough my selfe haue beene a toylesome husbandman in cherishing the briers and thornes that haue choked euen all those few cornes of good seed which deriued from them
at least if their leprosie my whole man yet was it not so deepe rooted or so strongly setled as by my ill diet it hath since beene
what then may this house of my body this garment that couereth my soule expect but to be vsed as the leprous house the leprous garment which in a fretting leaprosie were the garment to bee burnt the house to be plucked downe and indeed as impossible is it for the iuie that springs and a wall to be killed without taking in sunder of all the stones and separating them from the morter which knitteth them together as for the natiue sinne wherein was borne branching it selfe ouer euery part of my body and power of my soule to be purged except be dissolued my soule part from my bodie and the parts of my bodie loose that knot wherewith

each is linked to the other
doe not then complaine of the decree it is iust it is necessarie my sinne maketh it iust and that this sinne be dispossest it becomes necessarie necessarie for all and then for me
would yeeld vnto it would be contented with it blessed apostle the word of the lord which thou hast spoken were good would obey it would yeeld to death though death be bitter were there not a heauier thing that followeth death more terrible then death it selfe
let me feele gods hand so come not into gods presence into the presence of the iudge to giue an accompt for my life
blessed apostle is it not enough that my soule can no longer enioy her bodie no longer by her bodie enioy those things wherein shee hath placed her soueraigne good that shee can no longer solace her selfe with her mate take comfort in her eate the fruit of her labours receiue honour from others bestow fauours at pleasure bee an oracle vnto many and to as many be a terror blessed apostle is it not enough that these things faile and must part with them no thou sayest no when thou hast lodged my bodie in the the graue thou sufferest not my soule to rest thou callest her to a straight accompt thou tellest her of a iudgement
how vainely haue beene abused by heathenish prouerbs that told me death ends all and yet all is not at an end when come to death must come before my iudge must answere the law the law must trie my life how well haue obserued it how answerable my carriage hath beene to it and lord what a fearefull thing is this when thou blessed apostle didst reason of these things thou madest foelix a great man a heathen man to tremble and a greater then foelix the king of niniuie did tremble also when hee heard ionas
and yet how little did they know thy law how much did their ignorance excuse their transgression thereof and what then will become of me that know so much and haue so little to plead can chuse but tremble lord while liue often heare of thy law and the accompt that must be giuen thereof but neuer had so much grace as foelix or the king of niniuie no not when read the storie of foelix and the king of niniuie
neither of them onely but of good king iosias also whose heart did melt at the reading of thy law when

he saw how vnanswerable the liues of his people were thereto
and what wonder that iosias heart did melt when moses himselfe did quake at the receiuing of the law surely these all felt the terror of the iudgement they knew what it was to come before their iudge
and the more in my life was senslesse the more sensible shall bee hereof in my death vnexpected euils afflict the more especially if they bee great their impression must needs be deepe
but bee affected neuer so wofully must appeare must be tried hee that gaue the law will inquire into the obseruance of his law
while we liue many couer our faults which when wee are dead they will not sticke to amplifie and he that liuing goeth for a saint after his death is traduced as a diuell
a heauie iudgement yet how many vndergoe it but this is their comfort that of this iudgme~t they haue no sense how their name fareth in this world in death they know not
but against the other iudgement there is no shelter all the stormes of it must light vpon vs in our owne persons we must answere for our selues and we are not so well knowne to our selues as to him that sifteth vs yet so much we know that we shall trauerse no indictment we shal plead guiltie to euery bill our owne conscience is a true counterpart vnto gods booke we shall bee charged with nothing out of the one which we shall not read distinctly in the other
to read it were enough for the vttermost confusion for what man knoweth and doth not abhorre himselfe had we a true looking glasse wherein wee might behold the manifold enormous sinnes of our life neuer could any thing be more vgly neuer would any thing be more abominable neuer were we so much in loue with our selues when we acted sinne as wee shall detest our selues when we see the staines of sinne
but detestation and confusion are but the first part of this iudgement the worme the sting bitter tortures euen before we are sentenced for hell make vs to be wofull wretches
adde hereunto that which is the hight of shame the depth of paine were no body priuie to our sinnes but our selues the knowledge of them wil confound vs but when they become knowne to others if they be but men sinners like our selues and therefore more likely to be temperate in their censure the shame groweth double

but how manifold then will it be when the angels shall bee witnesses to it the holy angels whose puritie will the more illustrate it nay god himselfe whose image wee should beare and to whom how vnlike we are his presence wil make most manifest so that our shame will bee out of measure shamefull
our paine will bee no lesse painefull for here in this world the remorse of sinne euen in those that haue not a seared conscience is many wayes delayed in sleepe by feasts with companie many other outward helps but especially the putting farre off the euill day and the weake information that our distracted vnderstanding giueth our heart and the hardnesse that doth benumme the senses thereof all these more or lesse doe mitigate our paine
but after death these lenitiues are withdrawen from vs our eyes will be kept waking our stomacke fasting our friends farre from vs our wits that were wise to doe euill and to doe good had no vnderstanding at all shall then be wise onely to know our euill but good of ours it shall haue none at all to know and our heart was neuer so waxie to be wrought pleasurably with sinne as it shall bee feeling when it is affected with all kind of woe this is our condition after death and such is the iudgement where at we must appeare euen the first iudgement

though they would not hold an absolute imortalitie of their soule yet for a time till the day of resurrection they dreamt their soules should bee as senslesse as their bodies but it was but the diuels sophistrie to comfort the wicked with a soules sleepe from the houre of death vntill the generall assises of the world as hee did with hope of a generall pardon after some yeares of torment which made origen to thinke that at length the diuels themselues should be released from paine
but blessed apostle belieue thee wil not flatter my self do not more certainly expect death then doe looke instantly thereupon to come before my iudge know that there is a iudgement before a iudgement a priuate before the publike belieue as truly that euen now diues burneth in hell as that lazarus is in abrahams bosome and doe no more doubt that iudas went to his owne place then that the good thiefe was that day with christ in paradise no sooner doth the soule leaue the body but god doth dispose it to rest and paine

euer liuing god vnpartiall iudge both of quicke and dead thy decree is past vpon my life for my arraignment am here but a soiournour and yet accomptable for what so euer doe here
let not this decree be vnknowne passe vnregarded of me if health if prosperitie promise a longer terme a carelesse life let me trie their perswasion by thy infallible word
for there shall learne that heauen and earth shall passe the greater how much more this litle heauen and earth of mine and that thy word onely endureth for euer
yea see that all things come to an end but thy commandement is exceeding broad and it is this commandement that thou hast laid vpon my bodie and laid vpon my soule a heauie commandement that sounds nothing but that which is vnsauorie to flesh and bloud
death vnsauorie but iudgement much more skin for skin and all that euer a man hath hee will giue for his life but life it selfe who would not part with that he might bee free from iudgement my soule and body are loth to part but much more loth to appeare before thee it is grieuous to forgoe that which loue but to feele that which feare is much more grieuous if die want what would haue but if come to iudgement then must indure that which abhorre death ends the pleasure which take in life but iudgement reckoneth for the inordinatnesse thereof
and it is a double griefe to be so stripped to bee so tried but what shall doe thy word must stand and seeing it must stand let me not doubt let me not neglect let those two be euer before mine eyes let me vse this world as if vsed it not seeing the fashion therof doth passe away and change faster then it
the little world hast thou proposed as a glasse wherin we may behold what will become of the great world both appeare subiect vnto vanitie thou hast subiected both the frame of both must be dissolued so deepely is sinne rooted in either that nothing can extirpate it but the dissolution of the whole
but the case of the greater world is better then that of the little that is dissolued but this must be arraigned also arraigned for it selfe arraigned for the great world also if that haue any euill it hath it from man man infected it and it is dissolued because of man but man for himselfe his owne sinne maketh himselfe and others mortall also good reason

that he which hath baned the world so ruined the frame of all gods creatures should account for it vnto the owner therof
if a subiect trespasse against the king or his image the law doth challenge him it calleth for an amends and can the king of heauen and earth be wronged in his creatures be wronged in his owne image and not challenge the offender no lord there is great reason as for man to die that hath made all things mortall so for man to bee iudged that hath done it by sinne no reason that other things should suffer and he scape nay great reason why the blame of all should bee laid vpon him
he deseruedly must be exposed to shame and blush for whatsoeuer himselfe hath deformed and what hee hath made to groane hee must sigh for it
the maske must be plucked off where vnder in this life wee hide our selues and our sense must be rectified wherewith in this world wee excuse our selues we that would not iudge our selues must be iudged of the lord
and his iudgement shall bee without respect of persons this iudge standeth at the doore his assizes are proclaimed no sooner are we quickned but wee are informed of death and iudgement no sooner come we out four mothers wombe but we witnes our knowledge thereof euerie day of ourlife is a citation day
but as it wanteth not a date so it prefixeth not a day euerie one must dye once but the time of his death no man knoweth euerie man must be iudged no man knoweth how soone
this vncertainety maketh death and iudgement more terrible
and it should make vs more watchfull watchfull for that which we are sure will come but when it will come wee are vnsure when it commeth it is fearefull but it commeth suddainely
did it concerne my temporall state would take great care if the of the house knew when the theife would come he would surely watch and not suffer his house to bee surprised and care wee more for our goods then for our selues for that which may be repaired then for that which being past hath no recouerie so senslesse are we so vsually are we
let it not be so with me lord let me euer meditate vpon death and let me euer be prouided for iudgement

before sicknesse prouide physicke and righteousnesse before iudgement

a meditation vpon philippians
verse
epigraph christ is to me life and death is to mee aduantage

haue beene at mount sinai haue heard the thunder haue seene the lightning haue felt the shaking thereof it hath put mee in mind of my mortalitie at it haue learned what it is to bee arraigned before my iudge
were there no other hill were in wofull case woe is mee if haue no succour against death which cannot auoid against iudgement which is so strict
but blessed be god haue a succour though god bring mee to sinai in my passage out of egypt yet is it not his pleasure that should stay there the cloud is risen and goeth before me will vp will follow it and see it bringeth me to another hill it resteth me vpon mount sion no sooner lift vp mine eies vnto that hill but from thence commeth my saluation
and no maruell that hill is the hill of the lord it is lifted vp aboue all hils the hill of mercie is higher then the hill of iudgement there the punishing angell that with his sword drawne pursueth the sinnes of men is commanded for to sheath it
it is hieusalem indeed the uision of peace there is the altar there is the sacrifice whereat god will be worshipped wherewith he will be pacified
yea where abraham shall haue his jsaac redeemed and a father greater then abraham will giue a sonne dearer then isaac that isaac may liue and indeed to bee an isaac that is a matter of true gladnesse vnto abraham
there dauid shall find a truer dauid dauid out of loue to his people would haue yeilded his life to end their plagues but he findeth there a dauid that is more louing and more beloued and which indeed there doth what dauid was but willing to doe but was willing in vaine for no man can by any meanes redeeme his brother or giue a ransome to god

for him
no man if he be no more then a man can doe it it is a worke of god of dauids lord he it is that is the resurrection and the life it is his bloud that speaketh better things then the bloud of abel abels bloud called for vengeance euen the vengeance of eternall death and so doth all sinne which shed the bloud of a more righteous one then abel euen the bloud of christ himselfe it should call for vengeance vnto god
but see how the voice thereof is changed and how christ excuseth sinne before hee sacrifice for sinne father forgiue them they know not what they doe euen in the act of his passion he maketh this intercession when hee felt their wrongs see how he excuseth them to his father that they may find mercie hee pleadeth for them that they doe it ignorantly
how much more did hee in his oblation for sinne speake for remission of sinnes when in his passion hee was so indulgent vnto sinners this person doe find on this hill and find him able and readie to calme all the stormes that were raised in me at mount sinai
the storme of death the storme of iudgement for must die feare it not am assured of life christ is to mee life
is death the gate that leadeth to iudgement will enter it it shall turne vnto my gaine for the tribunall of god is but the theater whereon shall bee crowned
yea christ hath so altered both death and iudgement that well may say perijssem nisi perijssem had neuer tasted of such a life had not beene subiected vnto death
and how much of my glorie should haue lost if should neuer haue beene brought vnto gods barre how wonderfull is thy vertue what strange effects proceed from thee the alchymists boast much of their skill that they can turne baser metals into better lead into copper into gold but this is their presumption whereupon they build· that these baser metals are in their nature in the way to the better and they doe but perfect that which is imperfect and which by the course of nature of imperfect would haue become perfect if they had nouer laboured it
but they neuer aduenture to turne drosse into siluer or dirt into gold
thou dost more much more of so base a one as am for who is more base then a sinner who is indeed seruus seruorum a slaue of slaues for sinne is nothing but seruitude and the

master whom a sinner serueth who is it but the deuill then whom there is none more slauish of so base a one thou makest a vessell of gold euen where there was no disposition to become such thou hast giuen so excellent a nature and makest death to become life
thou hast quickned me which was dead that was dead in sinne am quickned by thee the fountaine of grace my vnderstanding liueth my will liueth my affections liue they liue their true life they know god they loue god they long after him they discouer the euill of sinne they hate it because it is euill and what they hate that they abhorre
are not these euidences of life cannot be dead so long as feele these things in mee
feele them in me but confesse they spring not from mee they haue a better fountaine that is christ he is this life of mine it began in him when he became one with mee by his personall vnion then the vnderstanding then the will the affections of man which had beene long dead began to liue
as this began in part when christ became one with mee by personall vnion so did it streame forth into me when became one with him by mysticall vnion then the beames of his light cleared my darknesse the comfort of his heate warmed my chilnes then was quickned by the influence of his life
doe not count that life which liued before though it goe for such with men and it seemed such to me
thought as the world thinketh that if my soule dwelt in my bodie was aliue but alas if christ be from my soule my soule is dead and how can a dead soule quicken my bodie the bodie of a man of such a man as should bee of the same societie with angels well may it make my bodie vegetable and so range it with the planets and yet therein shall come short of many of them
it may doe more my bodie by it may become sensible and may be of the condition of beasts and yet therein how many of them will ouermatch me happily or vnhappily rather it may boast of more it may boast that it maketh me reasonable and indeed such faculties haue but corrupt in that haue a reasonable soule
but this aduanceth me no higher then deuils and herein the deuils incomparably surmount me
but that life which is the chiefe life the life which is proper to the children of god liue not

except liue by christ and if once liue that life liue indeed
and heare a paradoxe desire to die this life maketh mee most desirous of death of any death sauing that which is opposite to this life would not die the death in sinne but the other death will die most gladly
would be dissolued would lay aside this tabernacle of my bodie
not that grace maketh me vnnaturall to my flesh no it maketh mee loue my flesh the more the more but the more truly
would haue my bodie doe aswell as my soule and therefore mortifie it that it may bee holy as my soule is holy
flesh and bloud thinketh that fasting and watching and other castigation of the flesh is a hatefull austeritie of the soule but well may the soule replie castigo non quod odio habeam sed quod amem and though this chastisement seeme not for the present to bee ioyous but grieuous yet afterward it yeildeth the peaceable fruit of righteousnesse vnto them which are exercised thereby
see a great gaine in this death by it which serued god at first only in the law of mind come thereby to serue god also by the same law working in my members
somthing get by it but not so much as would for my mortification leaueth too much life in my flesh and the old man is too strong irrecouerably to die by my strokes
therefore what cannot doe should not be glad when god is pleased to doe it pleased so to dissolue this bodie of sinne that it may cease from sinning yea be brought to that case that it may be fit for a glorious resurrection
and is not this a great gaine the happiest seed time that promiseth the best haruest that euer man can looke for when die sowe my bodie in corruption but when rise reape the same bodie againe in incorruption when die sow my bodie in weaknesse when rise reape it againe in power when die sow my bodie in dishonour when rise reap it againe in honour finally when die sowe it a naturall bodie but when rise reape it a spirituall
and is not this gaine and this is the gaine of death
foolish were that husbandman that would spare his seed and lose his haruest but much more foolish were if should bee vnwilling to die that know death is the seed of such a resurrection
you see what my bodie gaineth by death my soule gaineth much more the grace haue doth but set an edge vpon the desire of that shall

haue and hope deferred is the languishing of the soule but a desire accomplished is as a tree of life
if delight to behold christ in the looking glasse to heare him in the riddle of his word how shall bee rauished with him when shall see him face to face and heare him speake without parables

my soule when thou thinkest hereon canst thou do lesse then break forth into saint pauls words desire to be dissolued and to bee with christ which is much better for mee it is good confesse to bee in the kingdome of grace but much better to be in the kingdome of glorie
suffer mee sweet iesu to desire the best know the best should bee the vpshot of my desires
heare king dauid say how plentifull is thy goodnes which thou hast laid vp for all them that feare thee and that thou hast prepared for them that trust in thee before the sonnes of men
lord hunger thirst for these things to bee satisfied with the fatnesse of thy house would drinke my fill out of the riuers of thy pleasures
and seeing my soule cannot come to these except it come to thee for the good of my soule desire for a time to bee freed from my bodie that my soule may attaine that blessednesse by which my bodie also in her due time shall be more blessed
if my bodie gaine and my soule gaine when death putteth them so asunder how great will the gaine be when after death they shall both conioyne their gaines together and each shall communicate his good vnto the other when death approacheth mee it shall not be accounted either a thiese or a murtherer
let wicked men who haue their portion in this life and beyond this life expect no other good so account of death
and well they may for it robbeth them of all that they account good and bereaues them of that which they account life
but death cannot deale so with mee for it hath no power ouer my goods and ouer my life lose nothing but that which am willing to leaue
will at all times leaue the flesh pots of egypt to bee fed with manna and forsake the muddie waters of nilus to drinke of that water that streamed from the rocke it shall neuer grieue me to change the food of men for angels food
and for this mortall life why should it bee pretious vnto me that hindreth mee from that which is immortall no let this life die that death may be my entrance

into that life that life which is indeed life the life of saints yea the life of god
by death gaine this life because by death come to christ who by grace is my life here and when die will be my life of glorie

the yong mans meditation vpon death grounded vpon wisdome
verses
epigraph

though the righteous be preuented with death yet shall he bee in rest
for honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time nor that is measured by number of yeares
but wisdome is the gray haire vnto men and an vnspotted life is old age
he pleased god and was beloued of him so that liuing amongst sinners he was translated
yea speedily was he taken away lest that wickednesse should alter his vnderstanding or deceit beguile his soule

we would be immortall wee cannot be all sinners are doomed to die yet of a mortall life who doth not desire the longest tearme who would haue his spring to proue his autumne and be gathered before he is ripe it is vnpleasing enough to nature that it must bee dissolued but then to bee dissolued when soule and bodie begin each most comfortably to enioy the other must needs be most bitter
it is now my case in the quicknesse of my sense must taste of that potion mine eies must be closed when they doe but begin to iudge of colours and my eares doe but begin to iudge of sounds and they must be shut vp also my pallat hath but tasted and set an edge vpon my desire and must away and leaue these delicates to others others must enioy whatsoeuer worldly thing haue and the wormes must enioy me enioy my bodie
and for

my soule scarce hath it beene initiated with knowledge after which it thirsteth naturally scarce hath it giuen proofe of her vertue wherein it delighteth principally but am taken from this schoole wherein thought to prooue wise from this theater whereon hoped to bee exemplarie but vnlearned as am and vnrenowned must yeild and my name must be buried with my coarse
what shall say to all this and against this euill what is my comfort surely must calculate mine age a new and iudge better of gods intent herein
gods kalender is not like mans a thousand yeares to him are but as one day and one day to him as a thousand yeares
let a wicked man liue a thousand yeares because he is a wicked man his thousand yeares are but a day nay the worst part of a day that is the night for the euening and the morning did make the first day
let a good man liue but a day and because he is good he hath liued a thousand yeares for he is readie for god and the longest time of our pilgrimage if it be methusalems age it can but make vs readie
will then enquire not how many dayes haue spent but how much haue profited profited in the waies of god
and haue profited so farre as to acknowledge that of my selfe am but an vnprofitable seruant what should cannot doe but doe that which should not so that if guesse at my readinesse by mine owne worth am most vnreadie
but haue another valuation by my being in christ my faith is stedfast in him my hope hath cast an anchor in heauen feare not gods iudgement against which my faith doth hearten mee expect a kingdome which my hope doth promise mee and as for my loue though the world doth wooe me and my flesh doth often yeild to dally there with yet hath it none to whom it is deuoted with whom it is contented in comparison of god
and what greater readinesse can desire my audit is made my arrerage paid haue a quietus est why doe feare to come to my triall nay the bargaine is made heauen is purchased for mee haue the conueyance why doe stay from taking possession am so senslesse as to affect the worse that am offered the better shall dote vpon this house of clay my youth maketh it seeme better then clay though indeed it is no better a glased pitcher

notwithstanding the lustre is but a pitcher and the verdure of youth is but a glosse set vpon a lumpe of earth cunningly wrought by the hand of the potter age that weareth that glosse will discouer this clay
and why should murmure at god that is pleased to let me see quickly what in time must needs see that am brickle
neither am onely brickle but the world is fraile also and all the things of this life whatsoeuer they promise they performe no perpetuitie to me
seing then sooner or later the world must leaue me and must leaue the world let me leaue it rather sooner then later the lesse acquaintance the lesse griefe at the parting and indeed the longer liue the more vnwilling shall be to dye
now peraduenture leaue behind me a father and a mother and leaue griefe vnto them for the losse of a child but cannot so feelingly grieue as they when depart from my parents because loue descendeth more then it ascendeth
if liue may marrie and marriage doubleth the bitternesse of death when they that of two became one by death of one are made two againe
and if god blesse me with posteritie how much more vnwilling shall bee to die how hardly shall indure to be rent from mine owne bowels say nothing to the common infirmitie of age which seemeth to haue appropriated vnto it selfe couetousnesse and who knoweth not how hardly the loue of money and death consort together but these are the weakest holdfasts that the world hath on me there are much stronger the hookes of sinne which where they catch so fasten euen vpon the will which is in it selfe most free that it maketh men desire rather to bee slaues vnto pharoah so they may feed on the flesh pots of aegypt then to endure the difficult passage into canaan though when they come there they shall be princes of a land which floweth with milke and honie
god then that knoweth what may alter me and of readie make me vnreadie dealeth more mercifully with me hee preuenteh that euill that might stay me from him and hauing prepared me calleth me vnto him

lord all seasons are in thy hand and thou hast appointed vnto me this season blesse thee for it submit my selfe to it if bee ripe in thy iudgement gather me though in mine owne iudgement am greene
and thou which feest that although

now stand yet may fall least fall take me whilst stand
it doth not grieue me am most willing to change earth for heauen to haue those windowes of my senses all broken downe that my soule may be at libertie hauing no agent for the world to sollicite me from god shall more freely more fully giue my selfe vnto him my vnderstanding to know him my heart to loue him and more shall learne in one daies sight of god then in many thousand yeares could haue gathered out of the glasse of the world or riddle of the scripture
and how base spectators are men on earth in comparison of the saints in heauen who shall witnesse my seruice and behold my glorie doe loue my parents goe to better my best father is in heauen and my best mother is hierusalem aboue the ioy that foretaste for seeing them maketh me insensible of the heauie farewell take of these
am not moued with their wealth which they haue stored vp for me and the land which they haue purchased is as nothing in mine eyes shall haue a more induring substance a lot is fallen vnto me in a more pleasant place haue a more goodly heritage
and why the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup the lord maintaines my lot
lord then teach me so to number my daies that may measure them by righteousnesse and let me so interpret this thy summons by death as a warning to take shelter before a storme
hasten me on by grace that be not long on my way to heauen and in my way lest decline shorten more and more my passage so shall be as willing in this morning of my age as should be in the euening thereof to change my state and come to thee to passe from earth to heauen



the old mans meditation
psalme
ver
epigraph with long life will satisfie him and shew him my saluation

everie man if a child of god is a double man and so leadeth a double life and longeth for a double good a corporall a spirituall that hee may hold out long in regard of the life of nature and withall be ponest of the life of grace
thus doubly happie would euerie one be but it is not the portion of euerie one
many haue shortned either the one life or the other if they haue liued vnto god their dayes in the world haue beene but few and of those which haue liued many dayes in the world how few of them haue they liued to god my soule then how blest art thou whom god hath blessed both wayes blest thee in thy naturall life thou art growne till thou art ripe blest thee in thy spirituall life thy eyes haue seene the saluation of god
the greatest blessing that god bestoweth vpon earth he hath bestowed on thee thou hast experienced the truth of the apostles speech pietie hath the promise of this life and of that which is to come
for this life god hath bestowed vpon thee length of dayes thy time is not reckoned by nights but by dayes
and some men that liue long all their life long neuer see the sunne their time is night it is an vncomfortable time
no sense hath his contenting obiect they are all couered with darknesse yea and if it be a waking night insteed of contenting euerie sense is haunted with discontenting obiects
such nights doe many liue in this world which haue presented vnto them many and at whose eares doe enter many sounds whose perfumes are the damps of prisons whose bed is little case whose sustenance is the bread and water of affliction whose robes are fetters and manicles finally whose consorts are wretches no lesse forlorne then themselues
such a night

how many liue yea of what length are such nights of theirs but lord thou hast vouchsafed my life to bee a day the sun is vp to me and haue the pleasure of beholding the light my eye wanteth not content my eare hath her pleasures and euerie sense is cherished according to his kind
haue not beene pinched with famine haue not been consumed with sicknesse theeues haue not spoyled me haue not beene exposed to the tyrannie of malice my life hath beene a day yea many dayes for my prosperitie hath not beene like the good day of an aguish man which hath been succeeded with painfull fits but euerie day hath beene a day the sunne hath not set the clouds haue not the sunne so that all my whole life seemeth to haue beene but one day
but there are winter dayes and summer dayes short and long
it had beene well if my life had onely beene a day though that had beene but a winters day at least manie winter dayes
but to haue my day yea my dayes and haue them at length how much better doth it make my state in a winter day as the sunne stayeth not long so it warmeth not much but in a summer day the longer it staieth the more it warmeth then my length of daies are attended with the warmth of daies and to haue both length and warmth what more can a man desire for this life yes a man would haue the stinting of them hee would not haue them end vntill himselfe say enough
and so farre hath gods mercie gone with me he hath satisfied me neuer had my appetite satisfied more to the full with the most delicate meates then my heart is sariat with my daies
it is enough lord now let me die
but forget thou hast done much for me in my naturall life how much more hast thou done for me in my spirituall my spirituall life also hath beene a day it hath beene say a day and no night
the soule hath a night no lesse then the bodie and much heauier is the night of the soule then that of the bodie the darknesse is more vncomfortable the terrors thereof are more intollerable
how vncomfortable is it for a man who naturally desireth to be happie to be ignorant both where hee must seeke it and how he must come at it and so to wander all the daies of his life in vanitie and did he walke onely in uanitie the discomfort were not small for it is no small discomfort

still to hope and yet still to haue his hope faile
but for a man to haue vexation of spirit added vnto vanitie whereas we abhorre nothing more then miserie out of the guilt of conscience to be harrowed with the of eternall miserie how intollerable is this how vncomfortable how tedious is this spirituall night or rather how desireable how comfortable is that day which hath freed me from that night was in it was borne borne in it for lord no man commeth out of his mothers wombe but he is borne in the night and the day doth not dawne to him vntill he is out of the churches wombe
therefore doe the ancients fidy call baptisme undefined span alphabet illumination because then he that commaunded light to shine out of darknesse doth shine vnto vs in the face of iesus christ and we are translated out of darknesse into his marueilous light
it is my blessing that am light in the lord made light not light of my selfe but illightned by him
lord if thou hadst not illightned me could neuer haue seene thou that restoredst his sight that was borne blind corporally hast wrought a greater miracle in restoring my sight that was borne blind spiritually
let others boast in whole or in part of the strength of nature doe wil confesse that the eyes of my mind are a gift of grace these eyes that see that which see and cannot but be blest in seeing it in seeing gods saluation a blessed sight that discouers that obiect
how glad was abraham when he saw the ramme which was an exchange for isaac his sonne how glad was hagar when shee saw the fountaine wherewith shee refreshed both her selfe and her babe and were they glad at the sight of these things how glad then should be that see a lambe the lambe of god that offereth himselfe to be a ransome for me how glad should bee that see the well the well of liuing waters which onely can quench my thirst isaacs danger was nothing to mine well might his soule for a time bee parted from his bodie both were to goe to a blessed rest but my danger was that soule and bodie both must haue burned euerlastingly in hell
hagars thirst was nothing to my thirst shee trauelled in the hot sands and in the middest of many tyring sinnes no corporall paine can so spend our spirits as the conflicts doe of a troubled soule
how willingly then

doe behold the lambe behold the water euen the lambe and water that are my iesus
many saluations there are but no saluations of god but in him there is no name vnder heauen giuen by which we may be saued but onely the name of iesus he is indeed a diuine sauiour the highest degree of saluation is placed in him
let others make their peace by other meanes will be ransommed onely by this lambe let others quench their thirst in puddle streames will drinke at this well this saluation of god which god hath made me see
for lord thou hast not dealt with me as thou diddest with moses to whom thou shewedst from mount nebo the land of canaan but sufferedst him not to enter in what thou hast shewed me thou bestowest vpon me and hee that hath eyes to behold thy saluation by seeing doth enioy the same
it is not so true in nature as in grace intellectus fit omnia certainely this is euerlasting life euen to know thee to be the onely god and whom thou hast sent our sauiour iesus christ for by beholding with open face this thy saluation we are changed into the same image from saluation to saluation by the spirit of christ
lord that art pleased should liue blesse thee for that my time hath not beene night but day euen summers daies long and warme cheerefull and fruitfull
but the day of my soule hath beene much better then the day of my bodie seeing the sunne of righteousnesse hath also risen vnto me who hath so illighned me that hee hath discouered thy saluation to me
that saluation which freeth me from all feare and supplieth vnto me all that want my eyes are vpon both yea my selfe is possest of both
and what couldest thou haue done for me lord which thou hast not done that hast blest me so corporally that hast blest me so spiritually haue no more to expect in this life and therefore willingly surrender it to thee this bodie this soule hoping that both shall turne their length into eternitie and their daies shall bee yet much more cleare and much more warme where god is the sun and both light and heat are such as proceed from that sunne

heare my prayer lord and giue eare vnto my erie hold not thy peace at my teares for am a stranger with thee and a soiourner as all my fathers were

spare me that may recouer my strength before hence and be no more seene

lord am mortall see it feele it but it is thou that hast cleared mine eyes and quickned my sense which otherwise are to dimme and dull to read or acknowledge what notwithstanding beare engrauen in capitall letters and the condition of my nature maketh palpable
yea so are my senses taken vp with other obiects and so little am willing to know that whereof if be not willingly blind cannot be ignorant that except thou hadst rowsed me and thy afflicting hand stung me should certainely haue beene both deafe and dumbe should not haue heard thee neither shouldest thou haue heard from me
but lord the bitter potion that haue taken from thy hand hath wrought thus farre as to make mee confesse that it is too hard to be digested by me if thou doe not delay it must needs perish by it
yet lord know that it is not the end whereat thou aymest thou meanest not to take me out but weane me from the world
this vse if make of thy rod thou wilt quickly giue ouer to lay on stripes
haue made this vse now doe better know my selfe
liued before as if were not onely in but also of the world vsed not the things of this world but enioyed them rather
now find that haue here no abiding place am but a soiourner a tenement haue here but no the goods that haue account them not mine otherwise then by loane and therefore am as readie to leaue them as haue an vncertaine title to them
and if am but a soiourner in this place must

needs be a stranger to the personnes little commerce with them little affection towards them haue
and why should haue more seeing they will haue little with me and beare little towards mee am crucified to the world and the world is crucified to me weedes grow neere the corne and corne neere the weeds but yet the neerenesse is not without a strangnesse for neither doe their rootes sucke the same iuice in the ground neither aboue ground doe their stalkes beare the same fruit euen so thy children lord that cohabit with the children of this world neither inwardly nor outwardly liue by nor walke with the same spirit which the worldlings haue
my roote is in heauen and my fruit heauenly
am transplanted from the wild oliue into the true and grow no more in the fields but in the paradise of god
neither is this my single condition haue it common with my fathers am their heire and their inheritance is descended vnto me what they were not desire not to be neither would be more inward with the world then they desired to be
happily flesh and bloud may suppose that it hath a greater interest in things of this life and neerer cognation with the men of this world but it is a supposall of flesh and bloud
make it not the iudge of my state neither according to it do esteeme my selfe haue better parentage and better can proue my pedigree· acknowledge none for my fathers that had their portion in this life from them descended that vsed the world as if they vsed it not and walked with thee with those pilgrims professe my selfe a pilgrim and my life but the life of a man that is on his way to the holy land
therefore as they so desire not to bee surcharged with earthly things neither to surfeit on the vanities of this life desire to liue but it is that may keepe on my way to haue the things of this life but no farther then they are necessarie for my iournie haue enough if haue enough to doe this measure vnto me so much and so temper my crosse that may not come short of this
desire not to be immortall in a state of mortalitie farre be that from the heart of thy seruant onely let me not bee to my iournie so long as am fit to walke therein and to walke towards thee
forbeare to sowre my life and make bitter my daies would

serue thee cheerefully would serue thee couragiously deiect me not enfeeble me not let not thy heauie hand ouerwhelme me with heauinesse of heart neither let thy punishing hand enfeeble my fainting spirits
it is not long desire to liue neither is it continuall ease that affect
know that the later is not safe too much ease is the bane of pietie and more haue gone to heauen from the racke then from their
and as for the former it is against the decree thou hast made our daies but a span long and the time of our pilgrimage is but a moment scarce worthie the name of time
what then is my desire that of this little thou shouldest affoord me a little a little breathing before breath out my last
let me be a while what before long must cease to bee a vigorous pilgrim let me walke strongly that before long shall not be able to walke at all let me foretaste heauen on earth and trie me with the vse of earth how much preferre heauen before it
if thou continually affright my conscience with the horror of sinne if thou daily for sinne afflict my bodie if thou put no end to the malice of men and if thou cloud the state of thy seruant with incessant disgrace how shall so forlorne a wretch so distressed a caitife not be with dispaire and proue restiue in my way how shall inwardly or outwardly mind my countrie and reioyce in my hopes these things would doe but by reason of my paine cannot doe
what remaineth then but that desire release and thou denie not my desire make my suite as one that desireth to speed passionately feelingly but my prayer is a crie and my crie is powred forth not onely by my tongue but also by mine eyes
behold lord a true penitent whose voice is not onely verball but reall and canst thou stop thine eares against such words can thy relieuing hand forbeare to succor when it is importuned by such deeds thou that hast opened my mouth vouchsafe to open thine owne eares and let the fountaine of mercifull comfort streame downe vpon him from whose eyes thou hast drawne flouds of teares speake comfortably to him that speaketh penitently to thee and deale graciously with him that prostrateth himselfe humbly before thee
so shall willingly be a soiourner in earth that may be a citizen

of heauen a stranger to the world that may be a friend of god the ease that thou giuest me shall encourage me in thy seruice and will liue so heare as hee that shall not liue long
and because shall when death commeth bee no more a mortall though neuer so worldly a happie man will endeauour that may be by thy grace an immortall an eternall blessed saint

god thou art my god early will seeke thee my soule thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a barren and wearisome land where no water is

so haue appeared before thee in thy sanctuarie that might see thy power and glorie

lord want seeke reliefe to whom shall come but vnto god and with thee dare be bold thou art my god there is store in god and my want cannot be relieued but by his store
am in a wildernesse for what is this world but a wildernesse nay my selfe am a wildernesse what is a wildernesse but a drie earth which tireth those that passe through it and what is the cause it hath no water no water to quench the traueilers thirst no water to make fruitfull the soile that it may beare foode to sustaine his hunger no water which may inable the earth to become greene or be imbellished with flowers the sight wherof may ease the wearisomnesse of the traueller that languisheth and fainteth through thirst and hunger
this is the state of a wildernesse and in such a wildernesse am drie and wearie no moysture no strength and why haue no fountaine haue spent that moysture which receiued from thee
thou madest me a greene tree but am become drie withered no fruit no leaues no sap as farre spent as was the prodigall sonne and all by sinne
and yet sinne doth not leaue me it

turmoiles me still and my bloud being spent my spirits wasted the bloud and spirits of grace and goodnesse now faint now am wearie
and gladly would recouer some strength euen as gladly as the prodigall child would haue fed vpon huskes but he found none that gaue him
and here in my wildernesse find no waters except they be the waters of marah so bitter they cannot be drunke or of iericho so bad that they will make the land barren of such waters haue springs enough
euerie outward sense and euerie inward my vnderstanding my will are fountaines of such waters fountaines that streame forth and moisten my whole man yea and turne the whole man into a dead sea
this goodly as it were garden of the lord which was set euerie where with trees of life meane my bodie and soule inwardly and outwardly representing the image of god what are they now but euen as the dead sea and what are all the fruites thereof but euen as sodome want not waters then but sweete waters the want of them maketh me a wildernesse fruitlesse and yet fruitfull fruitfull in rootes of bitternesse in thistles in briers the fruits of a cursed soile
but fruitlesse am in whom groweth neither the lilly nor the rose neither is my life innocent nor my heart patient am as indisposed to suffer for as to doing well
but as for these better plants the vine that cherisheth god and man the oliue by which they are honoured both and the sweete figtree that groweth in paradise they grow not in my soile drie soile that hath no sap of that kind
and yet a soile in husbanding whereof tire my selfe and therefore well may call it a wearisome soile all the fruit it beareth is but vanitie of vanities and all my comfort is but vexation of spirit
seeing this is my case where lies my comfort the comfort of my soule the comfort of my bodie both are a wildernesse
but neither would bee so the thirst of my soule the desire of my flesh my drie my tired soule and flesh speake their wants and speake more audibly then can my words what want what beg
the thirst is mine but that thirst it is thy gift lord the desire is mine but that doe desire lord it commeth of grace it is thy holy spirit that teacheth me this language which can be learned in

no other schoole
and why lord hast thou taught it me is it not because should speake to thee that my drougth should speake my wearinesse should crie that both should aske of the lord raine for with thee is the well of liuing waters it is thou that turnest a wildernesse into a standing water and drie ground into water springs
vnto thee then come lord that onely art able to relieue me because thou art a god of power and no lesse willing then able because thou art my powerfull god
euen thou god that art three in one and one in three god the father come to thee and in the bowels of a father thou canst not reiect me thou art my god haue no other god then hee that is my father
god the sonne come to thee thou canst not refuse him whom thou hast made thy brother thou art my god haue no other god then hee that is my sauiour
holy ghost come to thee wilt thou despise him whose comforter thou hast vouchsafed to bee thou art my god haue none other god then he that is my comforter
a threefold cord cannot be broken and how should faile that haue this threefold stay let me be a wildernesse a drie a wearisome wildernesse was it not this god that of the chaos vnshapen and emptie chaos made this solid this beautifull fabricke of the world and cannot be transforme my wildernesse into a paradise yea the waters of the sanctuarie no sooner entred the dead sea but they became liuing waters all things presently liued in it and the tree of life grew plenteously all along the bankes of it
therein what dost thou shew lord but how powerfull thy grace is and what an alteration it can worke in me acknowledge this and lord let me feele that truth which acknowledge make hast to moisten him that early seeketh to thee
should haue sought vnto thee in the morning of my age and happie had beene if had so timely sought vnto thee had not so long continued in the wildernesse yea the trees which now scarce blossome would then haue beene loaden with ripe fruit the seed which is now scarce in the blade would haue shot an eare and beene white for haruest
but lord that neglected that morning to testifie my griefe therefore take holdfast of another morning as much as can

redeeme the time the day hath dawned suffer not the sunne to shine in vaine so soone as can see my way take my way to thee come earely would speed betimes
see lord my desire in my haste and lord let thy grace hasten like my desire yea preuent my desire who cannot desire so timely as would
onely lord take notice of my day and would not haue it spent in vaine turne my morning into let the sunne of righteousnesse ascend vnto his greatest highth but proportion my desire to thy light and let mee so beginne betimes as that perseuere vnto the ende let my later workes bee better then my first let my motions bee not violent which slacken as they goe on and are weakest in in the end but let them be naturall yea supernaturall motions let them increase as they goe on and the neerer my race draweth to an end the hotter let my zeale bee towards god
let me thirst the more let me the more desire those waters that moysten my drougth and refresh my wearinesse so let me appeare before thee
but where art thou in thy sanctuarie thy holy place
how reuerent is that place and how vnfit am to bee seene there is that a place for a wildernesse paradise is a better obiect of the eyes of god where god may see all that he hath made and see it good and blesse it being so but sinne hath no place in paradise gods eyes cannot endure it yea therefore were the cherubins set with the flaming sword that sinners might not approach the place of god
how senslesse then am that being such as am dare approach the place of god being such as it is true lord am senslesse indeed if come onely as a drie as a thirstie land such an obiect is not for the holy eyes of god it is not to approach his presence
but if the drie land bee also thirstie then thou callest ho all yee that thirst come yee to the waters and he that hath no money buy and eat yea come buy wine and milke without money and without price
if the barren land be wearie thou callest lord come vnto mee all that labour and are heauie loaden will ease you will giue you rest
seeing this thirst this desire is acceptable vnto god euen where there wanteth the fatnesse and fruitfulnesse of good workes and god whose throne is heauen

and whose footestoole is the earth will looke to that man euen to him that is poore and of a contrite heart though want righteousnesse yet because hunger and thirst after it am not afraid to be seene in the sanctuarie of god yea in the sanctuarie to looke vpon god
for know what he will shew vnto me euen his power and glorie hee will shew them both to me nay he will shew them both on me his power that shall worke on me and his glorie that shall crowne me
he will make me as a water garden and plant me with most generous plants by his power that so may flourish and bee comly in the eyes both of angels and men
yea god will shew his power and god will giue me glorie that my eyes beholding them my mouth may speake of them speake of the workes of god and tell what he hath done for my bodie and for my soule
lord other creatures partake thy power partake thy glorie but all doe not see it wee that are indued with reason not onely haue them but perceiue them and it is our happinesse that we know what blessings wee haue
lord let me neuer be so stupid as not to behold thy mercies and when doe behold them let mee also feele how blessed am whom thou vouchsafest to possesse them so shall more and more confesse that thou lord art my god and being my god shall make haste to thee my soule shall make haste and so shall my bodie also my drie and wearie bodie and soule shall goe out of this world wherein there are no springs of life and thirstie and longing as they are they shall approach thy sanctuarie and there lord let them see not onely feele thy power thy glorie quenching my thirst and satisfying my desire

who knoweth the power of thine anger euen according to thy feare so is thy wrath

so teach vs to number our dayes that wee may applie our hearts vnto wisedome

the first part

sinne and wrath by nature should go hand in hand and as deepe as we plunge our selues in to sin so deepe should we sinke in wrath
wee should if iustice measured vnto vs as we deserue but mercie hath prouided better for vs and god is pleased to proportion the smart of stripes to the feare which we haue of them the lesse feare the more smart and the lesse smart the more we feare
thou hast left it lord in the power of a sinner how farre thou shalt take vengeance of his sinne
let the law speake neuer so terribly let sinne offend neuer so grieuously let the curses be neuer so many let the plagues be neuer so manifold yea let thy countenance be with neuer so thicke a cloud let the burning coales that are kindled by thy wrath be neuer so scorching rore the waues of thy indignation neuer so hideously and bee the of thy wrath neuer so tempestuous feare onely feare the feare of a penitent soule that trembles at the voice of thy law that melteth at the sight of thy iudgements that accuseth it selfe that condemeth it selfe that is readie to ioyne with god to doe iustice vpon its sinfull selfe this feare say that least armeth it selfe against god is best armed and preuailes best by stooping most
and this is powerfull weakenesse a conquering captiuitie a match that for which we can otherwise find no match
this power lord hast thou giuen to repentant feare a blessed power and yet there are few that vse it though all doe stand in neede

of it
and why who armes himselfe against that whereof he hath no regard men sinne but little doe they thinke that their sinnes offend god and if they offend they shall be punished because god is not onely sensible of his wrongs but also iudge of our liues as he hath prescribed the precepts of his law so hath hee added sanctions thereunto and as the precept sheweth what we must doe so what he will doe we learne out of the sanction if we faile to obey thou lord wilt not faile to strike for there is wrath with thee and from thee will that wrath breake out on vs
and woe be to vs if it breake out for thy wrath god is a powerfull wrath
and indeed how can it be otherwise if it be thine who art a god of power can wee looke into thee and not apprehend almightinesse in thee but our eyes are too weake to pierce so farre happily in that that comes from thee a naturall man may behold what power there is in thee
heauen and earth are the worke of thy hands nay they are the host that attends thy person if they are mightie thou much more for what they haue thou gauest them and in proofe thereof thou takest from them at thy pleasure
as the sunne did shine first at thy command so at thy command it hath lost his light it was from thee the fire receiued his burning qualitie and when thou forbaddest it it could not burne thou madest the waters flow thou spakest but the word and they were sollid like a wall thou fixedst the globe of the earth and it stood still and when thou didst vtter thy voice it quaked it trembled for very feare when thou sendest foorth thy spirit· thou renewest the face of the earth and all things wither and returne to nothing if thou thy spirit
how powerful then art thou lord at whose command is the power of euerie creature and fighteth for thee against thine enemies the sunne can scorch them the fire consume them the aire poyson them the earth swallow them and how many spectacles haue we of such iudgements but what speake of these greater souldiers of thine and weapons of thy wrath how many beasts in the fields how many birds of the ayre how many fishes in the sea haue vndertaken gods cause against man and executed remarkable iudgements vpon sinners but doe not yet come home enough hee that readeth the

plagues of aegypt and considers what a destruction god wrought by frogs and flies and lice the least whereof wrested a submission from pharaoh and his kingdome and forced them to confesse their vnablenesse to resist can he choose but be amazed at the sight of gods power when these creatures so farre in their owne nature vnder the power of man when he commands them to be his executioners so farre ouermatch the stoutest of men but what looke without vs for the sinnewes of gods wrath what sinnewes may wee find euerie man within himselfe if god bee pleased to reward vs according to our deseruings he shall need no other we wil doe him this seruice our selues
our wits will not only faile vs but insnare vs our hearts will be so farre from eschewing that they will carrie vs headlong into all mischiefe our eyes will see fearefull visions our eares bee filled with dreadfull sounds our tongues will betray vs our feete miscarrie vs our hands offer uiolence vnto vs no power of our soule no part of our bodie wherewith we haue conceiued or acted sinne that will not lay on some deadly stroke vpon vs for sinne
but of all the souldiers of god wherin we are most feelingly to behold the power of his wrath there is none comparable to our owne conscience which laieth on so heauie a burden and peirceth with so deadly a sting that there is no man whom it cannot crush with its waight and which will not runne mad if he throughly feele the smart thereof
will not draw a man down into hell where into notwithstanding wrath will tumble sinfull man might there shew him vtter darknesse the priuation of that light which shineth in heauen vnquenchable fire in opposition to the waters of life that streame in heauen the weeping and wailing insteed of the endlesse musicke that is aboue the murmuring gnashing of teeth insteed of the triumphant songs of blessed soules finally the tormented and tormenting fiends insteed of the blessed and angels that are aboue
and what are all these but euidences of the power of gods wrath and is the power so large so palpable and yet vnknowne can it be such and yet not discerned of man if he climbe into heauen god manifesteth it there and he finds it in earth if his thoughts fal thither neither can he descend into hell but there he shal meete

it nay he must goe from himselfe or else god will force him to behold it
why then doth thy seruant moses moue this question who knoweth it is it not because men doe not heed it and so though they should yet take no notice of it and indeed lord if any be ignorant his ignorance is inexcusable and yet some such beasts rather then men are there that are willing not to know what they are not willing to regard
or if men be not so grosse as thus to winke with their eyes that they may stupifie their hearts yet do their lusts dim their sight and they see so imperfectly that they they are but weakly affected with it
hence co~meth it to passe that thy minatorie words and works stay so few from falling into sin and reclaime so few that are fallen there into they do not belieue that thou wilt strike vntill they feele thy stroakes are on them
the israelites would not as moses had good proofe for fortie yeere and wee are no better then they though our triall hath beene much onger then theirs we haue no vsefull knowledge of the wrathfull power of god
this question may well bee moued of vs euen of vs to whom god hath vouchsafed the same power ouer his wrath our little feare argueth our little knowledge and we may not thinke that we haue any true knowledge which doth not end in feare such a feare as can hold gods hand or at least moderate his stroake is the onely argument that wee haue profited in that schoole of the great and lesser world wherein we haue so full so plaine a lecture read vnto vs of the powerfull wrath of god

a meditation vpon psalme
verse

epigraph so teach vs to number our dayes that we may applie our hearts vnto wisedome

the second part
thou dost manifest thy power lord and we are the monuments of it our mortalitie is therein are grauen the capitall letters that describe thy powerfull wrath

for what is mortalitie but a reall voice in our eares or presenting rather vnto our eyes the doome of sinne thou madest vs immortall and immortalitie was a part of thy image which art eternall our time then had no terme it could not be defined by any kind of period
but sinne hath abridged what had no bounds it hath brought our life within a short compasse it is measured by dayes and dayes are· the first so the least part of time which thou hast made
and these dayes are not infinite in vaine should a man desire to number that which cannot bee numbred iacob said his dayes were few dauid that his were but a span long saint iames that no mans life is more lasting then a bubble a man would thinke a litle arithmeticke would cast vp so small an account a man seemes to need no better a master then a man for what man is he that is ignorant of this principle that man is mortall and that it cannot be long before he returne to dust
and yet moses that was learned in all the sciences of the aegyptians amongst which arithmeticke was one desireth to learn this point of arithmetick onely of thee lord why is it because as iob speaketh thou hast determined the nu~ber of his dayes would moses haue thee reueale to euerie man the moment of his end such speculations may wel beseeme an aegyptian an israelite they doe not beseeme
thy children lord know that it is not for them so to know times and seasons which thou keepest in thine owne power and are a secret sealed vp with thee we should not prie into that counting house nor curiously inquire into that summe
it is not then a mathematicall numbring of daies that moses would be schooled in but a morall he would haue god not simply to teach him to number but to number so and so points out a speciall manner a manner that may bee vsefull for the children of god
and indeed our petitions must beare this mark of profitable desires and we should not aske ought of thee but that by which if we speed wee may become the better he that so studieth his mortalitie learnes it as he should and it is onely thou lord that takest him out such a lesson
but what is the vse moses that thou wouldest haue man make of such a knowledge euen to applie his heart vnto wisedome

happie knowledge by which a man becomes wise for wisedome is the beautie of a reasonable soule god conereated him therewith
but sinne hath diuorced the soule and wisedome so that a sinfull man is indeed no better then a foole so the scripture calleth him and well may it call him so seeing all his carriage is vaine and the vpshot of his endeauours but vexation of spirit
but though sinne haue diuorced wisedome and the soule yet are they not so seuered but they may be reunited and nothing is more powerfull in furthering this vnion then this feeling meditation that wee are mortall
for who would not shake hands with the world that knows we must shortly appeare before god yea who would not prouide for that life which hath no end that seeth that this hastneth so fast vnto an end finally who would suffer the arrowes of gods wrath that summon vs vnto iudgement to passe vnregarded seeing the due regard thereof is able to turne a tribunall into a throne of grace surely affliction if we discerne the hand that infflicts it is the best schoole of wisedome yea of the best sort of wisedome the wisedome of the heart it turneth knowledge into practise and maketh vs more tender hearted then we are quicke sighted it doth not onely discerne that god is a consuming fire but melts at the very sight of him it doth not onely know that gods word is a hammer but feeleth the force thereof in a broken and contrite spirit it conceiue feares so soone as it heareth threats and is no sooner touched but it is reclaimed
and this is wisedome the true wisedome of a mortall man whose best helpe against mortalitie stands in the awful regard of gods offended fauour
seeing then lord this is the fruit of that desired knowledge and hee is best seene in the length of his dayes that is most humbled with the sense of thy wrath and he needs least to feare death that doth as hee ought most feare thee vouchsafe to bee his master that desireth to bee thy scholler and let grace teach what nature doth not discerne that moulder into dust because corrupt my selfe with sinne so shall bee wearie of my naturall folly that negotiates for death and affect true wisdome that is the tree of life with this shall endeauour to furnish not onely my

head but my heart also and that which now is the seate of shall then become the receptacle of life that life which beginnes in thy feare which is the onely of euerlasting ioy

wee are mutable and what wonder seeing we are creatures we cannot know that we were made of nothing but wee must acknowledge that to nothing we may returne againe and indeed thither we hasten if we bee left vnto our selues
for marre our selues we can but we cannot mend our selues wee can dedestroy what god hath built but we cannot repaire what we doe destroy
wretched power that is onely able to disinable vs and hath no strength but to enfeeble him whose strength it is
read of adam the first monument of this vnhappie strength but may read it in my selfe as all his sonnes inherit as his nature so this selfe ruining power
but when experience hath made me see how valiant haue been against my selfe inflicting deadly wounds precipitating my person and misguiding my steps become disconsolate and helplesse in my selfe what then shall doe to whom then shall seeke to the fiends of hell that sollicited me to sinne to the worldly vanities by which my lusts were baited well may they adde to my fall raise mee againe they cannot they will not such euill trees beare no such good fruit and if they did they would rather haue me a companion in their sinne and in their woe then seeke to free mee from or ease me in either of them
but happily the good angels as they are more able so they are more willing to pittie to relieue mee but they behold thy face lord and stirre not but when

thou sendest them and they only to whom thou sendest can be the better for them these heauenly spirits that attend thy throne moue not but at thy becke and doe no more then thou commaundest
see then that if stray it is thou that must fetch me home it is thou lord that must lift me vp when am slipt downe to the gates of death and my wounds will be incurable if thou bee not pleased to heale me
thou lord hast made me know in what case am and onely canst redresse my wofull case seeke to thee and to thee onely
to thy wisedome commend my head illighten it shew me thy way thou that of nothing madest me something vouchsafe to make me somthing that haue brought my selfe to nothing
yea worse then nothing for sinne is so it doth not onely abolish that good which thou hast giuen me but it filleth me with euill that is opposite to good yea to god
and how much better is it at all not to be then to be a sinner to bee nothing then to be a feind of hell neuer to haue seene the sunne then to bee at enmitie with god this is the state where into haue cast my selfe and thus farre haue estranged my selfe from thee
and how restlesse am vntill returne to thee lord sinne forfeits many things besides god but let a man recouer all all besides will yeeld no content except a man recouer god
and why lord thou art the soueraigne good and without thee nothing is good
if doe not partake the creature in reference to my creator well may haue it shall haue no true comfort in it
take then all from me and leaue me god though haue nothing yet shall enioy all things for god is all in all
wherefore though am sicke doe not desire health desire god and it is god that desire when am poore doe not desire wealth am senslesse of all other wants hunger and thirst onely after god
seeing then thou lord onely canst quiet canst satisfie my soule if thou vouchsafe to turne me turne me vnto thee let me not make a stand before come so far neither let me thinke my selfe recouered vntill haue recouered thee
let others rest contented with the drosse of the earth or with the pompe of this world my originall is from heauen and can find no rest vntill my affections rest there
therefore returne me vnto him from whom sinne hath estranged mee

euen to thy selfe god beg this of thee because can expect it from none but thee and from thee am sure shal not expect it in vaine
for be neuer so farre gone cannot goe out of thy reach can bee no more out of the reach of thy grace then of thy power as thou canst smite me so canst thou heale me and thou canst bring mee home as well as thou canst cast me out
lord make no doubt of the successe if thou vouchsafe thy will for lord if thou wilt thou canst make me whole onely thy power is equall to thy will and thou canst doe whatsoeuer pleaseth thee
be pleased then good lord to put to thy helping hand that thy prodigall child that by the first step of thy grace is come home to himselfe by a second step may come home to thee
desire no new blessing no such blessing as thou hast not vouchsafed to the sonnes of adam yea to mee
thou madest adam after thine owne image and me in him holy and happie diddest thou make vs such dayes were our former dayes cleare and warme without corruption without mortalitie though now we are both sinfull and wofull all our dayes are such euill dayes
but thou lord that commandest at first light to shine out of darkenesse and dost continually exchange the night for day shine vpon mee let the sunne of righteousnesse arise vnto me become my father make mee thy child giue me grace to serue thee and vouchsafe thou to blesse me create a new heauen and a new earth in this little world of mine wherein let righteousnesse dwell
yea and happinesse also let them rest on my bodie let them rest on my soule let them rest on both all the daies of this life vntill thou bee pleased to remoue both hence and consummate this thy fauour in the life to come
wherein my daies shall be though like yet much better then my dayes of old by so much better as glorification shall exceed the creation
thou seest
lord the vpshot of my desire
now let my desire be a comfortable prophesie of thy fauour disappoint me not of that for which thou hast made mee long so change me by grace here on earth that may be what hope to be by glorie in heauen where all things are made so new that they neuer can waxe amen

meditation vpon ecclesiast

verse

epigraph death how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liueth at rest in his possessions vnto the man that hath nothing to vexe him and that hath prosperitie in all things and is yet able to receiue meate

wee haue no abiding place on earth none haue but of those that would haue there are many
many there are lord that though they must die cannot indure to mind death nothing more vnsauorie to some then that their memorie should be exercised with the memorie thereof
and who are they surely they whom the earth most fauoreth are they that are best affected thereto where their goods are there they thinke it is good being
and how should any bee willing to part from that wherein he findeth content and whereupon hee hath set his rest he it is that is not onely in but of the world not onely vseth but enioyeth the same and from that which is our ioy if we be seuered we cannot be seuered without paine
heauen is a blessed place and blessed is the state which all are promised that shall come thither
but this truth we belieue we doe not see it surely the worldly happie man doth hardly credit it because he hath no sense thereof
sense that hath immediately to doe with the world as it is pleasured so doth it iudge thereof it iudgeth it the onely place of happinesse
if it may be so happie as to be fed to the full with that which it desires if we haue goods and haue the vse of them what saith flesh and bloud should wish for more and indeed what fuller definition can an earthly mind make of a blessed life then secure store and a comfortable vse of such goods which are the goods of this naturall life although in themselues they are fleeting vanities yet sensuall reason honoureth them with the glorious title of substance it thinketh they are and are

what they seeme because it iudgeth according as it wisheth and what it would haue them to be it holds them to be such
and if man bee so vnhappily happie as to hold them without the opposition of enuie or malice and their wings are clipt from flying away the more proprietie we thinke we haue in them the more are we confirmed in our erroneous iudgement of them
nothing doth more roote a mans heart in the world then an ouer great calme wherin he sayles and rides at anchor in the world worldly peace doth much helpe forward a worldly mind
especially if we bee lulled a sleepe by both charmes of this peace securitie and plentie if no bodie disturbe vs no bodie impaire what we haue gathered no casualtie no calamitie cloud the sun shine of our day or sowre the sweete of our welfare how can we but thinke that so secure a must needs be a blessed life but if our spring bee not onely not blasted but also beare all kind of fruit all goe well with vs and we haue the world at will blessed in the field and blessed at home blessed in our cattell and blessed in our corne blessed in all where to we put our hand how can wee but deeme our selues possest of a blessed state

but hauing is not enough though we hold all this securely yet is it comfortable vse that is the soule of sensuall blessednesse if this quicken that bodie then is a man a naturall man then is as blessed as he would be
when his eyes can behold the glorie of his wealth his eares be tickled with the flatterie of musicke and the musicke of flatterie his nostrels breath in the fragrancie of his paradises and perfumes of his precious oyntments while his pallat can taste and distinguish the delicacies of apicean cookerie finally while euerie sense is courted with his fawning obiect and nature hath not giuen ouer to delight in such courtings but holds her selfe more blessed in so partaking then in hauing of such worldly goods when such a state is befallen a man then is come to the highest degree of that prosperitie which the world can afford
and being in it little sense hath he of ought besides it for hardly will it giue leasure to the soule to thinke that there is any other welfare then that which is enioyed by the dodie
and how should it think that this is brickle if it neuer feele it crazed how should it loath that which neuer gaue it any

discontent finally how should it bee willing to bid that farewell wherein all its doth consist how then should diues cloathed in purple and fine linnen and faring deliciously euerie day thinke of death and not thinke with horrour that commeth to make so vnwelcome a separation a separation betweene such louing friends that take such mutuall content each in the other and wherof each seemeth with an inuiolable league to haue deuoted it selfe vnto the other
qui inter nos dissidium volunt saith flesh and bloud euill betide them that will breake this true loue knot
and who can doe this but death and how should he bee willing to heare of death that knoweth that death will doe this death will giue the lie vnto our goods and proue they are not substance but a shadow death will turne our calme into a storm and tosse the ship that lay still our wealth which wee haue treasured it will bequeath to others and it will lodge vs in the graue long before we desire to be at our iournies end
a natural ma knoweth this is so but yet he taketh no delight to make this the subiect of his thoughts the feeling of this truth when it falleth out is bitter enough
why should hee taste the potion thinketh he before he is sicke and lengthen his miserie by making himselfe miserable before his time the prognostication of such weather doth more afflict then the weather it selfe and feare torments more then paine
more is he distressed that forefeeth then he that feeleth miserie for feare and are the tortures of the soule whereas death and the harbingers thereof fasten their afflictions onely vpon the bodie
and much more sensible is the soule then the bodie can be

seeing this is the euill of worldly weale and the ease our corrupt nature taketh in it maketh vs more to distaste the loys of heauen mixe beseech thee lord my peace with war let me neuer be a secure owner of my worldly goods
yea lord let them appeare as they are transitorie and vncertaine that may neuer repute them to bee my goods
let theeues strip mee let crosses distresse mee though lose yet shall gaine and prosper best when doe not prosper
death that must come shall neuer bee vnwelcome nay the remembrance of it shall bee my greatest comfort it shall neuer

find me but willing to leaue what neuer did enioy and happie shall account that hower that shall take mee out of the world when it taketh the world from me because wee neuer were at one and therefore shall not feare to bee at ods the world is crucified to me and to the world
death shall haue no paines in parting our association which shall find vs before hand parted in affection let death bee bitter vnto others to me it shall be sweete and will prepare my selfe by timely thinking on it so shall neuer bee vncomfortably surprised by it

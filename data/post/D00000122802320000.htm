miracles of the virgin
or an historical account of the original and stupendious performances of the image entituled our blessed lady of halle

restoring the dead to life healing the sick delivering of captives written originally in latin by justus lipsius afterwards translated into french then into dutch and now rendred into english

ecclesia catholica fundata est miraculis conservata

london printed in the year

to the reader

those of the roman communion have imposed on the belief of mankind such fabulous legends and ridiculous stories that think it a sufficient antidote against their errors to expose some of these pretended miracles to the view of the world it is to this that have transloted the following relations
it will not be amiss to give my readers some account of the book from whence translated these relations which shall do as briefly as can
justus lipsius published a book in latin in the year
intituled diva virgo hallensis beneficia ejus miracula fide atque ordine descripta
this treatise was licensed and approved by gulielmus de berghes archbishop of camerick valerianus flossius vicar general and gulielmus fabritius the censor of books
it was translated into french and augmented by claudius maillard a jesuit it was translated into dutch by philip numan and again into french by ludovicus du gardin a physician it was afterwards again rendred into dutch with maillards additions by a jesuit and printed at brussels anno
it is licensed by the censor of books but there is a caution in the licensing of it which was not made use of in the latin edition of lipsius and it is that none of these miracles shall be received upon the credit of the church unless at least they be attested by a bishop but shall be

taken upon the credit of the faithful historian and this was in obedience to the two bulls of pope urban the to that purpose
it seems that they began to blush at these ridiculous stories but yet they would have the commonalty believe them though not at the expence of the publick faith
have in this translation most followed the dutch edition which is divided into three parts the first is spent in the description of the city of halle and the image which have rather abridged than translated
all that have taken from this part is comprized in my first chapter and is tho an abridgment in the authors own words for the most part the miracles make the second part which is subdivided into two parts the first whereof contains all the miracles that are in lipsius it is this that have taught to speak english
the third part is an account of the gifts offered to the virgin lipsius treatise met with some opposition in the world and was defended by anastasius cochelet a camelite and of paris and by carolus scribanius a dutch jesuit

because would not give the least opportunity to the romish calumniators to traduce me as a false translator have rendred it almost verbatim though am not ignorant that it is esteemed to be an error by the best translators

of the original of the holy image a short description of the noble descent and vertue of the holy elizabeth

in order to a clearer prospect of the original of this holy image

it seems necessary to enquire into the royal pedigree and constant vertue of the pious elizabeth

andreas ii surnamed hierosolymitanus the third son of bela iii
king of hungary after the death of his brothers inherited the kingdom of hungary anno
his queen was gertrude daughter to the duke of mernhem krenten and istrien by whom he had three sons and one daughter viz bela iv
celomannus andrew and elizabeth
andrew being desirous to advance himself travelled to venice and there married a rich wife by whom he had a son named marcus
marcus not being contented with the estate his father left him possessed of went to picardy and there married catharine de croy legal heiress of the house of croy descended from the palsgraves of hungary and wittenberg from this marriage sprung that illustrious family of croy

elizabeth which most serves our design daughter as above of andrew ii
king of hungary and aunt to marcus at the age of three years was by ambassadors betrothed to lewis son of hermon landgrave of thuringia and hassia descended from charles the great
at the age of four years she was conveyed to thuringia to be educated in her bridegrooms fathers

court
it would be tedious to relate the signs of a pious disposition visible in her infancy

it shall suffice to remark that being then a virgin and afterwards both wife and widow her vertuous deportment in all these estates rendered her famous the painters and carvers represented her with three crowns on her head intimating that she had merited a crown from each state
at the age of fourteen she was married to lewis and had issue by him viz hermannus who did not live long and sophia also another daughter of the same name or according to some her name was gertrude she left this world for a cloyster
lewis accompanying the emperor frederick to assist in the conquest of the holy land dyed in apulia or as some affirm in sicilie
his body was sent to elizabeth who with extraordinary grief interr'd it
henry her husbands brother after many injuries offered to her not only bereft her of all her estate but banished her so hastily that she could hardly find a place of ropose for herself and children
she retired to marpurg in hassia where after having spent four years in all manner of vertuous exercises by the assistance of one conrad a religious man she departed this life being but twenty four years of age anno
her sanctity and miracles caused pope gregory ix to add her to the number of the saints anno

sophia her eldest daughter and heiress rather of her vertue than estate went into the netherlands where she was married to henry ii
duke of brabant
he had henry iii by his first dutchess maria van swaven daughter to the emperor philip
he had also by sophia another henry surnamed the brabander he with the assistance of his mother made divers attempts

for the acquisition of their inheritance which the strength of the adverse party rendered ineffectual but at last he regained hassia and lest his posterity possest of it more by the prayers of elizabeth than the assistance of his mother
but leaving this neighbouring history let us come to those things for which cause it was related

sophia inheritrix of her mothers piety being willing to follow her example in all things was strongly inclined to the veneration and love of our lady
tis really believed that her mother bequeathed her some images of the virgin which in remembrance of her she loved and esteemed more than ordinary whereof she gave one to the cloyster of carmelite nuns at vilvord which hath been antiently as famous for its miracles as of late its title is our lady of consolation intimating that several persons have there been delivered from their maladies and acquired ease both of body and mind
she gave three other images to mechtildis sister to duke henry her husband who being a widow had married florentius iv
earl of holland and zealand from which nuptials sprung the honoured william ii who was in the contention chosen emperour of germany

mechtildis reception of these images of sophia in process of time had a better effect than could have been if she had received them from elizabeth her self who had been long dead and the great distance that was between their several habitations might have prevented any acquaintance between them
mechtildis not long before her decease distributed the images in divers places she placed one at gravesand

an antient though small city of holland situate near the cloyster of loosduynen which she had founded and where after

her husbands death she piously and chastly spent the remainder of her life
she gave another to the carmelites church at haerlem
and the third which is our image she bestowed at halle in henegow but why was this placed there believe because her daughter adelheydis was married to john of avennes earl of henogowe some years before her death
to which we may add

that she had a daughter of her own name who being married to the earl of hennenberg had at one birth children which were baptized altogether by the bishop of utrecht an event that looks more like a fable than a true history did not our annals so firmly and unanimously assert it
but to return to our design as the stubborn were apt to calumniate so the religious admired by what means the holy elizabeth collected so many images of the virgin
both which may be satisfied by haraeus who says

that she her self or some body for her received them from her aunt the religious heduwigis wife to hedricus barbatus prince of slesia and poland who knew the vertuous disposition of her neece
the reason of this conjecture might be that in her life time she was found to have a great quantity of images of the virgin which she very much reverenced she kept a small one commonly in her hand as well to excite her devotion with the sight of it as to bless and heal the sick nay which is more she so venerated that sacred image that she dyed with one between her fingers and was in that posture interr'd
some years after her death her body was found consumed except the two fingers which with their former vigor graspt the sacred image
this is the reason why the painters represent her with an image in her hand

to speak more particularly this holy image is composed of wood it is about three foot high sitting on a chair and offering her left breast to the child to suck the cloaths and other ornaments veil it from our eyes it is not esteemed for its composure nor the matter whereof it is composed that being slight and common nor its black colour caused by its antiquity and the smoak of lamps but there is a more than human majesty attends it because it represents the virgin who is so honourable and hath done so many miracles and doth daily
that character nigra sum sed formosa might here take place this meanness of the image ought not to diminish wisemens devotion nor the veneration of the simple and illiterate
here that falls in very opportunely which wichmans remarks viz

that amongst all the miraculous images of the virgin especially those that were found in the netherlands there was none whose matter was sumptuous or composure elegant
therefore they would not be esteemed were not their worth enhanced by faith which neglecting the curiosities of the image fixes it self upon the mighty power of god which appears through the images in the operation of miracles
this gives us a clear prospect of the divine providence in bereaving the world of all occasions of idolatry by this meanness of the images for on the contrary had they been elegant and costly the unthinking vulgar would have appropriated their honour and veneration to their splendor and the obstinate would think and affirm that we therefore honour the type but not for the sake of the prototype yet we ought not to hinder the making of costly images in honour of the virgin for they represent her as well nay better than the meaner if they be miraculous

the virgin began to be honoured in this image and to perform various miracles about the year
in the time of nicholas de la fountaine the fifty first bishop of camerick

a man of extraordinary piety and vertue and as his suffragan thomas cantipratanus who was born at leew near halle affirms a great honourer of the virgin a worthy scholar to albertus magnus and with thomas aquinas all ardent lovers of the mother of god

the blessed virgin defended the city of halle from the power of her enemies
let us now with a thankful acknowledgment relate the wonderful and memorable actions which the queen of heaven and mother of mercy hath performed to so many afflicted and comfortless persons
and here we must not omit that the wooden image which is several hundred years old and yet is so far from the usual concomitants of antiquity that it is not in the least injured by time nor the frequent fires which the neighbours affirm have consumed the adjacent houses
the virgin hath not only preserv'd her image and church from the impetuous flames but hath several times defended the city against the power and force of its enemies

philip cleve in the year
chief of the enemies of maximilian and his son philip seeing that halle was a thorn in the foot of the brussellers treacherously bought some of the burghers to his side that when he should come they should give him entrance

into the city he was on his march with
men and had surprized the city had not a burgher of brussels by chance why say by chance it was by the appointment of the virgin who watched over her city been imprisoned who discovered the plot the burghers made use of this discovery and let philip of cleve march on with his army pass the moat and climb the walls and then with an extraordinary courage forced him to retire with shame and dishonour

philip seeing the ill success of his first assault having procured more strength and armed himself better made a second assault he had now
men his design was carried on with such speed that he surprized twenty souldiers in the fields without the city the city was guarded with no stronger a garrison than
men which rendred his dishonour the greater
he planted his ordnance and battered down so much of the walls that three wagons could go in abreast others shot with bombs so violently that many houses were in danger of burning
in this apparent danger the burghers were with fear and astonishment all human helps were ineffectual which caused them to rely on the goodness of heaven
they applyed themselves unto the blessed virgin and being encouraged by an expectation of her help and accompanied with spiritual assistances they resisted so stoutly that by the enemy having lost his men and courage was forced to raise the siege openly proclaiming that it was more than human power that vanquished him
during the fight the women were very busie in quenching the injected fire there was ten women in one house so much endangered that all people thought they had been choaked or

burned but they were delivered without any great damage and went each of them to her own house

there was none in halle whose countenance did not express an extraordinary joy and there was a joyful and universal thanksgiving to the virgin
on the next day the enemy being resolved to hazard another assault there arrived a messenger from the valiant prince charles of croy to the burghers promising them his assistance within three days this caused an extraordinary joy to possess the citizens minds which shewed it self in beating of drums and ringing of bells this unusual triumph raised a suspicion and fear among the enemies which hurried them to so hasty a flight as forced them to leave their dead and wounded and appurtenances behind them in the and in the way
in remembrance of this great deliverance there was reserved one hundred iron and stone bowls weighing some thirty others forty and some sixty pound by this we may see the strength of those cities though weakly fenced which the virgin hath chosen to govern
for the remembrance of this victory the burghers spend the even of the tenth of july in all expressions of joy and the morning in devotion they sing a solemn and carry the host in procession along the streets and walls

the punishment of two blaspheemers
we will descend a little to our times and by an action worthy of derision evince the power and praise of the virgin

in the time of the bloody netherland

oliver vanden tempel had the chief charge of the magazeen in brussels
the city of halle as also henegow and artois put themselves under the king of spains protection this so enraged oliver that he marched twice couragiously against the city thinking that none of the neighbouring cities which were all his allies would hinder his design there was scarse forty souldiers in the city the citizens young and inexpert for all this he was couragiously beaten off the first day then under pretence of a feigned retreat he sent presently for all the souldiers out of the neighbouring cities and came again before halle with more strength before they knew of it
his souldiers being on their march heightened the valour of each other with couragious speeches amongst the rest one john swickius an impious fellow said he would cut off the nose of our little lady of halle so he called the virgin
they came before the city and when both sides began to shoot a took off swickius nose it was undoubtedly directed by the virgin

but john risselmans was more insolent and rude this villain said that he would carry the image of the virgin to brussels and make a bonefire with it
this impious calumniator thought not of the approaching fire that shortly after reached him for a hit him and carried his jaw along with it which was the cause of his death shortly after
this was the fortune of those that came to fight against the city of halle that is against the virgin

a servant having lost his masters falcon and being upon the ladder to die for it was delivered from his approaching death by the assistance of the virgin

the following relation is attested by antient records and an old wooden image although time hath bereft us of the year when it was done and the names of the persons
the dutch nobility before they were destroyed by war were great lovers of hawking and fowling for this end they had divers expert and costly hawks brought unto them from the north
a nobleman whose severity is better known to us than his name was addicted to this exercise and had a falcon which he highly esteemed this falcon either by an unhappy chance or the carelesness of the falconer flew away past recovery the nobleman understanding his loss was so enraged that he swore if his servant did not find his falcon within five weeks his head should satisfie the loss
he made all possible search in woods and all other likely places but in vain the falcon was irrecoverably lost at the five weeks end he could not prevail with his lord for one weeks respite but he still persisting in his resolution caused a gallows to be immediately erected before his house the executioner bound his eyes and led him up the ladder standing with the rope about his neck he remembred halle and your mercy blessed virgin which he shortly after experienced yea it even met his devotions for while he was at his prayers and directed his heart to you he thought that he heard the clapping of the wings

of a fowl which gave him some hope he desired his master that his eyes might be unbound that he might send his prayers to heaven with a freedom of sight his request was granted then renewing his invocations of the blessed virgin the falcon flew swiftly towards the almost dying person and settled upon his shoulder
some affirm that the falcon came not until he had been turned off the ladder but this is not attested by the image which he offered
all the spectators congratulated his preservation and wished him all felicity and he rendred praise and honour unto the virgin
his lord might with his falcon catch partridges but on that day the virgin caught the best prey

one was delivered from drowning

that the mercy of the mother of god is more abundant than the waters paslinus shall evince

who was a burgher of enghen in henegow
in august in this little city arose such a grievous tempest mixt with hard thunderbolts dreadful lightning and thick black rain that the swelling springs houses and were washed away by the prevailing stream and turned the land into a sea all now sought some refuge one got up on high to preserve himself from water another crept into a hole for shelter against the lightning
paslinus betook himself to his cellar as well to preserve himself as some victuals and as he was busie there he was with water there was no opportunity of flighht nor hopes of human help he

resolved in this extream necessity with a prayer to commit himself to the charge of the virgin and immediately he found help for he espied a little above a door which he caught hold of and hung there two hours yet the water was up to his chin and sometimes it rise above his head but did not continue so any time the approaching night filled him with dismal apprehensions of its length and made him renew his supplications to the virgin who cast forth her bright beams and considerablely increased his strength inabling him to keep his hold at the door until the next day and his deliverance appeared for on the morning the waters were sunk yet he understood to his great grief that his wife and child were drowned in the inundation
he offered a in honour of the virgin and came accompanied with seventeen witnesses to return her thanks for it was she alone that kept him from his approaching death

a drowned child restored to life

a house accompanied with many children and much water fills the parents hearts with fears
a young child unhappily evinced the truth of this to his fathers grief and the glory of the virgin
the father missing his son after having spent two hours in a vain search for him feared that misfortune which afterwards happened for he found him drowned in a pool his head in the mud and his feet out of the water he drew him out but found no sign of life remaining in him after he had lain thus a full

hour the father cast a sorrowful eye towards his child and sent a prayer for mercy to you blessed mother his thoughts had hardly reached halle before the child was restored to life and began to stir and to rise up and walked home with his father
the waters of death abound in all places but in halle there flows a fountain of life

a person possessed by the devil was dispossessed
if an ill guest be a great burthen how bad must it then be for a man to harbour his worst enemy not only in his house but in his body
reynier willegem a burgher of oudenaerde a stout man and of a robust body was after our ladies possest by the devil this hellish spirit seized him as followeth he raved and foamed and tore himself and others his countenance sufficiently evidenced the malignity of his guest
his friends knew no better remedy than to invoke the aid of our lady of halle their prayers were heard the devil ejected and reynier regained his pristine liberty
that hellish serpent might well fear that our lady would not spare his members whose head she had broken

some delivered from shipwrack

we have hitherto confined our discourse to the land let us now plunge our selves into the midst of a horrible tempest and there behold the star of the sea the virgin shooting the beams of her mercy

a ship which departed from holland being bound for antwerp encountred a dreadful storm on its way thither and the approaching night doubled the danger and the fears of those on board her and the pilot told them the ship was lost also that he had done all that he could and advised every one to think upon his soul that they might reach the heaven of felicity
this made them fill the air with lamentations and cries and prayers one of the seamen said unto them wherefore do we not betake our selves to the virgin of halle they immediately followed his counsel and presently a bright light visible above the ship dispelled the clouds of night from their eyes and those of fear from their hearts and conducted the ship to its desired key
the master with some of the men like another noah went to halle to present his to the virgin

a gentlewoman was delivered from her distraction

he that hath the use of his senses enjoys many blessings that are not taken notice of but the want of them renders a man poor

this was exemplified in a young gentlewoman of the house of angerelle who being very beautiful and of a healthful constitution became distracted her mother spared neither labour nor charge for her curing although it proved ineffectual she then had recourse to halle and by an ardent prayer recommended the miserable estate of her daughter to our lady and whilst she was at her devotions in the church the mother of mercy performed a miracle at home for her daughter was cured at the very same time

she came to thank the virgin and offered a of weight correspondent to the weight of her daughter but the miracle can never be overweighed

a boy was delivered from drowning in the maze

at hocy five boys went into a boat

they lanched into the river and wantonly played together in the boat but their sport had not continued long ere the swelling of the maze and strength of the winds interrupted it and tossed the boat so violently that they could hardly get to the shore but as soon as they were got to land four of them leapt out of the boat

and with their leaping made the boat fly back on the water the fifth who was about fourteen years old remained in the boat immediately the wind and waves tossed the boat aloft and presently plunged it into the deep and turned it upside down so violently that the unfortunate boy was thrown out amongst the waves the four that had leaped ashore by their cries drew the people to the and amongst the rest the boys mother what could she do she said virgin who art honoured at halle promise that will come thither with my son to serve you if it will please you to deliver him from his approaching death
the vow was hardly uttered ere he was driven towards the bridg by the mighty force of the waters he passed the arches of the bridg uninterrupted and floated along amongst the waves about the space of half a mile to a place where the overflowing river softly laid him down

wonderful goodness the boy wrestled with the waves and was as it were carried in the soft arms of the blessed virgin

a child which was strangled was restored to life

in the city of bins

there was a poor by name catharine she had a small child whose name was christopher being gone abroad to work on one of her neighbours knocked at her door and finding it slightly shut entred the house poor people who have nothing to lose have no cause of fear this woman found the child hanging out of the cradle and strangled it is probable that the child

in the absence of his mother turning it self to and fro rolled out of the cradle and remained hung in the
the woman seeing this fell to crying and calling which brought several people thither as also the mother of the infant who being astonished and frighted at the accident swooned away but the brought her to her self again and incourag'd her and advised her to offer up her child to our lady of halle which she did with a good courage and distinct words and behold the child which was stiff and had been above three hours dead immediately revived and eat and drank that which was given to it
the mother afterwards offered it up to the blessed virgin of halle according to her promise being accompanied with the noble lady of scarsinne and other creditable persons at halle
and should not the virgin cause such a grieved mother and her infant to rejoyce who as on the day following had received an unspeakable consolation by the resurrection of her son

chap
xiii
a girl that was drowned in a well was restored to life

it is a proverb the deeper the well

the clearer the water to which add the more excellent miracle
this was obvious in the castle of ligny and evinced in the person of johanna mallart who went to draw water for the use of the family out of a well about foot deep and the top was laid round with bricks having before it a great stone against which people leaned
as the girl was drawing up a bucket this stone and she with it fell into the well and was

drowned in this fall there was another evil for in the well there jetted out a piece of a rock upon which she fell with such a force that not only wounded her head and her arm but which was worst she so hurt her leg that it was swelled as big as her body she remained half an hour in the water before she was drawn out she was dead her countenance being very black and filthy
she was in this condition hours her mother was a sorrowful spectotor all the time but a ray of consolation displayed it self for as soon as she by the advice of the had offer'd up her prayers and her daughter to our lady of halle joanna reviv'd regain'd her former colour and her wounds were healed
her mother and she came to halle to return thanks to the virgin

here also should add a relation of a little boy which years before was drowned in a well at obbrussel and through the compassion of the mother of mercy revived
may not the virgin then say in the words of the wise man prov
he that findeth me findeth life and wells of salvation from the lord

a child after it had been three days dead and buried was restored to life

at seneffe a village of brabant not far from halle as is asserted by unquestionable testimony there was a child it continued in that state three days and was also buried
the sorrowful mother had spent a whole day in tears and in the evening she thought she saw a woman of an honourable miene and cheerful countenance who told

her if she would make a vow to our lady of halle her child should live the mother promis'd that she would go to halle to serve the blessed virgin and being comforted by this woman would have the child taken out of the grave which was done and the child laid dead and stiff in its mothers lap presently the pale colour began to vanish from its cheeks and the child revived and was baptized and at noon it dy'd again and its soul went to the coelestial court to render honour and praise to the blessed virgin

two dead children restored to life

another child at cantimpre

unhappily lost and killed its self his fathers name was john bidans who with its mother the family and neighbours spent two days and a night in a vain search after the child the father very zealously vowed to go on pilgrimage to our blessed lady of halle and renewing their search they found him smothered in a muddy pool and trusting upon the mercy of the blessed virgin they laid him upon her altar the corps feeling the power of that adjacent mother which bore unto us eternal life revived spoke and walked in the presence of nicholas lord bishop of cantimpre and a great multitude of people
the father coming to halle might joyfully say my son was lost and is found was dead and is risen again

but that which am about to add is more stupendious
at st hilaries a small village near camerick

lived one stephen morel and his wife fermine who

was delivered of a dead child which the midwife and all the rest of the women present at her delivery attested they had now no more to do but to bury the unbaptized child in unhallowed earth which they performed
in this condition it remained fifteen days and was forgotten by all but the mother in whose thoughts it was deeply impressed
it troubled her most that her child was not only bereft of this short but an eternal life

this raised such a commotion in the mind of the religious mother religious say because she came every year to serve our blessed lady of halle that she made a vow and daily renewed it her faith encountring the ordinary course of nature
things continued in this posture until the fifteenth day from her unhappy delivery when she was assur'd by a vision that her child was alive she forced her husband and some women to go to the grave to examine the truth of it they digg'd up the earth foot deep for so deep the child lay and behold oh stupendious miracle they found the same child living and as fresh as a blooming rose

they acquainted the parish priest with this miracle who found their report to be true for he saw in the child clear evidences of life but because the child was dedicated to our lady he advised them to carry it to vertigneuil a neighbouring village where our lady was very much honoured
the midwife and the women with other people went thence on the evening the village was scituate two miles distant the prudent mother gave them a piece of a hallowed candle to put into a lanthorn to light themselves along
and behold another wonder that small piece of candle not two inches long burned from

six of the clock in the evening until the next day without the least diminution
in their journey a third wonder appear'd before them it was light as the day but behind them a very dark night
they set out so late and walked so slowly for fear of injuring the child that it was late in the night e're they arrived at vertigneuil
tis to be supposed that they lodged there burning in the interim the hallowed candle by the child
the next morning as soon as it was perfect day light they went to the priests lodging but not finding him there they heard that he was gone to the castle of vertain upon some affair
the father and the wife went presently thither when they came there it was noon and they found all the gates shut they knock'd but in vain for no body opened them
behold now a fourth wonder the portal of the first gate opened its self also the portals of the second and third gate opened of their own accord and they came into the chamber where the governour the priest and others were without the knowledge of any in the castle
henry damman who was governour of the castle began to demand whether they were friends or enemies and run at the porter with his sword to revenge the treachery he thought him guilty of but having with astonishment heard the reason of their coming and the opening of the portals he and the guests about twenty in number would accompany the priest to the baptizing of such a child
when they came where the infant was they saw in it remarkable tokens of life it bled at the nose opened its mouth and eyes it sighed and wept great tears
this firmly assured the priest and all the spectators that it was alive the priest baptized it in the presence of almost seventy persons

and presently after is not this the fifth miracle they saw it evidently wast and decay like snow it died there and was buried in sanctify'd earth
the same hour the mother firmine felt her breast to dry which before was full of milk
this miracle was seen and attested by two whole villages oh wonderful thing what can impudence yea calumny its self say against these miracles blessed be thou blessed virgin which bore in thy womb everlasting life and through thy mercy and intercession gave life both of soul and body to the dead and made him partaker of eternal life
keep in us the life of grace that we may enjoy a happy death a joyful resurrection and everlasting glory and live in it with thee and thy son for ever

an innocent man wonderfully delivered from the gallows

if the mother of god be ready to help the impious how can she then neglect the innocent seeking her aid it is far from her mercy and goodness so to do
this was exemplified in the person of john sampenoy who

coming from aspernay in champagine to halle to offer his devotions to the blessed virgin on the way he got two treacherons companions nicholat barren and peter le norman who understanding the cause of his journey told him that they also were going to halle but not for the sake of devotion but profit for they were merchants

these two were pursued and taken at avennes for thieves and legally convicted of robbery they were put upon the rack whereupon they confessed that they had stole and sold four silver cups and

withal accused sampenoy of being guilty with them of the theft and receiving a third part thereof also they said that they had murthered a man on the way and sampenoy had assisted them hereupon they were led to execution but nicholas upon the gallows cleared sampenoy and recalled his false accusation but peter le norman persisted in his acccusation affirming that john was alike guilty with him and that he would confirm this with his death
the judge proceeded and hanged sampenoy with the other two notwithstanding his constant assertion of his innocence the judge exhorted the people to hear a mass for his soul to which sampenoy replied no my lord had rather they would recite a pater noster and an ave mary in honour of the blessed virgin of halle to whom was going and because my innocence cannot help me here appeal to her and desire that she would please to defend me
he was then turned off the ladder but still continued alive the executioner in a passion leapt upon his shoulders that he might strangle him with his weight but for all this he remained alive seeing clearly as he after related a beautiful woman of a majestick aspect who embraced him and took him into her protection
more than an hour had been spent on this manner to the amazement of all the spectators when john de selles a gentleman came riding with full speed to thither and said to the judge my lord desire that you would please to give me this innocent man or rather give him to our lady in whose name and was by whose command came hither
sampenoy was immediately cut down and released and began to thank the gentleman but he told him that it was the mother of god which had wrought his deliverance whom he was obliged to go

halle to serve
it is proverb that a man had better be given over by ten physitians than be condemned by one judge but they that hide themselves under the wings of the virgin need not fear the one nor the other for sickness and death are in her power to inflict or restrain them

a person delivered from his imprisonment in france

the holy angel delivered peter out of prison but the queen of angels

delivered the person whereof am about to write william mostier travell'd from picardy his own country towards the province of poictiers there was then a sharp war between charles the
king of france and the english he unfortunately fell into the latter and was led captive to the city of st michael where he was imprisoned in a deep dungeon and had two irons put upon his legs he remained there ten months because he could not raise a ransom of eighty golden crowns
being in this condition the blessed virgin of halle came into his mind whose name and worship was then famous in picardy he prayed heartily that by her assistance he might be delivered from this filth and darkness
hereupon he fell into a sweet sleep and waking in the morning oh wonderful thing he found himself not only out of the prison and free from his bonds but three miles distant from st michael

a person preserved from several dangers in and after battel

what will you see in the shunamite but hymns of armies said the bridegroom that is thanksgivings to the virgin for victories and deliverance from dangers in the midst of enemies
a wonderful history which was acted in picardy will confirm this
the earl of st paul famous of that time for his valour and noble descent was to go from chastelet to campaign to the daulphin of france there being then war between the french and the english

on a saturday in the morning he sent his cook steward and to provide lodging and to prepare for his reception
these three discovered a party of the enemy sixty or seventy in number that were stealing the cattel they returned speedily and advertis'd the earl of the danger he being a stout man caused his men immediately to arm themselves and mount their horses he being the most forward rid out before with john de gertru a trusty servant in such haste that john was not well armed the rest followed them by one or two at a time their whole number being about eighty
they pursued the enemy but they found them together with those which came out of their ambuscade to be strong
john first perceived their number and desired his master who burned to fight them to return whilst he would detain them with skirmishing the earl would not consent to that but fell upon them and they upon him john was shot in his arm by two arrows and looking about him once more to admonish his lord a third arrow hit him on the head upon which he fell from his horse
the earl seeing that the enemy was too unequal and knowing that delay would but inflame the enemy put spur to his horse and endeavour'd to reach the next town

the earl here was troubled at nothing so much as the loss of such a trusty servant thinking that he certainly dy'd of those three wounds but the goodness of god and the mercy of the virgin preserved him contrary to all expectation yea even beyond belief for whilst he lay among the men and horses he had continually in his mouth the virgin of halle praying that she who assisted so many would not forsake

him in this apparent danger he crept upon his hands and seet unto the next way where he lay very feeble here again arose a new difficulty for three of the enemies party came to plunder the dead and finding this miserable man they took his money rings and cloathes and cleaved his head with a sword
being thus wounded he still retained his life and hope again beseeching the virgin as also st barbara that they would be so gracious as to afford him an opportunity of confession this prayer so moved the souldiers themselves that they served him in this request for they seeing by chance a priest called him to the wounded person that he should prepare him for death for they intended to kill him
as it also happened afterwards one of them endeavouring to cut his throat but the virgin so averted the blade that only the coller of his shirt was cut
the priest did his best endeavour to beg his life of them whereupon the souldiers retired and the priest got him to an adjacent barn dressing his wounds as much as the time would permit
there came also another party of the enemy but there was amongst them some honourable souldiers and commanders but they did not meddle with them
at the approach of these the priest had run away
after they were gone the three villains came again and seeing him alive struck him a very hard blow by which they thought they had killed him as indeed they had without the assistance of the mother of god
going on their way they drew the body in a great rage to the river the virgin comforted him and advised him to seign himself dead here they threw him into the water and because they would be sure to kill him they pricked him with a lance
the virgin also averted this push and carried her servant

unto a small dirty island that jets its head a little above water where he lay three hours the coldness of the water and his loss of blood by nine mortal wounds rendred him quite stiff
the priest which had heard his confession like a good samaritan out of compassion went to seek him and following the track of his blood came to the water where to his great grief he could not find him
desire that the courteous reader would not be offended with the length of this relation but that he would please to search after and exalt the powerful arm of the virgin mary with patience and astonishment
the priest standing here comfortless cast his eyes towards the little island where he saw something but he could not discern whether it was a man or some evil spirits arming himself with the sign of the holy cross he called aloud conjure you in gods name if you are a christian to speak or make some sign hereupon john lifted up his arm and satisfied the priest who went up to the neck in water and brought him to a dry place and immediately run to the next town to procure a wagon and some men to carry him thither where he was cured and came in person to the virgin of halle with his mouth full of thanksgiving and yet the thanks was beneath the benefit which he received for he was four times preserved from death and consequently gained four lives

a gentleman was delivered out of prison

philip of cleve a young gentleman naturallly though illegally descended from that illustrious house lived at dijon in burgundy and was very much addicted to war and arms but he was not so fortunate as valiant for he was taken by the french and imprisoned at vaucouleur in lorrain in a tower cubits high his ransom being a gentleman was crowns which being too great a summ for his estate caused in him not only a grief of mind but a bodily disease also
once when his dinner was brought unto him he fell into a sweet sleep which continued until the next day at noon and then he was awaked by the keeper of the prison who admonished him to eat the portion of meat which was allotted him but the delight which he had received from a vision in his sleep averted his appetite from it
his vision was as followeth he thought that he saw himself lying upon the steps of our ladys chappel pouring his fervent prayers out before her image which were heard for the virgin gave him hope of an approaching deliverance
being alone he fell upon his knees beseeching the virgin that this dream might proceed to a happy event
hereupon he took a bone from the beef which was allotted him and used it instead of a file and touched therewith the irons that were about his neck hands and feet and broke them
he tyed his linnen and cloathes together with which he let himself down from the tower but it was not long enough he ventur'd a steep fall without any damage
now to

finish happily that deliverance which was begun he hid himself in the next wood and made use of the darkness of the night to fly in his flight continued three days and at their end he came hungry disfigured and naked as he was to thank the virgin of halle

a servant was delivered from the gallows

although according to the heathens bellona is the goddess of war yet she must lay her arms and laws at the foot of mary and those which she hath ordained to death

the virgin can preserve alive
as it happened in weerdt where the mutiners were strong and had retired to a place very well fortified
these men although they had trodden under feet all princely laws and obligations of obedience yet they could not effect their design without establishing new and more severe laws
they forbid the hindering or injuring of those which brought and sold provision upon pain of death
a young man of luxemburgh whose name was john went to the market to buy herrings as soon as he had received the herrings he intended to have paid for them but he was driven from his place by the croud before he could give the seller his money a trumpeter saw this but knew not that it was innocently done and being allured by the crowns which was promised to the discoverer of any breaker of this law he denvered and accused him to the officers who in a councel of war unanimously condemned him
guilty or not guilty he must now be hanged
seeing that there was no justice

on earth he sent his prayers to heaven for mercy and said mighty queen of heaven which art worshipped at halle as thou hast several times defended the innocent so defend my innocence and immediately he received a strong confidence in her mercy
he was led by the executioner to the gallows tyed up and turned off the ladder
he was also hanged with a double rope one cord broke and the other was likely to break
although the spectators esteemed this to be a miracle yet the executioner leaped upon his shoulders to strangle him a souldier seeing this ran up the ladder and cut the rope with his sword
thus john was delivered and came and bowed his condemned head before the virgin of halle and thanked her for the deliverance

a nun cured of a convulsion of the sinews

adriana serraets

a noble and religious nun of vorst being about years of age and in very good health was suddenly taken with a convulsion of the sinews this tormented her so grievously that she could not rest by day nor night neither the ingenuity of the physician nor the experience of the chirurgion could afford her any redress an evident sign that all humane help must give place that we may ascribe the glory to the virgin only
to that end with the approbation of her abbess she sent a pious woman in her stead to halle who in her name and for the regaining of her health should offer up a gift and cause the sacrifice of the mass to be recited
oh wonderful but true event at the same time that the woman

offered the gift at the very instant when the priest was serving for her at the altar at halle her health was restored her upon the quire at vorst she was then employed according to her custom in praising of god having regained her health she caused a joyful to be sung

the dutch author relates some miracles which are testified by the inscriptions and paintings of the chappel but they being not so fully related as the precedent relations shall only conclude with one of the inscriptions which is as as followeth

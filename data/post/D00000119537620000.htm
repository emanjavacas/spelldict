is the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe

we cannot more properly celebrate the memory of the incarnation of our blessed lord the pious purpose of our present assembling than by fixing our meditations on the nature reason and design of that most wonderful undertaking and condescension of the son of god
this is a sure way to sanctifie our feast and make it truly an holy
not that we are to neglect the history the bare narrative of the thing done affords very proper and useful entertainment for this season it refreshes the memory in all the mighty particulars of this stupendious transaction and so helps to settle them firmer in the mind it raises and warms the fancy excites and quickens the affections of the soul all which have very considerable influence upon practice
this is to keep too to listen with the shepherds to the of the bright ambassadour of heaven and the triumphant melody of

the celestial choir which assisted at that solemnity then to accompany the eastern sages conducted by a light held out from heaven to behold the place where the infinite infant lay to read the wondrous history of the as it was fairly written long before his birth in the prophecies of the old testament concerning the tribe the family the name the place the time and the manner of the nativity of him who was god as well as man
all this is the work of the day and you have done it often and the church hath taken care by the psalms and lessons and other parts of the proper service that it should never be quite omitted

but there is still further and more lofty matter of meditation in the mercies and mysteries of this day a day contriv'd from all eternity prefigur'd from all antiquity which the fulness of time produc'd which holy church and holy men in all ages gladly commemorate which angels gaze at with ecstasie and rapture and which both men and angels shall eternally celebrate with shouts of joy and everlasting hallelujah's
some part of this abounding theme is presented to you by the words of my text in which is contain'd this principal proposition that the law was but an introduction or dispensation preparatory to the gospel and the proof of it taken from the insufficiency of the law to effect what god mainly propos'd to himself the eternal happiness of mankind
for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness

should have been by the law
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe
in the whole argument as it lies in these words there are at least four particulars or propositions

first that man of himself has no title to immortal life
this is implyed and supposed because god contrives a way to render him fairly capable of being saved

secondly god sincerely desires the life that is the salvation of men and has propos'd means regularly to accomplish it

thirdly this was not could not be by the law of moses but

fourthly by the grace and mercy exhibited to the world in jesus christ or in the words of the text by the promise which by faith of jesus christ is given to them that believe

as for the first of these it is very evident that we are naturally without any plea for eternal life
the promise of immortality was free unmerited bounty even to our first parents whilst they stood adorned with all the beauties of a spotless innocence
the longest life of man all spent in most unblemished uniform obedience to his creators laws could merit nothing at all much less the inestimable reward of everlasting glory
death indeed is as we are told

the natural and dearly earn'd wages of sin but eternal life is the gift of god
the first

and perfectest of our kind could at the best be but an unprofitable servant to the infinite master that he served
nay it was the peculiar privilege and happiness of his nature that he was able to perform a steddy and perpetual obedience to all his creators will
therefore the psalmist prays for more degrees of such spiritual power and pleads his being a creature to move his maker to bestow them on him
thy hands have made me and fashioned me give me understanding that may learn thy commandments
mans own being the excellent endowments of his nature his very meat and drink are liberal and abundant wages for that service which is naturally due from the creature to the creator and is as duly paid by all man only excepted who yet is most obliged to it as enjoying great advantages and even an imperial prerogative above all the rest as if for him alone the whole fabrick of heaven and earth had been produc'd
mine hand hath laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand hath spann'd the heavens saith the lord by his holy prophet when call unto them they stand up together
good reason sure that they should stand up and be at the call of him who gave them and supports them in their being
frogs and locusts and all vermin come and go as they are commanded off and on by the sovereign word of their almighty maker
the ravens feed one prophet a lion tears another but hungry and ravenous as they were those lions chose to fast and starye rather

than hurt a third a fish swallows up a fourth and then harmlesly restores him to and all at the command of god
the stars in their courses fight against sisera fire and hail snow and vapour and stormy wind are fulfilling his word
these and all things else rejoyce in his commandment are ready upon earth when need is and when their time is come they shall not transgress his word
but man only man like a pamper'd rebel grown great and insolent by the abus'd indulgence of his prince boggled at the first and easiest trial of his obedience and proudly disdain'd to acknowledge any lord over him

but what if he does his best what has he of his own to offer to his god who hath first given to him and it shall be recompenced unto him again adam himself had nothing but what was given him why should he glory then as if he had not received it but then again what proportion is there between finite performances and infinite rewards nay tho we undergo the sharpest afflictions in the discharge of our duties

we are to reckon with st paul that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed as in one place that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory as he expresseth it in another
so that it must be agreed as a thing evident both from scripture and right reason that man has no natural and original title to an happy everlasting life
but yet for all that it is most certain that god did bestow

on him an immortal soul not with a design to destroy it again but on purpose that he might live for ever with himself in eternal glory
but the apostate seraphim envied so great a privilege to a creature so far inferiour to himself and man was presently cheated of it soon tempted to forfeit his inheritance by violating an easie precept that had been given him as a trial of his obedience and the condition of all the happiness that was promised which leads to the second proposition contained in the text

for to our comfort we know that god did not desert man miserable man fal'n as he was helpless and hopeless in himself but immediately reach'd down his hand from heaven and rais'd him from the groveling condition wherein he lay set him on his feet again and bid him look up and make a new adventure for a crown of glory
he remits the forfeiture of the broken covenant and vouchsafes to enter on a new treaty with his revolted creature affording him a better hope a better covenant established upon better promises

thus was it the happiness of the creature that god still proposed and pursued in all his dispensations towards the sons of men

it is true indeed that under the oeconomy of the law the kingdom of heaven and eternal life were but imperfectly discover'd through veils and signs and types mysteries and metaphors shadows clouds and darkness suitable to the meaner

genius of that discipline which was but imperfect as eusebius expresseth it

and agreeable to the weakness of that childish people who were to be managed and conducted by it
but it is absurd to conclude from thence that the utmost felicity proposed to the jews was only a fat land and a long life milk and hony peace and plenty and at the last the burial perhaps of men but the death of bruits
if this were all the swine they loath'd were as happy as themselves
but they were men a nation highly favour'd and honour'd by god far above all other families of the earth a peculiar and chosen people to whom were committed the oracles of god and to whom pertained the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came
they were our elder brothers as it were and the of the world and that inheritance which we now all so happily enjoy in common seemed for a good while to be entail'd only on the house of jacob

the very points in controversie between the pharisees and the sadduces sufficiently prove that the expectations of another life had been of old receiv'd and entertain'd by that people
and our saviour put to silence those that ventur'd to deny it by a plain proof of the matter drawn from the very pentateuch that small portion of scripture which the sadduces would own for authentick canon

many places there are in the books of the prophets which cannot receive a full interpretation without the supposition of a future state amongst which prophyrie himself cannot hinder but that of daniel will still be one many of them that sleep in the dust shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt

to which as the father observes our saviour makes a just parallel in those words all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation
the famous petition of the thief on the cross and our saviours gracious reply to it together with many plain and direct passages in josephus and the most ancient rabbins concerning a future felicity for the pious and misery for irreligious persons put it out of all doubt that the doctrine of a future life was far from being so strange and unreceiv'd a thing amongst the jews as some would represent it
we need not therefore wonder to find in the catalogue of old recorded in the epistle to the hebrews many that were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection
but then these gracious purposes of god for our eternal good were far more illustriously manifested in the gospel through which christ hath brought life and immortality to light

and that makes way for our third proposition

that the life intended for and proposed to man could not be obtain'd by the law of moses and therefore all must be devolv'd on the fourth the mercy and promise of god which by faith of jesus christ is given to them that believe
need not lead you from the text or chapter of which it is a part to find abundant proof of the impotency of the law of moses it is the argument almost of every verse
as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse
no man is justified by the law in the sight of god
the same had been avouch'd twice or thrice in the former chapter

it is needless to allege more testimonies of the truth of a thing so evident
it is the argument not only of this epistle but in a manner of the whole book of god it is the very foundation of the gospel if it be otherwise christ died in vain and our faith is vain
for if that first covenant had been faultless there should no place have been sought for the second

here therefore happily begins our fourth particular the oeconomy of the gospel
for god hath concluded all under unbelief that he might have mercy upon all or in the words of my text the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe
there was no room for repentance for second thoughts allowed by the tenour of the former covenants in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
that was the unrelenting rigour of the first law and the rigid condition of the law of

moses is carefully remembred by the apostle in this chapter cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them
a very uncomfortable and frightful sanction it is sufficient of it self to represent that law as a schoolmaster as it is stil'd qualified not only to bring but to drive us unto christ
thanks be therefore to god through jesus christ our lord who by the propitious mystery of this day and the saving consequences of it hath redeemed us from the curse of the law himself being made a curse for us who did all that could be requir'd in the greatest rigour and yet suffer'd too the greatest that we who of our selves could do nothing as we ought to do might yet suffer nothing but being by him enabled to do all things may be made heirs even joynt heirs with himself of eternal glory
and this it is that makes up our present rejoycing
the birth of christ was the death of the law for he was the end of the law and put an end to it also as it is taken in competition with the gospel
for we well know that it is not always so and therefore can easily reconcile those different and contrary accounts which are given of it in the new testament

as it is considered absolutely in it self without regard and subordination to our blessed lord who gives strength for the fulfilling of the moral part of it and is the substance and accomplishment of the

ceremonial it is represented full of terrors as to man and under characters of disparagement and diminution to it self
thus it is said to be abolished and disannull'd that it was but until john that it was given by moses who was faithful but as a servant whereas grace and truth came by jesus christ who is lord and heir of all things that it stops every mouth and makes all the world become guilty before god that it cannot justifie or make righteous it is not only reflected on as a less excellent ministry a covenant not faultless unprofitable decayed waxen old a shadow and vanishing away but it is likewise severely censured as an unsupportable yoak and that which worketh wrath and death it is said indeed to be weak but for all that we are told that it is the strength of sin a letter that killeth and the ministration of condemnation and death that it is a curse and emnity which christ abolished and slew the oldness of the letter and dead that there was made of necessity a change of the law and accordingly that we are not now under the law but under grace
at this rate is it expos'd and vilisied when consider'd as opposite to or distinct in part or in whole from the dispensation of the gospel

but there is another view of it and a much better prospect when it is represented as it was intended to be a dispensation preparatory and subordinate to the gospel a law of life and manners improv'd fulfil'd and enforced by our saviour who plentifully furnisheth out grace and strength to enable

us to live up to the precepts of it in an evangelical perfection
and thus it will soon appear that the law is not against the promises of god according to my text
for we find our blessed saviour making a solemn and very early protestation even in his first sermon that he came not to destroy but to fulfil the law that not a jot of it should be unfulfill'd that it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than one tittle of the law to fail
and st paul establish'd the christian faith by the law of moses as well as by the prophets and thus now the doers of the law shall be justified and we read often of the righteousness of the law and that it is not made void through faith god forbid saith st paul yea we establish the law
and thus the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good
thus too it is spiritual to be delighted in a commandment ordain'd unto life and a means to bring us unto christ
king david himself who composed so many hymns on purpose to celebrate and adorn the law and that long alphabetical octonary the psalm on that single subject could not say more in honour of it than what have already or may further be alledged for that purpose from the scriptures of the testament
but then the law is understood to be a kind of gospel a dispensation typical and significative of christ according to what the great father tells us

that the law was but the gospel mask'd and the gospel nothing else but the law reveal'd
indeed the whole old testament in a manner is a mysterious

shadow a prophetical and figurative representation of the new which some observing and finding what excellent use our saviour and his apostles made of the history and prophecies of the one testament to confirm and illustrate the doctrines of the other have indulged so long and unwarily to the contemptation of the allegorical that they have quite neglected and at last utterly lost and even renounc'd the first and literal sence
but this is an unreasonable affection of an extravagant and sottish extreme

it was the infinite wisdom and power of god that so contriv'd ordered and overrul'd affairs in the first ages of the world that they might aptly prelude typifie and represent that great undertaking which he was to set on foot in the latter times
hereby making the age of the patriarchs and the law but a long preface or introduction to that of the gospel
indeed to speak properly we are to date the gospel from the time of the first publication of it which was immediately after the fall as we all know from that happy moment all the hopes of heaven of a future endless life of bliss depended wholly on the birth and death of the messias
christianity therefore commenced about four thousand years before the first christmas

mean before the actual incarnation and nativity of the son of god
it is then no novel and upstart doctrine not a modern or new invented discipline but far the most ancient the senior religion of the world

almighty god for wise and weighty purposes did not think fit to put the gospel dispensation presently in practice with all the power and demonstration all the lustre and advantages with which in the fulness of time it was to appear and be recommended to the world
this delay left room for many previous passages and a preparative dispensation which did help to introduce the gospel with the more efficacy and glory
hence we have great confirmation of our faith from many and plain prophecies whereby we are enabled effectually to silence and shame both the jewish and heathen adversaries of our faith
for none now can resist the force and clearness of the evidence that ariseth thence but such who wilfully shut their eyes and chuse darkness rather than light it is to the great advantage of the gospel that it succeeds the burdensom oeconomy of the law the pedagogy of which discipline sets off the grace and sweetness of that liberty with which christ hath made us free
but tho the messias was not presently to appear yet the providence of god so order'd it that almost every great thing that hapned after the fall should conduce to make up a more solemn apparatus and sacred pomp as it were to the great bridegroom out of his chamber and introduce him into the world

the two first notable periods are from mans banishment out of paradise to the time of the flood and from thence to the giving of the law
in the

former mankind had many sad proofs and experiences of the corruption of their own natural inclinations and consequently of the great necessity of a saviour
whilst almighty god thus in times past suffer'd all nations to walk in their own ways as st paul and barnabas told the men of lystra he left not himself without witness though they were without excuse but sent unto them enoch and noah and other preachers of righteousness so that their condemnation was most just and death reigned from adam unto moses over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression
this was so evangelical a work that st peter according to a well grounded interpretation of that somewhat obscure place seems to ascribe it to christ himself who by the spirit went and preached unto those that were disobedient when the of god waited in the days of noah
indeed repentance and mercy and pardon of sins were the peculiar conditions of the gospel therefore it was very fit that those gracious indulgences should be tender'd to the world by the author of the gospel the mediator of that covenant even the holy one of god but this bountiful offer was obstinately rejected by that obdurate and irreclaimable age
upon this the divine justice proceeded to the long threatned judgment opened the floodgates of heaven and showred down vengeance on the rebellious world in a deluge of waters as he will one day of fire on unrepenting sinners

this was a serious and sad period and must not pass without a new intimation of a saviour
and accordingly we learn from st peter

that the ark floating on the surface of the waters and so preserving eight persons from the common ruine was an early type of christian baptism by which we are initiated into the church signified by that ark which contain'd in it all the church god then had in the world
he had destroyed the enemies of this little flock by a mighty ruine
and so will it happen but more eminently and compleatly in the antitype
none will escape the gulph not of perishing waters but of unquenchable fire but those only that get into the ark of god or at least put no wilful obstacle or bar against their admission thereinto
this parallel of the ark and the church together with the doctrine that attends it runs through the writings of many of the ancient fathers but must not stay to trace it or to lament that so important a point is no more consider'd than it seems to be in this age

the next remarkable adventure we meet with is that of babel a fit emblem and so received by the church of what was afterwards transacted at jerusalem
for as god then by dividing the languages of the daring builders blasted the insolent attempt of that rebellious crew so did he at the feast of pentecost by cloven and divided tongues another wonderful multiplication of languages baffle and

confound the combined opposition of jews and gentiles against himself and his holy child jesus

in the next place may mention to you those two famous types and forerunners of christ and the christian faith melchisedek and abraham one of which bore the express character of our saviour's person and the adventures of the other together with those of his family made up a long and large exemplification of his life and doctrine
abraham desired to see the day of the messias and he saw it and was glad

here then we have a christmass in the old testament
for abraham saw this day and kept it holy the feast it seems rejoyc'd the heart of that great and religious prince
he receiv'd an explicit promise of the messias

and that more than once and had a revelation made to him of the
this was that undefined span alphabet which the apostle refers to

when he tells us that the scripture foreseeing that god would justifie the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed
thus did abraham become the great patriarch of the christian faith the father of the faithful an honour not unworthy the friend of god as he is stil'd by god himself

the types are still plainer as you descend lower as in isaac his son his only son as he is stil'd the son whom he loved the son of the promise born by prophecy the prediction of an angel of a womb

that was dead as was that of sarah then led to death with his typical cross on his back to be sacrificed near the very place where his great archetype our blessed redeemer was afterwards actually sacrificed upon the cross
the day as well as your patience would fail me if should tell of sarah and hagar and the twelve patriarchs
indeed the whole succession of this family seems designed for so many types and symbols of the messias and the
jacob and esau in the womb and several passages of their lives signified that great event which was to come to pass in that the younger should be prefer'd before the elder the gentile should get the blessing from the jew the very thing we happily experience at this day
there was a famous visit of angels as they are stil'd made to abraham long before this which might have remembred to you of which one is universally concluded to be the son of god even he of whom afterwards it is said jehovah from jehovah the lord from the lord rained upon sodom and gomorrha brimstone and fire out of heaven
and that fire and brimstone that sodom and gomorrha are types sadly and certainly significative of that infernal lake of fire and brimstone which shall eternally burn all those that resist the merciful overtures and manifestations of the gospel
the famous wrestling of jacob with the angel interpreted by the ancients to be the son of god serv'd as a type of christ sufferings and temptations
joseph was another remarkable type

of christ appears by his bloody coat his innocence his chastity his sufferings his advancement unto honour and his feeding of the people
and now we are come within view of the sojourning of the children of israel in egypt and their slavery there a subject which makes up a considerable part of the old testament and is copiously insisted on in the new for the history and mystical interpretation of it

do not pretend to lay down the reasons of divine wisdom in singling out one family of the whole world for the object of his greatest mercies and his severest judgments
such speculations are apt to tempt men to venture too far and to a too curious examination of the methods and motives of gods wisdom in the administration of the world
that's an attribute out of our reach whatever appeal he hath been pleased to make to us concerning the justice and equity of his ways do not find that he ever submitted his wisdom to the trial and judgment of a man
but thus it actually was in the case before us
all mankind were equally the sons of god but amongst all these it pleased him to pitch on the house of jacob to make it a sign and an example to the rest of men
upon these on certain conditions he heaps mighty and miraculous mercies and upon these when highly provok'd he poureth forth his vengeance in dreadful and stupendious judgments
the account of this their diverse and double condition makes up

the greatest part of the history and prophecies of the old testament
the new gives us an account of the last attempt of heaven to reclaim that people and of their last concluding provocation the murder of their messias which as it was foretold by filling up the measure of their sins ripened them for that woful final desolation of their people government city and temple which had been long before predicted by the prophets and was then more expresly foretold and denounc'd by christ and his apostles
all which ruine the romans in gods appointed time brought upon that devoted people and the world at this day with astonishment beholds to which that forlorn nation hath been for this sixteen hundred years a mocking an hissing a and an abomination

this was the people that long continued the type and emblem of the christian church and a little consideration will enable us to expound and apply to our selves the several dispensations of god to them
the devil is the afflicting pharaoh our lusts and sins the taskmasters and bondage
the blood of christ is the red sea redemption to us but ruine to the devil and his instruments
moses and joshuah did evidently personate our jesus that conducts us to the land of canaan the heavenly jerusalem through the wilderness of the world
he is the rock that is smitten for us and supporteth us in our journey
he is the brazen serpent lifted up on high on the cross to cure us of all the

venemous and malignant bitings of the old serpent
but before we had brought the israelites thus far on this their mystical march we might have observed the blood sprinkled on the posts of their doors to secure them from the stroak of the destroying angel as likewise their paschal lamb of which not a bone must be broken any more than of the lamb of god
but their food from heaven their celestial manna did plainly signifie that true and living bread which came down from heaven and which stands now upon our altars prepared for the spiritual repast of devout receivers

but must not stay to enlarge on so known a theme
irenaeus tells us in short that the coming forth of that people out of egypt and their whole progress was ordain'd by god to be a type and representation of the original and progress of the christian church which was to be gathered from among the gentiles

but it will concern us to have a care that we do not carry on the metaphor too far and provoke god as those typical christians did by murmurings and rebellion for the author of the epistle to the hebrews observes

that the carkases of those that sin'd fell in the wilderness god having sworn that they should not enter into his rest

thus have we taken an hasty view of much above two thousand years so thick set with figurative indications of the kingdom of the

that it looks like the very age of christ himself the copy or pattern of the gospel
and it was indeed a kind of primitive or patriarchal christendom
so that when our saviour took our flesh upon him and as on this day appeared upon earth in order to the establishment of the gospel in all its parts he was but undefined span alphabet

as eusebius expresseth it a restorer of the most ancient religion that which had been the religion of the world before moses

by this order and disposition of things god made it manifest that the law

as meerly positive was not necessary to salvation that man could be well without it that it was to be but a long parenthesis as it were between the first and second christendom the age of the patriarchs and that of the messias something that might have been left out and well spared as for any intrinsecal excellency of its own a meer interim an expedient for the present a kind of interregnum or a temporary constitution
and indeed the whole frame of it look'd forward and was apparently founded on relation the chiefest use of it being to point and direct to a better covenant something greater and more desirable than it self
if you abstract it from that typical and relative respect it will soon appear much unworthy of its great author the most trifling as well as the most burdensom constitution that ever was
so that it is no wonder that the heathens found it easie to pick quarrels with it and raise objections against it of that nature
these philo amongst others learnedly

labours to remove but all in vain because he himself was a stranger to the true use and signification of the law
that it was mutable not established as a necessary or intended for a perpetual rule may be collected even from the lateness of its date
had it been otherwise god would not have suffer'd the renowned patriarchs of the former periods to have been ignorant of it those illustrious heroes mean to whose faith and vertue he himself gave such ample and honourable testimony
nor after the law given do we find that the neglect of its positive prescripts was ever objected to those nations whose sins were yet distinctly reckon'd up by the prophets that were sent unto them as the ninevites egyptians chaldaeans idumaeans moabites and such others

the expiration of the institutions peculiar to the law was not so properly their destruction or abolition as their accomplishment consummation and attainment of that end for which they were by god instituted and intended
what was meerly shadow must needs become useless and vanish at the appearance of the substance
yet several usages and institutions under the law were adopted and introduc'd into the church being by our saviour and his apostles improv'd and sublimated into a more reasonable service
circumcision was advanced into a better sacrament more useful more easie more extensive in its application
the sabbath became the on which as it is the seventh part of

time we still commemorate gods rest on the seventh day and as it is the first day of the week we celebrate our redemption from spiritual egyptian bondage and the full assurance of a compleat victory over death and the grave by the resurrection of our lord on that day
this therefore is become to us a greater feast than the jews could observe on their sabbath
the great feast of atonement as well as all other bloody sacrifices of the law was finally accomplished on the cross and the memory of that the church solemnly recollects on
but in this feast of the atonement there was something peculiar and of very extraordinary signification that of the scape goat mean on which aaron was to lay his hands and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of israel putting them on the head of the goat and then send him into the wilderness
thus was christ on whom god laid the iniquities of us all presently after his baptism led into the wilderness carrying with him all the sins that had been confess'd by jerusalem and judah at st johns baptism

and thus it is that not the goat indeed but the lamb of god takes away the sins of the world

as the baptist had declared concerning him
am sensible that the pleasant contemplation of these divine mysteries would easily transport me beyond the proportion of the time must not therefore insist upon any of the rest not on aaron the high priest his mysterious vestments and more mysterious consecration nor any of the oral prophecies

concerning the great business of this day those immediately from god to adam and abraham or those of jacob moses and the prophets down to the express testimony of st john baptist the immediate harbinger and forerunner of the lord
and am sure need not put you in mind of that which is daily in your ears the melody of the psalms those lofty inspired hymns which are at once a very history of the birth life and death of the messias and also the most fervent petitions and devoutest strains of thanksgiving that the mouth of man can utter or his heart conceive

thus great thus holy thus divine are the triumphs of this day
it is the birth of god the of the whole world
it is the day which the lord hath made and which abraham saw
it is not a private or a modern feast we have heard already that it is as ancient as the fall of adam

nay we read of grace given in christ jesus before the world began according to the eternal purpose which god purposed in christ jesus our lord
that is what was from all eternity decreed and presently after the beginning of time happily put in practice
for christ is the way and the door by which both the first and last man and all other that come thither must enter heaven
neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby adam or any of his have or can be saved
god himself therefore could not apply more seasonable or effectual comfort to

our drooping parents languishing and astonished under the shame and horrour of their fall than to tell them of the seed of the woman the wonderful birth of this day
thus do both our testaments run one into the other they exhibit one and the same thing even the common salvation only under diverse circumstances suitable to the differences of persons and time

the substance of things is the same both in the old and the new testament

it is one and the same great housholder that brings forth things both new and old as irenaeus applieth to this matter that parable of our lord

the same lord and christ is exhibited in both the books dispensing to his children and servants laws and rules suitable to their several capacities and ages
well may we therefore be fill'd both with wonder and delight when we listen to the ravishing harmony of those two books of god

an employment and contemplation in the opinion of st austin to be prefer'd before the peaceable enjoyment of the empire of the whole world

do not the two testaments says he as the two seraphims call and cry to one another holy holy holy lord god of sabaoth that great and good man seems to have wrought himself up into a kind of transport

or ecstasie by dwelling long and thinking deeply on such things as these

from the considerations which have now mentioned and very many such like which in this vast and inexhaustible subject may be brought to illustrate one testament by the other might observe as irenaeus on the same occasion in the place forecited and also the chapter of that book how justly our saviour requires that his disciples and apostles who went to instruct others in the christian faith should themselves be scribes well instructed unto the kingdom of heaven and like the great master of the family able to bring forth out of their treasure things new and old that is saith the excellent writer without all dispute the old and the new testament

very pleasant it is and a great satisfaction to consider that we are in the self same way to heaven which the first and best of men have so happily trodden and with this advantage to us that now it is become far more visible and plain
it was only describ'd at a distance shewn and pointed at to them but we are brought and led into it and may discern the very footsteps of our saviour and tread in them too if it be not our own fault
the guide walks before us and cannot miss either of our way or our reward at the end of it if we do but follow our leader the victorious captain of our salvation

there was never at any time but one true religion in the world and that since the fall has been

no other but christianity either shadowed and covered or open and like it self
there is no difference between israel of old and the present israel of god but a few years and a clearer revelation
they had another law indeed but that did them no good nor afforded any true comfort but as it was sweetned and improv'd by a saviour
but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets

they were to expect no remission of sins without shedding of blood but it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin
therefore we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all there is a christmass in both the testaments the first authors of mankind our fathers both before and after the flood could not be happy by any other means than we their late posterity or as st peter expresseth it in the first general council through the grace of our lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they

st justin martyr in his dialogue with tryphon the jew proves that christians are properly the israelites from some places in isaiah as also from the notation of the word a notion in the main of it confirmed by our saviour and his apostles in what they teach concerning the seed of abraham of israelites indeed and the circumcision of the heart
have not time to repeat the texts
the sum is that christ was at the bottom and at the end of all our claim and theirs is in and through one and the same messias who tenders salvation equally to all that will

acceept of it on his own best that is evangelical terms
the patriarchs and prophets as well as apostles and other christians were saved by faith in christ as the early martyr ignatius avers in several places of his epistles and the same is at large prov'd by irenaeus and clemens of alexandria in his sixth book of stromata hath the same with something more of his own concerning christs descending into hell which shall not offer unto you

but thus have we seen

that whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that when the veil is taken from the face of moses he shines forth nothing but grace and gospel and this veil is now done away in christ

in christ say the almighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace alpha and omega the first and the last the beginning and the end who was and who is and who is to come the same yesterday and to day and for ever the almighty child of this day
a day so plainly foretold by the ancient prophets particularly by the greatly beloved daniel five hundred years before the time

that the whole people of the jews were in eager expectation and even on the gaze for their messias at the very time when he appeared in the world
and yet alas though he stood full before them and their great baptist pointed at him proclaiming aloud that it was he though the devils falling down before him or flying from him in groans and yells published who he was and he himself avouch'd

the same thing and testified it both by word and deed yet did their sins make the old curse stick so close to them

their heart so fat their ears so heavy and their eyes so dim that they understood not what they heard nor perceived what they saw
no noise of prophecies and miracles could wake them out of their golden dreams of a temporal triumphant prince with earthly crowns and scepters dominion and greatness such must their messias be and bring or he is no messias for their purpose

but he is for ours hope even just so as he did and was to come into the world
but then what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness

it was the folly and misery of gods first people the jews that they trusted to their priviledge of being so stil'd they took up with that and gloried abundantly in the temple of the lord without ever considering what great obligations were thereby laid on them for holiness and obedience
a prince has little reason to be satisfied with the loud professions of loyalty and obedience from such as take no care to express those boasted vertues in any thing but in words nor will the king of kings accept of the demure hypocrisie of those who as the prophet expresseth it come before him as his people cometh

and sit and hear but will not do
it is mockery and not religion to have lord lord in the mouth and no fear and reverence of him in the heart
judas could cry master master when

he kiss'd his lord and then betrayed him
if be a master where is my fear saith the lord of hosts
we are all ready to claim a share in the mercies and blessings of this day some interest in and relation to the saviour that was born in the city of david even christ the lord
we are willing to take our denomination from him at the least we would be call'd christians and he must be esteem'd and stil'd our lord
but he disowns and renounces all such relation and even acquaintance with those that conform not to his laws
why call ye me lord lord says he and do not the things which say know not whence you are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity
that peculiar people of god found by woful experience that he is no respecter of persons but that in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him
and that it is most just for god so to do seems to be the main design of that so much disputed and mistaken chapter the ninth of the epistle to the romans but if god spared not the natural branches on the like provocations most certainly he will not spare us
and if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven
the promise was made unto abraham and to his seed not the natural seed of his body but the children of his faith for they which are of the faith the same are the children of abraham as we are told in this chapter of my text
and if we do the works of abraham then are we the children of abraham

according to the estimation

of our blessed saviour who best could judge of such a matter
it is greatly our concern then to clear up our title to the saviour of this day which can no way be done but by the observation of his laws the imitation of his practice and walking worthy of him who hath called us with an holy calling this is truly to keep christmass the most christian and to god the most acceptable way of celebrating the nativity of our lord
st paul does not only assure us

that whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning but more particularly that the punishments of the jews were recorded

that they might be examples to us nay that they hapned unto them for examples and are written for our admonition
therefore that may still use the words of that apostle of the gentiles let not us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed

what can we imagine was the meaning of this eternal consultation of heaven this operose provision and almost unconceivable condescension that was made to bring about this wondrous day big and swell'd as it is with miracles of mercy
we cannot conceive that god who never needlesly contradicts or discomposeth the order that he himself hath establish'd in nature would thus heap wonder upon wonder for mean and little purposes much less for any thing unbecoming the purity and perfection of his nature
he did not then descend from his eternal throne and step into the womb of a poor virgin become an impotent infant and a man as miserable

as earth and hell could make him meerly that afterwards there might arise a generation of men who should be only stil'd christians
the effect was to bear more proportion to the cause
the design of heaven was upon our natures not our names
god propos'd to himself the salvation of our souls and

in order thereunto to redeem us from all iniquity and purisie to himself a people zealous of good works
he took our nature upon him that we might take his that is be made partakers of the divine nature and eternal glory
for these great purposes he liv'd and died for this he preach'd published and bequeath'd to the world the most perfect precepts the most incomparable example the most glorious promises the most dreadful threatnings together with all sort of the most inviting convincing and perswasive arguments that the wisdom goodness and power of heaven could contrive and furnish out for the benefit of mankind
may we therefore all sincerely endeavour to cast away the works of darkness and put upon us the armour of light now in the time of this mortal life in which our saviour came to visit us in great humility and let us purifie our selves even as he is pure that in the last day when he shall come again with power and great glory we may be made like unto him in his eternal and glorious kingdom where he now liveth and reigneth with the father and the holy ghost to which undivided and ever blessed trinity be all honour and glory power and deminion now and for ever
amen
finis

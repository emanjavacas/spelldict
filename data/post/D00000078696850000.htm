epigraph xx psalm we will rejoyce in thy salvation

this short but sweet and excellent psalm was indited by the holy spirit of god and penn'd by david the sweet singer of israel in the form and manner of a prayer for the help of the church in their imploring blessings and successes upon their kings whom god by his providence had set over them though here is also a particular reference or respect had unto the lord jesus who is the head of the church and over all things to the church king of sion and of saints of whom those other kings in their power and authority were types shadowing of him out in his royal office and dignity and some of them as david and solomon were so in a more special and peculiar manner
the psalm indeed doth contain in it two parts or is made up of two things prayer and praise
the former of these namely the prayer takes up the five first verses in which they do humbly and heartily beg of god these things for the king

first they beg of god audience for the king the lord hear thee in the day of trouble
where we may observe that kings may be in trouble as well as meaner persons they have burdens upon them the burden of government which calls for a strong sholder and the burden of care which requires an able

head and heart
and as they have their burdens so their troubles crowns and thrones are not without their thorns no more than other things
trouble will make its entry into the prince's palace as well as the peasant's cottage

observe again as princes have their troubles so they should not be without their prayer it is not enough for them that their clergy and other subjects are suitors on their behalf but they ought to spread their own case before god and make their requests known to him while their people pray for them they should pray for themselves and their people too
as they are men of power so they should be men of prayer give my self unto prayer said david
and happy that nation which hath a praying king such a king as is valiant and dares fight with enemies for them and being gracious knoweth how to wrestle with god too
it is in the text taken for granted that the king prays and therefore they desire he may be heard
observe again while the king prays it is the people's duty to back him and set in with god with him and for him we owe him a special room in our hearts and petitions the lord hear thee in the day of trouble doth the king pray oh that he may prosper oh that his prayer may come up before god as incense oh that his prayer may be accepted and granted the lord hear thee

secondly they desire protection for him the name of the god of jacob defend thee
do troubles encompass thee let salvation do so too are men thine enemies let god be thy guard his name is a strong tower let it be so to thee from the face of thine enemies let all his glorious attributes which are as so many letters

of his name be engaged and employed for thy security and preservation

thirdly they beg assistance for him not only that the divine shadow may be over him but that the divine hand also may be with him and the everlasting arm stretched out on his behalf send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of sion
help when thou needest it and callest for it maist thou never be without the help of god strength when thou hast enemies to grapple with that thou maist conquer them and when thou hast work to do that thou maist go thorough with it and do it to acceptance praise and honour send thee such help as will be seasonable and such strength as will be sufficient
fourthly they beg for him acceptance with god and the gracious remembrance of all his religious services remember all thy offerings and accept all thy
my friends what a singular comfort is it to a gracious people when they know their king to be a true worshipper of god together with them and have reason to look upon him as one that is devoted to the fear service and honour of god and when they are so perswaded it is unquestionably their duty to desire that he might in all that he doth be accepted of god acceptable to his people at least to the best and most judicious of them and to his god too

lastly they beg the fulfilling of all his counsels and of all his petitions verse
grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfil all thy counsels
and
of which the text is a part the lord fulfil all thy petitions
the lord grant that when thou hast directed thy prayer

and lookest up thou maist see something of mercy coming down that none of thy prayers may miscarry none drop by the way and fall short of heaven but that what goeth up in a cloud of prayer may descend again in a shower of blessings and that none of thy prudent counsels may prove abortive but what thou hast been travelling with for the glory of god the welfare of the church and the good of the nation thou maist be able to bring forth
the lord grant that thy prayers may be followed with satisfactory answers that thy counsels may be crowned with prosperous issues and thou maist prove most happily successful in them both

besides these their prayers for the king whose example let us follow in prayer for ours who highly deserves it at our hands as all must acknowledge who are not basely disingenuous and ungrateful they do in the words of the text promise and ingage for their interesting themselves in his good and that his safety peace and welfare shall be the matter of their comfort we will rejoyce in thy salvation
in which words we may take notice of these two parts


a great mercy or blessing bestowed upon the person of the king that is salvation

ii
a sutable affection thereupon working in the hearts of the people and that is joy this they promised we will rejoyce in thy salvation
if god be thy defence that shall be our delight and question not their performance good men will be as good as their word
and may their example be followed by us may all the people of this land tread in their steps
god hath graciously commanded salvation for our king and now let us rejoyce in his salvation
sure

am there is very great reason why we should
the doctrine which shall from hence draw and insist upon will be this

doct
the prince's salvation is just and great cause for the peoples joy when the prince's salvation goeth before the peoples joy should quickly follow after praises should even tread upon the heels of mercy and answer presently as the eccho doth the voice
and now that our king who hath receiv'd the mercy doth out of that kindly and deep sence he hath of it call us to the work of praise we should have our ears open to the call and our hearts rais'd and tun'd for the work now that their majesties say to us all bless the lord with us that man who will not come forth with a blessing deserves to meet with a curse at home
he that is without his joy is unworthy of a share in the benefits of the salvation
in the prosecution of this point shall observe this method shall prove it and give you some reasons for it why the prince's salvation should be the peoples joy shall instance in some particulars which do accent the salvation and therefore may very well raise and encrease the peoples joy a special salvation ought to be attended with more than a common joy
here shall present you with some considerations that may help to furnish you with the better sacrifices of thanksgiving and prove as fuel to raise a higher and more noble flame
shall in a few things shew you what kind of joy we should have what ought to be the properties of it if we may be accepted and approved of god and then

we shall make some improvement of it in a way of use and application and in all have a due respect to the time
we will begin with the first and shall speak to it as at this day it hath a direct reference to his present majesty his salvation doth loudly call upon us to rejoyce in it for these reasons


because it is such a salvation as hath come to him upon the wings of prayer sudden and unexpected mercies deliverances and salvations ought to be rejoyced in such as come to us in a way of surprize when god doth for us things that we thought not of that we looked not for these we should entertain with joy and be thankful for
these speak the watchful care and rich mercy of a gracious god
but when we can look on a mercy a salvation as an answer of prayer it puts a further and very delicious sweetness into it and accordingly calls for the higher praises
when a poor woman hath been in hard labour and had many a severe throw and terrible pang that hath extorted groans and shreiks from her oh what joy is there when she is told that a lovely perfect child is brought forth into the world if we do not trifle with duty but understand what prayer is and manage it aright we do travel in prayer we have our pangs and throws and surely it is with great wrestlings that we wrestle and when the mercy sticks in the birth what an agony is the holy soul put into and when we do prevail when saith be it to you even as you will and divine providence midwives the mercy into the world we should be very disingenuous ingrateful and unworthy if we should not heartily welcome it embracing and hugging it with joyful arms
a bare salvation is a mercy a single mercy but a salvation fetched in by prayer is a mercy doubled upon us a meer salvation is but a common mercy extended to the

bad as well as to the good to brutes as well as to reasonable creatures for god preserveth man and beast
but that salvation which is commanded and sent in as a return of prayer is a special mercy
how greatly upon that account was the heart of that good man david affected in the psal
verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of my prayer blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me
now while our king hath been studying caring and consulting for us while he hath been travelling labouring and fighting for us we have been praying for him
some of us have been praying for him every day and more than once in a day you know what prayers have been made and multiplied for him in our publick congregations and solemn assemblies what clouds of incense have ascended to heaven what days of prayer have been spent and set apart for him what fastings and prayers there have been and in them the pourings out of our souls and it hath not been in vain god hath heard and answer'd and done therefore let us be joyful in the lord and his goodness and take up the aforesaid expression blessed be god that hath not turned away our prayer nor his saving mercy from our soveraign yea and again let us say blessed be god


the king's salvation is and ought to be the matter of our rejoycing because by means thereof there is the continuance of our peace and prosperity
indeed when princes instead of being the fathers of their country do become tyrants and their government degenerates into oppression when they bind heavy yokes and burdens upon their subjects and sport themselves in their sorrow and ruine when they take destructive courses and are known to joyn with a common enemy in order to the overthrowing of all then it must be own'd a mercy

to have them taken away for it is a good riddance and that hand which gives them a fatal stroke or a seasonable remove reacheth out a singular kindness to the people
it's sad when they sit in the throne who will not mind and pursue the great ends of government but the salvation of a prince whose heart is set for publick good and who doth as david said bear up the pillars of a land should engage all his subjects in the work of praise

there are would hope not many among us but what are sensible what a potent and cruel enemy we have too too near us that hates us with an implacable hatred a declared enemy both to us and our religion and who will if ever it come within the reach of his power make us pay dear and smart bitterly for the opposition we have made him and the blows we have given him of which he possibly is soar and it is not a little slight revenge that will satisfie his rage rods will not be thought bad enough no no they must be scorpions
and some who have their eyes in their heads and open do and cannot but see what kind of persons we have living among ourselves what vipers lurk in our own bosoms who are full of discontent and malice so that they cannot command themselves nor bridle their passion but must give vent we see their restlesness we are not strangers to their purposes and endeavours and we hear their threatnings and if god had not been pleased to guard and establish the throne to preserve our king abroad and our queen at home and continue them both to us what confusion would that sort of men have put us into before this how would our land have been made an aceldama a field of blood but through divine goodness our king is saved our peace is preserved you may follow your callings

take the comfort of your estates enjoy your relations delight yourselves with and in your friends meet together in the great congregation worship god in the beauty of holiness and sit under your own roofs vines and none making you afraid and therefore we have reason to rejoyce in the king's salvation


the salvation of the king is and ought to be the matter of our rejoycing because it is a great ground of hope and comfortable expectation for the future the broken hearted and weeping prophet jeremiah did teach the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem to bewail their own loss by the early death of that gracious and most excellent king josiah in these expressions
lam
the breath of our nostrils the anointed of the lord was taken in their pits of whom we said under his shadow we shall live among the heathen
blessed be god our king is not taken in their pits nor fallen by their swords nor stab'd by their ponyards nor poysoned with their figs nor wounded by their bullets nor cut off by any of their cursed plots but may we not say he is the breath of our nostrils mean under god for without him he is no more than another man but it is to him under god that we do owe our being a nation a nation in so much peace a protestant nation and may we not hope and say that under his shadow we shall live notwithstanding the burning glowing fury of our inraged enemies and under his prudent and happy conduct we shall be delivered from and prevail against the power and attempts of those sons of perdition who are skilful and greedy to destroy and who would gladly make us their prey and swallow

us up quick
surely we may look upon this preservation in the midst of so many enemies and dangers as being a singular token for good and comfort ourselves with the thoughts of this that he is continued by god in mercy to us to the nation to europe and to the church of christ and that as he hath not only exalted him and placed him in the throne but likewise honoured him already by making use of him as an eminent instrument in his hand for good so he will go on to imploy and prosper him yet further and that he still hath more great and excellent work for him to do both among us and in the world
and that as his hands have laid most happily the foundation of our peace and prosperity so he shall proceed until he hath added the upon which shall be joyful acclamations grace grace to it

and since god hath put it into the hearts of their majesties with so much thankfulness to own him in the mercies which they have received in the deliverances which have been commanded for them and in that signal victory which was given their forces at sea
do heartily pray that they may and do with no small confidence perswade my self that they do and will look upon these mercies deliverances and great success as laying upon them strong obligations to a continued and vigorous appearance for the honour of his holy name and the prosecution of the great and glorious ends of government that so mercies may not turn plaintiffs nor the expectations of god and good men be disappointed
conclude that upon these accounts it is evident the prince's salvation should be the peoples joy

my work in the next place will be to offer to your serious consideration some things which may advance and increase your joy in order to the filling up of this day with the duty of it that the flame may be answerable to the occasion the high praises of god being both in our hearts and minds
now to this purpose know that an ingenuous and rightly spirited people should and will raise up their joy and thankfulness to a lofty pitch a very high degree for the salvation of their prince when it is accompanied and cloathed with such circumstances as these

first when the prince hath been the means of their salvation when he that is now their king was before their saviour when he is not only their governour but their redeemer and deliverer also when that crown which now he wears upon his head was placed there by the hands of an engaged and grateful people as a reward due to him for the special kindness he had shewn them and the eminent service he had done them and when the royal scepter which he now sways was by them put into his hand as an acknowledgement of his having drawn his sword in their quarrel and for their defence

whatever some sons of discontent do mutter we cannot but know how sad and doleful our condition was and what a black cloud sate upon the face of things among us when he was by a gracious and compassionate god sent in to our relief
you cannot so soon forget what a multitude of perplexing thoughts crowded in upon you what fears did fill your minds and that you were in your own eyes an undone people when the wicked did walk on every

side and the vilest men exalted and the power for most part put into the hands of those who were enemies to you and your religion
you know how religion was discountenanced sobriety it self ridicul'd prophaneness tolerated and encouraged the of wickedness and debauchery drawn up the edge of penal laws whet sharpned and turn'd against the best of men who were peaceable in the land and deserved not only protection but promotion also
how did the antichristian beast lift up his horn among us the whore endeavour'd to intoxicate all ranks of persons by her golden cup of fornication and the locusts that came out of the bottomless pits swarmed among us
were not popish schools erected for the corrupting of our youth and a wide door set open in their assemblies for the introducing doctrines of devils and setting up idolatrous worship which god's soul abhors in short we were upon the very brink of ruine in the jaws of death and the heavy iron yoak of arbitrary government popery and slavery almost bound upon our neck after which we must have gone bowed down to the grave
this was the time this our condition when our dearest and most renowned king was pleased to interpose and make a rescue and the hand of our gracious god was upon him and with him for good as he had inspir'd into him a mighty spirit so he assisted him with an almighty arm
and now blessed yea for ever blessed be his name for that he hath preserved and saved him for verily he did work with god that day as the people said concerning jonathan sam



secondly the peoples joy should be very great in the prince's salvation when having been the glorious instrument of their salvation formerly he is still devoted to their good and set heartily for it
though there hath been an addition made to his honour and power yet there is no abatement of his vigilance kindness and care
there have been kings in the world history acquaints us with them that have been shrivel'd and confined to themselves altogether swallowed up of themselves though they mistook their way and mist their end undoing themselves in a fond foolish and unlawful seeking of themselves
how many have there been that did reach at and would grasp all in their own fists they would make prerogative to command law and devour property as if the king were the only figure in a land and all the subjects must stand for no more than so many cyphers or as if the people were made only for the king and the king not at all for the people whereas there ought to be a reciprocation of kindness between them the king studying and seeking the peace prosperity and comfort of the people and they again contributing freely chearfully to the honour of the king
but there have been princes wholly immerst drown'd in the pleasures of a court as if the gratifying of a sensual appetite and fulfilling brutish lusts did better become them and more loudly proclaim their greatness than a due and paternal care of the body politick would do
and without all peradventure that must of necessity be a very sickly consumptive and languishing body which hath such an head and whose physician is its worst disease

but happy these nations if they will but know their happiness and not be peevish sullen and enemies to their own good as our king came to deliver so he goeth on to desend as he came to wrest our liberties and comforts out of the hands of those who had seized them and to restore them to us so he labours to preserve us in the possession of them
in short as he rose at first like a beautiful sun with healing under his wings so he goeth on to warm and refresh us with his beams
how much doth he think and study for common good how doth he labour and lay out himself how doth he weary and spend himself hazard and expose himself we see the beauty and glistering of his crown but it is he that feels the weight of it as it hath its rose so it is not without the thistle
we little think how often he breaks his rest that ours may be undisturbed how frequently and long his eyes are held waking while we lie down in safety and throughout the night take a sweet and comfortable repose the voyages and journeys which he undertakes the councils in which he presides the armies which he commands the battles which he fights the hazards which he runs for the preventing of ours do speak him a loving vigilant and active prince

thirdly there is reason the peoples joy should be very great in the prince's salvation when their religion is dear to him and lieth near his heart
it is a very sad and dreadful thing when the king is an utter and sworn adversary to that pure and excellent religion which is so precious in itself and in the eyes of his people as that they value it at a greater

rate than all their temporal enjoyments yea than their very lives
how sad is it when the prince's design is to deliver the ark a captive into the hands of the philistines upon the taking whereof the subjects would as once the wife of phineas did cry out and name the land ichabod because the glory is departed from it
it was sad when a jeroboam would not permit the children of israel to go and worship at jerusalem the city of the great king where god placed his name and therefore to be the city of their solemnities but laid snares for them upon mizpah and spread nets upon mount tabor to catch them and also set up his calves at dan and bethel for them to pay homage to and by that means made them to sin such an one wheresoever he is found deserves to be counted the plague and curse of the people who turns his own back upon true religion and not only so but encourageth others to do the like by making them the objects of his favour and that the highway to preferment neither is that all but will with violence and fury compel or ruine those that do refuse to follow his pernicious ways
god grant this poor nation which hath been long contending with difficulties and troubles may never have such a bramble for a king to reign over it

blessed be god our king is of the same holy religion with ourselves he hath not given his power to the beast but is a follower of the lamb
he serves that god whom we call father rejoyceth in that christ jesus who is our prince and saviour doth receive and own the same scriptures which we do for the perfect rule of faith and manners

performs the same worship with us for the substance of it gives liberty to all that fear god and will be peaceable in the land is himself tender over tender consciences and instead of setting up mischief by a law hath by law as we to our ease and comfort see given them protection and encouragement opening unto them by a gracious hand a wide door though there be many adversaries to whom it is an
the good lord grant that none might be able to shut it and that all might be made so wise as not to abuse it

it is great a very great mercy to a protestant people to have a protestant king and queen set over them and this is the mercy which our god hath now extended to this sinful unworthy and provoking nation and oh that it may be continued to us and blessed for ever blessed be his holy name that it hath been continued to us so long and upon that account let us heartily rejoyce in their salvation

fourthly the salvation of the prince is to be looked upon by the people as matter of great joy when it hath been a salvation from great and eminent dangers the greater the dangers have been the greater is the deliverance and the greater the deliverance is the greater should the rejoycing be so far as our ability reacheth there ought to be some proportion between the receipt and the return
we shall be too low when we rise up to our highest it is a shame for them to content themselves with doing little things for god for whom god hath been pleased to do great things
david took special notice of this as to himself in the psal
great deliverance giveth he to

his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed
doubt not but we may say our king is god's king
god hath set his king upon the throne in these nations he was raised up and sent to us by god he was called and spirited by god he was advanced over us as by the general choice and consent of the people so by a special and mighty hand of god it was the lord's doing and well may it be marvellous in our eyes psal
and great deliverance hath god given to his king
let the king remember and with all humility own what followeth that god sheweth mercy to his anointed
though he hath deserved great things of us yet nothing of god he hath deserved a crown of us but not a a crum of god of us he hath highly merited but not of god psal
lord said the king my goodness extendeth not to thee
his deliverance was a great mercy and we may well call it a great mercy because it was a great deliverance great it was in itself and great hope it will be in its effects
may proud and cruel lewis feel it so

it was a multiplied deliverance a repeated salvation not only from one single danger but from several there was a complication of them some of them are known and are there not more unknown it is like the devils name legion may very fitly be given them for they are many
something we are made acquainted with by the royal proclamation
a preservation of their majesties government notwithstanding the designs and attempts of their open and secret enemies though their government hath been so just that it pleaseth good men and so mild that it might attract and reconcile bad men yet still they have their enemies
there are those that rather than they

will not be enemies to our king and queen will fall out with reason and be enemies to themselves and their own interest and we may be sure they are not without their design because they are wicked nor without their attempts because they are restless
and there are too many of both sorts for certain more than are good
abundance of open enemies the god of heaven fight against them abundance of secret enemies the lord discover them and either change their hearts or blast and confound them both
great deliverance the king had from many and great dangers of war in his late expedition beyond the seas when swords were drawn against him bullets flew thick about him and he was the principal mark they levelled and aimed at besides there was the defeat of an horrid and barbarous conspiracy for the cutting off his sacred person and putting a period to his precious life by assassination
hell and rome and france have been busie at work and god knoweth how many more of the divel's imps concurr'd and joyn'd with them
but his and our god hath had an eye upon him for good delivering him from bloudy and violent men and giving him the shield of his salvation his right hand hath holden him up
this one thing being well and throughly consider'd will do much to the inlarging of our hearts in praises and oh that they may be so this day and longer too

fifthly the prince's salvation well may yea and ought to be by the people looked upon as great matter of their rejoycing when much exceeding much depends upon his life
who is there that can tell or conceive what never enough to be lamented changes

and alterations would have attended his miscarriage what a dismal catastrophe would there have been upon his dissolution how many pale faces aking hearts in these three nations what floods of tears wringing of hands and trembling of limbs would have followed not only here but in all places where the everlasting gospel is in estimation and on the other side what te deams and triumphs in france what insultings healthings and huzza's among the atheists papists prophane debauchees and vilest of men among us had our implacable enemies prevailed against him they would not have question'd the working their will upon us had he not returned in safety and with honour to us we might have bid a sad farewel to our religion peace prosperity all that we can call good and wished for death rather than life seeking ease and rest in the silent and lonely grave which we could not possibly have enjoyed above ground
his fall would have shaken all the protestant princes and states in the world and made so great a gap and wide a breach among ourselves as that an inundation of evils would suddenly have broken in upon us and we been deluged with all sorts of miseries which it is in the power of prevailing and enraged enemies to bring upon the people of their wrath
that was a notable expression of david psal
the earth and all the inhabitants of it are dissolved
his meaning is they were so in the time of saul who was wicked himself remiss in his government and suffered the reins to lie loose and men to take the bit in their mouths and run into what villanies they pleased all was turned into disorder and dissoluteness from the throne of god

and the the lamb revel
there proceeds a pure river clear as chrystal but from the throne of saul there came a stream as black as hell which poysoned the country
there was no care taken of religion nor of the due administration of justice and so both place and people were ready to sink under the weight of their iniquities but david came in and set his shoulder to it bear up the pillars of it
am the basis that doth uphold those things upon which the earth should stand and without which kingdoms must and will fall into decay and ruine
make it my business to reduce all into order to set and keep matters in a due frame and posture by a regular and religious government and upon this account also blessed yea for ever blessed be the father of mercies for putting his everlasting arms under our king and queen and for bearing them up who bear up the pillars of our country without this we should soon have had among us a terrible earthquake to an utter overthrow
but once more

sixthly it is most certainly the peoples duty to increase their joy in the lord upon the prince's salvation when it doth not come alone but attended with a great and lovely train and bringeth other choice and desirable mercies in its company when it is usher'd in by some and followed by others so that we may say behold a troop cometh had there been no more than the single deliverance and preservation of our king who in our quarrel ventur'd himself in the high places of the field and upon the mighty waters we should have been mightily concerned in it and therefore greatly obliged to bless god but as

affliction doth not use to go alone so neither did this mercy god hath compasted us with favours and laden us with benefits of which we may well be glad
how precious have his thoughts been concerning us and how open his hand of bounty to us who can tell the number of the former or measure the largeness of the latter day unto day hath shewn his love and night unto night his faithfulness
take a few instances and set a mark upon them how gracious hath god been in the preservation of our queen let us give him the glory of that and of his directing and assisting her in a most prudent most just and most gracious administration of government
his mercy in the late earthquake that he did so gently shake his rod over us and not stir up all his wrath nor rise up to that height of severity which he had used a little before upon jamaica but only shewed us what he could do and we deserved still drawing out upon us a longer line of life and tranquility and giving us space for repentance
mercy in continuing the peace of the nation so that none have been able to disturb or interrupt it
mercy in his gracious presence with you of this great city in the choice of your magistrates under whose conduct we may promise our selves encouragement of them that do well and the suppression of those crying abominations which have abounded among us
and likewise wonderful mercy in that great and signal victory given to their majesties navy over the french fleet whereby the marine power of that cruel nimrod was greatly shaken and shatter'd and his intolerable pride may well be abated
neither may we forget or in silence pass by that seasonable weather which was given to the laborious

but then sorrowful for the gathering in the fruits of the earth when the great and continued rains had threatned us and some begun to hoard up corn and most did apprehend a scarcity approaching and at the very door
shall bind these up together our king hath had salvation abroad our queen been blest and made a blessing at home our forces have been crown'd with victory our land enjoyeth peace when neighbouring countries have been the seat of a devouring war we have plenty as well as peace yea and the true religion and and ordinances to sweeten all the rest
for all this praise the lord england praise thy god london whose name alone is excellent and his glory above the earth

in the next place we are to consider what should be the qualifications what the properties of this joy and that shall do in these three things

our joy ought to be an hearty joy not feigned but real not hypocritical but sincere the joyful sound we make ought not to be an empty sound
it is an impossible thing to deceive god and a dangerous thing to moek him do not you mock him in your meeting together at this time
wish none might be guilty of it though fear some will who for example sake because others do so or out of fear and to avoid suspicion will go to church somewhere or other and sit out the publick worship though very uneasily and as upon thorns and then go to the tavern and meet their vain companions and with them drink confusion to their majesties sacred persons

and health to their enemies
let not such guilt come upon any one here before the lord whose eye is upon you that pure and peircing eye which searcheth the hearts and looks for truth
what you do this day do it as to the lord as in the sight of god be affected indeed with this salvation and with these mercies and with the great goodness of god in them and be thankful indeed
the apostle tells you your love must be such not in word and in tongue viz only but in deed and in truth
call upon yourselves as that holy man did psal
bless the lord my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord my soul and forget not all his benefits
or let me bespeak you in those words which you have in the psal
glory ye in his holy name and let the heart of them rejoyce that seek the lord
you have been a seeking people you have fought the lord his face and favour and strength you have been seeking frequently earnestly you have been seeking the lord on the behalf of your king and queen we have done it frequently earnestly together and apart many and many a prayer we have lifted up to heaven for them and god hath graciously heard us and been found of us our king hath found god near to him and round about him
he hath been followed and guarded with an army of prayers and he hath been brought home to us in the arms of prayer now as you have been hearty in your praying make sure that you be so likewise in your rejoycing let the hearts of them rejoyce that have sought the lord
it is as the prayer so the praise of the upright that is god's delight
it is an harmony between the heart and the lip a consent and agreement between the

inward affections and outward expressions that makes melody in the divine ears
therefore that request in the
psal
let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy sight lord my strength and my redeemer

ii
our joy must not be light and frothy but a solid ioy there is such a laughter as solomon called madness with it persons that are sober and in their wits should have nothing to do
some cannot be merry without ranting let them do so without you
do not now condemn nor speak the least syllable against those outward expressions of joy which are in use among us and unquestionably lawful no no let the bells ring and the canons roar and your bonfires flame let there be the sound of the trumpet and instruments of musick
but do not any of you mingle any thing of wilful sin with these innocent and very becoming signs of joy do not speak your thanksgivings in the language of hell away with all swearing and cursing and excess all drunkenness and debauchery
these things would be the sacrifice of fools and not of a sweet savour in god's nostrils they would indeed go up as pillars of smoak but not perfum'd with myrrh and frankincense and all the powders of the merchant
while we are pleased beseech you let not god be provoked by us lest he quickly distributes sorrows in his anger and turn our mirth into mourning
make it appear to all that while you are chearful and pleasant there is the awe of god upon you remembring the command given forth by an holy person divinely inspired psal
serve the lord with fear and rejoyce with

trembling
not as slaves but as children that know their father's greatness and their own duty
true joy is a grave and severe thing and doth not admit of what is childish for that lessens it nor of what is prophane for that doth corrupt it
keep all your festival days like christians not like heathens let holiness to the lord be written upon them
may a vein of godliness run thorough all your actions but do nothing contrary to the principles and rules of morality
when you have put on your white and beautiful garments do all you can to keep them clean do not contract dirt and filth upon them for let me tell you that which is to day a spot upon your garment may another day prove a wound in your consciences
oh therefore after you have been here offering praise to god do not go away and offer affronts to him
may that abide upon you with a commanding power which you find in the psal
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will shew the salvation of god
let god see that which pleaseth him and you shall see that which will comfort you
in this way you shall see more temporal salvations and you will have need of them and at last you shall have an eternal one

iii
our joy in the king's salvation ought to be a well regulated well govern'd joy give it its full scope but still keep it in its right place and within its due bounds
god would not have you honour him with stoln goods but hates robbery

for a and for certain he is as much against sacrilege his soul loathing them that would go about to take the crown off his head and set it upon a creatures
therefore let your joy in the king's life health and safe return be subordinate to your joy in god love the king and queen dearly but love god more for he is infinitely better than they honour them but give god a greater honour for he is the king of kings and the highest of them are his servants rejoyce in them but most in god make him your exceeding joy the gladness of your rejoycing
let us bless god for establishing their throne but let none go about to set them or either of them in god's throne
remember that of our precious saviour which is counsel worthy of the author give unto cesar the things which are cesar's and to god the things which are god's
our king is a great king and he is a good king a singular blessing to us yet he is but a man a frail man a mortal man subject to errours mistakes and passions who would soon faint and sink if god did not uphold him quickly swerve and wander if god did not guide him
the sence of this put solomon upon asking wisdom of god kings
am but a child know not how to go out or come in give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that may discern between good and evil
some have been so vain foolish and absurdly wicked as to turn princes into idols so must not you for doing so will be a mischief to yourselves and no kindness at all to them acts
herod arrayed in royal apparel

and sitting on his throne made an oration thereupon the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of a man
but it had been better for him if they had been silent or he had sharply reproved them for immediately the angel of the lord smote him and he was eaten of worms
cursed is the man that trusteth in man glorieth in man and maketh flesh his arm as for us let us trust in the lord and that for ever since in the lord jehovah is everlasting strength
proceed to the use which shall divide itself into five branches

first do you this day put that in practice which my text tells you the church had in her resolution god even our god hath graciously commanded deliverance salvation for our king and for our queen he hath been the securing comforting shadow and saving strength of his anointed now let his high praises be in our mouths let us compass him about with songs of deliverance it is god that giveth salvation to kings and covered his servant's head in the day of battle and deliver'd him from the hurtful sword
his gracious eye hath been upon him for good while the malicious eyes of his enemies have been against him for evil
let us there therefore put on our garments of praise which are indeed beautiful garments and comely for the upright
let us make melody in our hearts to the lord and come before his presence with thanksgiving
the mercy calls for it our king and queen call for it our own interest doth oblige to it and god expects

it at our hands let us now answer the calls on earth and the expectations of heaven and in order thereunto look diligently upon the mercy study it well labour to see it through and through in the largeness of its extent in the greatness of its beauty and glory
thereby our hearts may come through the concurrence of a divine influence to be duly affected with it and greatly inlarged oh that none of us here may be found empty before the lord but every one provided of such a sacrifice to lay upon his altar as he will not despise but accept having a respect to our persons and to our offerings as he had to abel's yea earnestly intreat that you together with me would use greatest care to offer up this day such praises to god as he may call a glorifying of him

secondly let us accompany and follow our praises to god for the salvation which hath been already commanded with prayer for further salvation as need shall require and for more and more blessings upon him upon them both sor they will stand in need of more they have an absolute dependence upon him and cannot be without him one day should he depart from them their strength would be weakness their counsels folly and all their endeavours unsuccessful
god hath store of salvations by him and a multitude of tender mercies and can send down showers of blessings and he is willing so to do for he doth not faint under works of power nor is he weary of acts of kindness
but still we must seek him for he

loves to be enquired of by the house of israel
let us therefore pray for our king and queen heartily constantly every day while they are thinking consulting ordering caring spending venturing themselves for us it is our unquestionable duty to be praying for them
let us do it now and hold on in doing it
praise and prayer are good in company when we with joy draw waters out of the well of salvation we must let down our buckets for more and since god hath set a crown of pure gold upon their heads let them still joy in his strength and through the mercy of the most high let them not be moved let them be prevented compast followed with the blessings of goodness let them have honour and majesty laid upon them and be made glad with the light of his countenance let the right hand of god find out their enemies that hate them and make them as a fiery oven in the time of his anger the good lord cloath their enemies with shame but upon their heads let the crown flourish

thirdly make their work as easie to them as ever you can
you all see the height of their station and how much god hath advanced them above others but you do not know the difficulties they meet with in it crowns do glister but they are very heavy
it is no easie thing to manage such a trust and sit at the helm of three kingdoms
you that have but little families do know it is an hard matter to provide for them rightly to govern them and to keep all things in them in a due order by that judge what it is to look after care for direct and rule such great bodies

let us make it our business to render their work as facil and delightsul as we can and surely it is highly reasonable that every one should contribute his utmost toward it
while it is our unanimous desire they should make their government as easie to us as they can shall we not make it as easie to them as we can and then we shall do so when we are a quiet and people when we are a loving and loyal people when we are an united people away with discontent and variance with discord and quarrels and grumblings without cause or for trifles or for such things as are unavoidable
let their majesties see that ye love them and are at peace among yourselves how sweet and pleasant will it be to them to find they have a room in your hearts and that you have a brotherly kindness for one another and why not though there are and will be difference of judgment and consequently of practice in some things yet there may and should be an uniting in affection men may walk divers ways without punching one another

fourthly be ready to assist them to your power in the natural body the hands and feet and all the members will contribute all they can to the service of the head so it ought to be in the body politick
accordingly let all do the duties of their places single persons theirs let them order and govern themselves masters of families theirs let them wisely rule their own houses magistrates in cities towns and countries up their places judges theirs ministers and people theirs persons in ecclesiastical civil military employments theirs

that is an healthful body of which all the parts are fit for and bufie at their several functions
the doing of this will lighten the princes load and remove many rubs out of their way assist them then with your persons one would think the gallantry of an english spirit should scorn to wait for a press when the service of the king and country calls you out much more to flee and hide from it my heart is toward them among the people that offer themselves willingly said brave debora judges
and let all that are able too assist with their purses
why such discontent because of the taxes are they unnecessary can they be avoided can a war be maintained without charge a navy and army be kept up with nothing will souldiers and seamen venture their limbs and lives for nothing or is it fit they should who can see by your garbes and tables that you are by the taxes which of you fares the coarser for them or goes the meaner but what are these taxes to what those poor countries suffer that are the seat of the war what to military execution do you pay more than the gospel is worth more than the honour of your wives and daughters is worth more than your peace and liberty are worth think it better to pay half what you have than lose all as thousands have and you will if under a french power

lastly do not you expose their majesties to danger by your follies we are now rejoycing for their salvation and other mercies shewn to them and us in them let us not when we have done go and sin

both them and us into misery and ruine
know as a people may suffer for the sins of a king so aegypt did for the stubbornness of pharoah yea and israel too for david numbring the people so may a king suffer for the sins of the people it was unto the people samuel spake those words sam


if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your king
let us all therefore take heed to ourselves let us break off our sins by repentance and be a reformed and holy people so walking as to please god and honour the gospel then it will be well with us and our king and queen

amen
the end

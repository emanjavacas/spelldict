a specimen of the rhetorick candour gravity and ingenuity of wi williams speaker to the late house of commons at westminster in his speech to sir robert peyton when he expell'd him that house

you are absolutely the worst of men

and have committed the greatest of offences for which you deserve to be obliterated from the knowledge of all being of a base and timerous spirit you have endeavoured to cast the damnable plot upon the most innocent of his majesties subjects

even those friends who chose you to sit in this honourable house

you have disgraced the honour of your family brought such perpetual ignominy upon your self as can never be retrieved
you have forsaken god and your country

and satan being your director you have imagined contrived and endeavoured to bring popery into this kingdom by the vilest ways the devil and the pope could assist you withal

you have been out of measure ungrateful and fled from the principles of all honest men cannot call you fallen angel for you have been a devil from the beginning

and to bring your diabolical purpose to pass you have consulted the devil gadbury and hugg'd the witch celliers and have been a true hypocrite

and plaid a prize with religion for advantage
but why should say religion when you never had any but were ever a profuse rolling hero having nothing now left you but the shape of a man whereby you are become nauceous to this house

and therefore they now spew you out

sacramentorum encomium or the praise of the sacraments in a letter written in the year to the preacher then at barham in the county of kent the holy sacraments from a great number of godly souls unless they would subject themselves against laws and good conscience to a rigid presbyterian government
wherein the said government is plainly and undeniably proved to be of all other the most injurious to the magistrate most oppressive to the subject published by a member of the parish of barham for the satisfaction of all subjects and good christians

the prophet is the snare of a fowler in all his ways hosea

london printed in the year



sir

the eye of the world hath now twice made his progress through all his degrees and you having received of the parishioners of barham since you came hither well nigh so many pounds as there are degrees for his orb to move in during all which we a considerable number of the same parish having with no ordinary as we and others too conceive expected that you should administer the holy and saving ordinances of our most blessed lord and saviour jesus christ amongst us but to our wonderment and greif finding so great we will not yet say wilful neglect in you therein do now not out of any humour of opposition or cavelling with you qualities which become not the servants of our lord and master who is the

prince of peace but out of a sincere and hearty affection to the glory of almighty god and the welfare of our souls in all and meekness of spirit earnestly desire implore you from the very bottom of our hearts as you are a minister of jesus christ if as truly sent amongst us as never chosen by us or liked of us that you will not defraud us of that which we conceive belongs to us our children is no less then the holy sacraments ordained by the lord jesus himself till the time of his second cing

in this manifestation of our thoughts and desires you cannot expect from us plain any rhetorical florishes any depth of humane learning any wisdome such as is that of the world these faculties as they are above the sphaere of our capacities so are they far beneath the level of our desires for we seriously confess we covet not the excellency of enticing words or of the wisdome of the men or princes of the world but that which we daily and hourly beg for is that we may receive the spirit of god thereby to know christ crucified and seasonably to apply his merits to our souls by participation of

him in his holy sacraments

we know that the world knew not god in the wisdome of god that natural man perceiveth not nor indeed can he perceive the things of the spirit of god
we also know that not many wise men not many mighty not many noble no not many princes of the world hath god chosen to be his favourites but that he hath made choise of the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and the weak things of the world to confound the mighty and the vile things of the world and things which are despised and things which are not to bring to nought things that are amongst which foolish and weak things we ranck our selves neither having attained to nor indeed much affected the wisdome of the world or excellency of words
god he knows our meaning is honest and very plain and we shall sincerely propose our very hearts and thoughts to you

we truly confess we speak to your honor we have not observed any of those vices of drunkenness or prodigallity in you which too too much abound in some men we do as cordially wish that spiritual

pride secret malice and immoderate covetousness affections which many times are too too predominant in the saints themselves may not take up any lodging in the chambers of your as we hope sanctified heart yet we must really tell you we cannot but wounder with what face with what reason with what conscience you could impose or suffer your self to be imposed upon a people which it should seem you esteem to be no better then infidels or dogs for upon what other ground we are to seek why you should refuse to give that which is holy unto us we have not as yet denyed to give you temporal things the fruits of the labour of our hands the sweat of our browes the issue of our brains why should you withold from us those which are spiritual why should you keep back from us those tokens which our lord and master hath left for us we beseech you tell us do you think it your whole duty to get up into the pulpit and there only preach unto us and by vertue thereof to extort tythes from us in sober sadness is there nothing else in your opinion required of a minister of jesus christ are there no signs and seals of

the covenant of grace to be delivered by you to us is it therefore you refuse to do it because you may think there be some amongst us that have been railors drunkards wantons fornicators adulterers or covetous persons why though not guilty we can say it is to be feared such were some of you and if you be now washed sanctified and justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of god who knoweth but by the same spirit we may be in the like manner washed sanctified and justified and if so or desire to be so pardon us if we importune the seals of grace which may conduce to our future glory

but if you think us like turks jews and heathen unworthy of them tel us so if not why have you witheld them from us all this while if you will not give them us but necessitate us to seek for them elsewhere we then desire you to set down your reasons under your hand in the mean while we demand of you with what conscience or honor you can refuse to restore back to the poorer sort amongst us out of that great income you receive those moneyes they have been forced to expend

upon other ministers for doing that which we conceive of right belonged you to do we say great income because it is great in it self greater in respect of the very little content you give us for when we stedfastly look upon you and behold you like janus to have two faces with the one looking earnestly toward our tithes without any regard to the sacraments with the other toward womens weuld we cannot apprehend you to be other then some strange minister we will not say monster rushed in amongst us and indeed such an one as neither we nor our ever saw in barham before

none of your predecessors some of whom without all peradventure were pious and learned men

ever like unto your self denyed the sacraments unto us they knew them to serve as bonds of obedience to god strict obligations to the mutual exercise of christian charity provocations to godliness preservations from sin memorials of the principal benefits of christ annexed for ever unto the new testament as other rites were before with the old they knew them to be warrants for the more security of our belief

marks of distinction to seperate gods own from strangers heavenly ceremonies sanctified by god himself and ordained to be administred in his church as signs to know whereby god doth impart the vital or saving grace of christ unto all that are capable thereof and as means which god requireth in them unto whom he imparteth grace
for sith god in himself is invisible and cannot by us be working therefore when it seemeth good in the eyes of his heavenly wisdome that men for some special intent and purpose should take notice of his glorious presence he giveth them some plain and sensible token whereby to know what they cannot see
for moses to see god was imposible yet

moses by fire knew where the glory of god extraordinarily was present
the

angel by whom god endued the waters of the pool called bethesda with supernatural vertue to heal was not seen of any yet the time of the angels presence known by the troubled motions of the waters themselves
the apostles

by fiery tongues which they saw were admonished when the spirit

which they could not behold was upon them
in like manner it is with us christ and his holy spirit with all the blessed effects though entring into the soul of man we are not able to apprehend or express how do notwithstanding give notice of the times when they use to make their access because it pleaseth almighty god to communicate by sensible means those blessings which are incomprehensible
our predecessor knew the necessity of receiving the sacraments that grace is a consequent of them a thing which accompanieth them as their end that it is not gods ordinary will to bestow the grace of the sacraments on any but by the sacraments which grace also they that receive by sacraments or with sacraments receive it from him and not from them they knew that saving grace which christ originally is or hath for the general good of the whole church he severally deriveth every member thereof by sacraments and that they serve as the instruments of god to that end and purpose

moral instruments the use whereof is in our hands the effect in his they knew that for the use of them we have his express commandment

for the effect his promise so that without our obedience to the one there is of the other no apparant assurance and we are not to doubt but that they really give what they promise and are what they signifie they knew that the sacraments are not bare resemblances or memorials of things absent or naked signs and testimonies assuring us of grace received but as they are indeed and in verity means effectual whereby god when we take the sacraments delivereth into our hands that grace available unto eternal life which grace the sacraments signifie or represent and are they such effectual means are they necessary to salvation are they by god himself for ever annexed unto the new testament how great then is the neglect how great the offence how detestable the wilfulness of those men who though impowred set apart in a great measure for that purpose and required by god himself to communicate them in order to the salvation of his people shall notwithstanding be careless in performance of his will yea peremptorily deny to put his most sacred and saving ordinances in execution

hath the great judg of all the world said

that

unless a man be born of water the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven except you eat of the

flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you and hath the mirror of piety and learning affirmed that we may with consent of the whole world

conclude the sacrament of baptism and the supper of the lord to be necessary the one to initiate or begin the other to consummate and make perfect our life in christ who then can imagine otherwise but great must be the ignorance or obstinacy of those kind of men who deny the administration of those heavenly mysteries which are so necessary to eternal life

for as concerning the sacrament of baptism in the first place we believe as we are not naturally men without birth so neither are we christian men in the eye of the church of god but by new birth nor according to the manifest ordinary course of divine dispensation new born but by that baptism which both declareth and maketh us christians in which respect we justly hold it to be the door of our actual entrance into gods house the first apparant begining life a seal perhaps to the grace of election

before received to our sanctification here a step which hath not any before it

the law of christ tyeth all men to receive this baptism expresly specified by water and the spirit water as duty required on our parts the spirit as a gift god bestoweth for unless as the spirit is a necessary inward cause so water were a necessary outward means to our regeneration what construction should we give unto those words to be new born and that even of water why are we taught

that with water god doth purifie and cleanse his church wherefore do the apostles of christ term baptism

a bath of regeneration what purpose had they in giving men advice to

receive outward baptism and in perswading them it did avail to remission of sins if then christ himself who giveth salvation do require baptism it is our duty who look for salvation seriously to do that which is required and religiously to feare the danger which may grow by the want thereof and it behooveth all ministers of the gospel of jesus christ who have any fear of god in their hearts and care of delivering mens souls

from sin to teach men the necessity thereof not omit when ocasion is offered this their necessary duty in their own persons
for though we grant that those sentences which make sacraments most necessary to eternal life are no prejudice to their salvation that want them by some inevitable necessity and without any fault of their own yet we say it ought in reason to be acknowledged likewise that for as much as the lord himself maketh baptism necessary necessary whether we respect the good received by it or the testimony yeilded unto god of that humility and meek obedience which reposing wholy it self on the absolute authority of his commandment and on the truth of his heavenly promise doubteth not but from creatures despicable in their own condition and substance to obtain grace of inestimable value or rather not from them but from him yet by them as by his appointed means and howsoever he by the secret wayes of his own incomprehensible mercy may be thought to save without baptism this cleareth not the church from guiltiness of blood if through her superfluous scrupulositie lets and impediments

of less regard should cause a grace of so great moment to be witheld wherein our merciless strictness may be our own harm although not theirs towards whom we shew it and we for the hardness of our hearts may perish albeit they through gods unspeakable mercy may live

god which did not afflict that innocent whose circumcision moses had overlong deferred was about to have killed

moses himself for the injury which was done through so great neglect giving us thereby to understand that they whom gods own mercy saveth without us are on our parts notwithstanding and as much as in us lyeth even destroyed when under unsufficient pretences we defraud them of such ordinary outward helps as we should exhibit
not that we hereby make baptism a cause of grace but say that the grace whch is given with baptism doth so far forth depend on the outward sacrament that god will have it embraced not only as a sign or token what we receive but also as an instrument or mean whereby we receive grace

and as concerning the sacrament of the lords supper we say that he which

hath said of the one sacrament wash and be clean hath said concerning the other eate and live
life being therefore proposed unto all men as their end they which by baptism have laid their foundation and attained the first beginning of a new life have here their nourishment and food prescribed for the continuance of life in them
such as will live the life of god must eat the flesh and drink the blood of the son of man because this is a part of that diet which if we want we cannot live whereas therefore in our infancy we are incorporated into christ and by baptisme receive the grace of his spirit without any sence or feeling of the gift which god bestoweth in the eucharist we so receive the gift of god that we know by grace what the grace is which god giveth us the decrees of our increase in holiness and vertue we see and can judge of them we understand that the strength of our life began in christ is christ that his flesh is meat and his blood is drink not by surmized imagination but truly even that through faith we perceive in the signs of the body and blood sacramentally presented the very taste of eternal

life the grace of the sacrament is here as the food which we eat and drink
the sacrament is a true and real participation of christ who thereby imparteth himself even his whole intire person as a mystical head into every soul that receiveth him and every such receiver doth thereby incorporate or unite himself unto christ as a mystical member of him yea of them also whom he acknowledgeth to be his own
and to whom the person of christ is thus communicated to them he giveth by the same sacrament his holy spirit to sanctifie them as it sanctifieth him which is their head and what merit force or vertue soever there is in his sacrificed body and bloud we freely fully and wholy have it by this sacrament the effect whereof in us is a real transmutation of our souls and bodies from sin to righteousness from death and corruption to immortality and life and though the sacrament it self be but a corruptible and earthly creature yet he by the strength of his glorious power will bring to pass that the bread and cup which he giveth us shall be truly the thing he promiseth

this sacrament keepeth christians in a continual remembrance of that propitiatory sacrifice which christ once for all offered by his death upon the cross to reconcile us to god he was himself once really offered and as oft as this sacrament is celebrated so oft is he spiritually offered by the faithfull
this sacrament confirmeth our faith for god by it doth signifie and seal unto us from heaven that according to the promise and new covenant which he hath made in christ he will truly receive into his grace and mercy all penitent believers who duly receive this holy sacrament and that for the merit of the death and passion of christ he will as verily forgive them all their sins as they are made partakers of this sacrament
it is also a pledg and symbole of the most neer and effectual communion which christians have with their head from which communion there followeth to the faithfull many inestimable benefits as his taking by imputation all their sins and guiltiness upon him to satisfie gods justice for them and he freely gives by imputation unto us all his righteousness in this life and all his right

unto eternal life when this is ended and counteth all the good or ill that is done unto us as done to his own person there likewise floweth from christ nature into our nature united unto him the lively spirit and breath of grace which reneweth us unto a spiritual life and so sanctifieth our minds wills and affections that we dayly grow more and more conformable to the image of christ he also bestoweth upon us all saving graces necessary to attain eternal life as the sence of gods love the assurance of our election with regeneration sanctification and grace to do good works
this sacrament also feeds the souls of the faithfull in the assured hope of life everlasting and withal doth seal unto them the assurance of the injoyment of that life
manna angels food fed the israelites forty years in the wilderness but behold a better food is prepared for them even the body and blood of our most blessed saviour the bread of life on which whosoever by a sincere and stedfast faith do feed it will nourish their souls for ever unto a blessed life without end in order to which it is an assured pledg of the spiritual resurrection of our

souls from the death of sin here and of the corporal resurrection of our bodies at the last day of the first resurrection our saviour hath said

he that eateth me even he shall live by me of the second he himself hath also said

he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and will raise him at the last day for this sacrament signifieth and sealeth unto us that christ died and rose again for us and that his flesh quickeneth and nourisheth unto eternal life and that therefore our bodies shall surely be then raised unto that life for seeing our head is risen all the members of the body shall likewise surely rise again for how can those bodies fed and nourished with the body and blood of the lord of life but be raised up with him again at that day unto life it being given by him for their eternal salvation

it was neither saint nor angel but the son of god himself who ordained this holy mystery and is the chiefest memorial left by him of our redemption our redemption which was the chiefest benefit that ever man needed from god or that god ever bestowed up on man and there

fore every christian should account this holy supper the chiefest and most joyful feast in this world and come unto it with praise and thanksgiving the sinner laying aside his sins must come to this feast the envious man his enmitie and come he that hath variety of secular imployments must lay aside his secular imployments and and come and converse with god
he that is well grounded in grace must come because he is excellently disposed to so holy a feast but he that is but in the infancy of his piety had need to come that so he may grow in grace the strong must come least they become weak and the weak that they may become strong the sick must come to be cured the healthful to be preserved they that have leasure must come because they have no excuse they that have no leasure must come hither that by so excellent religion they may sanctifie their business the penitent sinners must come that they may be justified and they that are justified that they may be justified still they that have fears and great reverence to these mysteries and think no preparation to be sufficient must receive that they may learn to receive

the more worthily and they that have a less degree of reverence must come often to have it hightned here are remedies for all sick and sorrowful sinners the very letter of the word of christ giveth plain security that these mysteries do as nails fasten us unto his very cross that by him we draw out as touching efficacy force and vertue even the blood of his gored side in the wounds of out redeemer we there dip our tongues we are dyed red both within and without our hunger is satisfied and our thirst for ever quenched they are things wonderful which he feeleth great which he seeth and unheard of which he uttereth whose souls is possest of this paschal lamb and made joyful in the strength of this new wine this bread hath in it more then the substance which our eyes behold this cup hallowed with solemn benediction availeth to the endless life and welfare both of soul and body in that it serveth as well for a medicine to heal our infirmities and purge our sins as for a sacrifice of thanksgiving which touching it sanctifieth it enlightneth with belief it truly conformeth us unto the image of jesus christ who by vertue of

his divine benediction with hands and eyes lifted up to heaven first blessed and consecrated those chosen elements of bread wine made them for ever instruments of life for the endless good of all generations how inexpressibly comfortable are the benefits devolved upon us hereby how infinite are the joyes such as eye hath not seen nor eare heard nor can enter into the heart of man prepared for the worthy receivers to such belongs life life indeed life everlasting with those is the tabernacle of god and god himself shall be their god and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes no more death no more sorrow no more crying no more pain shall trouble them he that is alpha and omega the beginning and the end will be their god and they shall be his sons they shall inhabit the great city the holy jerusalem enlightned with the glory of god and walled with a great and high wall founded upon twelve foundations garnished with all manner of precious stones and the names of the lambs twelve apostles the gates belonging to this city being no less in number then twelve and every one of them made of

pearl

and the pavement of it of pure gold a city having no need of sun or moon to shine in it having the glory of god to light it and the law to be the light of it to this city all the kings of the earth shall bring honor and glory and all those who religiously hunger and thurst after the body and blood of this lamb and worthily partake of it shall walk in the light of it and shall any hunger and thirst after this heavenly banquet shall some be set apart on purpose by an almighty gracious and liberal inviter freely to deliver it unto them and are all these mentioned benefits and priviledges yea heaven it self promised to them that hunger and thirst and partake of it and yet shall there be any who will not only wilfully neglect but also peremptorily deny to minister at this holy feast and thereby suffer the hunger and thirst of poor souls to remain unsatisfyed shall any in like manner whom our most mercifull saviour jesus christ hath commanded to suffer little children to come unto him for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven be so wickedly so maliciously bent so without all natural compassion

as to shut the door against those poor little infants deny them a little water sacramentally to wash away their sins with keep back from them the sign and seal of gods promise and as much as in them lieth put them out of the covenant of grace and thrust them into the wofull pit of everlasting perdition certainly if we had not seen such creatures with our eyes wee should hardly have believed our ears at any mens mentioning of them such there are amongst us and our children after us will declare the mighty work of division they have wrought in our days which they first prepared under colour of religion to accomplish their own crooked ends thereby
and these people do separate themselves from others desiring to be thought more holy then they
these the apostles long since foretold should come to deceive in the latter times they have thrust out pious and learned men out of their seats and exalted dunces and themselves in the room of them they have caused schismes and heresies amongst the people which happen by reason of our sins through the just judgment of our god wherewith from on high he hath

visited us by permitting those false lights to shine in these times of darkness to lead our feet out of the way of peace and deny us the holy sacraments which were ordeined for the remission of our sins such strange lights there are now and what makes them such semblably it is to be feared ignorant obstinacy and ends for who can imagine it to be other then ignorant obstinacy in these crabbed doctors who alledge no other then unsatisfactory reasons for their omission of holy and necessary duties as because forsooth the people whom they expect should do just as they would have them be it right or wrong will not presently go out of the old and instantly come into a new church way and that even before they are shewn what it is or where it lies or the contrivers of it themselves have thorowly agreed what it shall be a way which when by themselves as they may think perfected will in all likelyhood be as little liked of and followed by the most godly most wise and most learned men of this nation as it hath been practised by them since the time of our blessed saviors coming into

the world till the first year of liberty for every one to take upon him what religion he pleaseth broach what heresie he fancieth and be of what sect he conceiveth most to his own advantage

and is it any other then an unsatisfactory reason in those austere doctors which will not administer the holy sacrament of baptism to those children whose parents though visibly in the covenant of god and visible members of christs church though they acknowledg themselves to believe in him and by vertue of his merits to obtain everlasting life and though they desire to partake of his ordinances yet because they will not in every thing dance after their pipe will not have a hand with them in renting in pieces the seamless coat of their saviour will not apprehend all their errors to be truths will not suffer themselves to be rid upon by these unmercifull horsmen under pretence of church discipline will not break the bond of unity amongst themselves but maintain a sociable familiarity and sometimes as they have too too much cause speak against pharisaical practises yet because they will not confess all that

these teachers say to be true all that they practise to be good all that they would have done to be of absolute necessity to be done shall therefore be denied the benefit of the holy sacraments though accused by no other then themselves to be ignorant scandalous and scoffers at religion and hereupon be rejected as children of wrath plain aliens altogether without hope utterly without god in this present world
miserable were the condition of man if it were by a perpetual law established that these partial and rulers should be his accusers and judges
for should not god through his unspeakeable goodness shew mercy unto thousands of poor children whose remote forefathers loved him they must forever go without it for these men and all because their immediate parents were such as would not every way square themselves according to their wild fancies and unrectified judgments
but suppose those immediate parents were wicked indeed as they many times only pretend them to be so hath not god told them plain enough by the prophet ezekiel

that the child shall not suffer for

the iniquity of the father is it not evident that the children of wicked parents amongst the jews were circumcised and if so why may not children proceeding from the like parents of the christians be baptized sith it is not to be doubted his hand is not shortned and he hath given as large priviledges to us under the gospel as he gave to them under the law otherwise we should be loosers by the coming of christ which credat judaeus apella non nos though the circumcised jew will believe we will be far from giving credit to any such monstruous improbability

we read that saint john the baptist sprang for joy in his mothers womb at the salutation of the virgin luke
but are to seek for the cause of so great joy had his birth been so disadvantagious to him and others in that condition the coming of christ witness the testimony of an angel from heaven and the holy ghost bearing witness of the truth of that testimony was joyous to all

all sexes all conditions all ages advantagious to all even to infants
our most blessed saviour brought grace along with him grace and truth saith john

came

by with jesus christ grace in the superlative degree reaching spreading farther under the new then the old testament
the grace of god which bringeth salvation hath appeared saith the apostle

to all men i.e to all sorts of ages conditions of men
the grace of god in an ordinary dispensation was first appropriated to the jews they were then his favourites to whom his grace in christ was manifested but now that grace hath appeared to all men the grace of the gospel is more ample and every wayes greater grace then that before or under the law god having provided some better things for us saith the apostle

more greater and better privileges for us under the gospel then for them under the law and by consequence for the children of the christians then for the children of the jews which could not be if our children had not right to the covenant as well as theirs
had these teachers who are thus scrupulous in administring this holy ordinance perused and minded holy and learned perkins his works as much as they use to read and and study the noval and schismatical pamphlets of the time they might have been

taught by him that the children of parents that are professed members of the church though cut off for a time upon some offence committed have right to baptism because it is not in the power of man to cut them off from christ though excommunicated which being so why may not the children descending from parents though in their persons wicked not excommunicated have right to the sacred ordinance of baptism sith those of the very excommunicated in the judgment of so profound a master as perkins have right thereunto

but behold the opinion by the practice of a greater then perkins even of john the baptist himself who baptized all that came unto him for his baptism mat
amongst others even those very pharisees and sadduces whom at the same time he called a generation of vipers mat
and the latter of whom denyed the resurrection it self

and as they are no other then unsatisfactory reasons which are given for not administring the holy sacrament of baptism what are they better which are rendred for their not admitting those that are religious and knowing christians to the supper of

the lord because peradventure there may be some in a parish who may be scandalous or ignorant or others who will refuse to make answer to some needless questions may be demanded by such as rake it to be a part of their function to make a deeper search into consciences then any law of god or reason of man inforceth and upon this denyal they shall be put off to another time from the mystery of heavenly grace though for piety and knowledge they be sufficiently capable in like manner others who deny not to submit themselves to this severe inquisition yet if they be persons any way distasted by them if these do not make answer iisàem terminis to that they would have them though in effect knowingly enough they shall notwithstanding be put off to farther tryal in which men although there should be found some weakness indeed as it is too too often only pretended there is yet should they in divers considerations be cherished according to the merciful example and precepts whereby the gospel of christ hath taught us towards such to shew compassion to receive them with lenity and all meekness if any thing be

shaken in them to strengthen it not to quench with delayes jealousies that feeble smoak of godliness which seemeth to breath from them but to build wheresoever there is any foundation and to add perfection unto slender beginnings and that as by other offices of piety so by the ordinances which christ hath left in his church not only for preservation of strength but also for relief of weakness

far differrent from these men was the practice of the church of corinth unto which it seems many came over from heathenism and as many as came in unto them all were admitted to their communion amongst whom some were such lukewarme christians that they were sometimes ready to go to their idols and sometimes to church to say nothing of those corinthians who were as it is to be doubted

given to strife envying wrath contentions backbiting whisperings pride and discord

and others of them who were given to uncleanness fornication and wantonness

and other some who were so scrupulous as to make a doubt of the resurrection it self

yet these idolatrous corinthians whom we shall also find mutinous

and even drunken together at this table whilst they are but willing to profess christ are admitted with the rest to the sacrament true it is they are reproved as they justly deserved to be so for their prophanation and directed to examine and carry themselves better for the future but as for their coming together and general participation that was but their duty and nothing said against it

and this general participation of the corinthians appears plainly by the sence of the words of the apostle to them

shewing them that all the israelites that passed thorow the sea and wilderness were admitted to both sacraments as well as they even those very scandalous ones with whom god was not well pleased but like to them destroyed in the wilderness yet it was a just punishment upon them when they ran to idols as they in like manner did and therefore bid them take heed and not think that they should escape gods judgments if they walked not answerable to their profession notwithstanding their admittance to the sacraments

and this is not only evident by the example of the corinthians and israelites

but by that notable one of our blessed saviour himself who admitted even judas that to the passover if not to his supper however it is the same in signification so that those who will not be otherwise moved to a more free admission of the sacrament then is of late dayes allowed of might very well be enduced to do it if not by what the corinthians and israelites did yet by the example of the son of god himself unless they will wilfully shut their eyes against that light which came into the world to illuminate all those who have a desire to see the right way and walk in it

and that some the sacraments from those they ought to minister them to may it not be doubted they do it out of selfish ends which if well looked into will prove the state of many questions which go under the notion of religion in these dayes as well as it hath in the times of old hence it is that they account they shall be the more sought unto the more held in reverence the more engrandize their power and hold men in obedience and slavery under them and they themselves be in subjection to none this selfishness

if thorowly searcht into will be found secretly to contain that poyson which hath so powerfully wrought upon the braines of so many presbyterians and other sectaries and caused them to cast so many stumbling blocks in the way and set so many fences between the people and the body of their saviour mistake us not we beseech you we mean not all but some of your profession hence is it that so many heart burnings so many contentions so many divisions hath happened between and as well as between them and the people however in this particular as herod and pilate though they differed otherwise yet agreed against christ so in this too too many of each sect joyn hand in hand in scrupuling to give the bread of life to poor sinners which might nourish and comfort their hungry souls unto life everlasting

but we hear you say if we will come under a presbyterial discipline you will administer the sacraments to us otherwise not

to this we demand of you would you have us to subject our selves to a discipline

against our consciences a discipline not established by law nor congruent to our liberty would you have us put our necks under the yoak of a discipline which we truly conceive hath been the anvil upon which so many engines have been framed which have so much battered down the quiet and peace both of church and state

have not the favourers of this discipline grasped at unlimited power such as neither deriveth its beginning nor willingly receiveth its commands from the magistrate whom they would have countenance them in all their actions and yet not allow of his rules and direction they would have him censure and condemn or others by his authority which is all one and yet will not allow him to know and judg they will call for his hand to strike and yet not allow him an eye to see

without offence be it in a good hour spoken we apprehend this discipline to be of all other most injurious to the magistrate most oppressive to the subject and most pernitious to both it is the very quintessence of refined pouery and a greater tyranny then ever rome brought forth inconsistent with all forms of civil

government destructive to all sorts of policy a rack to the conscience the heaviest pressure that can fall upon a people and so much the more dangerous because by the specious pretence of divine institution it takes away the sight but not the burden of slavery

how it is injurious to the magistrate appears by that little hath been said already but will farther appear


by overthrowing his rights in convocating synods to order ecclesiasticall affaires and reform the church within his dominions

by robbing him of the last appeal of his subjects

by exempting the ministers from due punishment

by subjecting the supream authority to their censures even to the highest censure of excommunication that very engine by which the popes exalted themselves above emperors

by robbing the magistrate of his dispensative power

by cheating him of his civil power in order to religion

by challenging an exorbitant power by divine right


and by making a very monster of the

and little more then a cypher of parliaments

all which are evidently demonstrated not by some extraordinary practises justified only by the pretence of invincible necessity a weak patrociny for general doctrine nor by the single opinions of some capricious fellows but by the scottish book of discipline by the acts of their general and provincial assemblies by the concurrent votes and writings of their commissioners as is exactly to be seen in the fair warning to take heed of this discipline by dr joh bromwel bishop of in ireland
and how it is oppressive to particular persons and full of rigor and like dracos laws that were written in blood it will appear by inflicting church censures upon slight grounds as for an uncomely gesture a vain word for suspition of covetousness or pride for superfluity of rayment either for cost or fashion for dancing at a wedding or of servants in the streets for wearing a mans hair al a mode they scarce allow a man a latitude of discretion in any thing all men even their superiors must be their

slaves or pupils
if a man will not confess himself a delinquent be sorry for giving the presbyters any offence and conform himself in his hair apparel diet every thing to what these cato's shall prescribe they will proceed against him to excommunication

by this discipline a man is punished twice for the same crime first by the magistrate according to the laws of god and the land for the offence then by the censures of the church for the scandal
to this agrees their synod nothing forbids the same fault in the same man to be punished one way by the political power another way by the ecclesiastical

by that under the formality of a crime with corporal or pecuniary punishment by this under the formality of scandal with spiritual censures

thus their liturgy in express terms all crimes which by the law of god deserves death deserves also excommunication
yea though an offender abide an assise and be absolved by the same yet may the church enjoyn him publick satisfaction
or if the magistrate shall not think fit in his judgment or cannot in prosecute the party upon the

churches intimation the church may admonish the magistrate publickly
and if no remedy be found excommunicate the offender first for his crime and then for his being suspected to have corrupted the judg
by which we observe how these severe disciplinarians bring all crimes whatsoever great and small within their jurisdiction how that a delinquents tryal for his life is no sufficient satisfaction to them and how that to satisfie their own humours they care not how they blemish publickly the reputation of the magistrate upon frivolous conjectures

and as they bring all crimes great and small so do they bring all degrees under their jurisdiction
the supreme magistrate shall be bearded and mated by every ordinary presbyter witness that insolent speech of mr robert bruce to king james sir see your resolution is to take huntley in favour if you do will oppose you shall choose whether you will lose huntley or me for us both you cannot keep
it is nothing with them for a pedant to put himself into the ballance with the prince and most potent peer of the realm
and as for the common people they shall have

an high commission in every parish and groan under the arbitrary decrees of ignorant unexperienced governors who know no law but their own wils who observe no order but what they list under these men parents shall lose the free disposition of their own children in marriage

if the child desire a husband or a wife and the parents their request and have no other cause then the common of men have to wit lack of goods or because the other party is not of birth high enough upon the childs desire the minister is to travail with the parents if he find no just cause to the contrary may admit them to the marriage for the work of god ought not to be hindred by the corrupt affections of worldly men
this doctrine is very high but their practice yet much more high for the presbyterians will compel the wronged parent to give that child as great a portion as any of his other children

all masters and mistresses of families of what age or condition soever must come once a year before the presbyter with their houshold to be examined personally whether they be fit to receive the sacrament in respect of their knowledg and

otherwise and if they suffer their children or servants to continue in wilful ignorance though they cannot help it they must undergo the severity and extreme rigor of their excommunication

after which sentence no person his wife and family only excepted may have any kind of conversation with him that is excommunicated they may not eat with him nor drink with him nor buy with him nor sel to him they may not salute him nor speak to him except it be by licence of the presbytery

his children begotten born after that sentence and before his reconciliation to christ may not be admitted to baptism until they be of age to require it or the mother or some special friend being a member of that church present the child abhorring and damning the iniquity and obstinate contempt of the father
and all this being not enough they proceed to an outlawing of the party and a confiscation of his goods and putting him out of the magistrates protection so as any man may kill him and be unpunished yea the party excommunicated is not so much as to attend or hear these fatal letters granted

and that the people may the more patiently

suffer all this harshness from them may the more quietly indure all their heavy oppressions and the more humbly submit themselves to all their rigid ordinances they perswade them that they are bound in conscience to hear and obey their voice and reverence the majesty of the son of god speaking in them for having made their consistories the tabernacles of christ they expect that their determinations shall pass for the sentences of christ and thus these proud vicars having mounted themselves aloft they sit upon the temple of god and exalt themselves above all that the scripture calleth god

and how can any man be so ignorant so stupid so void of reason as to think that these men can be led by an infallible spirit who in this manner like the lords of the heathen seek for dominion and power who aim at authority and rule in this world of which they cannot but know their masters kingdome is not who being puffed up with an unparallel'd pride have made themselves drunk with the spirit of antichrist and so drunk that they begin to stagger and are in danger of falling

down even level with the the ground

but sith they the better to support themselves from falling have thought fit to joyn unto them a sort of men whom they have christned by the name of lay elders and will have them looked upon as commissioners of christ we will let you know that we are not ignorant of the true reason of their annexing this conjunction copulative unto them for the politick projector and founder of this new discipline by name calvin a man famous for his great wisdome the more surely and easily to bring that beast of many heads the people to assent contribute their labour and endeavours towards the erecting of the building whereof he had before hand conceived an idea in his mind thought good to tender an offer to them plausible enough in outward shew that for every minister who should sit perpetual judg they should annually chuse two lay elders out of every parish amongst themselves and they to sit with them in the standing ecclesiastical court which was to be established to be judges together with them in the same and these two sorts should have a care of all mens manners

power of determining all kind of ecclesiastical causes and authority to convene to controul to punish as far as with excommunication whomsoever they should think worthy none either small or great excepted now the people who are ever taken and deluded with fair shews and to the worlds end will be so rather then realities conceiting this ods of two to one to be sufficient to remedy any inconvenience might arise by the ministry willingly enough embraced the offer and joyntly set to their helping hands and heads to bring the business to perfection and accordingly after no small opposition which was made by the wiser sort effected what they intended we say no small opposition for the more and men of profoundest judgment among the layty foresaw that this filling up of the seates in the consistory with so great a number of laymen was but to please the mind of the people to the end they might think their own sway somewhat but when things came to tryal of practice their pastors learning would be at all times of force to simple men who knowing the time of their own presidentship to be

but short would alwayes stand in fear of their ministers perpetual authority and hereupon professed with greater stomach their judgments that such a discipline was little better then popish tyranny disguised and tendered unto them under a new form
but how much soever the more prudential men gainsaid this upstart discipline yet certain it is in those times of distraction as the citty of geneva was then in as we have in like manner seen in these our dayes by woful experience

not the wise but the many like a boisterous torrent beares down all before them and to the disturbance of the world do what they list so they established this discipline
a discipline which they peremptorily affirmed to have been taught by christ and his apostles in the word of god and yet full fifteen hundred years have passed from the birth of our saviour till the setting up thereof and they cannot during all that time shew us one church upon the face of the whole earth which ever found out or erected it till this present time and now forsooth this discipline is become the scepter of christ the eternal gospel and where did this scepter lie

hid during all these hundreds of years that we cannot find out the least of it in the meanest village of christendome this world draws toward an end was this discipline fitted and contrived for the world to come or how can it be the eternal gospel

we should be injurious unto charity it self if we should affirm all these men who are of this stamp to have wilfully gone out of this right way into this labyrinth and accordingly to have led others a long with them in a maze or should surmise all those who have been misguided knowingly to continue in an error no we have a better opinion of some of them who no doubt have a conceit of the divinity of their discipline and yet are truly godly men in their hearts sincere in their affections upright in their meanings but we say certainly godly men in all ages have erred and without all peradventure so do the best of these and that the founder hereof himself was but a man we all know we no less know men are but men and humanum est errare what moved him at first to fancy this discipline and afterwards to establish it is to be seen at large in judicious hooker his preface

nature worketh in us all a love to our own counsels
the contradiction of others is a fan to in flame that love
our love set on fire to maintain that which once we have done sharpneth the wit to dispute to argue and by all means to reason for it wherefore a marvel it were if a man of so great capacity having such incitements to make him desirous of all kind of furtherances unto his cause could espie in the whole scripture of god nothing which might breed at the least a probable opinion of likelihood that divine authority it self was the same way somewhat inclinable
and all which the wit even of calvin was able from thence to draw by sifting the very utmost sentence and sillable is no more then that certain speeches there are which to him did seem to intimate that all christian churches ought to have their elderships endued with power of excommunication and that a part of those elderships every where should be chosen out from amongst the layty after that form which himself had framed geneva unto
but what argument can be shewn wherby it was ever prov'd by calvin that any one sentence of scripture doth necessarily inforce these things

and his followers who with all their learning have endeavoured to extol his tenents to the highest have notwithstanding acknowledged that with whom the truth is they know not neither do they all agree in one opinion and of them which are at agreement the most part through a courteous enducement have followed one man as their guide and that one man therein most assuredly hath swerved from the truth

and what can they be thought but selfseeking ends in some who when they know themselves infinitely short of that learning hath been in their predecessors and therefore not knowing how to get unto themselves fame by walking in the plain and beaten road leading to happiness marked out for them will attempt to get unto themselves a name by pretending to have found out a nigher way unto it then any else have done before them amuzing the unlearneder sort with a belief hereof get unto themselves followers after their own horrid inventions whom they entice into such a path as neither our blessed saviour nor any of his holy apostles ever traced out for them insensibly by degrees bring

them into such a labyrinth which when they are once entred into they become amazed and know not which way to get out of it and then run out of one error into another from bad to worse till at length they become as dreadful comets to all that behold them
these kind of pernicious leaders imitate him who knowing not by any other act set the temple of diana on fire with an intent to memorize themselves by that strange one

and what can be thought better of these than of that monster of men bernardinus ochinus whose zeal at the first seemed to be so violent as no former religious institution though never so rigorous was strict enough for him he from thence fell to be an heretick then a jew then a turk and last of all an atheist and then wrote a furious invective against the three grand impostors of the world amongst whom he horresco referens jesus the prince of peace saviour of mankind and moses as well as mahomet

and what can they be construed but self seeking ends in those men by whom those who are rich who are powerful and able to do either good or hurt though

they be as ignorant and scandalous to the world and perhaps more than those who are poor shall notwithstanding be diligently invited gladly received and earnestly entreated to partake of those comfortable mysteries and saving food which the redeemer of mankind hath prepared for all true believers without all peradventure in as large a measure for those indigent ones to whom the kingdome of heaven belongs as for those great ones who will find it easier for a camel to enter thorow the eye of a nedle than for the proud ever to come there

let this slie generation of men know who are guilty of this wilful omission and such as upon unwarrantable pretences deny the holy sacrament of baptism to those it belongs to and who thrust by hungry and thirsty souls from the saving banquet of of the lords supper who preferr obstinacy and selfish ends before the will of their lord and maker that though they may take to themselves the glorious name of gods dear children it is to be feared they may at last be found out to be children of belial in having in the day of their fast sought their own will rather than the will of their great commander

let them take heed that though in their own conceit they may be lifted up to heaven they be not brought down as low as hell for most assuredly it will be easier for those in the land of sodom in the day of judgment to enjoy the new jerusalem than for obstinate and hypocrites to come within the gates thereof

which kind of people profess to know god

but it is to be feared in their works deny him they shut up the kingdom of heaven before men going not in themselves nor suffering those that would enter to come in
they say stand apart

come not near to us for we are holier than you

yet they bend their tongues like bowes for lies and proceed from evil to worse

their lying lips are an abomination to the lord and their throats as open sepulchers

their hearts is as hard as the adamant stone and deceitful above all things

they are leaders of the people causing them to err and at last devour them

they lay wait as he that setteth snares and make nets to catch men

they have mens persons in admiration because of advantage

they draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin with cart ropes
they are much given to

be drunk with malice though not with wine and to stagger their heads being full of whimsies though not with strong drink which causeth them to be eagleeyed in spying the mote in their brothers eye and blind in beholding the beam that is in their own they are strainers at gnats and swallowers of camels

they hatch the cockatrice egs and weave the spiders web

they are as an unclean thing and their very righteousness as a filthy clout
from the least of them to the greatest they are commonly given to covetousness

and from the prophet to the priest they all deal falsly the prophets among them being a company of crafty fools and the spiritual men no less then mad
these are they which separate themselves from others walking after their own lusts murmuring complaining mocking and speaking evil even of those they know not
clouds they are without water carried about with every wind of doctrine favourers of damnable heresies raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandring stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever

but here by the by we desire there

may be notice taken that it is no part of our thought to bring within the circumference of this description of hypocrites any truly sincere and godly soul neither have we the least aim to any particular holy persons alive that we are acquainted withal and therefore if any shall account him or themselves deciphered hereby and thereupon take offence it must necessarily arise even in the opinion of all indifferent men from the check of his or their own restless consciences which we heartily wish had no just cause to accuse them as we are truly innocent of any intent of doing so

we leave this way of accusing censuring particular persons to that pharisaical generation of people who being rapt up by a spiritual kind of pride into the aëry region of a conceited degree of holiness in themselves do from thence look upon others as sensual polluted and wicked yea as dogs and swine altogether unworthy to eat with them either at their own or the lords table or so much as to come within the verge of their select company

we thank our god we have not in such

manner learned christ as to place our selves in the seat of the judg accuser censurer or scorner of our brethren we shall leave all men to the great day of judgment for who is he that dares anticipate that day and enter upon the throne of the great judg we confess that the serious acknowledgment of our own vileness makes us afraid at heart that we our selves are the greatest of sinners such as when we consider our own deservings we cannot but tremble with terror and amazement at the just and dreadful punishment due unto us for sin and hereby have learned to pity others as fellow sinners not think our selves too good to accompany them in civil or religious duties

wee do withgreif and shameconfess that we have erred willingly and strayed willingly from the wayes of our almighty and most merciful father and that more like untamed buls then lost and wandring sheep we have followed too much even altogether the absurd devices and brutish desires of our own hearts we have been offended against nay been offended at his holy most holy laws we have left undone not lone at all those things which we ought

to have done but insteed thereof done those things which we should not have done insomuch as there is no health no hope of health in us miserable most miserable and the greatest of sinners all which when we seriously lay to our guilty consciences how can we possibly preferr our own wicked and abominable selves whom we certainly know to be thus polluted and defiled before others whose hearts we are no way so able to search and dive into as we may into our own

and being in so great a measure sinful from the crown of our heads to the soles of our feet all over contaminated and infected in so much as no part of us remaineth sound we know no certain cure for our sick and wounded souls laden with so many and so grevious sins but to cast our selves into the arms of our most blessed redeemer and by a lively faith though we cannot as saints yet lay claim unto him as sinners as wounded and penitent sinners whom he came to save and his coming being to save such he will certainly afford the seals of his grace to such and having appointed the ministers of his gospel to deliver them to such we look

upon you mr barton if you be a minister of jesus christ as bound in duty having thrust your self upon us and thereby kept off those who might otherwise have done it to perform your office according to the dispensation of god

which is given to his ministers to us ward to fulfil the word of god

and we also say to you as the apostle commands the church of god to say to archippus

take heed to the ministry that thou hast received in the lord that thou fulful it a part whereof is the communication of the sacraments of the lord jesus christ which we wish we had no cause to say so to our greif and your own shame you have hitherto omitted

and therefore give us leave to tell you that the ministers total omission of administring the sacraments to the generality of the people under his charge because there may perhaps some wicked persons not known to be scandalous creep in amongst the godly is as an erroneous so an upstart way never used in the church from the time of the first planting of it till of latter dayes the wild boar of the forest hath rushed into christs vineyard to the

danger of the rooting out of the hearts of men the zeal to the frequent practise of applying the seals of grace to their souls and insteed thereof to the planting of a peculiar and superstitious holiness in the ordinances thereby quite to invert the charitable use of them and to bereave them of the great legacy which the saviour of the world hath left to his people

and we do wonder there can be any person so obstinate and selfish as thereby to have the eyes of his understanding so blinded to force himself to believe that an upstart unused way should be the right way when god himself hath said ask for the old way and with all told us that it is the good way given us a charge that we should walk in that way with a promise that in so doing we should find rest to our souls
he hath also said by his scripture for our instruction call to remembrance the dayes of old ask thy fathers and they will shew thee ask thy elders and they will tell thee

and now can any man who is not utterly void of reason think that he for whom it is impossible to lie hath promised

rest unto our souls by our walking in the old way and hath promised to guide his church all wayes in the right way should notwithstanding break his word and suffer it to wander out of the way and that for above hundred years together even till these times these very latter and perrillous times in which the spirit speaketh evidently that there should come divers hypocrites men having their consciences seared with a hot iron who should depart from the faith giving heed to the spirit of error

and shall that spirit of error have so much power as contrary to gods direction to intice us into new wayes by perswading us to imbrace novel opinions or unwarrantable practices in religion schismes or heresies shall any under any plausible pretence whatsoever go about to make us believe that the sacraments are not necessary to salvation or that the celebration of them doth not belong to the ministerial office we shall boldly aver such to be of yesterday and not to be yet come to their understanding

and we shall not be ashamed to say they are altogether out of the old right way and have made to themselves crooked pathes wherein they grope as blind men without eyes and stumble at as in the their feet treading the pavements of desolation and destruction run to evil far off from the way of peace and equity which it should seem they never would be enduced to follow which is the reason why judgment is so far from them and justice comes not neer them

and we do here for our selves profess that if an angel should come from heaven and preach to us any doctrine in order to the putting us out of the right way we would neither follow nor believe him

for as it hath been hitherto so shall it be ever far from us of the parish of barham in these licentious times in which some would have the golden reines of discipline and government let loose in the church in so much that single ministers and private persons might take up what forme of divine worship they pleased to follow so dangerous an example far be it from us to be led by wandring stars new but false lights bold but blind

guides far be it from us to make small or no account of the pretious ordinances of our lord and saviour jesus christ by neglecting the holy sacrament of baptism and by counting the blood of the testament as an unholy thing far be it from us to exchange the truth which we have received for falshood which ought not to be believed or to undervalue the sound doctrine which hath been taught us by giving ear to old wives tales for it is our firm resolution to imbrace that truth which the great doctor and author of truth it self hath commanded the blessed apostles taught the holy martyrs confirmed and the most godly and most learned men in all ages practised we shall desire to be washed that we may be cleansed we shall desire to eat that we may live

thus much have we thought fitting to declare to the end that posterity as well as those now living might know what our judgments are concerning the sacred and saving ordinances which our most blessed saviour whose name be for ever praised hath left to his church and that in a time in which so slight a regard hath been had of his heavenly mysteries we did

not with silence and patience behold such horrible contempt and detestable neglect but on the other side might understand our reverend esteem and opinion of the necessity and use of those seals that are to continue in his church until he the author of them come to judg the world and that a more free and large admission ought to be to them than of late hath been permitted or allowed of and also that obstinacy and selfish ends have been stumbling blocks in the way to this free admission and that tyrannical presbytery of some which hath cast those stumbling blocks in is both new in erection and erroneous in execution

and as we have declared thus much so we thought our selves bound in conscience to do it to the end that we might not foolishly like the unprofitable servant hide our talent in a napkin or perfidiously put our light under a bushel

non nobis nati sumus was the saying of a heathen we are not born for the good of our selves alone but for the welfare of others also we say of our very enemies as well as friends to whom we have in some measure held out our light as we

have done to our neerest relations whereby they may if they please see how to distinguish realities from apparances substances from shadowes truth from falshood

and notwithstanding though they may have but little or no regard to our care endeavours for their good nay though as jannes and jambres withstood moses they may stand in direct opposition to and contradiction against us yet shall not we say with the great cardinal si populus vult decipi decipiatur if the people will be deceived let them be so but shall to the utmost of our power prevent such delusion and as much as in us lies guide their feet in the blessed wayes of truth and peace
and in order thereunto shall advise them as we do the like to all others of what condition and quality soever they be to beware of such as come in sheeps clothing and to mark those who make division experienced in the old maxime divide impera divide and command

of such it hath been said of old quasi vulpes in deserto prophetae tui israel israel thy prophets are like foxes in

the desert and it is justly to be feared that some of that breed are crept in amongst us

of whom that we may the better take heed we shall continually and fervently pray to almighty god to give us a discerning spirit and a right apprehension of the necessary use of his holy heavenly and saving mysteries so as we may not neglect much less contemn them but frequently and piously hunger and thirst after them and withal that we may not be cajoled by the selfish ends of any erring presbyterians or others how soever they be that we may be able to discerne wolves clothed like sheep and that he will arm us with the wisdome of the serpent whereby we may understand and avoid the subtilties and deceipts of those foxes who earnestly desire to prey upon our goods and intellects that so being safe under the shadow of our most gracious protectors wings we may humbly religiously and joyfully worship him according to his word and sacraments ascribing unto him all honor power and dominion both now and for ever

brethren and beloved

some thoughts have of late more then formerly and more sadly visited my heart that wish may prevaile more upon your hearts
first the thought of the greatness the soveraignty and soveraigne

perfection of god the foolishness of god is wiser then men and the weakness of god is stronger then men
he is the onely potentate the king of kings and lord of lords and that in the most undoubted right that has made all things of nothing by the word of his mouth for himself
vaine man would be wise although he be borne like the wild asses colt he will provoke god to anger transgresse his laws change his ordinances and breake the everlasting covenant
but who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let him answer it
do we provoke the lord to anger are we stronger then he adde not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a

lyar
the world yea the hight of the people do languish because the earth is defilled by deniations from the laws ordinances and covenants of god tis mans deformitie to walke according to his own invention in any thing will prove his own destruction
can god endure to be prescribed by creatures shall man coin laws for rules of acceptable walking with god in spiritual civil or ecclesiastical things it would be and is horrible impudence for any to do it
all the sin and misery in the world brake in at this door viz by hearkning to reason· against institution
twas israel sin to do that was right in their own eyes in civils judg

much more in ecclesiasticals
the apostle held a war with reasonings and thoughts of men cor


these are no competent judges of the doctrine of god in christ but must be overthrown

secondly the thought of the fatal miscarriages of man managing any thing by his own wisdom and strength
eve became the mother of mischief to all living by trusting to carnal sense and reason in judging of the tree of knowledge of good and evil
the sons of god brought the deluge on the old world by taking such wives as they chose
israel provoked god to anger with their own inventions not onely in point of worship but in the matters of their commonwealth when they followed their own fancies and the customs of men but in determining what kinde of government to set up in the nation and were convinced of their mistake by a signe from heaven

god thundering his displeasure against them from heaven and raining tokens of his wrath upon them and the tyranny that followed was as teaching of the same god giving them such recompence of their error as was meet
gedeon would have a new way of remembering the victory by a costly ephod and israel went a whoring after it which thing became a snare to gedeon and to his house
alas is but a shew of wisdom that is in col

and by this means men are beguiled of their reward vers
and righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any people prov

we think by our own inventions to get us glory among the nations whilst we conform our selves to the worldly glory of their government but our way were to keep

to gods statutes and judgments without adding or diminishing then the nations would say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people deut


thirdly the thought of the perfection of the scriptures they are able to make us wise unto salvation tim
to teach us how to behave our selves in the church tim


how to behave our selves in the commonwealth david teaches the church to pray give the king thy judgements and thy righteousness unto the kings son psal

the scriptures are able to make the man of god perfect throughly furnished to all good works tim



therefore my beloved brethren accept no but jesus christ neither in church nor commonwealth
let this be your profession the lord is our

judge the lord is our he is our king
and though other lords besides him rule over us let us him onely make mention of his name that will in due time save us from devilish government in the church when he shall give the body of the beast to the burning flame and cast the beast and false prophet into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone and from all worldly government in commonweals when the stone cut out of the mountain shall smite on the toes of the image then not onely the clay but the iron and the brass and the silver the shall be broken to pieces and be carried away like dust by the wind and no more place shall be found for them no not for the goodliest government that ever was invented by the wit of

man
and till that time change of governments will be the disease of the world whilst crowns and diadems are transposed from one man and from one people to another
must say it although delight in it considered in it self as little as others that complain of the great cry of overturnings wherewith the world is now alarm'd
there will be overturnings till he come whose right it is
oh the stupidity of men that apprehend not gods displeasure against the governments of this world by the often changes that are made tis to be feared that this is judiciary that god may leave europe and the wise nations thereof unto themselves to walk in their own counsels because they trust in and leave nothing of their own doings nor

of their stubborn way whilst he passes over to america and thence to the to set up the government of jesus christ amongst the barbarous nations
the lords word brethren is to me to you love the truth and peace let us not of a fond affection to peace and ease lose truth yet in our striving for truth let us strive lawfully or else we shall not be crowned wherein would have every one be wary not with a carnal but spiritual wariness walk in your warfare by a divine rule act from a divine spirit keep to a divine frame of spirit and stand every one in his place striving for truth

hope in what have done in this following treatise have not exceeded
as one of

the lords watchmen must warn men
hope have spoken from the spirit of god am sure is after many prayers and tears and so long have delayed till conscience made me speak and the guilt of my delay began to stare in my face and think speak not beside the cause that was the disciples fault that they spake beside the cause and from this christ argues the carnalness of their spirit that would have fire come down from heaven on the samaritanes luke

is it not the time of antichrists war whilst christ is consuming him with the breath of his mouth if any judging of my frame of spirit by my phrase think me too bitter let them but take this along with them that speak not of persons but things that can't be too ill spoken

of when vicious and contrary to the word of god
and for the text have for what say if abused it shall be glad the righteous should smite me for it
read and judge and as you see cause correct my mistakes
my time cuts my epistle to you shorter then intended
beg this that as the three thoughts before mentioned led me into this treatise so prepare to read it by the meditation of them and shall pray to the lord to make both profitable to you who am

devoted to the service of your faith and holiness gualter postlethwaite

a voice from heaven
epigraph rev

and heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues

the chapter begins with a most stately proclamation of the certain sudden and utter ruine of babylon the great together with the causes of it vers
but shall not here insist

there follows an admonition to god's people to come out of her· and this in our text

in this there is observable
the means whereby this warning is given and that is a voice from heaven to note god to be the author of it matth


here are not the like stately circumstances accompanying this voice as accompanied the foregoing voice
it seems this voice will not be so remarkable for any thing as the divine author of it the impress of whose divine excellencie stamped on it shall be the onely thing observable challenging our attention to it
as if god meant to sound forth this voice not by silver trumpets but rams horns not employing the choicest parts and gifts nor men of greatest power and repute among men in this work


the admonition it self wherein we may observe


a duty required viz to come out of her

the argument moving hereunto drawn from the consideration of a double danger viz


of fellowship with her sins

of sharing with her in her plagues

there remains one thing to be enquired into and that is who is here meant by the relative pronoun
the antecedent to this relative must needs be babylon the great vers
and she is the same with that great where in the foregoing chapter as appears by the name written in her forehead vers
and this is no other but rome antichristian as appears plainly from the beast that she rides on neither is this at all controverted among protestants

but the great question will be about the extent of the signification of babylon or rome here
surely we are to extend it to signifie not onely what lies within the walls of rome but whatsoever is comprehended within the

territories of the romane jurisdiction
and my reason is because the same that are called to come out of her in the text are by the same voice called upon to execute vengeance upon her vers
and this work is laid out for the

ten horns or kings over which she reigns
chap

and besides we know there was the like extent of signification in the prophets words from whence the text is taken jer

my people go ye out of the midst of her that is out of all places within the babylonian jurisdiction

but still there remains as great a question viz
how we are to conceive of the romish jurisdiction and under what notion to consider the territories of it
to which answer that we are to look upon them in their ecclefiastical considerations as they are formed into antichristian churches
certainly antichristian societies are here meant because they are distinguished from their sins it being made a of abiding in them to be partakers of their come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins

now is not like that civil societies should be meant for babylon here is the same with the great whore chap

that is out of doubt rome considered

ecclesiastically
for if we take the beast for the secular state on which she is said to ride then apparently she is distinguished from the secular state as the beast she rides on vers
and if with mr cotton on chap
we take that beast to be the catholike visible church of rome we must needs take rome ecclesiastically for rome civil does not ride on rome ecclesiastical but rome ecclesiastical rides the universal church of rome as the reference of her universality to rome makes plain and by vertue of this reference come out of rome is as much as to say come out of all the several territories of her jurisdiction

having thus made way unto it come to the thing that intend viz

whosoever would avoid fellowship

with the sins of antichristian churches must see to it that they depart from the fellowship of such churches and cease to walk in antichristian order

there be many examples in scripture that shew how the people of god have degenerated through unwarrantable civil

cohabitation and association with wicked men and false worshippers how much more dangerous is ecclesiastical communion in the times of the gospel unwarrantable to be held with wicked men cor
heb

especially in ways strange to the word of god

the sons of god lost their religion by marrying the daughters of men gen
israel was defiled with the idolatry of the egyptians in egypt ezek
they were mingled among the heathen and learned their works and served their idols psal

and in their captivity this comes into their minde we will be as the heathen and as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone ezek

but if civil communion be so dangerous how much more dangerous is ecclesiastical communion the daughters of moab called the israelites to their sacrifices and the people did eat and bowed down unto their gods
numb

yea israel joyned himself unto vers

take one place for all deut

the lord warns the people that

they should not imitate the heathen in their worship not onely that they did not worship their gods but that they did not worship their god in that way
and here note that though the means of worship be onely changed yet is a going to another god
take heed says god that thou enquire not after their gods saying how did these nations serve their gods and that the means of worship is onely minded is plainly apparent from what follows thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god
to worship god with a strange worship is to worship a strange god neither will god accept of any other interpretation of false worship or worshipping in a false way but that a new god is devised for the object of it that

is delighted with such worship
so long therefore as we worship god in the antichristian way we do interpretatively worship the gods of the antichristians

steven the lost his life in defence of the of worshipping god in opposition to the legal worship earnestly contended for by the jews his antagonists amongst the rest

for preaching against the temple and so consequently against their national church the bond of which was their meeting together at the temple in one individual worship acts

for

although the witnesses are said to be false witnesses yet as calvin says this reproach was not objected to him for nothing for he taught the abrogation of the law
but in this they were false witnesses and suborned to lye because they wittingly depraved that which was well and piously spoken

shall now explain what mean by

antichristian churches

and first mean
to prove which to be antichristian shall first shew what finde storied of their original

potter in his interpretation of the number

quoting onuphrius panvinius de praecipuis urbis romae basilicis cut of him writes thus

whereas originally there was a small uncertain number of presbyters at rome· they were brought to a certain number and order by cletus and evaristus

popes of rome
first cletus reduced the presbyters of rome to the number of afterwards evaristus about the yeer of christ appointed and prescribed a several parish to every one of these presbyters which parishes were afterwards enlarged and had their bounds and limits more perfectly and more exactly prescribed unto them by pope dionysius about the yeer of christ
after which time marcellus about the yeer of christ
limited the number of those titles which anciently were first given to the presbyters by evaristus and did by decree constitute that there should be in rome as it were so many dioceses for the more convenient baptizing of such gentiles as were daily converted to christian religion

thus he

selden in his history of tythes chap

writes thus

for it is plain that as metropolitane sees patriarchates exarchates in the eastern church and bishopricks these greater dignities

were most usually at first ordained and limited according to the distinction of seats of government and inferiour cities that had been assigned to the substitutes or vicarii of the or of the east and west empire so were parishes appointed and divided to several ministers within the ecclesiastical rule of these dignities according to the conveniencies of and villages one or more or less of such as being but small territories might not by the canons be bishopricks to a parish the word parish at first denoting a whole bishoprick which is but as a great parish and signifying no otherwise then diocese but afterward being confined to what our common language restrains it
the curates of these parishes were such as the bishop appointed under him to have care of souls in them and were called

these parishes arose from the limitation of the ministers function
afterward there arose another kinde of parishes

from the limitation of the ministers maintenance of which selden in his history chap

thus

afterward when devotion grew firmer and most of fair estates desired the for some chaplains that might be always ready for christian instruction among them and their families and adjoyning tenants oratories and churches began to be built by them also and being hallowed by the bishops were endowed with peculiar maintenance from the founders for incumbents that should there onely reside which maintenance with all other ecclesiastical profits that came to the hands of every such incumbent in regard the had according to the territories of his demesnes tenancies or neighboring possessions made and assigned both the limits within the which the holy function was to be exercised and appointed those that should repair to the church and offer there as also provided a special salary for the performance was afterward also restrained

from the common treasury of the diocese

and thus you see the pedigree of parishes set aside some few that have been made by the special orders of popes or princes in the dividing or uniting of parishes for conveniencies sake of which selden
out of what has been said is evident that are not plants of our heavenly fathers planting and so shall be plucked up
mat

they are of mans making and have sprung out of his pride ambition and usurpation
they have been bred in the womb of the apostacie of these latter times and brought forth by the working of the mystery of iniquity
the best that can be said of the mother of these daughters is to call her ignorant devotion
they are therefore things that may be shaken and that god hath promised to remove heb

and therefore it behoves all to flee out of them before they fall on their heads
but lest what hath been said be useless to the more heedless consider

first that scripture speaks nothing of if we cut out the scantling of them by what hath been alleadged
we have nothing of such in scripture as we have spoken of
there is nothing of limitation of churches by the ministers function or maintenance by the edicts of popes bishops or princes of this world and it is enough against a thing belonging to the worship of god that there is no institution for it that the scripture says nothing of it
heb


secondly that these derive their pedigree from rome there was the copie set after which all the world wrote wondering after the beast neither does it help that they derive their pedigree from times so neer the apostles for the mystery of iniquity did work even in paul time thess



thirdly consider what babels of confusion and superstition they be
here you shall see christ and belial confounded saints and sinners jumbled together without any kindly separation of the precious from the vile
civils

and ecclesiasticks confounded whilst the civil power of a magistrate bounds a church or the priviledge of a patron by civil precincts
here you may observe great care that all should be consecrated the walls within which they meet yea the ground that they tread upon except the worshippers as if god were pleased with an holy house and holy ground without an holy people which kinde of superstition steven rebukes in the jews acts


fourthly when the pretended reasons of these constitutions of men are the convenient baptizing of converted gentiles and taking care of souls in the country there lies poison hid under these herbs
for the necessity of curates arose from the exorbitant pride and ambition of the bishop affecting a spiritual dominion parallel to the civil dominion of the civil governour
and again the curates are the bishops creatures for the managing of their monstrous ecclesiastical dominion and so appointed as not to infringe the dominion of the bishop nor detract from the dignity of the bishoprick and that

not onely before but since and patrons the bishop still reserving to himself ordination of ministers consecration of churches and excommunication of delinquents and so as the devotion that made men desire a chaplain to reside with them in the country was ignorant and superstitious like the times so was it satisfied with as superstitious a mean which therefore layeth no good foundation to the churchdom of a parish

fifthly these have continued unto our times witness the presentation of patrons institution and induction by the bishops who also consecrated the church as often as any new one was built
and here we may minde the known distinction of the viz of ministers into bishops and curates whereby it plainly appeareth that our parish ministers were reckoned still to stand but as curates to the bishop
now though there hath been some change made by the fall of the hierarchy yet there hath not been a kindly reformation
for the most standing

to their old principles though their practice be lamed by the fall of the hierarchy wait with hope that the deadly wound that that image of the beast hath received may be cured and he live again and therefore while the head labours of the deadly wound they do what they can to defend the extreme parts
others though they would have some reformation yet delight in some broken pieces of the shattered image of the antichristian structure setting up their threshold by gods and their posts by his posts ezek


sixthly if we would make a kindly reformation we must not build on antichrist's foundation but laying aside all thet is of men return immediately to gods institution and primitive practice matth


as for instance when the national church of the jews was to cease and the floor of christ to be purged this was the apostolical practice viz to preach faith and repentance unto their audients and especially that they save themselves from the untoward generation they lived amongst that not onely were unbelieving and impenitent

in general but resisted the reformation that christ had set afoot and with tooth and nail defended their temple law and customs acts


this done those that gladly received their word walked in the fellowship of the church acts
and when antichrist hath raked the national church out of her grave and set up her daughters or rather divided her into curacies as so many members of her who cannot derive their pedigree from apostolical institution know no reason but that in our reformation we should imitate the apostolical practice
and concerning the antichristian tis plain that is spoken rev

the court that is without cast out and measure it not
that is says bullinger god will not edifie but destroy it and those that god acknowledges for churches during the time of antichrist under the notion of the two candlesticks vers
which in the language of the revelations are churches chap

these are witnesses against and separatists from

the antichristian as we see by the context precedent vers
christs is set down in the first verse antichrists in the second the witnesses against it are impowered vers
and specified to be the two olivetrees noting magistracie and ministery and the two candlesticks noting churches that arise against the antichristian at least at the later end of his raign shall the testimony be managed by separating congregations say separating for were absurd to conclude that they witness in word against and comply in practice with the antichristian that is to be utterly slighted and demolished like a castle that is to the damage not the defence of the commonweal
and how the holy ghost could speak plainer for separation not onely from the corruptions of the antichristian church but from the antichristian it self which is also a corruption then in the text cannot tell come out of her my people that ye be not partaker of her sins

thus far for the rise and original nature of we come now to consider them in their present state

does not the character of the antichristian agree very fitly unto them as you have it rev
are they not given unto the gentiles do not men of uncircumcised hearts and ears stand seized of the power of the keys in those churches the major part by far everywhere for ought can observe being such finally does not this present party of gentiles in all tread the holy city under foot and trample upon the sacred politie of jesus christ will they endure the reformation of their christian gentilism or the breaking of the image of the first beast their churchdom is acknowledged and an answerable interest in the managing of their churchaffairs allowed them

look on the condition of those parishes where the minister pleaseth his parishioners and ye will finde that verified that is written lam

zions adversaries there spread out their hands

on all her pleasant things
cast them out therefore and measure them not

the samaritanes pretend the same religion with the jews and therefore desire to be admitted to the house of the lord with them
but the jews reject their motion saying you have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our god but we our selves together will build an house unto the lord god of israel ezra

let our answer be the same to all those christned gentiles that would on pretence of being of the same religion
yea church with us being of the same parish to them that would say upon this pretence equally with us interess themselves in the of our let our answer be the same they are adversaries they have for these many hundred yeers trodden under foot the holy citie and to this their genius leads them and therefore there is no probability that they should further the work but hinder and mar it especially if we continue our fellowship with them in the where they are the greatest part by far

saints of late and heretofore have expressed their sense of what have said
mr caryl mr oxenbridge and mr sidenham in the epistle dedicatory to mr lockyer's little stone thus the first part of his work that pleads for the holiness of say they may put you upon enquiry whether you viz those of scotland have dealt kindly with christ to obtrude as imperious and selfish guardians or tutors such a spouse upon him as is not according to his choice minde or liking
the experience of the true and discerning shepherds here who are as dear to their brethren as sheep to the wolves doth tell them that almost nine parts of ten of their flock are not sheep nor fit say they of civil much less say we of spiritual priviledges and then they are rather a herd or drove then a flock for few as the shepherds themselvs think now their driving power ceaseth will be willing to be kept by them nay many as they already know do turn again and would gladly rend them

and afterwards thus if saints will not say they but in the company of this multitude walk with god or his people what can there be expected as for the purging of this body we suspect it to be as the body supposed and a diversion from a real duty for besides what we apprehend how impossible it is for the far lesser in number retaining their present constitution that they should regularly cast out the greater part therefrom we are informed by our experience that the worse and greater part is more able and willing to a formal ejection of the better then on the contrary and therefore this ten yeers talk of the lips about purging hath tended onely to penury and the last yeers are farther from that work then the former
thus they

adde a notable prophecie of john hus that you may read in foxes martyrologie vol
pag

moreover says he hereupon note and mark by the way that the church of god cannot be reduced to her former dignity or be reformed before all things

first be made new
the truth whereof is plain by the temple of solomon
like as the clergie and priests so also the people and laity or else unless all such as be now addict unto avarice from the least to the most be first reclaimed as well the people as the clergie and priests
albeit as my minde now giveth me believe rather the first that then shall arise a new people formed after the new man which is created after god of the which people new clerks and priests shall come and be taken that shall hate covetousness and the glory of this life hastning to an heavenly conversation notwithstanding all these things shall come to pass and be brought by little and little in order of times dispensed of god for the same purpose
and this god does and will do for his own goodness and the riches of his great longanimity and patience giving time and space of repentance to them that have long lien in their sins to amend and flee from the face of the lords fury whilst that in like manner the carnal people and carnal

priests successively and in time shall fall away and be consumed as with the moth

thus far john hus

neither let it seem harsh to any that admire the antiquity of churches in england which they conceive began to be planted by joseph of arimathea or simon zelotes that press the casting out of the the deemed successors of them
it was a saying of william rufus of the popes of rome the pretended successor of peter quod petri non inhaerent vestigiis praemlis inhiantes non ejus potestatem retinent cujus sanctitatem probantur non imitari
the like may say of that is conceived were planted by either of those worthies above mentioned they retain not their priviledge whose neither constitution nor conversation they can be found to imitate
and we know that the holy ghost teaches us to say of as few as may be to give a valid testimony against the antichristians of two witnessing churches witnessing against and separated from the and corruptions of gentiles of

these say the holy ghost teaches us to say these are the two candlesticks churches standing before the god of the earth rev

whereby the churchdom of these witnessing separated churches is not onely established and approved but the churchdom of others rejected whiles is appropriated unto those two witnessing separated churches that they stand before god whereby is plainly implied that others stand not before god but such a god as must be conceived to delight to be worshipped in such an order

thus much for we come now in the second place to interpret antichristian churches by episcopal churches that are the greater territories formed into diocesan provincial and oecumenical churches under the several orders of bishops of which amefius thus superstitio secundi

generis est in humanis ecclesiae formis
that is a superstition of the second kinde is in the humane forms of churches of which sort are churches visibly integrally and organically

oecumenical provincial and diocesan brought in by men as also in the hierarchy agreeable thereunto
for jesus christ has instituted no other visible integral organical church or church with officers for the practise of his visible publike and solemn worship but one particular congregation that may meet together ordinarily in the same place to worship in all the ordinances of gods house
such was the church at hierusalem there were added to the church about three thousand souls acts

the number of the men was about five thousand chap

yet they were all with one accord in solomons porch chap

multitudes of men and women were added chap

yet the apostles call them together unto them chap

and chap

paul and barnabas were received of the church by which says calvin he understandeth plebem ipsam totum corpus the whole body of the people in distinction from the apostles and elders as appears from the immediately following mention of them and in vers
all the multitude

of the church that it seems were present at the disputation of the apostles and elders vers
and it is very plain they were by their concurrence with them immediately upon the conclusion of james his speech in chusing brethren and subscribing letters to the brethren of the gentiles according to the declared sentence of james gave audience to paul and barnabas declaring what miracles god had wrought among the gentiles by them
and whereas the apostle speaks of myriads of jews that believe chap

it is not to be restrained to jews dwelling at hierusalem since it was the time of pentecost chap

when jews and proselytes came to hierusalem out of all nations and we have express mention of the jews that were of asia vers
neither is it impossible for myriades in the language of luke at least to come together and to hear at once the same preacher
to shew which mr norton urges luke

however it be it seems that the church of hierusalem did at this time ordinarily come together in one place as occasion

required for vers
tis said the multitude must needs come together
this cannot be meant of the officers for besides that they are the speakers it would be incongruous to call them the multitude neither can it be meant of others besides believers for this speech of the elders is to be speake some condescension in paul to some legal rites thereby to take off the offence of these that believing were yet zealots of the law as is plain and so such an understanding would not agree to the scope of the elders
neither doth it seeme congruous that it should be said of any other but the church of hierusalem
what other multitude should the apostles and elders expect that they should come together unto them as is implied much less determine their coming together as some understand the speech about the apostles being come to town to this agree calvin beza and diodate on the place

we may adde to this instance that of the church of corinth cor

and antioch acts

but finde no contrary instances

and this say not onely against the episcopal but also classical churches which are put in the room of those episcopal churches by the effectual working of the mystery of iniquity

these are combinations of many congregations united by subjection to one and the same court of elders chosen out of the whole to govern them
these are pressed so far at least by some as to take away power of government and exercise of ecclesiastick discipline from the congregations and not onely infringing of it so leaving them but as the curacies under the bishops and their ministers to have no more power then the had under the bishops at least considered as the ministers of such congregations
see mr wood in his answer to mr lockyer little stone part
sect


will not says he question the an sit or being of the subject of this assertion whether there be de jure and of divine institution an eldership or presbytery within a particular congregation that is a colledge of elders belonging to one single congregation

by it self having power of government and exercising ecclesiastick discipline although know men learned and much exercised in the study of the questions about ecclesiastick government are of the judgement that there is not such an eldership or presbytery
and confess it is right hard to finde in scripture either precept or example for it

let us consider the judgement of these learned men to which mr wood seemeth to incline and more too as appears in his foresaid treatise
where expresly he gives his judgement
the fixing says he of single congregations under appropriated officers is not necessary by any divine institution

observe first that they appropriate the power of government and exercise of ecclesiastick discipline unto the eldership that is implied in what has been quoted and we need not search their writings that are of that way much to finde it expresly denied that popular concurrence in acts of government is to be proved by the scriptures

vide mr wood part of his aforesaid treatise

this how well it agrees with the institution matth


let it be considered
when christ says whatsoever binde on earth does not he include the offended brother to whom he directs his speech from vers and of whom and whose act to the offender he had last spoken especially considering that this verse contains the confirmation of the last clause of the verse mentioning the said act of the offended brother to the incorrigible offender that amounts to the casting him out of the congregation of christs church and making an heathen of him which that we may conceive that it was done though by him yet not by him alone but with the church christ adding the confirmation of this act speaks in the plural number and says not whatsoever but shall binde yet withal keeping the second person that the offended brother be not excluded not saying whatsoever or but shall binde on earth shall be bound

in heaven
and when christ promises the keys of the kingdom of heaven unto peter his whole discourse lookes on peter as a lively confessour of jesus christ his confession being the occasion of all that christ speakes unto him and nothing coming in between the beginning and end of his speech that may make us thinke that christ considering peter as a confessour of him at the first did afterward change his notion and look on him otherwise
read matth




secondly they exclude the single congregations considered severally each one by it self from having an eldership having power to exercise ecclesiastick discipline and so consequently the several single congregations are excluded from having power of government which they say resides wholly in the elderships
how likely this is let it be judged
is it likely that go tell the church matth


should mean go tell the elders of the combination is it likely that our saviour so tender of the offenders credit and wary of offending him by making

his fault publique that he must be told of it first alone then onely before so manay as may be sufficient to give a satisfactory testimony according to the law is it likely say that he should appoint no mean between the two or three witnesses and a court of elders of many combined congregations but not to stay here it has been proved already that the church of hierusalem and corinth were single congregations that met together ordinarily in one place and that the church of hierusalem had her appointed officers and that the church of corinth exercised ecclesiastick discipline who can deny but how unwarrantably soever hard they press their classical way against the congregational even as hath been said to the utter taking away of power of government from the several single congregations neither do they stay here but translate the power of government to their elderships subordinate one to another till they come to an occumenical assembly to the officres of the whole catholick visible church of christ as united in lesser greater combinations

even to an occumenical assembly
as mr wood in the aforesaid treatise pag

this is altogether strange to scripture for if we grant that single congregations with their eldership be excluded from the power of government and exercising ecclesiastick discipline yet will it not appear from scripture that there are any higher elderships or larger combinations of churches then those of the first form and of the first step from the single congregation yea the contrary apears in that the churches of asia grant them collective churches rev
and chapters do severally receive of christ the praise of their good and blame of their evil carriage each single church for her self without any reflection on superior combinations notwithstanding some of them lay situate within eight or ten miles of each other and those that were farthest distant not above miles each from other as some have computed the journeys between them
this is strange if there were superior and if there should have been tis much that

christ should not blame them after so long continuance of christianity for not setting up his ordinances especially considering the defection of divers of the churches to whose charge it might well have been laid as a thing wherein they were accessary to their own apostacy that they had not set all up gods meanes to preserve them

if it be objected that we read of an higher eldership exercising acts of rule over a proportional combination of churches viz a synodical assembly act

to this answer we read not of any combination of any such combination of the churches there mentioned viz of hierusalem antioch syria and cilicia whereby they should become subject unto the rule of one superior eldership in matters conceived to belong firstly to their cognizance or that may be referred unto them or in which there may be appeales made unto them nor when and how the said combination was made and established

secondly here was no synod by which our adversaries understand an

assembly of officers resulting out of many inferiour presbyteries say here was no synod in this sense
for we read of no forreigners that came to this synod if we must call it so but these that came from antioch of whom we finde nothing that may import their concurrence in the decrees of it but these proceeded from the apostles elders and whole church that must needs mean the church at hierusalem and when tis said with the whole church there is a reflection in the expression on the apostles and elders as related at least in their present residence and action which is all can be said of the apostles being general officers unto that church onely
so that upon the whole the result is that the decrees here made were of the church at jerusalem and the officers of it onely

thirdly here was no appeale from the censure of the church at antioch
for we read not of any ecclesiasticall censure that the church at antioch had passed either concerning the persons disputing or the things disputed but onely of dissention and disputation had betwixt

paul and barnabas and those that came from judea
neither were there any refers made from antioch unto hierusalem as though the matter were too high for their cognizance or beyond their abilitie to determine
for the churches of antioch and hierusalem were alike congregational say more then classical in that strict sense wherein the next to congregational is meant our adversaries cannot say and furnished both with extraordinary officers to which appeals and refers in the sense before recited cannot agree

but the reason of sending from antioch unto hierusalem seemes to me most probably to be this viz to take off the scandal that came to the church of antioch and at least might come to those of syria and cilicia also by these false teachers by whose comming out of judea it may be also bragging of the apostles and elders at hierusalem that they taught the same doctrine to the brethren there yea moreover and it may be urging them to go and see if it

were not so by these meanes say the church of antioch had as it is probable

at least twice taken some offence and been staggered in their faith as though paul and barnabas had taught otherwise then the apostles and elders at hierusalem
and so the errand of these messengers from antioch to hierusalem was primarily to get satisfaction that there was the same doctrine taught at hierusalem that was at antioch for the establishing of such as might be staggered and preventing of farther danger by the pretences of these false teachers
and this seemes to shine forth clearly in the returne of those at hierusalem in the
verses
because some had gone out from them that had offended the brethren of antioch therefore they send chosen men of their own company that might take off the offence by assuring them of the contrary judgement of the apostles to what those false teachers taught

fourthly here was no rule exercised over the churches to which they of hierusalem wrote the result of their conference occasioned by the messengers from antioch wherein they throughly weighed the controverted point to give

a sound resolve for the establishing of the staggering brethren
there was no rule exercised say for paul is so embarqued with the church of antioch by his residence there and deepe hand in carrying on the controversie with the false teachers that cannot see how without diminution of his apostolical authority that the decrees of the apostles should be more then materially binding viz because gods word onely
how paul that in the defence of this same point causes whomsoever should preach otherwise then he with the rest of his perswasion

had preached how he say should submit unto any judicature on earth authoritatively determining of his doctrine whether sound or not so as their decrees should be formally binding viz as the decrees of such a court this cannot conceive

and again tis a joynt act to make these a joynt act of the apostles elders and brethren the whole church concurs to the making and sending of them· and that under the same notion vers

it pleased the apostles and elders with the

whole church
it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord it seemed good unto the holy ghost and to us which us must be interpreted by apostles elders and brethren mentioned in the inscription of the letter

now it will not be granted that the brethren did joyne with the apostles in an act of rule over another church or churches
neither will it helpe to say that the concurrence of the apostles and elders and of the brethren was of a different nature
for the text is so full as to the involving them together in the same act under the same expressions even the highest with so much punctualness in signifying their joynt concurrence that it will not admit such a plea
difference in the order of their concurrence we shall grant viz that the apostles and elders did lead the church in these acts but difference in nature we cannot grant

if it be said that by the whole church is meant onely the synodical church the reason that is given for this falls to the ground
for tis grounded on the impossibility of the meeting of the

church of hierusalem together in one place that hath been refuted from cleare texts of scripture

but be it that we shut out the brethren from a concurrence of the same nature with the apostles and elders to the making of these decrees and let our adversaries make the most of vers
of this chapter and vers
of the following chapter will they say these decrees were authoritative and formally binding the churches of antioch syria cilicia trow not when they have better considered of the matter according to what has been said
will they say that the elders of a classicall presbytery at ierusalem for they assert no more of the presbytery there see mr wood in the aforesaid tractate pag
and the messengers of antioch are excluded from the decision of the controversie and decrees here made by the text it self ch

did exercise rule over all these churches so far distant that could not therefore be of their combination

neither is it to be conceived but if classes were then in fashion they had their classical combinations and presbyteries

too and shall presbyteries of the same order rule over one another

it may be it will be said that the presence of the apostles being extraordinary officers constituted this a synod
answer tis sooner said then proved the text rather represents the apostles condescending to act with the church then elevating the church to act with them vers
if against what has beene said against exercise of authority by this meeting over the churches that vers of laying a burden of necessary things upon them be objected let it be considered whether there be not as much said of the assertion of the pharisees vers
whether therebe not as much said of their assertion vers

and thus you see how hard it will be to grant any more with if we should grant classical elderships and combinations but we shall not grant these for want of instance in scripture or any other sound ground for them
for the most numerous of churches that we read of we have already shewed at large that it was congregational

viz the church at hierusalem and conceive that the numerousness of the churches we read of in scripture called severally even the most numerous but by the name of church in the singular number without the mention of any more then one company of elders conceive that hath occasioned the conceit of classical churches and elderships but without warrant from scripture as may appeare say from that the holy ghost hath been so punctual in shewing that the most numerous churches have still met together in one place
to the church of hierusalem we may adde that of corinth
tis plaine that the apostle writes to the body of the congregation by the epither he gives them in the inscriptions of both epistles these he hints their ordinary coming together to joyne in the same individual acts when he enjoynes them the casting out of the incestuous person when ye are gathered together to deliver such a one to satan ep chap
vers
a like hint we have in the same epistle chap
vers
and here we may take notice not

onely that this numerous church of corinth how numerous soever pretended to be was congregational but that this church had and exercised the power of the keys for neglect of exercising which she is blamed cor

although paul had not before this written to manifest his determination and that the exercise of this great piece of the power of the keys viz
power of excommunication say the exercise of this power is put upon the body of the congregation by paul without any distinct application of his speech to the presbyterie
and in the same manner that the power of binding is put upon them in the same manner is the power of loosing put on them cor

without any mention of their eldership in particular but wrapping up elders and people together as which were both to concur in this exercise of ecclesiastick discipline and that with a concurrence of like nature as to the substance of the matter leaving to each their due place in the body the one going before the other following in the lord

but to return if these most numerous

congregations were congregational not classical cannot think there were any classical churches except there be a scripture produced as plain for their classicalness as these are that have quoted to the congregrationalness of these that have instanced in
for reason will carry any man to thinke if the most numerous churches were congregationall that the less numerous were so too and nothing but a plaine scripture can stop the course of such a reasoning

and thus the whole fabrick of the classical way falls to the ground in my judgement
their appropriating all authority and power of exercising ecclesiastick discipline to the presbyterie the secluding the presbytery of a particular congregation from such authority together with the whole course of subordinations of combinations of churches and elders from the classical that is the lowest to oecumenical that is the highest combination they can none of them shew their genealogie nor derive their pedigree from scripture

and what difference betwixt the episcopal and presbyterial government

wherein does their constitution differ except in the exorbitant power of a that the presbyterians cut by the height of the rest of the presbyters in the several combinations and what difference betwixt the universal church of the papists and that of of the presbyterians is it more then circumstantial the papists refer the roote and head of the universality to rome the presbyterians do not the papists subject it unto the pope the presbyterians do not but unto a general councel and some papists plead for no more save in the interim of the general councel
vide ellis vind
cathol
pag

let it be seriously considered that the bishop of rome is not reckoned the antichrist from what time he got the peaceable possession of his universal bishoprick with all the exorbitant power thereunto belonging but from what

time he aipired to and carryed it ambitiously and had it yeelded usually unto him to sway bishops and churches at his pleasure and from this time at least before he proceeded farther he is

reckoned antichrist and the seventh head of the monstrous beast rev


that is no other then the catholick visible roman church as mr cotton has learnedly demonstrated in an exposition of his on that of the revelations lately published
and this reckoning of the beginning of antichrist is suitable to that description of him that is given thes

that he opposeth and exalteth himself
accordingly we may easily gather that the ambition of a with the fond devotion of some elders and people may soone turn presbyterie into episcopacy
there needs not an act of state for setling such power on a chairman and putting elders people in subjection unto him to constitute either papacy or episcopacy
thus you see there is little difference betwixt presbytery and episcopacy and an easie transition from presbytery to episcopacy yea papacy and

they agree much also in nature being an usurpation of authority over the particular congregations the visible churches of christs institution and therefore have put them together as also

mr bain diocesan tryal qu
pag
those who subject themselves to a presbytery sayes he as being under it by subordination may in effect as well be subject to an episcopal and by consequence say to a papal consistory

let it be seriously weighed that the apostle gives us this character of the spirit of antichrist that such a spirit confesses not that jesus christ is come in the flesh john

we must not understand this of a confession of words onely but it is sufficient if practice speak it for antichrist acknowledges that christ is come in the flesh in words but he denyes it in practise whiles he brings in judaism or any other way of worship that christ hath not instituted into the churches according to that uncontrolled expectation of the woman of samaria john

when the messias comes he shall tell us all things viz about worship that was the matter in discourse for that practise contradicts christs being come in the flesh when men do not look onely to christs institution in matter of worship
and this is the expectation of the jewes even at this

day that christ will at his coming give in a sutable platform of his worship sutable to his being come into the world to who therefore the practice of judaism must needs be a
though men may thinke they differ from rome they are of the same spirit if they walk not according to the of christ

before come to the reasons of the obj point shall answer some objections

and first twill be said this way of separation that you press to be made from the parochial and episcopal yea classical churches nulls all at least the most part of the reformed churches in the world

answer this tends not to null or an&sw make void the faith of the true believers that shall be found in the aforesaid ways of deny not their faith whereby they are of the mystical church of christ and accordingly destroy not their mystical churchdom which is acknowledged by a voice from heaven in the text when such as are in babylon mixt with the gentiles in the outer court unmeasured and nourished hitherto in the wilderness of abominable confusion

where the great whore sits president when say such as these are called out of the babylonish corruption and confusion by the name of gods people they are plainly acknowledged to be of the mystical church and yet they are implicitely denyed to be of a right order when they are called and warned to come out of babylon that must needs mean order since their faith is approved for that being done there remaines nothing to be disapproved but order for under these two the apostle sums up all to be approved or disapproved in the church colos


deny accordingly that the churches before mentioned are such visible churches as christ hath instituted and their politie such as he hath appointed and assert though their faith be christian yet their order is antichristian· deny them not to be the woman nourished in the wilderness rev

but deny them to be the candlesticks that stand before the god of the earth chap

and this need not be grievous since the holy ghost hath foretold us of such a distinction of christians
some are content to walk with the nations

in the outer court with so much as will keepe life and soule together and to bite hard in the wilderness and straggle there from one greene path to another so they can but get a living
others god gives power to be his witnesses against the gentiles and to set up christs owne order in the face and to the teeth of the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit though they be slaine for it and will not be content to serve god as pharaoh will give them leave
such was the congregation in queen mary's time which mr fox mentions gods preservation of in his vol pag
and those of which mr cotton makes mention in the way of congregational churches cleared pag
these were in queen elizabeths dayes and were remembered by some amongst us but lately dead they were about an hundred and they refused the common lyturgie and congregations attending thereunto and used prayer and preaching and sacraments among themselves and suffered imprisonment for it and pleaded for their separation before the lord mayor bishop sandes and other commissioners jul


and in this they behaved themselves as faithful witnesses of jesus christ

tis one thing for churches to be looked upon as churches in point of salvation and another thing for them to be looked upon as churches in respect of outward constitution and visible order in the former account we cannot but give the right hand of fellowship to all that looke to no other way of salvation but by the blood of the lambe in the latter account we can give the right hand of fellowship onely to those that are after the heavenly patterne laid down in the word we must not for respect to a right faith swallow a wrong order
hath not the letting go the right order let in a wrong faith does not the great beast rev blaspheme god and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven meaning the catholick church of rome as mr cotton on the place shews at large

secondly twill be said this laies a ground to question all the ordinances obj that have beene administred in any other way then that you press for whether they are to be accounted null and void

to this answer there is a double degree an&sw of corruption that ordinances have met withal
some have beene corrupted in the essentials of them as for instance the lords supper in the popish churches was essentially corrupted the signs were turned into the thing signified one element denied to the people
when ordinances are thus essentially corrupted they become no ordinances are of no efficacy to do good unto the souls of men
other ordinances are circumstantially corrupted onely as baptisme although much were added unto it as anointing crossing yet the essentials were retained whil'st it always was administred by washing sprinkling or dipping in water in the name of the father son and holy ghost
now when ordinances are but circumstantially corrupted we have cause to be humbled that we have not sought god in due order as david for bringing up the ark· in a cart that should have beene borne on the priests shoulders but we cannot reject the ordinance no more then the israelites could reject the ark because it was carried in the cart of the philistims making

when tis promised that the woman shall be nourished in the wilderness rev

it must needs imply that there shall be some ordinances preserved from corruptions in their essentials and that gods people shall be accepted in the use of them and have benefit by them yet that is no argument against coming out of the wilderness expressing as is plain the condition of the christian world during the reigne of antichrist when they have light and might todo it neither can it be more an argument against separation from the images of the beast or reliques of them then it was against separation from the beast
will any say that because baptism was valid that was received in the catholick church of rome that therefore they should not have separated from her that are called the reformed churches why then should any say that because baptisme is valid and other ordinances that have retained their essentials in the episcopal churches and classical churches the images of it and in the parochiall

churches that are but reliques of the image of the beast that therefore we are not to separate from them

but to speak no longer in general let us come to that which is mainly drived at in this last objection viz whether this separation do not require rebaptization
am for the negative as appears by what hath been said and shall adde these arguments against rebaptization

first the scripture speakes nothin of it jesus christ hath left us no institution for it who yet was expected to tell us all things and this expectation owned without the least exception by our saviour john

that of the of the acts of the apostles is all the instance that know hath at any time been given to prove rebaptization and this scripture has been quoted to this purpose in the fourth age after christ by the donatists but in my judgement

so long abused
when say they paul found certain at ephesus that said they were baptized with the baptisme of john he commanded them to be baptized in christ
after the same manner do our anabaptists interpret this scripture through mistake applying vers to luke as his relation of what paul did whereas indeed it is to be looked

on as the relation of paul of what john did
and so is to be joyned unto the former verse as one intire speech of paul to the ephesine disciples
to prove which beza argues thus for says he

the particle undefined span alphabet which in all greeke copies is read with greatest concent and necessarily answers to the particle undefined span alphabet does by no meanes by no meanes say suffer that we should breake the series of this speech asunder as though the first part were to be attributed to paul and the latter part to luke the writer
and besides if there were here a rebaptization of the disciples that had been baptized with the baptisme of john it will be implyed that christs baptisme that he was baptized with being baptized of john and the baptisme of all his members is not the same that sounds very harsh
these considerations perswade me to thinke that here was no rebaptization and upon this account there was none because paul upon deliberation findes the essentials of a in john's baptisme
and let it be proved that any thing else was deliberated of by paul as to the solving of the question

whether he should baptize them or no before he laid his hands on them after that their ignorance of the gifts of the holy ghost brought their baptisme into question and whether the text will afford any thing to say upon good ground for the former baptisme of these but that they had the essentials

secondly we must either owne our baptisme received in the catholick visible church of rome the mother or in the diocesan or national churches the and images of that strumpet or else we must conclude that the churches that shall be and be owned of god during the months of antichrist of which see rev

shall want utterly the initiatory seal of the new testament and of this we finde no president in scripture that a church should utterly want the initiatory seal of the covenant of god neither do finde any hint that these churches should want it be in this case unparallel'd or know of any that pretend to any such thing that there should be a church utterly without the initiatory seal or else there must be an extraordinary way of

reviving the lost ordinance of baptisme in these churches and of this know neither promise that we should expect a second baptist nor experience for these hundreds of years since there have been such churches that any such have been raised up yet this must be received or the former that these churches must want baptisme if that be null that we have had in the catholick visible church of rome or the images of it for if receiving it in those false churches null it every one think will readily grant that there was not a baptized person left in the world when the wilderness first began to set up particular visible churches
for from the churches rest till those waldenses and albigenses tis very rare to finde a man that would acknowledge any other churches then the beast or his images that would acknowledge a particular visible church as mr cotton observes in his exposition of the revelation

chap
pag we are indeed minded of an act of constantine by his imperial edict reducing all to the catholick church to walk in communion with her holiness as his language is

by the centuriatores magdeburgenses cent
pag
by which church that he meanes the catholick visible is plain by the meanes he uses viz the delivering up the or oratories to the catholick church as they that please may read in the place above cited

thirdly twill be said but many

godly men have worshipped god zealously in this way and do still and god has and is still no question found of them

in answer to this let me propound

this to be weighed by every serious soule that this must be looked on as an indulgence of god unto sincerity owning what is of himself mingled with much of man
after that god had declared his mind about the place where he would put his name and david had preached it chron


yet solomon and the children of israel neglected to build the house the foundation of which was not laid untill the fourth yeare kings

and verses and perhaps this came to pass through solomons too much intensness on the building of his own house because this is named

before the lords house chap

immediately before the people are blamed for sacrificing in the high places that is done vers
neither can tell how to make the connexion betwixt these two verses but that solomon was so intent on his great match and providing a suitable palace that in the meane while the building of the temple was delayed not being carried on with that speed that it might have been and this prolonged the peoples sacrificing in the high places that turned unto sin unto them and solomon too and is made an exception in the religion of them both kings

and yet solomon zeale of god is approved too and god is found of him vers
but for all that is not that can make god winke at the neglect of gods institution
men thinke because they love god and are abundant in duties that god will not take notice whether they come to jerusalem or go to the high places what churches they worship in but believe it they are deceived and they are as much deceived that think tis enough to say for a way

that they have found god in it or rather in something of his that is practised in it

but there may be good done this obj way and has been good done in it errors suppressed and those reject it now made use of it once

answer the good that god brings an&sw out of evil is not to be construed into a divine approbation of it that its name should be changed and evil called good
neither is the use that has been made by good men of a false way of churches to be drawn into an argument to continue in it
see peter martyr in his

common places pag
transcribe not the latine as also neither in other quotations for haste
godly men says he so long as they were compelled to be in the papacy neither could have their meetings otherwhere if they thought they should any way profit in amending maners or any way procuring the glory of god or the salvation of others were to shew what was necessary to the bishops and pastors for that time given if they could not do it amongst their owne
but when it pleased god to raise up heroick persons such

as luther and zuinglius which have planted innumerable churches leaving the graves and ashes and small

footsteps of the church it was meet they should betake themselves thither where they might both live and do according to the word of god and by this meanes continue among themselves by succession the apostolique faith and life by joyning themselves to their predecessours· which lived rightly and sincerely in the primitive church

but shall we do it without the authority obj of the magistrate

answer that which is pressed is but an&sw the doing of your own duty in separation from unwarrantable societies that the text layes on every particular christian upon peril of incurring the wrath of god
jer

is a parallel place go ye out of the midst of her and deliver ye every one his own soule from the fierce anger of the lord burning against false worshippers

if the magistrate will further reformation tis a mercy so that he keepe to his own power and do not infringe the

power of the church for these two powers must not be confounded which yet few of the objectors attend unto but the text hath no such provisoe as if the magistrate bid or give you leave then come out of babylon
and therefore we are to resolve with pet
martyr we must

worship god holily and piously though all the magistrates in the world gainsay it
may adde to this what wollebius

saith if the magistrate be an enemy of the church the reformation of religion cannot be obtained of him then reformation of religion lyes upon those as their duty whom god hath furnished with necessary gifts for it neither is the consent of bishops to be expected
and because of this last clause shall adde what peter martyr a little above the place above quoted in the margine saith

there are some which may say saith obj he before we depart from the obedience of the magistrate in point of religion the consent of the church is to be expected

they which say these things let them an&sw consider that christ hath never so commanded

every one is for himselfe firmly bound to the law of god whether others assent or dissent
if a master have many servants that he commands to worke in the field and some of them in the masters absence will be idle ought therefore the rest to be idle too because the others do not at all consent to the common worke for this he quotes gal


and adds so ought we also to do after god hath made known his truth we must not delay
consent indeed is to be expected if the matter be dubious and obscure viz to him to whom it is revealed as the course of his speech makes manifest
let those therefore whose hearts god hath raised up go up and build his house ezra

and be as the before the flock jer

get we our brethren if we can along with us but let us not delay our own work and duty but with david make haste and not delay to keepe gods righteous judgements

and so much for explication

the reasons of the point are first

because antichrist churches are sin the great beast rev

represented in so monstrous a shape to shew ugly he is in the fight of god is the universal visible church of rome for it cannot be meant of the roman pagan empire because of the crowned hornes rev

and being in the wilderness rev

nor the roman christian empire for the devil gave not the seat to the christian emperours neither were they admired of all the world after the healing of the wound by charles the great neither is it a note of perdition to yeeld subjection to them which things are said of this beast rev

nor antichrist which is the other beast vers
he is indeed one of the heads but not the beast it self differing in number original shape and exercise of power vide cott in revel
what then can this beast be as he concludes but the catholike visible roman church and this beast answers to and is most fitly thought to succeed in the place of the roman empire

tis reckoned also amongst the detestable sins of antichrist that he causes an image to be made to the first beast
rev



that is to set a church in every nation that may have the likeness of the roman church viz
metropolitan national diocesan cathedral and provincial churches as mr cotton shews pag
and indeed if the first beast be the catholick visible church of rome these are the living characters of her and so may well be thought to be the image they are as like as mothers and daughters and the parishes are but reliques of them
now these being sins of antichrist the doctrine cannot be doubted of and those that will meddle with this sin it will draw in more sin upon them even as the needle drawes in the thred rev

her sins have reached unto heaven the holy ghost gives this a reason of our text
take beza's criticisme on the word rendred by reaching
he uses saies he the word undefined span alphabet whereby is signified sins mutually following one another and springing one from another at last to grow unto such an heape that they have reached even to heaven
and how naturally antichrists blasphemy of the tabernacle of god rev

that in

the language of the revelations best signifies the church followes on the continuance in his churches let all men judge and whether that be not the reason why the congregations of christ are so evil spoken of

secondly because they are harlots and will entice as the harlot to draw us away to their leud courses rev

she holds forth her abominations and filthiness of her fornication in a golden cup
babylon hath golden pretences for her abominable idolatries the prevention of schisms and heresies for a catholike church visible reverence to the womb that bare us and the paps that gave us suck for metropolitane national or diocesan churches and decencie for the surplice
she hath the alluring smell of a leopard to draw people after her
is dangerous to come neer her lest they be ensnared being besotted with her

sweet smell to the carnal sense
she contrives all things should be very sightly a comely proportion in the number of the beast is contrived is pleasing to the fancie and easie to remember is

she is mystery babylon subtil of heart her ways are such that thou canst not know them
therefore hearken not to her
a void her pass by her turne from her and pass away pro


and she is stubborne if you will return to to her well but she will not return to you
gods people would have cured her but she is not cured as twas said of old babylon jer

never knew any that would have a through reformation that durst take along their whole parish with them to the worke but have been forced to lay aside the most of them as the jews the samaritanes ezra

when they would prepare for distinguishing ordinances as their phrase is knowing right well that there were dogs enough if indifferently all were admitted to the management of that matter to snatch the bread out of the childrens hands and drive them from the table
why should they be washed in the same laver at least their children that must be washed in their right that may not eat at the same table let us take the prophets counsel forsake we babylon

and go every one to his own country let us wash our hands of her and expect what god hath determined of her

as du plessis once said of the roman church
so much for the reason of the point
a word or two of application

let all according to their places farther v&se and facilitate gods peoples going out of the antichristian churches according to the exhortation isa


be wise oh ye kings be instructed ye judges of the earth serve the lord in this worke cast ye up cast ye up an high way for the people of god and take away the and gather out the stones out of the way of gods people

first take away parishes by an act of state viz the ecclesiasticalness of them and all that may represent them to be of ecclesiastical consideration leave not so much as a broken piece of the image of the beast such are the parish and its ecclesiastical appurtenances as hozekiah made the brazen serpent nehushtan a piece of brass and brake it to pieces because the children of israel unto those dayes did burn intense

unto it kings

so do ye make them common civil things and leave no shape of the fomer ecclesiastical state in them
take josiah example in demolishing the altar of bethel and the high place there he brake down and stamped to powder the high place
parishes are our high places in this apostacy of the latter times temples of mans invention
away with all those consecrated places for worship those holds of mahuzzim daemons or as mede expounds them opening the verse of the of

daniel as a part of the description of antichrist
he renders the text thus he shall make the holds of the mahuzzims with all or joyntly to the forreigne god
he paraphrases thus and though the christian god whom he shall profess to acknowledge and worship can indure no compeeres yet he shall consecrate his temples ecclesiastical holds joyntly to the christian god and his mahuzzims deo sanctis to god and the saints

this may seeme a nicety to most that should inveigh so against these
but

is not god as jealous as ever and should not saints be as zealous may monuments of idolatry be better indured then heretofore sure am the argument for the demolition of these is perpetual and why the precept should not know not
daniel

and also verses

the true reason why these are suffered is hinted by mr cotton when he says vial the
pag
when the zeale of god lifts up the hearts of people saith he then they will not endure a consecrated place in all the world where they come
and when this vial is poured out then the earth shall be full of the knowledge of god and then all the chappels ease and churches of state and temples of glory wherewith the world hath been deluded shall be thrown down they will not leave them a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down

tis to our shame that we have no more knowledge of god then to suffer such plain monuments of idolatry
confess were it not to cry out against the altar of bethel and gain an advantage

of speaking to them that otherwise cannot have after the example of the churches meeting in solomons porch after the temple was abolished act


would never more preach or perform any holy duty in them

a way with patrons or those most abominable usurpers they usurpe the prerogative of christ they will found churches not onely build a synagogue but appoint the church and the minister and herein they usurpe over the church too
is it not wisdomes priviledge to build the house and hew out the pillars thereof pro

is not christ jesus the builder of the house and is not this his prerogative founded in his godhead heb

durst paul and barnabas exercise such tyranny as to impose a minister on the people as these do with the helpe of the bishop formerly of the commissioners for tryal of ministers now see act


mr calvin on the place having rendred the text thus when by suffrages they had made them elders in every church he comments thus the word undefined span alphabet is

to decree somthing by hands by which form of speech is best of all expressed the right way of making pastours
paul and barnabas are said to to chuse elders did they do this alone by their own office but rather they put it to the suffrages of all away therefore say with these abominable usurpers
and although this usurpation appeare not so clearely in the continuance as in the beginning of patrons and though it lie under more restraint now then formerly this will not salve the matter for the patrons now a dayes hold their right to present by vertue of the first usurpations of their ancestours which yet they also imitate and uphold and so now all the wickedness of them and withall scripture will not beare a mincing reformation lopping and plashing of bad plants neither will the blood of christ beare it and the power of his spirit
when the fountain is opened for sin and uncleanness the names of the idols shall be cut off and be no more remembered zach

twas evil to sacrifice and burne incense on the high places

though it were unto the lord onely god will be served onely in his own way and wisdome will send forth her maidens pro


which she cannot be said to do when men will minister to her in a strange way in the doing of it
and mark these maidens are such as go abroad to them that are without that are simple without understanding and walke with the foolish vers

let the world as well as the church be supplied with ministers according to christs institution
that which is stuck at much is the rights and properties of patrons the taking away these is looked on as a piece of injustice
remember pharaoh king of aegypt and sihon king of heshbon how their hearts were hardered by abuse of righteous principles urging them against gods commands and his churches good
do you ever finde when images are broken and burnt groves cut down and burnt and high places destroyed that there is any regard had unto the right that any had to the materials the great proprietarie of all the world calls in these rights who shall them

am sorry for men in these dayes

that make it a ground to breake up parliaments and make ordinances to preserve the rights and properties of patrons god calls for them and they may yeeld them without any dammage except that they shall want a way to oblige ministers to daube them with untempered mortar and sow pillowes under their elbows that they may lie easily in their sins and go in ease to their everlasting paines

a way with tythes that that seemes to me plainly distinguished from the in that argument of the apostle for the maintenance of the ministers of the gospel cor

tis plain he argues a simili from the like and like is not the same
and to this suffrages judicious mr hooker in his survey of

this way of raising maintenance saies he appointed in the gospel is far differing from that way of the tything in the law
mr mede hath this passage touching difference of the lawmaintenance of ministers and the gospel

maintenance
that which was onely required for acknowledgment of the divine dominion under the bondage of the law is now turned into the nature of an undefined span alphabet or gift for good tidings but this does not fully teach the difference betwixt law and of ministers which differs not onely in the motive and end but in the very kind
for one is a legal ceremony and the other is a the one is jewish the other is christian the one reformed the other popish according to the epithers find put on the way of tything by mr hooker calling it the popish jewish way of tything

concerning the popery of it shall onely adde what mr cotton speakes opening the number of the beast
the foundation sayes he is six that he opens by the six books of decretals now says he if you would know why this six comes to be multiplied by ten if you observe it all the government and maintenance of the roman state is by tenths by tythes all the people must give the tenth to the priest and the priest to the bishop for the maintenance of the catholique

church and so the whole government comes to be multiplied maintained and established
all the roman catholiques are built upon popish laws and decrees all which require subjection to the popish church and submission to that church and to the pope as the head of that church receiving doctrine and worship and discipline from that church and that was founded in six in the six books of their decrees and it is multiplied viz by tenths according to the same bookes to maintaine all the clergy from the pope to the lowest
but my argument that would follow is that tythes are jewish that is much to be suspected because they are popish the papists being so much addicted to be the jews apes and the rather because they have seemed to make much of the jewish in composing theirs and so their maintenance was most sutable to uphold it
but which is more the maintenance by tythes had reference to the temple they that minister in holy things do live of the things of the temple cor


that is a shrewd hint to their jewishness for they have reference to and so imply a temple priest sacrifices which have been revived by the papists with this maintenance
but yet farther either tythes are paid by the light of nature or moral command or else by a ceremonial precept
for as for the judicial law it contains but appendices explications and functions of the moral and ceremonial law and so need not mention that in this
and also know none that flie to another mean to prove that tythes were not ceremonial that may hurt this my argument besides this of natural light or moral command
assume therefore tythes are not paid by natural light or moral command
those instances of abraham and jacob paying tythes before the law of moses are not sufficient to evidence so much
circumcision was not of moses but of the fathers joh

yet was it so incorporated into moses law that it did oblige a man to keep the whole law gal


sacrifices also are as old as cain and abel gen
yet part of the ceremonial

law and abolished by christ heb


but the assumption is manifest because no law appointed in the gospel is inconsistent with any natural or moral law of god
but the institution of our saviour luke

urged by the apostle cor

and explained gal


will not stand with tythes these are out of the seed of the land the fruit of the trees or of the herd of the flock lev

deut

the is raised out of all good things that the person taught hath
tythes were paid the first tenth to the levites and they paid the tenth of the tenth to the priest neh

and those levites that taught in the particular synagogues paid to the priests who administred in jerusalem the is to be paid by all that are taught
conclude therefore that

tythes belong to the ceremonial law which to practise is to dig christ out of his grave and a character of antichrist joh

neither will it avail for any to say that they take them not as tythes for the corinthians could not be so excused

as to their eating things sacrificed unto idols neither in the idols temple nor otherwhere having taken it from the shambles if they eat with the offence of their brother
and if they eat in the idols temple it was not onely evil for the offence its sake but for it self as in which they committed idolatry and had fellowship with devils cor
notwithstanding they made no conscience of the idol or the things offered to idols but went to eat as to the civil feast of their friend vers
compared with chap


when we joyn in the same action with others our different opinion will not save us from the guilt of it as the apostle hints vers
these tythes were sacrificed to idols either directly whilst in honour of the saint the patron with them endowed the temple that was consecrated unto him or her or interpretatively by worshipping god with other worship and setting up other things yea contrary things then what he hath appointed in his church worshipping god in a messiah to come and exchanging institution gal


for tythes

and these are still fixed to the temples of the saints to whom temples were built in every parish and though they be not now looked upon so much as temples of the saints yet as temples of god they are looked upon generally and the service thought to be the better because performed there and this comes to the same pass since to worship god in a false maner is to worship a false

god for god hath now no material temple
neither hath there been any thing done by way of publike act of the nation against this superstition received by tradition from our fathers
upon which could not meet with the parish were it not that come as a prophet from judah to bethel to them to cry out against the altar there or upon the account of the churches meeting not theirs primarily
there is a thing like that eating things sacrificed to idols that the church of thyatira stands as

a bush in a hole to warn us lest we fall into it
and they that oppose it shall it may be fare the worse for it with the nations but christ will give them power over the nations at last
let us

not deceive our selves god will not be mocked all the churches shall know that he searches the reins and the heart and will give to every one not according to his pretences but his workes
let us esteem our knowledge by humiliation and the love of god

whereby we submit unto him and are zealous of his glory and afraid of offending him not by the enticing words of mans wisdome god will acknowledge him that loves him and submits unto him though his brethren may hate him and cast him out for trembling at

his word through which he becomes in their eyes more nice then wise but he shall appear to his joy and they shall be ashamed

away say with all appurtenances of a
let us not desire the silver and gold of the idol lest we besnared and become an abomination like it and accursed like it
deut

let us not be confident of our own strength how easie is it for us or at least our children to be reduced to the former popish when we have cathedral and

parsons vicars curates still continued people are apt upon such occasions to be taken with such things and to ask kow their fathers or the nation hath worshipped and this is a step to idolatry and forbidden of god deut

that therefore would not have any of the reliques of the canaanites idolatry survive them
oh that god would turn england into a bochim weepers as is in the margin that we might become weepers for this that we have not yet abolished the memory of our fathers superstition lest the lord leave us to our enemies to be thorns in our sides and to their gods to be snares to our souls
see that sad story judg

meditate on it sadly we have been parallel to israel in deliverances answerable to them in neglect of duties why should not we expect to be like them in the judgments that came on them

if to this should say take away episcopal churches you would say it were needless but what then means the cathedral temples other things may

be found is like if you search as god will viz with candles every dark hole
but give me leave to say take heed take heed that you set not up episcopacie again
saints are afraid what the commissioners for trial of ministers will come to at last
some spake out their fears at first sight and wished it came not to another episcopacy
let it be seriously enquired into
confess that at first was pretty well satisfied with the ordinance for their sitting save that tis grounded in part on the defence of patrons rights and properties but since my scruples increase
that which most satisfied me at first and made me think favourably of these commissioners mean as such commissioners was that their commission gives them not power to invest into office but that will not answer all my scruples now
for though they are not to invest into office yet they are to take the beginnings of their proceedings from the presentation of the patron that presents to benefice with care of souls originally and know no qualification that is put on his presentation but onely care

taken to preserve his rights and properties and so when they do confirm this presentation they do in effect invest into office and supply the place of the bishop to give the complement to the

and again is there not the of tyranny exercised over the elections of the people that was formerly even as whom the patron and bishop could agree in he was the man for the place let the people be never so much grieved even so now if the patron and commissioners agree that brings in a minister into a parish in spight of their hearts
but twill be said that they are not looked on as churches
but answer there cannot be denied but in many of them there are some reliques of a church some poor saints that are nourished in this wilderness that should not be imposed on
let it be considered what temple of god that is that antichrist is described by usurping over it thes

was it not the woman in the wilderness rev

with
antichrist raigns over the universal visible church during the of the church that is hid in

the confusions of antichristian order and lurks among the crowd of gentiles in the outward court that god owns not as a church rev

and therefore his remnant is this temple during the confusion of antichrist lurking secretly among the gentiles in their corrupt order

lastly does not the ordinance for empowring these commissioners provide for the propagation and continuance of our for though the commissioners are not to make them so yet they approve them that are so without any alteration

of their standing
aaron would have excused his making the golden calf if he could when he said there came out this calf but aaron should not have cast the metal into the fire over such a mould and then the gold would not have come forth in such a shape so the aforesaid ordinance should not cast ministers in the fire of examination over the that is not taken away and then when any come out of this fire they shall fall into that mould they become or are continued to be so

let things be seriously weighed make not cavils but speak out of conscience and the fear of the lord
the fear of his majesty makes me stand upon such things as these whose name should be sanctified his kingdome be submitted to and his will be done in earth as it is in heaven
the lord make his people of quick understanding in his fear not judging by the sight of the eyes and the hearing of the ear
things may have fair faces and be well spoken that are very foul filthiness of the fornications of mystery babylon whose abominations are in a golden cup
cannot but look upon what mr goodwin once said speaking of the

world to come in opening eph

viz
that christ will not cease till he has thrown down every rag all that dross and defilement that antichrist and popery brought into the world
cannot but look on this as comprehending as much in brief as have said jesus christ will never rest sayes he till he hath thrown out all the dross of this world both of doctrine and worship that conformity to the world hath brought in

know the great objection against what has been said is that ministers will want their certainty but for all this they that trust in the lord will say cast up take away the and that with a great deal of fervour because of the promise they that trust in the lord shall possess the land and inherit my holy mountain isa

god hath kept me bless him from many a snare by enabling me to take the promise for my maintenance and when first entered into the ministery that psa

was set on my heart when was in doubt whether to serve the lord with a little means or go to seek more yea rather accept more for was offered it in more places then one
and have been tried whether would stick to god hath kept me to it though with much experience of my frailty through this comfort of the promise have refused livings when might have had them and laid the down when god call'd for them in the witness of the truth
that say in the strength of god is vincat veritas ruat coelum
let us gain truth with the greatest damage for he that is the

fountain of truth is the fountain of good that hath riches of glory to supplie all our wants

proceed now unto a use of exhortation v&se to all gods people to come out of babylon according to such scriptures as these viz isa

it is an exhortation

sayes diodate to the people to come out of earths babylon and not to be allured and enticed by the unclean and profane benefits thereof and to all the church redeemed by christ to seperate it self from the communion and affection of the world and the corruptions and idolatries thereof cor

if any say we are in a captive state yet heare what calvin saith on

the place he admonishes them says he that although they be captives yet that they do nothing for the sake of their lords that their condition may be the better that they suffer not themselves to be drawn away from the pure worship of god that they be not polluted with their rites that they seeme not to worship their idolls assent to their religion the prophet doth not sayeth he exhort the jews to be clean

when they shall be free but whiles they shall be held captive and undergo the peril of their lives
add jer

and

and

strive to be formost in reformation as the delight to go before the flock
deliver every one his own soule stay not for others so as to lose your selves
these are not commands onely but have the force of a promise that the people of god shall come out of babylon
and tis as much as to say ye shall come out if it be not your own fault
and this is a cordial not to be neglected as in the type so neither in the antitype that the lord gives his people
but what hopes of deliverance one rumour comes one yeare and another yeare comes another rumour and in the land is violence ruler upon ruler as some render this last clause
the lord endeavours to defend our heart against such discouragements as these jer

before quoted
take

calvins note on it
doubt not says he but the prophet here bids the jews be of good and cheereful heart although the earth do often change the lords thereof because that mutation

althought it be manifold cannot at all detract from gods rule viz swaying all things to the accomplishing of his promise to his peoples good in their season

my deare brethren whom long to see upon mount zion and meet in the rendezvous of the there following the lambe and singing the new song beseech you suffer the word of exhortation in these following particulars

first reform not onely substance but circumstance hate the garment spotted by the flesh
under the law a man might not onely be defiled by a leprous man but by his clothes
jude alludeing to this type exhorts us to hate the garment spotted by the flesh vers

jude is so far from suffering evil to be cherished by indulgence that he commands to cut off all preparations and all accessaries as they call them that they avoid whatsoever is of any affinity or neere to vice
willet on the place

gives us this exhortation
we that profess saies he the glorious gospel of christ are taught that we should not neither in opinion

or in any external usages rites or customs which may breed offence conform our selves to the carnal and spotted profession of poperie but to decline in all things the very shaddow shew or least suspition thereof

secondly take away not onely idolatrous notions but the things
the lord commands that the graven images of the heathen gods be burnt with fire deut

but it might be objected the silver and the gold is never the worse we will therefore save that and call it silver and gold we may put it to a good use so we looke upon it as of no holiness but common silver and gold therefore the lord adds thou shalt not desire them nor take them unto thee lest thou be snared
dod and cleaver on the commandments give this comment on the place god say these reverend lights labours with the people of israel that when in the land of canaan they met with idols covered with gold and silver they should not covet or touch one parcel of the plate or meddle with it for if they did it would ensnare them and make them remember

the idol and from remembring fall to likeing and at last to worship it
therefore it is an abomination to god and he that will keep a piece of gold of the image it is the next way to make him a worshipper of the idol

this is that which the apostle means when he bids us purge our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit
we must not onely purge our selves of evil intentions as the corinthians that eat things sacrificed to idols in the idols temples that said they went to the civil feast of their friend and acknowledged but one god and one lord but as the apostle teaches them they must not eat the things sacrificed to idols nor sit at meat in their temples even so we must lay aside all superstitious things and actions and have no fellowship with wicked men in them

thirdly return not onely to the true object of worship but to the right means that are instituted in the word of god
enquire not how others have worshipped their gods deut

we should in reformation take no notice how idolatrous superstitious people have

done before us but what thing god commands observe to do that ver

this is that spoils reformation that mens eyes do not look right on and their look straight before them prov

and so as the serpent beguiled eve by drawing her eyes from institution to carnal considerations so are men beguiled from the simplicity that is in christ cor


lastly beware of antichrist's brokers and buy nothing of him at
the prophet reproved the hypocrites of his time· who though they would not eat of polluted and unclean flesh yet the broath was found in their vessels
it

hath been the old stratagem of the dragon and his vicar antichrist to deceive men by an image and men that will not abide papacy are yet well a paid with episcopacy and those those that cannot bear with episcopacy fall in presbytery which how neer of kin to it ye have seen before
as there is the strength and juice of the swines flesh in the broath though not the outward form so is there the force and strength and nature of episcopacy in presbytery although it in shape

shape be somewhat different

therefore

mr ellis
once popery sayes he rective or in point of government shewed was very probable for the substance though not the formality of it to follow upon the presbytery on the ground that its now endeavoured upon

do not scornfully upbraid any tis far from my heart but faithfully warn men of the devils method whereby he goes about to deceive

shall conclude all with that noble speech of the noble lord du plessis

may we not

lawfully say with the prophet we would have cured babel but she would not be cured
forsake her and let us go every one to his own country let us now wash our hands of her and expect what god has determined of her especially since her judgement is come unto heaven on the contrary the lord hath set forth our righteousness

and what then do we wait for from the same counsel the same prophesie and therefore from the same certainty but that those kings and the same states who have worshipped her finish the work of god who will put into their hearts to fulfil his will and his pleasure to execute his sentence and let not the present state of things astonish us in one

day in one hour in a moment are his works performed and this work must without doubt be performed
and long ago as of a thing already done near at hand and most certain the angel cried out· redoubled it it is fallen it is fallen babylon
but god forbid we should forget that other cry that follows go out of her my people ye to whom god hath given power to know her ye which know her but too well take heed it be not your damnation

can any man now pretend an excuse that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues lest being defiled by the contagion of her idolatry and enchantments ye be made partakers of the sentence long ago pronounced against her of eternal fire that remaines for her

but because we are for the most part incredulous and stupid let us pray unto god of his mercy to draw us as a lot out of this spiritual sodom as st john calleth it to pull us to himself by the hand of his angels to grant unto us that we look not back again and that we may before he pour down his judgements on babylon get to that holy mountain to that little segar

his church how small and contemptible soever it be in the eyes of the world
is it not a little one saith lot and my soul shall live now to him father son and holy ghost for the bottomless depths of his judgements and of his graces be praise and glory world without end amen

and when he was come neere the cittie hee beheld it and wept for it saying oh if thou hadst knowne euen at the least in this thy day those things that belong vnto thy peace but now are they hid from thine eyes

in the seauenth of eccles and
verse it is written that it is better to goe into the house of mourning than into the house of feasting and therefore haue chosen a tragicall text sounding foorth nothing but passions and mournful notes like the tunes of those banished israelites

vpon babilons banks

the first voice that euer proceeded from adam our progenitor after his fall was a voyce compounded of sorrow and feare

when god called vpon him while hee hid himselfe among the trees of the garden

all adams children ought to bee like adam passionate and sorrowfull making theyr whole life sutable to theyr infancie as wee all come to the worlde by a sorrowfull conception
in the
of genesis iacob coulde not meete his brother but their eyes must streame forth teares
and in the
chap we finde abraham the patriarch an old man in yeeres a verie childe in teares mourning weeping
in iosiah his time whole multitudes are recorded to goe out and weepe before the lord
not to stand vpon particulers which are not necessary in so cleere a truth christ iesus the very mirror of sorow is in this place presented vnto vs weeping pittifully vpon ierusalem
wherein wee are by the way to note the differences betweene the godly the wicked betweene the children of god the children of this world

the godlie are euer noted rather sorowing then reioycing rather bewailing lamenting theyr sinfull condition than solacing themselues with the vaine pleasures of

this transitory life

vvee finde not them at any time either

sporting it like cham or dauncing like herodias or carowsing like belshazar
search the volume of holy writ from moses vnto iohn that saw so many misseries in pathmos and wee shall finde a contrary humour and another kinde of affection raigning in the righteous

moses as hee was drawne vp from the waters so hee shewed himselfe in the course of his life to be as it were quite swallowed vp with the ouerflowing waters of affliction and he prayed god to race him out of his booke that he had written in the
of

exodus
dauid watered his couch with continuall teares

paule wept for the corinthians
peter went out to weepe bitterly for denying his lord
and to come to our example in thys place christ iesus though hee were the sonne of god shewes himselfe in thys to be also the sonne of man he shed many a salt teare ouer ierusalem
vvho among vs can be so deuoted and so solde ouer as it were to sinfull vanitie now to be sporting seeing christ our lord so heauy and passionate the generall proposition vvhich saint luke vrgeth in this historicall discourse of christ his trauailing to ierusalem is thys hee prooueth that in this place which indeede is the scope and drift of the vvhole booke viz to cleere to the world but especially to the vnbeleeuing iewes that christ is the only messias or sauiour proued so by his birth his life death liuing dying rising and ascending
as iohn the baptist poynted at christ the lambe of god purging the sinnes of the world so heere saint luke poynts at christ vveeping for the sinnes of the world

when the people of ierusalem laughed christ wept as when the ministrell played elisha prophecied and therefore this cittie otherwise famous but in this infamous

worthily ranne to ruine and so receiued a true and due recompence for her securitie
and when he drew neere the cutie hee beheld it and wept for it
the do note many things in christ appertaining to saluation
prudentiam in eius doctrina wisedome in his doctrine
temperantiam in eius vita temperance in his life
fortitudinem in eius tortura fortitude in sustaining torments
diuinum numen in miraculis diuine power in his works
consolationem in dictis consolation in his words
and in this place compassionem in eius tristitia compassion in his sorrowfulnes for he wept vpon ierusalem
hee wept
to teach vs to weepe and to haue compassion in beholding the lamentable state and condition of our neighbours
we must weepe for them as christ wept for the iewes and withall hee teacheth vs to weepe for our selues as hee bad the daughters of ierusalem to weepe for themselues
to drawe yet a little neerer to the embowelling of these words for a cleerer narration obserue with me these foure things

the person who came that was christ

the place whether he came to ierusalem

the action or rather you may terme it a passion hee wept

his admonition in reprehending theyr ignorance and theyr fall
now then that wee haue founde out the myne let vs digge for the treasure
the person who came to ierusalem was christ
and the scripture doth manifestlie declare how great he was for he was god
the father and are one
ioh
how humble he was for he was the sauiour of the worlde
his humilitie appeared in taking our nature vpon him
being god it pleased him to become man and to dwell with men hee withdrew himselfe from none no not from the publicans and sinners

that iesus who was contempte mundi a hater of this worlde one that nothing esteemed the pompe and glory thereof for when the tempter presented before him at one viewe all the kingdoms of the earth

tempter and temptation were both driuen to retire
one powerfull worde of christ

quite vanquisht him as dauid ouercame golias with one stone when it perced into his temples
that iesus who refused all worldly superioritie and power for when in the sixt of iohn they woulde haue made him theyr king he conueyed himselfe out of the way
who was mercifull for he forgaue the woman taken in adultery
who was powerful for his words made the souldiours giue backe when they came to take him
as in the
of mathewe his worde made the prince of darknesse giue backe when he came to tempt him
who was pittifull this place proueth it
he wept

that christ who is called vera lux the true light for the saued to walke in
the

bright morning star
the flower of lesse
the mighty lyon of the trybe of iudah
the author and finisher of our fayth

that christ to who that excellent voyce of glory once sounded from the heauens this is my well beloued sonne in whom am well pleased

hee who was promised by the father figured in the lawe spoken of by the

prophets poynted at by iohn baptist manifested in the flesh iustified in the spirit seene of angels preached to the gentiles

beleeued on in the world and receiued vp in glory
this christ came to ierusalem
so much briefely is spoken for the person now for the place
the place whether christ came was ierusalem the metropolis or chiefe citty in all asia by interpretation a vision of peace
yet this people knevve not their peace
god had stampt a remembrance of his blessings in the very name of ierusalem yet could not this people co~sider of it they made no vse of this peace which god had giuen them
this citty had in it many faults in christes time
for first they knewe not theyr peace
secondly they prophaned the temple of god making it a denne of theeues and a shop of merchants where it should haue beene the house of prayer
thirdly in it were the prophets slaine
fourthly it fostered within it the greatest enemies of the crosse of christ
fiftly beeing the citty of the great king it was allotted to destroy the great king christ iesus the king of glory
this citty so polluted christ comes to visite

as once god the father said come let vs goe downe and visit babel so heere christ

the sonne sayth to his apostles come let vs goe visite ierusalem
in which his comming to ierusalem we see it first noted by the euangelist he drew neere the citty for beeing a prophet hee would doe as did the prophets
samuell came neere to israell ionas came to visite niniuie and christ came heere to visit ierusalem
hee drew neere to it
hauing first trauailed to iericho and after to and then to bethany at last he comes to ierusalem
wherein wee are to note the great dilligence of christ to verifie his former words came to seeke and to saue that which was lost
he neuer ceased to doe the will of his father

beeing but twelue yeeres old he taught in the temple and disputed vvith the

doctors hearing them apposing them

we should be armed with like industrious diligence
the chyldren of god are euer noted to be eyther going or walking or running

peter during the time of his fall is noted sitting to shew his carefulnes but so soone as hee felt the motions of gods spirit calling him to repentance hee

sits no longer but goeth out

the israelites are recorded to be alwaies

trauailing and remouing till they came to canaan

moses so soone as hee was borne was

cast out among the flagges from thence he was brought to the kings court in egypt
after that he was driuen to she to midian and from mydian backe againe to egypt
and after all this what long and tedious trauels did hee vndergoe in that long iourney to canaan
wherein is rightly typed the state of euery religious christian mans life

our life heere is but a pilgrimage a vanishing vapour that suddainly is lost while a man lookes vpon it and therefore holie men must learne of moses and of christ

to redeeme the time by walking towardes god and by trauailing about our fathers busines as christ trauailed about his fathers busines when hee went to ierusalem
this is the pilgrimage that best pleaseth god and not that of the idolatrous antichristians of this age the iesuites meane and seminaries which take great paines to compasse sea and land to make one proselite like themselues and when they haue made him hee prooues duplo plus filues gehennae quam erat prius two folde more the sonne of perdition then he was before
much better were it for such if they sate still than so to seale vp iniquitie to theyr greater condemnation

christ his trauell and the trauell of the godly tendeth to a contray purpose viz to drawe men to the knowledge of the truth and the gayning of soules to christ
such shall not loose theyr labour
hee that conuerteth soules saith daniell shall shine like the starres for euer

the prophet dauid desireth god to make him goe the path of his commaundements and hauing learned to goe hee striueth to runne will runne the way of thy commaundements when thou hast set my hart at libertie
in the tenth of marke one comes running to christ
zacheus beholding christ out of the wilde made hast to get downe and runnes to meete him
bartymeus threw away his cloake to run to christ

in the fourth of micheas the cry of religious iewes is noted come say they let vs goe vp to the mountaine and to the house of the god of iacob
so the godlie are still in motion as christ himselfe is euer noted trauailing for the most part
vve read neuer of his sitting but once and then hee disputed teaching vs to shun idlenes
hee drew neere the cittie
the bride cannot bee drawne from the bridegroome nor christ from the citty
in the first of canticles vvee finde the church the spousesse of christ running after christ will runne after thee

and in the
chapter we finde her seeking

and diligently inquiring after christ haue yee seene him whom my soule loueth and in this place vvee finde christ the spouse seeking out his spousesse the church with like correspondent affection he trauaileth to visit ierusalem
wherein besides his diligence his loue and tender affection towardes the children of god is manifested
he cherisheth them as his owne bowels and therefore he draweth neere to ierusalem as one desirous to know theyr state
christ beeing borne in the citty couets to liue in the cittie
he came for mans sake into the world and so he liued in the presence of men
yeeres together
he came to call sinners and therefore he liued in the citty because there were the greatest sinners
we reade of iohn baptist that hee liued in deserto in the wildernesse he shrunke the cittie for that the citty was full of pollution which christ needed not to feare
hee would liue in the cittie to winne the cittie like an immaculate lambe he tooke away all spots from his elect

hee vvoulde liue in oculis aduersariorum

in the eyes of his aduersaries to the end hee might truly iustifie himselfe
quis exvobis arguat me de peccato who of you can reprooue me of sinne euery thing couets to liue at home the byrds in the ayre the fishes in the water the beasts in the mountaines and christ bred in the citty loueth the cittie delights to visit it
he drew neere to the cittie
more than this it is added hee beheld it
in
psalme it is sayd a vertente faciem tuam omnia turbabuntur when thou turnest away thy face all thinges are troubled
to shew that they are blessed vpon whom christ looketh
happy had these people beene if they had as carefully looked vppon christ as christ did vpon them for then they had beene healed as they that looked vpon the brazen serpent recouered
hee beheld

that is in a carefull contemplation hee considered the great corruptions wherwith this cittie was stayned and withall he looked with a prophetical eye vpon the seuere iudgements which god already had determined

to throw vpon the citty for the sins therein committed
in this example two sorts of men are called vpon that is ministers magistrates
ministers ought to visit the places most sinfull
they must cry out against the sins of the people
es

they must be knowne by theyr teaching and preaching as aarons entering into the sanctuarie was knowne by the sounde of

the belles which he wore in the skirts of his clothing
magistrates are likewise called vpon for christ was both rex et propheta a king a prophet
they may not slumber vvhen iniquitie is increased but they also must come and visit ierusalem that is they must see the disorders of citties and townes and labour to reforme them
christ hath in his owne person chaulked the way before vs and other godly magistrates in all ages haue succeeded him vvith like holy practize

moses the perfect mirror of sincere magistracie did looke into the abuses of sinners in his time and laboured carefully to reforme the same
and for that hee coulde

not alone vndergoe so waighty a prouince by the aduice of iethro his father in lawe gods counsell also concurring hee chose vnto himselfe other inferiour magistrates

to be rulers and iudges and there hee describeth what manner of men they ought to be viz

men of courage fearing god dealing

truly hating couetousnes
but am not to speake of this but in a generalitie
magistrates must learne of christ to behold those places ouer which god hath made them ouerseers
they must not onely in theyr circuites come to citties and townes but they must circumspectly looke into the disorders there
when christ came within a sight of ierusalem he makes there his rest his station and there deliberatly in this his prospect he summoneth arraigneth at the bar of his iustice all the sinnes of the people of ierusalem

to behold then in this place importeth not a slender looking into matters of corruption as the fashion is of many magistrates that carry no conscience of their places such as was corah his complices

that could smooth vp the matter to moses with this warme conceit all is well and the people are holy enough
but this intimateth a diligent and a carefull speculation a due examination of all matters both of smaller crimes and greater offences and when they haue founde out the sinner as iosuah founde out achan the theefe his theft also then to punish according to the weight of the offence
the magistrates iudiciall censures must not be like spyders webs which intangle onely the small flies
as christ passed first from to bethany and from bethany to ierusalem so shoulde magistrates passe fro smaller sinnes to greater enormities till all wickednes be abandoned without which due speculatiue courses nothing can be reformed in any wel ordered
the magistrates ought to haue lynceos oculos to bee the better to looke into abuses
they must be able to iudge of sinne intus et in cute to make a scruting into euery corner of corruption that no sinne may escape without his censure

they must rather shewe themselues seuere and straight like vnto moses and iosuah in the punishing of sinne than too slacke and remisse in theyr places like ely who spared to correct the disobedience of his sonnes and so god tooke the iudgement

into his owne hands and spared not to cut off both him and them in the seueritie of his iustice
magistrates must remember that they are the lords in gods sled appoynted for the punishment of euill doers and for the prayse of them that do wel
the phylosophers lay downe three properties of a good eye that is to see quick
to see long
to see farre
like balaam to see the vtmost coasts of israell euen from dan to beershebath
they are not sound politicians nor profoundly learned in the arte speculatiue that doe not in this sort behold abuses
they carry not in them the substance of magistracie till they haue learned to execute the edge of theyr authority in punishing offences

as the spirituall sworde hath two edges so the temporall or ciuil sword should haue

two edges to cut two wayes
in the and second psalme haue said yee are gods saith dauid speaking in the person of god
as if hee should haue saide during the time of your magistracie while you sit in gods chayre you must forget that you are men least so base a conceit doe make you yeeld to weaknes and corruption but you are for that tyme more then men
you are gods and therefore consider of your places behold and punish
looke into the nature of the sin and let the punishment be aunswerable
otherwise you are not like gods more than in your names and titles as labans idols were called gods and yet were but blocks
if magistrates when they shall ascend theyr iudiciall seates did but consider of this theyr very names would teach them how to carry themselues and then woulde not sinne so violently breake out nor walk in the open streets so vncontroled as at this day it doth

as no halt nor lame nor blinde might be admitted into the ministery so vnto the magistracie should no weake or corrupt

or blinde magistrate be preferred but the wisest and best approued
it followeth he wept for it

when christ beheld the monstrous impietie and horrible sinnes in this citty committed without any hope of speedie reformation or amendement it greeued him to the very hart as once it greeued god his father when looking vpon the sins of the old world hee repented that hee had made man
and when he had once entered into this griefe he could not chuse but expresse the same by teares that flowed amaine fro his eyes in great aboundance like the waters of hesbon
hee wept partly for theyr sinnes partlie for the iudgements of god which now already were begun to be poured out
saint bernard principally noteth three things in christ our sauiour dicta consolationis words of consolation
opera propitiationis works of propitiation
facta commiserationis deeds of commiseration or pittie as in this place and elswhere

we read that he wept thrice once when he raised lazarus in this place vpon ierusalem and vpon the crosse

yet we are not to thinke but that hee wept more often
for he did alwaies with teares no doubt lament the wickednes of men to teach vs not to glory in our neighbors fall but to weep bewaile their fraile co~dition
cyprian hath a sweet saying uere patitur qui compatitur he is most patient that is most passionate
or rather he hath passion enough in him that hath in him compassion
and it argueth a most christianlike and charitable affection when we are in a pittifull remorse touched with our brethrens infirmities
such was moses his compassion in the
of numbers
and paule when he wept
yeeres for the corinthians
and esdras for the afflicted iewes
heere by christes teares we are to learne three things
first that hee was a man like others sin onely excepted which confuteth the heresie of the manichees which do deny his humanity
for they holde that christ was not verus homo but quasi homo not very man but in the similitude of a man and that he had not corpus but quasi corpus viz corpus assumptinum not a naturall body but an assumptiue body
in maintaining whereof they crosse that scripture hee was made of the seede of dauid according to the flesh
rom

the word was made flesh
iohn

and againe we haue but one mediatour euen the man iesus christ
let them but aske the deuill in this case and hee although the father of lyes vvill speake truth heerein to conuince them the rather of heresie
cast thy selfe downe mute te deorsum sayth hee to christ
the deuill is better then the anabaptists for he acknowledgeth that christ had a body which they denie
the second thing that wee learne by his teares is hee was vnwilling that the people of israell should commit sinne against the that most blasphemously affirme that god is the authour of sinne
volens efficiens suggerens
crossing these scriptures
a prophane writer that neuer sawe the light of diuititie could confute such hereticall opinions
undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet

neither must wee imagine that god is the author of euill neither yet without god

can any euill be done
for the spirit of god hath spoken it non est malum in ciuitate quod non facit dominus
thirdly by christes weeping we learne the sympathie and holie vnion that is betwixt christ and vs hee feeleth our sorrowes and is touched with our infirmities

we read of his sighing in marks gospel

when he cured one that was deafe heere wee reade of his weeping ouer ierusalem that had in it many deafe eares and regarded not the voyce of the charmer
of the necessity of weeping and howe farre teares may preuaile with god beeing powred out from the eyes of the godlie haue plentifully spoken elswhere
thus much then shall briefely suffice co~cerning christes weeping vpon ierusalem
now let vs proceede by order of the text to the cause of his weeping
if thou hadst knowne ierusalems sinnes prouoked christes teares and of theyr many sinnes one is here discouered they knew not theyr peace

the learned doe expound peace three waies eyther it may signifie externall or outward peace or peace of conscience or

christ the authour of peace
ye may admit any of these significations in this place but in my iudgement the last is fittest and most specially meant by our sauiour in this check when hee told them they knewe not that which belonged to their peace
which had they knowne it had brought them to the knowledge of all the rest
they knewe not christ by the preaching of the word they receiued not the gospell of peace
they yeelded no obedience to the worde of truth nor did shewe any carefull practise in reforming their liues accordingly
these people of ierusalem liued in securitie and at ease they liued in peace euery man vnder his owne vine and vnder his own
and they soothed vp themselues in this their securitie assuring themselues that this great citty beeing the lady of so many prouinces the light and beauty of all asia and all kings glory so strongly sortifyed so richly furnished and vvith so many people replenished should neuer bee brought to vtter desolation

such is the naturall corruption of men generally to be carelesse and not once to

thinke or aduise themselues of future calamities so long as it goeth well with them so long as they are fatted with the aboundance of gods blessings
these inhabitants of ierusalem were not so prouident nor so wise as the prophane phylosophers notwithstanding they liued then when wisedome cryed in their streets
sapientis est in otio de negotio cogitare a wise man ought in time of peace to think vpon warre

so is it verifyed vvhich vvas spoken by our sauiour the chyldren of this world are wiser in theyr generation then the chyldren of light
these carelesse iewes abused their peace because they sought no meanes to contitiue it for they killed the prophets and stoned the that were sent vnto them yea when christ himselfe came among them they crucified him to seale vp theyr securitie to theyr greater ouerthrow
and howe then could this people know theyr peace vvhen they contemned and euill intreated him that was the onely authour and maintainer of theyr peace

thys peace contayneth in it all other

blessings
and therefore christ onely nameth it in this place as the very continent of all the rest

the excellencie whereof may appeare in those speciall commendations of it
before his departure hee commended vnto them peace
my peace leaue vnto you

when he was risen againe hee commended peace vpon his the angels proclaimed peace and the gospell is

called the gospell of peace
therfore haue peace and thou hast all the blessings that god hath and want onely this peace and thou art worse spoiled of gods graces than euer was iob of his chyldren and goods
oh if thou hadst knowne here it may be proclaimed againe which once was vttered by that voyce of maiestie proceeding from god himselfe in the
of exodus the lord the lord strong mercifull and gracious slowe to anger and aboundant in mercy and truth
see howe christ our sauiour trauaileth with mercy in this place and laboureth to be deliuered
oh if thou hadst knowne
yet hee offereth mercy to ierusalem if ierusalem would haue repented
oh that yet they would turne and be saued
shall say since they will perrish let them perrisht nay surely saith christ will yet wash naaman seauen times more to clense him of his leprosie if hee vvill be clensed
in the
of ieremie ninth verse saith the lorde woulde haue cured babell so christ in this place saith would haue cured ierusalem but alas she will not be cured
all the precious balme in gylead will not suffice to recouer ierusalem the prayse of the world
in this thy day
he calls it ierusalems day to shewe that god giueth all men a time and now is our day and our time therefore vse the time and abuse not gods lenitie
for the night will come when no man can worke
and therfore it is sayde to day if you will heare his voyce
but if you will not to day will not to morrow
beholde as when called you woulde not heare so when you call vvill not heare saith the lord

a day consists but of a morning an euening and a noone and hee that hath the longest time permitted him hath but a day

defer it not then in any case since thy time in which thou maist turne to god is so narowly scantled
if thou lose the morning of thy life lose not the noone and if thou be so carelesse a sinner as that thou puttest off thy conuersion till the euening of thy life yet euen then reclaime thy selfe before the sunne of righteousnes doe set when it can shine no more vnto thee
but thou shalt haue a happier successe in my iudgement if thou begin betimes like abraham in the morning of thy life to sacrifice thy selfe to god
for wee haue an old saying it is a true saying a good beginning makes a good ending
and qualis ita
as a man liues so commonlie he dies
euery man would be gladde to die vvell as balaam desired to die the death of the righteous but hee had no care to lyue the life of the righteous
and therfore though he could prophecie to others yet hee could not prophecie to himselfe nor his owne end

farre otherwise did dauid that propheticall king carry himselfe and may stande

as a rare president not for kinges onelie but for priuate men also he began his day betimes and so continued it to the end
at euening morning and at noone will prayse thee
thys forslowing the time and continuall running on in sin making vp the score of iniquitie is heere imbrayded vnto these iewes
the tyme of grace was offered them the time of visitation vvhen the lorde called vpon them for repentance but they repented not
the turtle the crane and the swallowe knowe theyr appoynted times yet israell knoweth not his time
god sent his worde they neglected it his prophets them they slewe his ovvne sonne and him they crucified
still they were carelesse like the olde worlde before the flood
and so god shut them out of tyme for that vvhen they had time they abused the commoditie thereof in the world

if these people had considered of theyr peace they had not prouoked christes eyes to distill into teares but as fast as christ drevve them forwardes sinne and

sathan drew them backwards sounding in their eares this so pleasing and so plausible a lesson it is not yet time time is not yet
see howe continuance of sinne breedes custome when custome entereth gods grace auoydeth and so the temple of god becomes a denne of theeues
for consuetudo peccandi tollit sensum peccati custome in sinne takes away al sence and feeling of sinne and so beeing once past sence and feeling the body becomes dead without motion life or soule in it

note the degrees of sinne in sinfull men first they grow wicked then obstinate then desperate like caine posting it from one sinne to another at last a griping worme of conscience seazeth vpon theyr soules as the deuils entered into the heard of swine
and then they cry out in a desperate rage whosoeuer findes me shall sley me

not much different from this is that destinction of the learned wherein they make foure degrees of a sinner
the first in voluntary delectation
the second in co~sent
the third in fulfilling it by worke
the fourth in continuance
vvherein whosoeuer

is once buried is hardly raised to life againe without earnest prayer vnto god many teares on his owne behalfe
and therefore it is said languor prolixior grauat medicu but languorem breuem praecidit medicus a long vlcerat sore troubles the phisition but a greene wound is easilie launced
it followeth tut now they are hid from thine eyes
this call of christ in this place was as it were the third cocke to warne these people to repent
the sinner cannot say but he hath been called
herod had a call when iohn preached vnto him
that other herode had a call when he felt a desire to see christ
what a call had pilat when he was made to vnderstand the innocencie of christ
and so ierusalem had a call that a loud call by christ himselfe preaching vnto them euery day in theyr temple and working so many miracles before them which made christ vtter with weeping eyes thys sentence so full of sweet compassion oh if thou hadst knowne at least in this thy day those things that belong vnto thy peace
now come to particular application so conclude
when we come to our citties townes as christ came to ierusalem do cleerelie behold as we cannot chuse but see the manifolde pollutions and sinnes in them committed haue not we cause to take vp a lamentation and to weepe for our ierusalem of england together with our other citties and townes and may not vvee as iustly proclaime with christ in this place oh if you had knowne at least now in this your day the things that belong to your peace
vvee are as sinfull as euer the men of ierusalem vvere
nay our sinnes exceede theyrs both in quantitie qualitie number and nature euery way beyonde comparison and may not our eyes then streame foorth teares for that vvee are they that do not knovv nor regarde the day of our visitation

these dissolute iewes liued securely too too much presuming vpon gods long tolerance and lenitie
besides for that they had the temple of god amongst them the arke of his couenaunt which promised blessing and life for they

waxed the more carelesse mistrusted nothing
yet more then all this they trusted in the strength of their citty in the wise gouernment of theyr sage senators and in the multitude of theyr horses chariots
but all deceaued them to iustifie the truth of that scripture cursed is hee that maketh flesh his arme
yea the emperour titus himselfe confessed it had been a thing in humaine reason impossible to ouercome it
the prophet ieremie confirming the same
the kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world would not haue beleeued that the aduersary and the enemy should haue entred into the gates of ierusalem
but theyr false confidence deceiued the god had so disposed that euen at easter when there came infinite multitudes from all places to ierusalem to worship the citty should then be besieged
and there were gathered together at one tyme about thirty hundred thousand as iosephus testifieth

in that bloody stratageme so many thousands left theyr liues that it greeued the very enemies that came to take it and it

was commaunded by the emperour vpon view of the dead bodies that so many as remained aliue should not bee slaine but be sold
and the residue of the iewes were had in so vile a reckoning that thirtie of them were valued but at one penny as they valued christ our lorde but at thirty siluerlings so god in his iust iudgement prized thirtie of them to be woorth but one siluerling and that to be a coyne of the smallest value
most writers hold it to be but a farthing
and at this day they are accounted the most co~temptible nation in the world yea the very name of a iewe is odious and it is not so much as once mentioned vvithout disdaine
and thus was ierusalem defaced thus were the peculiar people of god become no people the citty that once was shem the glory of the world nowe become the shame of the world wherein may not bee found one stone vpon a stone because they regarded not to know the day of theyr visitation

so it pleased the most iust iehouah to reuenge that place where our lord was crucified

and where the blood of gods saints was spilt vpon the ground like water
hence let vs grow wise and learne by ierusalems fall to stand
let the shrubs tremble when the tall cedar trees are throwne downe
si hoc fit in viridi quid fiet de if this were done in the greene tree what shall become of the dry if god spared not ierusalem because the people thereof knewe not theyr peace shall he spare vs that know not our peace neuer did so many prophets cry at once in our streets as at this day they do throghout the whole land from dan to beerseba from douer to saint dauys from barwicke to the mount court citty and country but who doth listen to the voyce of the cryer

neuer was the vvorde more plentifullie taught neuer more contemptuously reckoned neuer more talking of it but neuer lesse walking after it many that can speak well too too fewe that can doe well
and so we deferre our conuersion till our confusion ouertake vs like the iewes in thys place who woulde not beleeue till they

smarted for it
well if wee perseuer and runne on the score with him as we doe certainly a iubilee of yeeres cannot passe ouer vs till our iudgement come
for the word is the same now it was then and god is the same to day and yesterday and the same for euer
therefore while the kingdome of grace is with vs let vs holde it least in despysing it wee lose a better paradice than adam did
vvee liue in that age wherein wee may beholde the cleerenes of that glory and the fulnesse of that peace which the kings of the earth the mighty men before vs haue desired to see but might not attaine vnto it all which doth agrauat our sinnes the more for by howe much more plentifully god shines among vs in his graces by so much the our punishment be

for if the worde when it was spoken by angels was stedfast and euery transgression and disobedience receiued a iust recompence of reward howe shall vvee escape if vvee neglect so great saluation which was first preached by the lord him

selfe and after was confirmed of them that heard him
pyndarus writeth that it was counted a happy citty on the which it was thought that golde did raine
if any citty bee so then hath god poured this blessing vppon vs and our citties of england in an extraordinary measure
it is seene in the wealth the peace and godly securitie that wee haue nowe a long time inioyed
euery man now liues vnder his owne vine and vnder his owne figgetree so that our houses may seeme vnto vs so many tabernacles of rest
it is seene in the peaceable gouernment in the whole frame of our christian policie

euery good man weigh with himselfe the long tranquility great plenty peaceable libertie which god hath giuen vs during the raigne of our most gracious soueraign making our daies like the daies of salomon in whose time siluer was as plentifull as

stones and cedar trees like the wild figgetrees that are abundant in the plaine
these so great blessings from her deriued vnto vs ought in no wise to be forgotte for they are indeed for number so many for valew so

great as the like haue not beene seene almost in any age
first in hauing the true light of the gospell so shining among vs so publiquely receiued so vniuersally professed so freely preached
againe in giuing vs a prince so vertuous borne among vs with such peace defending vs against them that would deuour vs vvhat coulde god doe more for his vineyard then hee hath done so that wee may sing with dauid peace is within our gates and plenteousnesse within our palaces
and againe mercy and truth haue met together righteousnes and peace haue kissed each other
and again non est auditus armorum sonitus in vrbe
that may be truly spoken of vs vvhich zephany coulde not iustifie of the people in his time
our princes are not as roaring lyons our iudges are not like rauening vvolues that leaue not the bones till the morrowe
our prophets are not light and wicked persons polluting the sanctuarie and wresting the law
the iust god is in the midst of vs he will doe no iniquitie

so many england seeme these infinite blessings that haue spoken of duly considered like eden the pleasant garden planted

by the lord
since god hath performed these great things for vs which no tongue of man or angell is sufficiently able to eternize let vs be thankfull and let our gratitude be testified by our obedience least it be saide of vs that ierusalem is no better then samaria
when iacob in the
of genesis avvaked out of his sleepe at bethel hee sayde surely the lord is in this place and was not aware
so if when god shall testifie his presence among vs in his manifold blessings and we take no notice of it in acknowledging neyther him nor them we may well say as jacob did of a surety god was in this place we were not aware
let vs acknowledge them now wee haue them for it will be too late when they shall be taken from vs bring forth fruites saith iohn woorthy of repentance
so bring forth good works worthy of these blessings
wee would all seeme to be hanged with leaues let vs rather shew that we are hanged with fruites least we be like the fruitelesse least wee be like chorazin where christ

wrought many miracles yet they remained faithlesse
beseech you brethren in the bowels of iesus christ make much of the worde which is preached among you for it is euen your life
so termed by moses in the
of deut
if you will haue a care of your peace if you will haue christes eyes to distil with no teares if you will not greeue the spirit of god by whom yee are sealed to the day of redemption
let ierusalems ruine be to you a cause of rising
this profit shoulde bee made of others harmes like the honny that sampson found in the dead lyon
oh that this heere threatned to ierusalem were written vppon the tables of our harts with an yron penne or the poynt of a dyamant that it might neuer be forgotten oh that we would yet learne to know our peace and the time of our visitation

yet there is time to consider our selues yet is the acceptable time yet is the day of saluation yet the sunne of righteousnes shineth god calleth to the waters of life
yet hee cryeth in our eares
be lifted vp yee gates and will enter in saith the lord and

be open vnto me ye euerlasting doores and the king of glory shall come in
the same christ our lorde in the
of reuelation and
verse saith stand at the doore and knocke if any will heare my voyce and open to mee will come in and sup with him
end in a word with this short exhortation
as when god made the light and had it from the darknes he sayd bonum est it is good
when he had made the firmament the earth and the seas he sayd bonum est it is good
when hee had made the trees hearbes and plants and all creatures hee said still bonum est it is good
but hauing finished his work of creation taking a perfect view of al that he had made finding that all things did agree sute together after a kind of heauenly harmony and more then geometricall proportion then he pronounced ualde bonu est it was exceeding good
so when good profitable lawes shall be established among vs it may be said bonu est
when magistrats minister righteous iudgements dealing truly vprightlie in their offices it may be said bonum est it is good

whe the minister preacheth the word of

truth in season and out of season and the people doe diligently heare and reforme theyr liues accordingly it may be sayd bonum est
but when there shall be a musicall consent as it were and a mutuall harmonie of all together where such matters are duly performed practized in a christian policie it may be said valde bonum est it is exceeding good
and all this will bee easily brought to passe if wee doe but consider of our peace
now the very god of peace sanctifie vs throughout pray god that our soules and bodies may be kept blamelesse to the comming of our lord iesus
christ purging the temple
epigraph math

and iesus went into the temple of god and cast out them that bought and solde in the temple and ouerthrewe the tables of the the seates of them that sold doues saying it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but you haue made it a denne of theeues
in euery action of christ we may learne to saue our soules and to shunne those thinges that are enemies to the spirit of god
by his heauenly doctrine wee learne heauenly wisedom by his practize of holy life example of well liuing by his miracles our fayths confirmation and here in this place by his entrance into the temple we learne deuotion
he entered into the temple
within this temple were his professed enemies the scribes and pharisees yet hether hee would enter to expresse his zeale and kingly authoritie
he entered once into the desert signifying the temptations the chyldren of god are subiect
another time hee entred into a shippe shewing the perrill of christians
hee entered into zacheus his house shewing the humilitie that must be in christians
he entered into iudgement when he was condemned shewing the persecution of christians
he entred vp vpon his crosse shewing the patience of christians and in this place he entred into the temple shewing the deuotion that must bee in christians
christ loued the temple and therefore he would enter into the temple and holy men that haue theyr names from christ must also cary the like affectio that was in christ
they must loue the they must learne to say with dauid the zeale of thine house hath euen eaten me vp
and againe haue loued the habitation of thy house and the place where thyne honour dwelleth
many there be that enter into the temple of god but fewe there be that enter in like christ in this place for deuotion and zeale
vvee reade of antiochus in the first of mac verse
and in the
of mac

that he entred into the temple but hee entred in like a theefe for he robbed the temple of god and tooke out of it the golden altar the candlesticks the pouring vessels the golden vestments the precious iewels and treasure of infinite value
the like doe we read of that not so olde as wicked athenyan whose name is there omitted because the author of the booke reckoned him as a vile person not worthie to be mentioned in holy writ
he also into the temple but he entered in to it and to fill it full with and gluttony
nichanor another instrument suborned sathan to rise vp against god and to religion purposed to enter into gods but himselfe vttered his wicked when come againe saith he will vp this house
and so belshazar in
of daniel caused his lords to go the temple thence to bring him the vessels that himselfe his wiues and might drink in them

and these buyers and sellers heere cast

out by our sauiour christ entered the temple but not for any holy practise to pray or praise god in it but to pollute it and to abuse it in making the house of god a shop of merchandize
in all these wicked men there vvas not found deuotion but pollution vncleannes of hart
sinfulnesse had so possessed them that they seemed to haue solde themselues to worke impietie like ahab
but thys their monstrous sacriledge horrible prophanation of gods temple escaped not vnpunished
for in the same place where theyr faultes are mentioned their iudgements are likewise recorded
antiochus was striken with a remedilesse payne in his bowels and he died most lothsomly the wormes issuing out of his bodie in great abundance
nicanor was the first man that was slaine in the battell after the armies had met
his head and right hand were smitten off and hanged vpon the gates of ierusalem

belshazar in the prime of his pride and when he was most merry carowsing vvine in his golden vessels was striken to a dump when he saw the hideous hande vppon the

wall penning his tragicall end and ruine of his kingdome
that night was belshazer slaine and forced to resigne at once both life and kingdome
so as the wicked plow vpon gods backe large long furrowes the furrowes of iniquitie so god also ploweth vppon theyr backs he trampleth vpon them at his pleasure and this will hee doe to all them that seeke to dishonour god by stablishing theyr owne honour
to iustifie that which the propheticall king hath published long agoe surely god will arise and his enemies shall be scattered they also that hate him shall flee before him
as the smoake vanisheth so shalt thou driue them away and as the waxe melteth before the fire so shall the wicked perrish at the presence of god

let vs then betimes aduise our selues by these mens falls to learne to stand and by theyr punishments to hate their sinnes least wee be with the same condemnation
this lesson ought we to learne euen in the sinners schoole and thus should we from other mens sinnes deriue instruction to our selues as salomon did to himselfe in the
of the prouerbs vvhen hee

passed by the fields of the slothfull sawe it all couered with weedes
let vs know then that if deuotion call vs not hether our entrance is in vaine
if the pharisee when he entered into the temple had carried with him deuotion as he caried pride with him when he iustified himselfe hee had not lost that which the publican found to teach vs to come as the publican that is in humilitie if we will find mercy
many come to the temple but fewe come as they should as a number in christes time came to the sinagoues to see him and to heare him but yet fewe there vvere that drew fayth and deuotion from him as the woman drew vertue from him by touching but his hem
herod desired to see christ but it was for that hee looked that christ should worke some miracle before him
in another place wee read of vvhole companies following him but not for the doctrine he taught them but rather for the bellies sake as they that sayd rabby vvhen cammest thou hether the scribes pharisees slocked to the temple to heare christ preach but it was to intangle hym in his words
so is it nowe with vs all will come to the temple all will present themselues some for feare of lawe some in hypocrisie vvill come because they will pretend a shewe of religion and so bee reputed as honest men as any within theyr neighbourhood other for fashion sake few or none for co~science will present themselues to the lord in pure deuotion as christ did here
the note of instruction then to be raised from this example of christ is this
vvee must learne how to enter into gods temple that our seruice and ministery there when we come may be accepted
for as paule said to the philippians many walke of whom haue tolde you often and now tell you weeping that they are the enemies of the crosse of christ
so may it be sayd that many enter into the temple of god as if they were the enemies of the crosse of christ
like the buyers and sellers in this place that entered in both to corupt themselues the temple

hee that will enter then as hee ought must first consider of the place vvhether hee presseth

it is the temple more then that it is gods temple nay yet more it is gods house the place where god dwelleth and it is the very arke of his presence and vnto it hath hee appoynted blessing and life for euermore
wee seeke men commonly at theyr houses for there is theyr continuall dwelling so if wee will finde god wee must seeke him at his house as ioseph and mary did his house is the temple
so then both in regard of the place whether we come and of the person to whom we come wee are to bee armed with reuerence
iacob found the angell in bethell and wee must come to bethell before wee can finde the angell that is christ
wee must free our selues from corruption before we enter in hether the means to effect that is by aduising our selues of the place and person

in the fift of exodus when god appeared to moses hee called the place terram sanctam a holy place and hee might not tread vppon it till first hee had put off his shooes and so we must put off our shooes

of carnalitie before we enter into this holie place
in the
of genesis when god appeared to iacob he called the place terram terribilem a fearefull place so the temple of god is also a fearefull place it is both fearefull and holy
it is a terrible place to them that make no conscience howe they enter in vvith vncircumcized hearts and hands
for to such god is a co~suming fire as he consumed nadab and abihu euen in the temple making of a place of refuge a place of terror for that they regarded not with what fire theyr sacrifice was kindled
but it is a holy place to them that come in holines and deuotion to them that before hand prepare the~selues as moses prepared himselfe before hee aduentured to come neere the flaming bush

in the
of exodus aaron his sons might not enter into the sanctuary vvith vnwashen hands nevther might they minister in the priestes office but in theyr holy garments
why then we must knowe that somewhat is to be doone before wee enter into gods sanctuary before wee presume to presse into the presence of god wee must prepare our selues we must cleuse

our soules from all corruption wee must purifie first our owne temples our bodies and soules for it is sayd estis vos templum dei your bodies are the temples of the holy ghost therfore glorifie god in your bodies in your soules for they are gods
otherwise if this reuerent preparation be not made well wee may thrust in our selues among others into gods temple like as these buyers and sellers intruded the~selues but we haue no comfort in so comming and wee must looke to be throwne out as they were and as the vnworthy commer to the mariage of the kings sonne was cast out because hee brought not with him vestem nuptialem a
this is to come vnreuerently vnworthily and such shall not bee accepted because they offer vp the sacrifice of fooles as salomon noteth
in the
of the reuel no vncleane thing might enter into the new ierusale so no vncleane thing should enter our bodies our earthly ierusalem

it is written of abraham that when hee went to sacrifice his sonne he left his asses at the foote of the hill so when wee haue a purpose to sacrifice our selues vnto god

wee must leaue our sinnes and corruptions behind vs as he did his asses
our cares and our corruptions may not enter in with vs but wee must leaue them without as a man leaues his shadowe at the doore when he enters into the house
consider when wee are going out from our houses we are going out fro our selues and from our vanities and when vvee are come to the temple we are com to god god our soules are heere met together like abraham lazarus in the heauens
as the israelites durst not come to the mount where god spake till they had washed their clothes sanctified themselues so may not we presume to enter into gods temple till wee haue washed our clothes our menstruous raggs of sinfulnes like the spousesse in the who had vvashed her feete and changed her rayments when she went to meet her spouse

and to this purpose it is saide keepe my sabbath reuerence my sanctuary
and to this purpose wee haue our preparations before the sabbath which we call the sabbath eeue and on the sabbath our morning sacrifice and our euening incense

yea and the bells that sounde in our eares doe giue vs summons for this reuerence as aaron gaue notice of his entrance into the sanctuarie by the sounde of those golden belles which were fastned to the skyrts of his robe
in a worde not to make a long amplification in so cleere a matter by this enterance of christ wee learne two things first his godly care secondly the effect of his carefulnes
in this chapter tis especially noted that as soone as he came into the citty he made hast to goe visit the temple
wee doe not reade that he first entred into any house to refresh himselfe or to ease his body beeing by all likelihoode with long trauell for he had come from iericho to and to bethany and so to ierusalem

but all this notwithstanding to the temple hee goes to teach vs principally to be carefull in the seruice of god before vvee minister to our selues or other in the businesses of this world
wee must first serue god and then our selues as eliah sayde to the woman of sarepsah bake mee a cake

first and then after prepare for thee thy familie
so vnto vs god saith first offer me a sacrifice of holines and than minister to thy selfe and thine
first seeke the kingdome of god and the righteousnes thereof but we seeke our owne things first
first wee serue the worlde and our lusts and our vanities and god is serued eyther not at all or after all
after sin and after the word and after the deuill
he entered into the temple
in the temple giue to god all holie worshippe there is the place where our lampes ought to be continually burning kindled with the fire of zeale deuotion
there ought wee to hold vp pure hands harts vnto god praysing him continuallie without ceasing and in pouring out infinite like those saints in the reuelation vnto him that was and is and is to come

this is called by our sauiour
vnum necessarium that one necessary thing and the better part which cannot be taken from vs christ was carefull and hee was willing to visit the temple for it was the first thing hee did after hee had foote within the

streetes of ierusalem
he that will serue god must serue him willingly we must come to the church in a voluntarie affection not by constraint as doe the in our age for they enter in by compulsion for feare of lawe and the princes displeasure not for conscience
or if it bee loue that drawes the thither it is the loue they beare to theyr houses and lands not for the loue they haue to christ or his gospell whom they haue denyed in denying his truth
such mens roome is better then theyr company and they goe forth as they cam in onely a little water is sprinckled which presently fals of faster then it lighted on
these are they that like temporary menpleasers do only serue the time to serue their turne hoping whe time wil turne that they may turne with time
these serue god as nabucadnezars chaplains serued their idol god god bell they serued bell because bell serued their bellies they seeme nowe to serue god not the true god who we worship but a god whom their owne idolatrous conceits haue erected another another bell and all for the belly
but wee beloued haue not so learned christ let vs rather sticke to him and say with the apostles whether shal we goe thou hast the words of eternall life
let vs learne to serue him willingly with alacritie and cheerefulnes for as it is sayd god loueth a cheerful giuer so it may be said god loueth a cheerfull worshipper
paul in the
of rom
exhorteth vs to giue our bodies in that hee calls it a gift hee sheweth a voluntary obedience
and where in the following wordes hee saith and fashion not your selues like vnto the world he iustifieth thereby that indeede it is far from the fashion of this world to giue our bodies vnto god for the men of thys world are carnally minded and doe take theyr bodies from god and doe giue them to their lusts as the isralites gaue their children to moloch
in the time of the leuiticall law we read that among those many offrings some were called offrings these were in greatest request with god
look the
of exod how bountifully the people gaue how gladly the lord accepted it look the
of the
booke of chro· vvhat a liberall offering is there recorded
the princes and captaines and rulers gaue for the seruice of the house of god fiue thousand talents of gold and ten thousand of siluer and of brasse and beyond measure
yea and they with whom precious stones were found gaue them to the treasure of the house of the lord and all this was doone willingly
for it is added in the ninth verse the people reioyced when they offered willingly and with a perfect hart
loe howe chargeable was the seruice of the temple then and none of these things doth god require of vs onely saith hee giue me thy hart and yet we cannot afford to giue him but so much
surely wee ought not to it from him for he hath deerely bought it payde for it
and paule witnesseth the same are bought with a price
it was a price indeede of greatest value more worth then all the talents of gold before mentioned
euen the of the most glorious person in the world
and thus much shall briefely suffice for clearing the matter of substance contayned in these wordes of christes entrance into the temple
you haue hearde of christes deuotion nowe shall you heare of his zeale
where these two are met together there is a perfect christian
as a lampe cannot burne without oyle so deuotion cannot bee kindled without zeale
hee threw out them that bought
heere is shewed christes action what he did vpon his entrance into the church he throwes out them that bought and sold wherein he shewes his regall authority
christ entering into the temple findes the people there neyther praying nor prophecying but chopping and changing as if it were forum not templum
as it is not coenient to make of the house of god a den of theeues so is it not fit to make it a shop of merchandize
it was once sayd where god hath his church the deuill hath his chappell but nowe it may be sayd where god hath his chappell the deuill hath his church
nay god hath scarce a chappell

these merchants these buyers and sellers in this place possesse both church chapell chauncell and all
euen fro the porch

to the altar and to the sanctum sanctorum all is deuided betweene these buyers sellers for the throng christ is scarce able to haue roome to enter into the temple
of olde time it was established that it should not be lawfull to carry so much as a vessell through the temple
yet in this place chapmen buyers and sellers most prophanely durst intrude themselues into gods church
salomon had so great a care in the building of that magnificent temple in ierusalem that he suffered nor eyther hammer or axe or any yron toole to be heard in the house while it was in building
but this vngodly generation of buyers sellers feared not to pollute defile gods temple with blasphemous clamors lowd cryings idle talkings and walkings swearing and forswearing all which horrible and grosse corruptions are wont to bee among them that buy and sell
yea this to be done in gods house and in christes presence

needes must christ be grieued at thys sight
this spectacle must needes make him looke about for his zeale as iob looked

about for his patience after so manie heauie messages
no doubt as noah was greeued with the sinnes of the olde world and lot at the vnrighteousnes of the sodomites so it greeued christ our lorde to finde in the temple this rout of wicked ones abusing the temple of god with theyr most vngodly demeanure
but what doth christ doth he shew himselfe onely a looker on and doth he make no speed to reforme this intollerable outrage yes hee bestirres himselfe like a mightie giant newly wakened out of a dreame and hee clothes himselfe with zeale as with a garment and presently proceedeth to purge the temple of this wicked assembly
he throwes them out
in the third of genesis we reade that assoone as adam had sinned
god sent his angell to thrust him out of paradice heere was zeale
the sodomites people of gomorha sinned presently god rained fire brymstone from heauen to consume the at once and heere was zeale

dauid sinned in nu~bering the people for

which
thousand lost theyr liues heere was zeale
phineas in his zeale slew zymrie and cosby
and in this place god sent his sonne to punish the prophaners of his temple
hee cast them out
after sinne comes reuenge the heauiest companion of wickednes
the sinnes of ierusalem did once make christes eyes to distill into teares
there hee exercised his eyes expressing his great greefe and heere theyr sinnes made him exercise his handes by throwing them out of the temple expressing his zeale
it is woorth the noting to consider vvith what speed christ laboureth to reform the abuses that had crept into his church
presently vppon his enterance into the temple he begins to purge it
sinne must bee strangled in the birth before it gette strength for if it may once haue his full growth it will bee sure to haue the vpper hand of thee and thou canst not it

shewed you before of christes carefulnes and in this place againe you may learne his speedines in resisting sinne to teach vs

to be speedy and quicke in beating downe corruptions whatsoeuer
doctor speede is the best physition for mistres vanity
sinfulnes is soonest resisted vppon her first entrance but if it rancle through continuaunce and growe to a running fore it must speedily eyther bee launced or quite cut off like a putrified member
because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily therfore the harts of men are fully bent in them to doe euill
eccles


the vse of this example to our selues is this when wee purpose to doe anie good thing wee must testifie our carefulnesse in dooing it presently
if this were carefullie obserued much euill would soone be stopped euen in the fountaine before it might streame foorth to the vniuersall harme of country citty and

for many times when wee minde to doe good and doe it not presently our endeuours doe fayle betweene the purpose and the practize and so the good to be doone is not done at all but it dyeth with vs like a byrd in a mans hand while the head is deuising whether it were best to holde it still

or let it goe
as this concernes all men generally so in a more special manner it concernes them that are aduaunced to high place of authoritie in the common wealth
officers are chosen for the punishment of euil doers the praise of them that doe well
they must be gods cause by throwing out such as transgresse
they must consider that they are appoynted as in gods stedde to punish malefactors and therefore they must not suffer the sword of iustice to rust in the scabbard of long sufferance
and zeale it is that will soone aduise you when and how this may be done zeale wil tell you by the qualitie of the offence how it may be best corrected
for greater sins must of necessity haue greater punishme~ts as olde and festered sores require sharpe and bitter medicaments
onely be couragious saith the lorde to iosuah and will be with thee so to the magistrate god speaketh onely be zealous and will be with thee

zeale best graceth an officer it is first named among those
in exod

such

as must be ready with phineas to kill sin in the act
they must when occasion requireth learne to protest with nehemiah if you doe it once more will lay hands vpon you
this want of zeale in officers suffering sinnes to passe with immunitie is the cause that corruption nowe carrieth such a sway and doth spread it selfe like a cankerworme ouer the world
what a discontentment mutinous outrage did corah and his rebellious confederates cause the israelites to grow vnto when being prepossest with a conceitednes and an opinion they would haue perswaded moses that all was well and the people holy enough surely the best workes we can doe yea our religion it selfe is starke dead afore vs vntill zeale come
religion without zeale is like the sunamites dead childe vvithout breath life or soule in it
all our knowledge our wisedom and other vertues can litle auaile vs litle can they doe if onely zeale be absent
they can profit vs no more the the prophets staffe could recouer the dead chyld till elisha came himselfe
let fayth come and yet thou art vnperfect let patience come and thou art yet vnperfect let temperance come and thou art yet vnperfect let charity and chastitie and all come that may come and thou art still vnperfect
thou art but a maymed christian like agrippa till zeale come then as dauid said the riuers of god are full so maist thou say the graces of god are full
thou art as well furnished as zacheus was when christ told him this day is saluation come to thine house
but this is sathans policie when hee cannot drawe vs from religion nor from our prosession yet euen then will hee seeke to hinder vs in our good course he will stand like a lyon in the passages that we be not too forward eyther to stop vs in our running by one rub of iniquitie or other or by laying some pleasant baite before vs to tum vs aside out of the way as hee coosend adam out of paradice

if needes thou wilt be religious sayth he thou shalt not be zealous
as iacob said of ruben thou art my might the beginning of my strength but yet thou shalt not be excellent so though we be of power and

might and haue made a good growth in gods graces and doe carry about vs excellencie of dignitie as ruben did yet saith sathan ile preuent thee thou shalt not bee feruent
the minister of laodicia had many good qualities that graced him but one vice marrs many good vertues as one dead flie putrifieth the oyntments of the apothecary
he was not zealous hee was neyther hote nor cold
and therefore god sayd will spew thee out of my mouth and so vndoubtedly god will also spue out of his mouth the lukewarme protestants and the temporarie gospellers of this age that are neyther hote nor colde
oh then let vs labour to haue zeale or our religion profits vs nothing
knowledge zeale must be vnited together like the urym and thummym to the consecrating of those holy ones
one briefe note yet remaineth so we will descend to particuler application and so conclude

if buyers and sellers of small things were throwne out of the church what and how great shall theyr punishment be that buy

sell the patrimonie of the church
how shall they be throwne out from the presence of god and good men for euer that so sacriligiously dare intrude vnto gods possession as if it did descend vnto them by inheritance
it is a matter of horrour to consider into what iniurie or rather into what iniquitie of times we are fallen
nothing is nowe so common and so familiar a matter as to see schollers spending their times in kinges courts making their courts theyr cloysters
merchants by theyr bylls entering into gentlemens patrimonies and gentlemen themselues intruding into church liuings as if the whole frame course of the world were quite dissolued into the olde chaos like lots wife moulten into a saltpyllar so that the godly zealously looking into these intollerable abuses haue cause to cry out tempora tempora quale monstrum aluistis iniurious times vvhat a prodigious monster haue you traueled vvithall

did these men but sounde theyr consciences in this behalfe quocunque sint sts

cauterio yet they must needes cry with the and sound forth this harmonie that they haue no more right norinterest in then herod had to philips wife or achab vnto naboths vineyard
but this is a sore that may not be ript vp the contagion thereof is so great and so vniuersall
onely wee are to pray that god may open the eyes of them that are the transgressors in this behalfe
and that it woulde please him to worke a speedy reformation in restoring to his church that which of right belongs vnto it
giue it beauty lord in sted of ashes rich apparrell in sted of that yet it may be pronounced which was once proclaimed by the prophet aggei the glory of the last house is greater then the glory of the first house
he cast out them that bought sold
you haue seene christ reforming the abuses that had crept into this temple now let vs make a true vse of this to our selues

as these grosse corruptions crept into the materiall temple so the like to these

or rather worse then these doe creepe into our spirituall temples our bodies
vvhen wee conuert our bodies to anie prophane vse and doe not glorifie god in them then it may be sayd that wee pollute our temple
when the magistrate shall be found not to deale truly when he shall not cary cleane hands free from corruptions when he shal peruert iudgement and turne aside out of the right way then it may be sayd hee polluteth the temple of god
when the lawyer or counseller carryeth not himselfe to his clyent as he ought if he incourage him to proceed in lawe vvith his aduersary when he might work a peace betweene both all for his priuat gaines thinking to becom a purchazer with poo mens purses as gehazy thought to intich himselfe with naamans gold then doth pollute the temple of god
when the recorder or prymitorie doth falsify the record most of al it co~cernes him to be circumspect for the record being falsifyed it may doe harme an
yeeres after then he dooth corrupt his conscience and defileth his temple
if the sheriffe shall make a partiall returne of such as must determine matters betweene party and party he prophaneth the temple
if the iurors that are impaneled shall through friendship fauour or feare or being blinded with rewards shall deliuer an verdict they pollute the temple
in a worde this pollution is vniuersall wheresoeuer any kinde of vngodlines shall take place
and the soueraine helpe for all this is that which our sauiour in his owne example hath heere taught vs
when so often as these corruptions shall breake out wee must cast them out betimes as christ did the buyers and sellers
this speedy purging must be effected by the word in the godly minister and by the sword of authority in the ciuill magistrate

euery man can best sound his own conscience by sending downe the bucket of gods spirit into his hart
euery man can best satifie himselfe whether he hath clensed his body by casting out all sin and vanitie and so consecrating it as a holy temple vnto the lord or whether hee hath abused it by giuing it ouer to all sensualitie vvith

greedines suffering sin and sathan to haue ingresse and egrelle and regresse at theyr pleasures till the graue be possest of his body the wormes of his flesh and the worlde of his goods
and so he returne more rotten out of the world then the matter hee was first made of when hee first came into the world
thus you see how the temple of god may be polluted and so in time a generall rent be made from the top to the bottome till it be quite destroyed and defaced as that famous temple of ierusalem is now defaced and lyeth in the dust
but let vs beware how wee runne to the like ruine howe wee destroy this temple of god not made with hands but by the mightie power of god for feareful is that saying he that the temple of god him shall god destroy
corruption and sinfulnes are the pullers downe but holines and righteousnes holines meane towards god and righteousnes say towards man are the raysers vp of this temple

these two are better builders than that ioyned vvith him

in the building of the arke for they built not for the~selues but for others but these doe build for god and vs yea and christ himselfe worketh in this frame of this spirituall building nay himselfe becomes the in whom all the building beeing coupled together groweth to a holy temple in the lord
it followeth for it is written my house is the house of prayer but you haue made it a denne of theeues
christ in these words yeelds them a reason why hee threwe them out hee makes them acquainted with their sinne it was for defiling the temple my house is the house of prayer but you haue made it a denne of theeues
sin till it be knowne cannot be shunned
we shal the sooner be drawne from doing euil when we shal looke into the nature of it and the danger that shal insue of it

christ proueth to their faces the greatnes of theyr sinne which they could not deny nay they must needs condemne themselues in it vpo this so manifest a profe produced

by our sauiour
it is written
eyther implying a notable ignoraunce in not knowing the scriptures or an obstinate wilfulnes in them for not performing obedience to the word
by these two as by speciall instruments of wrath sathan worketh mightilie in the children of disobedience by them millions of soules are chaind vp brought vnder sathans seruitude
it is written
as if hee should haue said haue you neuer reade that scripture that speaketh thus
the lawyer who woulde needes know what hee must doe to inherite life had thys aunswere how readest thou christ sendes him to the word to finde out the life that hee looked sor and so to these buyers and sellers that polluted the temple christ speaketh in like manner
how reade you
it it not written house is the house of prayer why goe yee about then to make it a denne of theeues you erre saith our sauiour in the twelfth of marke not knowing the scriptures and heere he telleth these prophaners that they

erred in polluting the temple for that they knew not the scriptures
in the fourth of mathew he droue away the deuill with one word scriptum est and heere with the same word he driues before him these buyers sellers out of the temple
woulde the papists did learne but thys one thing fro christ onely to plead scriptumest in all theyr counsels writings and conferences for then all controuersies in religion would quickly be decided
vp the testimony saith esay seale vp the law among my disciples
if they teach not according to this lawe it is because there is no light in them
if any man bringeth not with him this learning receiue him not to house nor bid him so much as god speede

iohn
christ brings his warrant out of scripture to teach vs to doe the same other authorities cannot build vp our holy faith
as the sunne is not discerned but by his owne light so no spirit can interpret scripture but by the same spirit that wrote it
goe not out of this field to gleane said boas to ruth so goe not out of the plentifull field of gods booke to gather
whatsoeuer is gathered elswhere prooues no corne

but chaffe which euery gale of wind soone scattereth
we must keepe our selues within our compasse that is within the canon of the word as shimey was charged not to goe beyond the riuer
most certaine it is a matter of vndoubted euidence that no doctrine ought to be deliuered concerning faith and religion but scripture
the religion of god must stand simple as god himselfe left it
mans additions in gods matters are but fantasies
in other matters adde what they list but in matter cause of saluation christ left nothing behinde him to be added any more eyther by apostles or martyrs or whomsoeuer because the perfection thereof is absolute nothing being lest vnperfect
wherunto who so addeth blasphemeth doth no lesse then infringe the testament of the lord

let the papists then beware howe they maintaine vnwritten verities for in so dooing what do they els but infringe the testament

of the lord
and they seek to eclipse the glory of christ like herod who caused all the genealogies of the kings of israel to be burnt because hee would not haue his pedigree abased or obscured
what of truth can vnwritten verities cary since they resemble a tale that is told which passing fro mouth to mouth is told so many waies as be men to tell it
beware of the leuen of the phartsees saith our sauiour so say beware of the leuen of vnwritten traditions for it is a phariseicall leuen it will sowre the whole lumpe
the doctrines of men may not passe for the precepts of god
these things are written that yee should beleeue that iesus christ is the sonne of god in so beleeuing you might haue life euerlasting
where it is showed that the scripture is all sufficient hath nothing it it vnperfect
it includeth all things that are necessarily to bee knowne in matters of saluation
let vs drawe then fro this most holy fountaine for goe the puddles of mans inuention
but to end this note let vs haue recourse to christ alone both in this place and elsewhere let vs make him our pilot we shal be sure to be soundly directed in our compasse that we cannot erre

consider but of hys practize proofes are scriptum est
his demaunds are

quomodo legis his apologies scrutam
and the apostles as they vvere taught by him so they learned to speake as he did deliuered to you that which receaued how that christ died for our sinnes according to the scriptures and that he was buried and rose the third day according to the scriptures
so christ himselfe his apostles all the holy men of god still poynt vs to the scriptures as the onely touchstone of saluation whereby wee try the difference betweene light and darknes god and beliall truth and heresie
it is written my house

in this place· god appropriateth to himselfe the church to be his house if it bee gods house than are we to haue a greater regard of this than of our owne houses

dauid had a speciall care of this house when he said one day is better in thy courts then a thousand elswhere
he had rather accept of the meanest office in gods house than to bee a princely commaunder in his owne house
yea were it but a porters roome he valued the same so greatly that it made him register his loue to the world to all insuing posterities
had rather be a

in the house of god than to dwell in tabernacles of cedar
and againe hee saith to expresse further the care hee had of gods house shall the king dwell in his sieled house and the arke of god remaine between the curtaines this sheweth dauids loue and care and it should draw from vs the like loue care to gods house yea hee calls vppon vs for this carefulnes in the hundred psalme and in many other places enter yee into his gates with prayse into his courtes with reioycing

the very name of the place as haue sayd before should force from vs a religious worshippe
it is gods house the place that hee hath sanctified and chosen to himselfe to place his name there
in that it is called an house it dooth signifie the vnitie that must be betweene christians
they that are of this houshold may not be deuided
the minister that serueth in the sanctuarie and the people that come together in the holy assembly to heare or pray or to prayse god must be all of one mind of one affection
the coate of christ vvas inconsutilis without deuision shewing that

if we will weare christes coate vvee must shun deuision
as there is but one trueth one fayth one baptisine one christ one lord ouer all and in vs all so there should be but one shepheard one slock one pastor and one pasture
so all is vnitie to shew that he was false that maintained
one lately writ a booke the title whereof was tria sunt omnia
but it had com neerer to the truth of druinitie if he had altered his poesie thus vnum sunt omnia
for trinity must be reduced to vnitie before our fayth can be perfited

it pittieth me to see and it is a matter of such griefe that it expresse and vvring teares from trees and stones where men are sencelesse in beholding the lamentable condition that citties townes almost euery particuler congregation is fallen into and all for want of this vnity
the minister one way the magistrate another way and the people a third way deuided from them both
manasses against ephraim ephraim against manasses both against iuda
alas what is this else but in time to eate vp and deuoure one another and to bring in

ciuill hostilitie the most mortall and capitall enemy to mankind and the very moth that fretteth and teares in sunder by little little the peace that maintaineth all christian societies
the minister beates down vanity the magistrate raiseth it on foote againe like dagon and the people like men amazed wot not what to do nor who they should cleaue vnto whither to god or baal

when aaron myriam were deuided from moses what came of it god departed from them the clowd a testimony of his presence likewise departed fro among them
and we must not think the contrary but that god also departeth from vs when we cease to be at one
when we deuide our selues god wil also deuide himselfe he will goe out from vs as lot went out from sodom to dwell in zoar
nay hee will not so much as leaue behind him the clowde the testimony of his presence that is his blessings graces all shalbe taken from vs our peace our liberty our wealth whatsoeuer we had comfort in we be left as naked as adam whe he ran to the sigtrees or as iob vpon the dunghil without his children his vvife his friends his wealth his health

hee had nothing now who before had all things onely his scabbes sores did beate him company
in the
psalme the prophet considering the great treasure of peace and vnitie falls into a kinde of admiration saying howe good and ioyfull a thing it is bretheren to dwell together in vnitie it is like the precious oyntment vpon aarons head which ran down vnto his beard and went downe to the borders of his garment
it is like the dewe of harmon that falls vpon the mountaines of sion
in the former verse hee calls all the chyldren of god brethren and ought brethen to be deuided abraham when he deuised how to bring his seruants and lots seruants to vnitie vseth this argument let not vs fall out we are brethren
the like speech is vsed by the patriarch in the
of gen
they told ioseph are all one mans sonnes
and in the
verse we thy seruants are al brethre
so should we say we are all one mans sonnes for god is our father and we his sonnes yea vvee are all brethren and therefore why should not we agree and be at one a kingdom that is not at peace in it selfe cannot florish and a house that is deuided cannot stand
what breedes so many scismes sects and varietie in opinions but diuision labour then for vnitie for that is the onely that peserueth the citty
my house
a house consists of a foundation the sellers the and the roofe and euery of these must be agreeable and fitting one to another
this sheweth what vnitie is
and a citty consists but of many houses ioyned together in due proportion the very name sheweth the who first built the cittie
it was vnitie for it is called ciuitas quasi ciuium vnitas
many seedes are sowne in one field and beeing growne vp they fill but one eare are bound vp in one sheaffe and are lapt vp in one loafe
this sheweth vnitie
the body of man hath many members many parts the head the arin the shoulders the feete yet all make but one bodie

the head alone commaunds and all the other parts are pliable and seruiceable to

him
let vs also learne to serue our head we being many members of one body haue also but one head euen christ
let vs not then be deuided from our head for then wee shall be censured to make a worse rent then the iewes did who deuided his garments but we deuide his flesh and his body so long as we are not at vnitie
a house of prayer
the temple is called not the house of crueltie nor the house of maliciousnes nor the house of pride nor the house of couetousnesse as these merchants thought to make it but the house of praier
the iewes had citties of refuge to she vnto but the place of refuge for christians nowe to slye vnto is templum dei the house of prayer
here is the place where the priestes the people ought to pray before the lord euen betweene uestibulum et altare the porch and the altar as ioell speaketh

in the
of math it is said seeke and you shall find
if wee will sind christ heere is the place where we must seek him not as they that sought after eliah when hee was translated but as ioseph and mary sought for their sonne in the temple they sought him

and there they found him and there shall wee be sure to finde him if wee seeke after him with the like affection that they did
and hauing found him if you wil know how you may both speake with him and speed with him in your godly requests this place resolues you prayer must be the harbenger to passe from you to him it will in no wise returne againe to you till it hath preuailed like the doue that returned with the oliue leafe in her bill
prayer poured out with deuotion vttered with zeale is for power so forcible and for motion so swift that it pearceth like a clowdes skies and hauing come to god it departs not away till it hath preuailed by strong wrestlings like iacob for a blessing

in the
chro
we find salomon praying in the temple he desired god that his eyes should euer be open his eares alwaies attentiue to the prayers that should be offred vp in that place and his prayer then is effectual for vs now that pray before the lord in the temple beeing the place whereof hee hath spoken he would put his name there
this house of prayer hath been by the godly in all ages since there began

to bee a temple
and when there was temple yet there were solemne assemblies and holy meetings from the beginning
in the
of gen vpon the restoring and reestablishing of religion presently after the byrth of sheth wee reade that men assembled together called vpon the name of the lord
after the flood noah his familie sacrificed vnto the lord
gen

and after him abraham built an altar at bethell and called vppon the name of the lord
iacob did the like and moses all ages to christ
the tabernacle made by moses was in sted of a temple
reuerence my sanctuary
leuit
peter iohn went vp to the temple to pray
symeon went to the temple
anna prayd in the temple
here is the place where the afflicted may finde consolation the poore may finde plenty the wealthy shal find thankfulnes and the thankful shall haue more gifts the desperate shall finde comfort the sicke a phisition the sinner in a word shall finde his sauiour where he may embrace him in his armes if he will as symeon did
of prayer that is of publique prayer

not of priuate
if we will pray priuatly wee haue houses to pray in at home
enter into thy chamber and there poure out thy hart vnto god and hee that heareth thee in secret shall reward thee openly

if thou pray when thou shouldest heare thou prophanest the place and thy prayer shal returne as a curse into thy bosome
for

the word of truth hath spoken it hee that turnes away his eare from hearing the law his prayer shall be abhominable
it is not a priuat place and therfore it wil entertaine no priuate action
if thy heart call vpon thee to present any priuat prayer to the lord follow the vse of holy men in all ages
isaac went out into the fieldes to pray and meditate
iacob beeing alone in bethel fell to prayer
gen
dauid watered his couch with teares which fell from him while he prayed
daniell in his chamber fell to prayer
dan

peter in the
of the acts went vp to the top of the house to pray
christ went aside into the mountaine to pray

if pray beeing in the temple and all the congregation there present another preacheth a third man standing by readeth

heere is no order but confusion and god is not the god of confusion
let all things in the church be done decently and in order
thus haue you seene christ our lorde entering into the temple in deuotion and in zeale correcting the abuses that hee found there
teaching them withall the right vse of the temple and what exercises of holines the place requireth that so they might not come together to condemnation
let it be considered what is sayd and the lord giue vs vnderstanding in all thinges that hauing attained in some measure to the fulnesse of knowledge that is in christ iesus and beeing stablished in euery good worke and word our fruite may be holines and our end euerlasting life
let vs pray the spirit of grace to enter into the temples of our harts and thence to purge and cast out all corruptions whatsoeuer
to god onely wise our sauiour be rendred all honor glory praise with thanksgiuing now and euer
amen leaf motif the history of our lords birth
a sermon preached by the authour at shrewsburie vpon christ his day
epigraph math


when iesus then was borne in bethleem in iudea in the dayes of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to ierusalem saying where is hee that is borne king of the iewes for wee haue seene his star in the east are come to worship him
two principall motiues or reasons beloued in our lord induced me to make choise of this text
one vvas the occasion of our meeting at this time which is to solemnize keep in memorie the natiuity of our lord sauiour christ iesus
the other the great necessity of the doctrine in these wordes contained
for they deliuer vnto vs the history full discourse of christes incarnation beeing one principall branch in the misterie of our redemption
so you see how both text time our meeting matter or cause of our meeting all conspire together and are alike sutable

there shoulde be no matter of greater force to draw men together than this vvee haue nowe in hand for it is able to furnish vs with all necessary knowledge like the roule that ezechiell tooke from the angell which whe he had eaten it filled both

belly and bowels hee straightwayes began to prophecy
we liue not in those times wherein vve may offer rich presents vnto christ like the wisemen nor can wee nowe poynt at the bodily presence of christ as iohn did not can we feast him in our houses as zacheus did nor can we embrace him in our armes as once symeon did when hee came by inspiration into the temple
christ nowe looketh not for these curtesies nor can we performe the if we would but this and all this we do when we come to heare christ preached vnto vs when we open our harts to entertaine the worde as lydia did and when wee embrace with alacritie and cheerfulnesse the doctrine of christ
and as haue told you one capitall branch of this doctrine is this concerning his natiuitie

men are carefull very diligent in calculating

theyr owne and theyr childrens natiuities for a more certaine account they kalender them vp to the end they may not be forgotten and thys they doe for reason requireth it law alloweth it and ciuility commends the same
but a thousand times more careful ought we to be both prince prophet people to kalender and keepe in memory the natiuitie of our lord sauiour conscience it custome calls for it and vvhich is most of all
christe commaunds it
for vnto this name and to no other vnder heauen are we baptized
of christ wee are called christians

we are his schollers his seruaunts his disciples and therefore very careful should we be to honour our lord maister in keeping holy his day
for as christ in earth sought nothing but the glory onely of his father so his father now in heauen seekes nothing but the glory of his sonne
and as the same sonne beeing here on earth humbly debased himselfe as a seruaunt vnder all men to obey his fathers will so hath it pleased god his father againe to exalt him not onely to surmount the glorie of all

princes and potentates whatsoeuer but also with such power maiestie hath he aduaunced him that euen the very knowledge and beleese of his glorious name is able to giue euerlasting life to all sinners be they neuer so greeuously burdened or laden whosoeuer will come vnto him to seeke any refreshing
so proued by his testimony in the
of iohn verse
thy is the will of him that sent mee that euery that beleeueth in him should haue euerlasting life and will raise him vp at the last day
haue not wee great reason then to remember this day of christ a day as saint augustine calls it of all dayes the beginning of all daies the beginning of eternitie to the beleeuers
hee was borne to make vs rich hee vvas layd in a stall euen among beastes to vs to the company of angels

hee was borne an exile a banished person from the cradle driuen to flie into egypt as moses did to mydian to the end he might make vs free

hee came from heauen to the earth to the end hee might dravve vs from earth to heauen
hee tooke vppon him a naturall

to make vs heauenly bodies
he was made flesh to make vs spirits he was made the sonne of man to make vs the of god
to as many as receiued him them gaue hee power that they might be the of god
great reason haue wee then remember him that did all this for vs
and this much shall briefely suffice to vp your mindes to a carefull of christ and his glory
now let vs mathew speaking
when iesus then was borne at bethleem
for the increase of our fayth and for an certaintie heere is layd downe true story of christes birth with thereunto belonging
the maner of our lords birth is at large by this our euangelist in the chap afore my text beginning at the
verse
the other circumstances runne in these wordes as first the place he was born in bethleem

when the dayes of herod

who came first to the wise men

how did they know was borne or howe were they directed finde him they were guided by a starre

to what end came they to him worship him
this day and time was foretolde by the prophets commended to men by angels and by the godly fathers of the church

esay long before the comming of chr prophecied saying loe a virgine shall ceaue and beare a sonne and they shall name emanuell
and againe vnto vs a

is borne and vnto vs a child is giuen

and in the ninth of damel the very moment of time wherein christ should come is by seuenty weekes sa

he are vpon the people and the cty to finish the wickednes seale vp the sinnes and to iniqui to in righteousnes to vp vision and to annoynt theholie

to make vp the harmonie micah to the very place vvhere our lo should be borne and thou bethleem

little to bee among the of iu yet out of thee shall come that must rule raell

to produce proofes in so cleere a er

were to poynt to the sunne being mounted to zenith where it is day
the legall the ceremoniall historical scriptures all prefigured christ to come

christes own testimony agreeing to this the scriptures for they testifie of mee

and againe had ye moses ye would haue beleeued me for moses wrote of me
semen mulieris contret caput
and thy seede shall all the nations of the be
of this day and time iacob prophecied two thousand yeeres christ he should come in the fulnes of time the scepter shall not depart from iudah nor a from betweene his feete vntill come and the shall be gathered vnto
he shall binde his vnto the vine his aes colt vnto the
the lord will vp a prophet from you out of your brethren vnto yee barken

but all this is but to light a candle at day
for wee all from the to the

suckling from the gray head to the ten babe all are trayned vp in this doctrine we receiue it from an autentique truth
we all professe it and beleeue it that christ at this time tooke our nature vpon him became flesh for our sakes and therefore will be the more sparing in amplifying th point
vvere it so that were to speake before infidels or before an vnbeleeuing sort
iewes vvhich are not yet resolued th
christ is come because the vaile is not taken from them and theyr harts are hardned that they cannot beleeue the scriptures then had neede to produce all the testimonies that might be founde for confirmation of this doctrine and gayning them to the sayth
and yet all this notwithstanding vvo hardly preuaile since it appeares by christes owne testimonie of the that they giuen ouer to a sence
seeing shall see and not perceiue and hearing you heare and not vnderstand

for had they not beene altogether hardned and solde to infidelitie so many scriptures and prophecies of christ all which

daily read in their sinagogues would haue forced them to acknowledge christ whom yet they denie
vvee would haue thought that if wee had beene then liuing in that age of theyrs when christ was borne among them conuersed with them wrought so many miracles before them vvee could not haue been so faithlesse
all the chiefest iewes both priestes and scribes beeing asked where christ should be borne aunswered thus at bethlehem in
yea and they alleage this pregnant place out of the prophets for it is written thou bethlem
and againe which condemneth them further in the
of iohn
sayth not the scripture that christ shall come of the seed of dauid out of the towne of bethleem yet though they knew all this whe christ came among them they denied him so do they gore themselues in their owne sides the baalites

the reason vvhy the euangelist so precisely layeth downe these circumstances of the manner time and place vvith other occurrences of our sauiour christ his

birth is for that hee would take away all distrustfulnes and also to verifie the former prophecies of christ that when it came to passe wee might acknowledge the truth therof since it fell out in the same sort time and place as was so long before
well let vs especially remember to giue god thanks for this grace giuen vs that we are not faithlesse like the iewes who to this houre resist the truth in vngodlines
or like thomas the apostle that would in no wise beleeue till hee had put his fingers into the print of the nayles

but wee not seeing doe beleeue and can say with an vndoubted testimony thou art our lord our god
and a special blessing followeth this our faith for our sauiour iustifies it thou hast seene and beleeuest say blessed are they that haue not seene haue beleeued
when iesus then was borne

here we are to learne the mercy of god in sending his sonne to the worlde for good onely which mercy of god made iohn exclaime with a rauishing kinde of admiration so god loued the world that hee sent his only begotten sonne into the world might liue through him
and in the tenth verse heerein is loue in that god loued vs first and sent his sonne to be reconciliation

and in the
verse he makes the same repeticion in substance still expressing the mercy and loue of god
this was so melodious a note in his eares when he strooke vpon loue· that as a byrde beeing taught to record doth double and treble one and the same thing often so doth iohn vpon this loue of god as if hee could neuer part from it so god the word
and heerein appeared the of god
and god loued vs first
iohn could no more part with this loue then elisha could with ehah the whirlewinde deuided them
a father of the church vpon this loue of god saith that the of the world and after that the creation of man did not argue a greater in god that this in giuing vs his son to be borne for vs

all the other workes of god as the making of the heauens the and the creatures haue in them matter enough of admiration

but this one surmounteth all the rest beeing as nazianzen speaketh undefined span alphabet a worke that passeth all admiration they may wonder at this that wonder at nothing besides at this loue of god in sending his sonne to be borne for vs after such a supernaturall maner to be borne of a virgine to translate him from the heauens to the earth god and the sonne of god whom the heauens nor the heauen of heauens could containe nowe to be included in so narrow a roome as the wombe of a virgine
they that passed by hazaels corpes stoode still and wondered here may we rather wonder at a liuing body

let the foolish philosophers henceforth burne their bookes as the ephesians did their vaine bookes they build al vpon reason

vpon the causes of things but thys is a reason beyond reason by no humaine reason to be comprized

the hautie astronomers that walke among the starres that send vp their typtoeco~ceits beyond the clowdes as if they were the onely commaunders of the world and could measure the heauens with a span as they seeme to shut vp all in one globe let

them trace it no more vpon the pinacles of planetary influences
if they can be so humble as to walk with vs heere beneath vpon this earth the seely cratch in bethleem where our lorde lay and the wombe of a virgin trauailing with the most glorious person of the worlde christ iesus at whose feete kings emperours must cast downe theyr crownes as before the chiefe and supreme king king of kings and all kings glory heere may they sinde say matter enough to occupie theyr wits and senses withall and here they may rather contemplate thys comet thys blazing starre as in vvhose presence the greatest starre sunne moone and all doe lose theyr light
here they may rather wonder at his so strange comming into the worlde as his disciples wondered at his going out of the world vpo his ascending
we all acknowledge this loue of god in that he gaue vs his sonne to be borne for vs but where is that serious consideration where is that isaac vs that will goe out into the fieldes to meditate of this so excellent a benefit

paule counted this world but dung in

respect of the excellent knowledge of christ yet with many nowe adaies dunge it selfe the basest thing is preferred before the deerest thing
for what is siluer and gold the mammon of this world which the wicked doe so highly magnifie but very earth and vile dung this time wherin we celebrate our lords natiuity we make it a time of feasting and a time of and tyme of reioycing but feare too too fewe there are that reioyce that christ was as at this tyme borne for them
if thys true reioycing were planted in vs it would cut off much vanity and much reioycing in euill
it would make vs fall into this holy parlee and angelicall conference hath god performed this great worke for me and shall be vnthankfull shall forget him that testified so great so vnspeakable kindnes for mee in not disdaining to take my flesh and nature vppon him to be borne for me to die for me to shed his hart blood for mee and to sustaine intollerable torments for mee which should haue vndergone
and all to the end should lyue and not die
if one man should die for another here were demonstration of great loue but in that christ our lord would die for vs beeing the sonne the onely sonne of god the brightnes of glory farre superior to the angels this is yet greater loue such loue as no tongue nor pen can amplifie
expresse it we cannot rather wee may wonder at it and exclaime like paule the riches of gods grace
was borne
heere we must also learne the obedience of christ our lord and his humility
as it was loue in god the father that sent forth christ into the world so it was obedience in christ the sonne of god that brought him and presented him vnto the world

god would haue him come and it was his will to come for so testifieth he of him selfe
loe come to doe thy will god

that we could possibly pactise the like holy obedience that when by the motion of gods spyrit working in vs and calling vpon vs to doe any good thing wee might be ready to aunswere we are come to do thy will
this was euer in christ but it is sildome or neuer in vs as the father hath sent me so doe alwayes the thinges that please him
his humilitie is likewise testified in our flesh vpon him in beeing borne for vs and in himselfe to sustaine in his glorious body our infirmities
for it pleased him to become in all things like vnto vs sinne onely excepted
great was this humilitie it must beare downe our pride it must teach vs to bee humble and meeke if wee will passe from earth to heauen whether hee is now ascended
abraham bowed himselfe to the angels to shew that there is no way to come neere vnto god or to the resemblance of christ but by humility
all do gape after honour as eue thought to be equall with god her maker shee would be higher then shee was and shee would needes from paradice mount vp to heauen before her time
but because she sought it by pride therefore by pride she lost both the one and the other heauen and eden till christ regayned them by his humilitie

humilitie is the first step to honour as pride is to basenes and therefore saith

pride goeth before destruction and an minde before the fall
pryde before and shame behinde as the spake both pithily and pleasantly when pryde is on the then is shame on the crooper
our sauiour in the eyghteene of mark chaulking the way that leades vnto honor saith he that humbleth himselfe shall be exalted but the proud he checketh when he saith thus hee that exalts himselfe shall be brought low
as heere we find humilitie in christ so may we find it in all the holy men before since christ

ioseph though he were the greatest potentate in egypt yet confessed he was but a shepheards sonne and this he vttered being

in the ruffe and prime of his honour
yet ioseph knew right well that the name of a was odious to the egyptians
moses is registred to be the meekest man vpon the earth

dauid beeing instaled into the kingdome humbly acknowledgeth his beginning thou tookest dauid when hee followed the ewes great with young

his honour made him not forget his
that prince who spake mildly humbly to eliah was not consumed so if will not be consumed with the fire of wrath we must be humble
saint basill speaking of the creation man saith cur accepit deus why did god take the dust of the ear
audis cur why should dust and ashes be proud then surely neyther honour riches friendes nor apparrell· nor ought else if the glory of the world were heaped vs it should not make vs proude
if mightest weare of gold couers but a rkae dust ashes
of all sorts of proude men they are be most condemned that are proude of apparrell as if they should glory in th shame for apparrell was made to our shame
when ad had sinned and so knew th hee was naked presently hee made himselfe breeches of
so sinne and shame were the first taylors that shaped adams garments

the humble and proude are both noted


scripture by theyr diuersitie of apparell
iohn is noted to haue vestimentum pilis camelorum et zonum pelliceam his apparell of camels haire and a girdle of a skinne about his loynes
here was an humble man
but the rich man in luke
is otherwise pictured
it is not omitted as a matter of speciall note that he was apparelled in purple and fared deliciously euery day
heere was a proude man
how doth the lorde by esay rip vp the of our rioting age expressing by al the handmaides of pride
slippers calls and round tyres sweet balls bracelets and bonnets the tyres of the head the tablets earings rings and mufflers costlie apparell the vailes crisping pynnes the glasses fine linnen hoodes and lawnes
had the prophet liued in these times how might he haue inueighed against the gaudines of apparrell long staring rues fardingals maskes fannes painted faces partlets bracelets frontlets fillets all lets to let and hinder vs from humilitie

when god began to make apparrell for man he made it but of the skinnes of beasts
and all the former saints were couered

onely with and the ha of camels
but nowe this fashion is qu out of fashion for wee rob all the creatu of the world to cloath our backs by taking from some their wooll fro some their sk from some their fur and from some th very excrements not sparing so much a the silly poore worme for the silke is the excrement of wormes
nay rather then wee will be vnfurnished of any thing that may adorne or beaut vs wee will not sticke to diue as it were to the bottom of the sea and turne vp sands of the sea for precious stones
when the glystering silkes on backs and the precious indian rings vpon our fingers when our necks are ged with goodly and costly chaynes the wristes of our hands with bracelets thinke all the vvorld dooth admire vs and vvee seeme in our owne eyes like the kyms or like the builders of babell thought to hyde theyr heades among clowdes

a godly deuoute man who now is the lorde meruaileth much at the vani of proude men wonder saith hee

men should in seeking to exalt themselues farre debase themselues for in clothing so richly they make theyr apparell better than themselues theyr bodies are not so much woorth as their apparell would be better then all men and yet make the~selues equall to the clothes weare vpon theyr backs
salomon when he was most royally was not halfe so glorious as the in fielde
if the lilly did exceede and a king vvhy should priuate men or great men in high place or in lowe place howsoeuer striue to be proud since they make themselues like one of the flowers of the field which florisheth before sieth and is cut downe in a moment
let vs not so passe away our dayes in vanitie let vs rather learne this lesson of christ here taught vs which is humilitie
euen from the beginning of his life the of his birth in bethleem to the time of his death in caluary alwaies hee practized humilitie
he sought no rich apparell but was to be lapt vp in a few
when he came to the world hee sought no stately building to dwell in
the foxes had holes and the birdes of the ayre had nestes but the son of man had not whereon to lay his head
in sted of a cradle hee had but a cratch and a stable in sted of a chamber for there was no roome in the inne other guests had taken vp the lodgings
see what poore entertainement was made heere for him who was the king of glory a pallace was not good enough for him yet in bethleem a towne that had ma houses in it and many roomes hee alone could get neither house nor
ioseph his supposed father mary the blessedst among women though she were euen nowe trauailing to be deliuered were glad of a stable like as iacob was glad of stones to put vnder his head in stedde of a pyllow when he slept at bethell

the had made it to entertaine his guestes horses yet it is dignified heere and of a base place it is made an honorable place of better reckoning then any emperours chamber or prince in the worlde for it was our sauiour christ his


the person tooke away the vilees of the place and made it honourable
micah when he wrote of bethleem thou bethleem art little among the citties of iudah might also haue saide thou inne in or rather thou stable of that inne in bethleem art little among the houses in bethleem yet in thee shall he be borne that must rule israell

zachary prophecying of christ his comming sayth thus reioyce sion shoute for daughter ierusalem for behold thy king commeth vnto thee he commeth poore and riding vpon an asse and vpon a colt the foale of an asse
hee was poore indeede when hee might not commaund an house but hee did it to shewe his humilitie
the lord of all had least of all hee had not so much as a house to be borne in and yet his father was a carpenter hee made many a house for others but none for himselfe his sonne

humilitie neuer founded gay houses this hath sprung vp but of late yeeres for our auncestors contented themselues vvith simple lodgings
comes it which is not so co~monly as truely spoken

sumptuous building hath vndone england
and hospitalitie are lost through pride prodigalitie

before time honest men contented them selues with an homely hall and a loouer no

chimney nor parlour nor vpper chamber and in such houses the poore founde good reliefe
but nowe our houses haue so inlarged themselues as if they were so many citties for height and statelines like nabucadnezers pallace in babell and the manie roomes in them like the streetes of niniuie one wrought within another like dedalus labyrinth or the pyramides in memphis and egypt that a man being once in them can hardly finde the way out of them many halls and many parlours many chimneyes or shewes of chimneyes and of many scarce one or none smoaking
goodlie

and all this came in with pride it vvas neuer so in his ruffe as now it is and therefore no better time to presse this example of humilitie then nowe
hee teacheth vs this lesson that teacheth vs al things learn of me for am humble and meeke yee shall

finde rest for your soules
christ that was borne for vs so gouerne vs by his spirit of grace that this sinne of pride and all other enormities beeing suppressed in vs wee may practize that humilitie which at last will exalt vs to immortalitie and infinite happines
it followeth in the dayes of herod the king
heere is deliuered the time when christ was borne
when herod raigned in iedea
it is woorth the noting to consider of the tyme of christes birth
it was a time of crueltie a time of trouble a time of tyrannie persecution
the troubles that fell vppon him in his infancie did presage continuance of like insuing calamities through the whole course of his life
he found no ease no peace no place almost in the world but was euer afflicted persecuted betrayed arrayned condemned and at last crucified
in the raigne of herod
herod was the first that stept vppon the stage and other tyrants after succeeded him to act christes tragedy

the murdered innocents in that merciles

massacre can witnesse the bloody crueltie of that time

christ new borne is compeld to flie fro bethleem to egypt like moses to mydian

there remained till they were dead who sought his life
in the daies of herod that is in the dayes of him whose power was of god but hee abused his power with the same sought to destroy the sonnes of god
this herod was the sonne of hyrcanus as iosephus noteth in lib
antiq ca
three circumstances are to be noted concerning this cruell herod
first hee vvas troubled when he heard of christes birth and the rather for that hee was termed a king
wherein we may see the of the wicked and reprobates they be sad when others are merry when the sheepheards and wise men triumphed reioyced then was herod and his people discomforted

there coulde not come to the vvorlde greater tidings of ioy than the newes of christes birth so proclaimed by the angell that appeared to the sheepheards in testimony whereof the multitudes of heauenly

souldiours praised god and sung melodiously vnto the lord
yea and with them the whole frame of nature seemed to reioyce
yet nowe was herod in the midst of his dumps not knowing which way to turne him terrors within and troubles without so affrighted him as pangs doe a vvoman that trauaileth with child and is plained to be deliuered
it droue him to a maze when hee heard of christ as the droue baithazer to a stackering
herods conscience it seemes could tell him that he had no interest in christ and therefore no maruell if hee were troubled
he feared also that he should nowe lose his kingly titles and honours and that christ would depriue him of his kingdome and so seeking an earthly kingdome he lost an heauenly kingdome and though he lyued for a short time like a king yet he dyed far vnlike a king for hee was eaten vp of life in the midst of his glory

the second circumstance
all ierusalem was troubled with him
heere is that prouerbe verified regis ad exemplar totus componitur orbis
the citty was mooued to see

the king mooued the whole people frame themselues to the passions of the prince
moses counsell was this non sequere multitudinem thou shalt not follow a multitude to doe euill
but in this place tis noted that the multitude follow and many are drawne by the example of one to doe euill
king and people all oppose themselues against christ
this is it which dauid so long before prophecied of christ the kings of the earth the mightie men haue assembled themselues together they banded themselues against the lord and against his annoynted
thirdly this feare proceeded to spill the blood of saints thereby to destroy christ
this was not timor but tremor such a terrour and fearefulnes as is wont to assault the reprobate
there is feare in the children of god but it is a fihall feare a feare but this is a seruile feare that was in herod such a feare as expels all good graces out of vs

of that feare saint iohn speaketh when he saith feare hath painfulnes in herod heere it had painfulnes for it disquieted

him and his people
it hath in it painfulnes and hatefulnesse for so soone as this feare entred he beganne to hate christ
by this herod the wicked mighty men of this world are noted which endeuour by all meanes to oppresse the gospell of christ
the tyrants of the earth could not abide that the glory of christ should stand but they are like the
angels in the reuel
the
winds of the earth that they should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor vpon any greene tree
examples of persecuting tyrants are plentifull in scripture
the tyranny of pharao against israell
the tyranny of saule against dauid
the tyranny of achab persecuting michaeas
so the deuill still hath his instruments to exercise crueltie and to insult ouer gods people as heere hee proucked herod to persecute christ

this note among the rest must not bee forgotten concerning the time of christes birth when most tiranny was vsed religion most defaced then was christ borne
and therfore in iohn he is called lux lucens

in tenebris a light shining in darknes
as our sauiour was borne vnder tyrannie so haue his members euer since beene borne vnder tyrannie affliction to teach vs that persecution is euer a marke of the true church
to drawe this doctrine to particuler applycation
we see in this place the crueltie and maliciousnes of herod against christ let vs learne to hate crueltie rather striue to be meeke and gentle
god hateth nothing more than crueltie and the man neuer commeth to the graue in peace
cruelty rather then it shal scape without punishment will be it owne executioner like caine whose own conscience did persecute him for his brothers bloode crying within him whosoeuer findes me shal sley me

let this bloody tyrant herod be a president of terrour to all that carry like bloodie mindes
as herod slew the poore innocents in bethleem so the lord slew him the bloode of those innocents cryed to the lord for reuenge and theyr cry preuailed for he died most shamefully
as he sent an army of men euen men of war to destroy

all those males so god sent another kinde of vvarriours to fight against him euen an armie of lice
these came about him in troupes thicker than the flyes of egypt did eate him vp aliue as you may reade more at large in the
of the acts
and as eusebius reporteth it he seeing the iudgements of god vpon him vttered these words qui vobis deus videor vitam turpiter finire cogor
that am reputed in your eyes as a god am constrayned to die most filthily
it followeth wise men came fro the east to ierusalem saying where is he that is borne king of the iewes since neither herod nor his people the inhabitants of ierusalem did labour to seek out christ loe god styrreth vp others euen meere strangers to come from farre from the east to ierusalem to worship his sonne
a prophet is not without honour saue in his owne country and amongst his owne
christ beeing in bethleem among his own is not receiued and therfore as our sauiour told the iewes when they bragged they had abraham to theyr father god is able euen

of stones to raise vp sonnes to abraham
so heere rather than christ shall want honour god rayseth men from farre that neuer knewe iury nor ierusalem to come vnto him and to present him vvith rich gifts vndoubted testimonies of a true worship
they were wise men yet but worldly wise till they came to christ and then they learned of him true vvisedome euen the word of lyfe which was able to saue theyr soules
in the example of these wise men trauailing so farre to seeke christ wee must learne that if vvee will come to christ as vvee ought wee must forsake our parents our countrey and friendes
vvee must leaue all behind vs the worlde the cares thereof to the end we may be the lighter in our towards christ
vvee shall be sure to finde no rubbes in the way able to stay vs if wee doe but consider that we are running vnto christ
to christ must we runne not to idols nor to the power of men but vvee must trauaile to him alone to onely must vve offer and to no other
for he is agnus dei he is the lambe of god that taketh away the sinnes of the world
it is neyther angell nor saint that can heare vs or intreate for vs or can grant the thing wee aske for
christ alone can do it for he alone hath borne our infirmities
hee is the onely phisition that healeth vs hee is the brazen serpent vpon whom looketh recouereth
he is the samaritane that powreth wine and oyle into our woundes
these men thus trauailing to christ are not recorded who they were and it is for vs to pry vnto that which the spirit of god hath kept secret
but vvise men they vvere and religiouslie vvise it seemes they vvere for they vvere inflamed vvith a feruent desire to see christ
some are of opinion that they were magicians such as had skill in diuining and interpreting difficult matters and in foretelling thinges to come
and the originall vvord would seeme to carry this sence magoi
such knowledge was extraordinary it is forbidden and accursed in many places of scripture
let none bee founde among you that hath a spirit of diuination or that is a or a charmer
deut

and if any turne after such ego excidam
leuit

and such it may be were these wise men before they knewe christ but this prophane wisedome went from them vvhen the true knowledge of christ was implanted in them
these magi were and gentiles they first came to see christ and therfore they are called the first fruites of the gentiles they had neither the law nor the prophets read vnto them yet they first labour to finde out christ

signifying that it is god onely who formeth euery christian mans hart hee can soone turne dauid from adultery adam to confesse his sinne paule of a persecutor to become a professor
he can make of stones sonnes to abraham and of gentiles sound christians
as heere hee caused these wise men to come from farre euen from the east to ierusalem to vvorshippe

christ so is there no respect of persons with god but in all places who so feareth him and worketh righteousnes shalbe accepted
from the east to ierusalem
as christ our lorde came from the bosome of his father to be incarnate and to dwell among vs so these wise men came from theyr country from the east to finde out christ their redeemer
this sheweth theyr great desire
ieroboam saide it was too far to goe to ierusalem but these wse men did not thinke it too farre to come from the fast to ierusale to worship christ him not at ierusalem they traueled yet further to bethleem in iudea they neuer rested till they found out him that saued them
by grace they sought him and by fayth they founde him whom they woulde not lose againe for the gayning of the world

but leaue wee these wise men thus traueling returne we to our selues awhile and doubt not before wee haue done by the guide of that starre in this story mentioned to place the in the inne at bethleem together with that princely babe though

lodged whom they with such a longing desire expected to behold
the vse of the doctrine to our selues is this we must the like desire and the same holy affection that they did
we must labour to come to the knowledge of christ we must seeke after where it is to be had by traueling for it though it were as far as ierusalem knowing that the sufferinges of this world are not woorthy the glory that shall be reuealed
wee may not looke that christ shoulde come to vs we must rather goe to him and neuer cease going till wee come where our soules he belodged together
we read of the earnest care of the church in the of in the first second and

shee neuer gaue ouer to seeke him

shee him
and so should wee be like diligent and carefull
vvee should our eyes to sleepe nor our to mber nor the temples of our to take any should not cease and day seeking still seeking and inquiring after him whom our long for till we haue him
like these wise men whom theyr iourney inquired euen in the of ierusalem and in the open places thereof whether all the people of the recoue there they demaunded for the newe borne king of the at length in bethleem they finde him
this may the lazie of men they know the comfort and they haue in christ yet will not myles to heare the word which is the now where
christ is nowe no to be founde in his bodily presence among vs onely is present in the word and there alone hee will be sought for

as christ shewed himselfe to the wisemen

at bethleem and after shewed himselfe to the doctors in the temple so in our bethleems in our citties and townes and in our temples doth he still shew him selfe in his word and in his gospell dailie taught and preached

it is not now that ierusalem in iudea

that bethleem where these wise men once were that christ will be found in now
our trauell is easier and our iourney shorter he is come home to our own countrey from to england and from ierusalem to london and to all the citties and townes in our land teaching and expounding in our euery sabbaoth
yet labour to heare him the wise men shall rise vp at the last day to co~demne such

yet more it controules the loose and dissolu carelesnes of those licentious libertines
cannot call them men but rather of men who hauing christ preached vnto them at theyr doores within the walls of theyr citties and townes vvill not to it dishonoring in a gracelesse the spit of grace and despising as much as in them lyeth both christ and

the ministers of his gospell
such are worse then the vnbeleeuing iewes for they hearde christ euery sabbath nay they are worse then herod for he desired to see christ and to heare him

but leaue we them to theyr dissolute resolutions let them remaine while they list in the darknes of egypt
but let vs holde goshen the comfortable light whereof will direct vs in our passage as the clowdy piller did the israelites through the wildernes or as the starre did these wise men
when this stifnecked generation shall stumble at the truth and erre from it like the sodomites groping for the doore of lots house

when they were striken with blindnes
where the spirit of god is there is a longing and a thirsting and a burning desire of the word
but sure there can be no grace where there is no liking of godlines
exhort you then and beseech you beloued in the lord euen in the bowels of iesus christ who will one day call you to a reckoning for your seruice of him labour to heare the word trauell to it desire it in a burning affection

if you haue any grace of gods spirit any

measure of proceede and grow more and more in the liuely fayth of christ iesus
cast away all your cares of this world and labour onely to haue that sauing knowledge which god hath reuealed in his wd
this one thing is necessarie· and it will supply all your wants
you are not yet the of christ till this desire of the vvord be planted in you
they that carry not an hungry appetite to the let them be for honour and dignitie how excellent so euer for vvealth and riches how potent soeuer for friendes and followers howe mighty soeuer yet are they but or that are full of and
because the comfort of the word is sequestred from theyr soules which alone can magnifie them
without the word nothing can make vs happy and hauing it nothing can make vs miserable

it is the that vs to life is the pearle for which the merchant would giue all that euer is the of dauid which openeth and no man and

no man openeth it is the onely our eyes being annoynted can not chuse but cleerely behold christ
name the word and thou hast named all things it is all all and contayneth all the blessings of gods which are for number so many and for value so great that no man can know them but hee that hath them like the stone in the reuelation that white stone with a newe name grauen in it which no man knoweth sauing he that receaueth it
these wise men from the east to ierusalem
thinges of high prise and of necessary vse if they be not neer vs must be sought farre of where they are to be had
and we must spare no paynes nor cost in procuring them
sent to loppa for peter to informe him in the way of righteousnes
dauid longing for the returne of the arke went brought it from
the longing to see his sonne ranne to meete him a great way of and kissed him
sent to to and heere these

east to to seeke out christ dauids lord
another note woorthy the obseruation comes to be considered in these wise men
these wise men did not cast the perrill and lets that might happen in theyr iourney
the gentiles might not conuerse vvith the iewes they were enemies one to the other
yet these enemies through vvhose country they were to passe did not them the dangers subiect to their iourney did not disquiet them the tediousnes of the way did not terrifie them nothing coulde stay them from theyr intended enterprise
their to see christ tooke away all worldly carefulnes our practise should be like theyrs
no busines of thys should withdraw vs from christ

vvhen they came to ierusalem they found herod snaring them all the citty in an king and people and all were mooued
so when we come to christ an herod without vs and an idolcall ierusalem within vs tyrants with and within many lets nets and ny snates to vs put we must respect neither herod nor but

still holde on our viage to bethleem the place where christ lodgeth
in all ages there wil be satans instruments like so many lyons in the passages to stop the children of god in their good courses
and now with vs there are many herods many like herod and archelaus to cut the throate of religion as hee sought the lyfe of christ in the blood of the innocents
but yet must we goe forwards like these wise men we must not feare them that kill the body rather him that can cast both body and soule into hell stronger is he that is with vs than whole legions of enemies that band themselues with them against god
let them and neuer so much like ze cheb and yet god will put an hooke in theyr nostrils and they shall not preuayle
no more than the stoode which was cast out of the mouth of the dragon in the reuelation against the woman tt sled to the wildernes
we haue seene his starre

heere comes to be considered how they knew he was borne
the stae gaue them knowledge and was theyr guide in

iourney neuer leauing them till they came to austin saith that at the birth of christ a new starre appeared
a blazing comet that neuer shewed it selfe before and at his death the sunne greater then the greatest starre was obscured
at this bvrth infants were murdered and at his death they were crowned
at his byrth hell was more conquered and his enemies more troubled
eusebius saith that at the bth of christ there happened to breake vp on a sudden a goodly spring that ranne with oyle the space of one day
and at the same time in romea circle was seene about the sunne no lesse cleere then the sunne
and that vvhen the imperiall crowne was brought by the senate to augustus he refused it saving that a greater prince then himselfe was nowe borne to whom all the crownes and kingdoms in the world did belong

a famous temple at the same time rent in in the dedication whereof when the oracle was demaunded howe long the

same should continue answer was giuen it should remaine till a virgine should bring foorth a sonne
these many such wonders then happened all beeing euident signes and perfect demonstrations of the newe borne king the rather to worke in mens and to stamp in them a neuer dying knowledge of this wonderful byrth of christ our lord
by the starre they knew him and by the starie they sounde him
and so if wee vvill know christ and finde him as they did we must examine our selues undefined span alphabet thys star hath appeared vnto vs or not
there is duplex
this undefined span alphabet is of two sorts there is a spirit undefined span alphabet in vs and another with vs
the starre without is the undefined span alphabet word
the starre within undefined span alphabet of faith and charitie without undefined span alphabet not see christ
in the first of the reuel undefined span alphabet called a starre in the hand undefined span alphabet and christ himselfe undefined span alphabet morning starre

the minister must haue undefined span alphabet

a starre which is to be alwayes bright and shining and to be euer in motu to shine in doctrine and to shine in his manner of lyuing to goe before his people in example of good life and doctrine to be a guide vnto them as this star was a guide to the wise men to direct them to christ
to be euer in motu that is to exercise his gifts of teaching and preaching godly conference continually without cealing without intermission
like a starre that trauelleth and keepeth his course night and day
the star of fayth which is within vs containeth fiue circumstances noted in the of iohn
the multitude of beleeuing when they heard that christ shoulde come to ierusalem in testimony of theyr fayth tooke branches of shewing theyr gratitude so our fayth must receaue christ palmis with palme branches that is with praise and thankfulnes
they were greene branches rami so must our faith be greene it must neuer wither it must alwaies operari it must branch forth into good works like to
they confessed him hosanna blessed is the king of israell that commeth in the name of the lord
so sides fayth cannot bee without confession
they also called vpon him hosanna to shew the necessity of cation
lastly they followed him so faith alwaies followeth christ and is euer vvith christ like the beloued disciple that leaned vpon his bosome
we haue seene his starre and are come to worship him
heere is sette downe the end why they came
they came to worshippe him
for they opened theyr treasures and presented vnto him gold frankincense by theyr rich presents you may gesse at the rich assection and loue they bare to christ
they came to giue all holy worship to him that was the king of glory
and therefore in testimony of theyr loialty obedience they bring vnto him gystes worthy such a king as it were to defray the of an vndeuided loue gold frankencense and mirth

behold a which fayth

drew forth and pure deuotion presented an offering better accepted then all the of
what gyfts might bee of great value then these so is it shll with the godly they count count nothing too deere which they bring to christ
looke the of exod
pure myrth frankencense were appoynted by a for the oyle holy oyntment and for the persume among other thinges of price there noted
in the
of exod the people brought so liberall and so towards the building of the sanc that ms was to prome they giue ouer
such and so free is the hurt of the righteous when fayth dooth it and the grace of gods spt inflames it such was the gift of these wise men
this in them must incourage vs to present and giue out of the easures of harts to the
and thys we may doe since god requireth of vs not golde uer or the like but hee requireth vs to offer but our selues a euen our soules bodies to serue the lord
offer not to me thy goods or thy welth or thy gold but saith god if thou vvilt giue me any thing giue me thy hart
sliuer it mine and golde is mine sayth the lord aggei
we cannot enrich him if wee giue him all that we haue if we giue him al the world and the kingdoms thereof we giue him but his owne
for terra est es the earth the lords and the fulnes thereof
god required in former ages large sacrifices
oxen sheepe and calues but these sacrifices haue nowe an end and are long agone determined but the offering that best pleaseth god now is that proclaimed by salomon giue thy hart
and that spoken by micah in his sixt chapter
shall come the lord or how my selfe before the god shall come before him with burnt rings or with calues of a old will the lord bee of raes or with of or shall giue my first for my transgression euen the fruite of my bodie for the

sinne of my soule
he hath shewed thee man what is good what the lord requireth surely to doe iustice to loue mercy and to humble thy selfe and to walke with thy god
so then ye honour christ aright and ye then worship him in spirit truth in presenting these treasures of the hart
thys wil be better accepted then the sacrifycing of a bullocke that hath hornes and hoofes
if you thus glorifie christ hee will also glorifie you and when hee commeth in glorie he will take vs to himselfe and giue vs better habitations then his owne sonne found with vs when hee dwelt among vs euen glorious mansions in his kingdome of glory
to him be glorie for euer leaf motif the true louers canticle

heerein is loue not that that wee loued god but that god loueth vs and sent his sonne to be areconciliation for our sinnes
beloued if god so loued vs wee ought also to loue one another
this loue holdes me to it like an adamant cannot be deuided fro it for that it is such a matter as vvith it doctrine of greatest substance and of greatest necessity
already hath been spoken in the former treatise concerning this loue now comes more to be spoken therof in this place by course of the text
not doubting but that this argument of loue being presented againe before eyes as at a second view it will the rather be planted in you

eyther the one or the other that former or this latter discourse must needes slampe so deepe an impression in the tables of your harts as no perpetuitie of time shall be able

to
saint mathew first in his gospell commended vnto vs the loue of god in sending his sonne into the world to bee borne for vs and heere saint iohn in his epistle commends vnto vs the like loue of god in sending his sonne into the world to die for vs iohn was hee of the apostles who alone with a speciall appellation is termed the disciple of the lord and the disciple whom iesus loued whom our lorde also seemed to carry as it were in his owne bosome
christ his lorde for louing him must needes drawe like loue and like affection from him towards christ
and to expresse thys loue as if hee were wholy compounded of loue thys beloued disciple soundeth nothing else almost throughout his epistle but thys loue vvee speake of
the loue of god towardes vs our loue againe towards god
gods loue first and ours after all is loue

and therefore thys text may well bee called the louers canticle
for the apostle begins the text with loue and continues

and endes the same with loue making loue as it were the burden of his song
is loue in that god loued vs and sent his sonne to reconcile vs beloued if god so loued vs wee ought also to loue one
all you that haue beene foolishly deuoted to fond loue that haue ill spent manie good howres in powring out your passionate complaynts in a vaine vaine of humorous conceytednesse haue taken great paynes to penne loues poems idle toyes of suspende both penne and poeme cast them from you as the israelites hanged theyr harpes vpon the willowes
tyme that tryeth all thinges and is the mother of truth can well you with infallible demonstrations that such lasciuious loue or rather such lawlesse lust vvill but leade you to vanitie and vanitie vvill seale vp iniquitie
and so beeing bereaued of all grace and godlinesse you become in a moment vtterlie irreligious

if you must and vvill needes loue if you haue made it your profession to bee

amorous heere is loue euen that true loue that other to this is but an idoll like dagon to the arke this loue how simply tyred is able to drawe all
in eternizing her praises if so bee you make her the mistres of your affections you shall sinde matter enough to vvorke vpon
this loue calls vppon you as the cheefe commaunder of all your actions and the onely supreme soueraigne vnto vvhich your tongues and pennes shoulde sacrifice theyr labours
heerein is loue shall liken this loue of god this holy loue is like a golden chaine that by an inseparable vnion linketh together god and vs like dauid aad ionathan yoaked together by an inuiolable leagne of amitie

againe may liken thys loue it is like to iacobs ladder which reached from the earth to the heauens on the

which were angels descending and ascending god himselfe slanding aboue vppon the top of it
yet once more to what shall liken this loue or may it bee compared it is like to the golden censer in the hande of the angell before the altar which censer was full of sweete odours the smoake whereof did ascend vp before god out of the angels hand
and it was a sweete sauour in gods for god accepted it so wee reade in the
of the renel
now we will bee accepted with god we must vse this incense
loue must be the golden censer of vvellsmelling odours to bee carried vp to the lord and to be presented the altar and before the throane by the ministery of the angell that is christ the holiest of all holies who alone shall be accepted for vs for that he alone hath reconciled vs iacobs ladder reached vp to heauen and this must be our ladder if we will learn like the angels to ascend vp where god is

a chaine consists of many linkes and all are fastned in so sure one in another that they cannot be sundred or deuided and he that drawes but the one linke drawes vnto him all the whole chaine
thys chavne is loue and we must of necessity be possest of

this chayne if wee will haue to doe vvith god
for god is not but where is vnitie this chayne is vnitie for vvhat is a chayne but many linkes in one
first one link then another then a third to that and after that another and so the chayne is perfited
nay there is such a mutuall relation betweene god and vs if thys loue bee in vs whereof wee speake that wee can in no sort separate the one from the other no not in intellectu not so much as in conceit as the terme it
the apostle saint iohn proouing the same where he sayth god is loue and hee that dwelleth in loue dwelleth in god god in him thys loue is consisting of two parts the loue of god towards vs and our loue to one another
vvee ought first to consider of gods loue and then to descend to our selues making a patterne first of his loue towards vs and out of it to frame a like loue in our selues one to another

god goeth before vs in the example of thys loue and we must follow after as neere as wee can in practizing the like loue among

our selues
heerein is loue
the principall proposition handled by the apostle in thys place is the generall doctrine of christ who was sent foorth from the bosome of his father vnto the vvorld to reconcile vs by the vertue of his death which doctrine is grounded vppon these arguments for strength like a brazen vvall against which sathan and the power of hell cannot preuaile
the first argument is drawne from the mercie or loue of god in these vvordes heerein is loue
the second from his will beeing a speciall effect of his loue in these words and sent his sonne many properties and attributes are in god vvhich it behooueth vs especially to take notice of
first hee is omnipotent prooued by his creation
wise by his daily gubernation
iust in his promises
mercifull for hee spareth sinners
louing to all for hee calleth all and is carefull for all
but specially for the elect who do heare when he calleth
his lone is heere iustified for that hee sent his sonne to the world that so many as beleeued might haue life euerlasting

the fountaine of all graces is loue which drewe from him a greater worke then the creation of the world euen the vvork of our redemption a matter of so great mysterie that it caused all the prophets from adam the sonne of god to iohn baptist the sonne of zacharie in all times and ages to speake and write of this superabundant grace and rich good will long before the foundations of the world determined but in the fulnesse of time reuealed vnto vs by the comming of his sonne by whom wee

haue redemption through his blood euen the forgiuenes of our sinnes according to his rich grace
this exceeding loue of god beeing deepely in a carefull consideration needes work mightily in the chyldren of god· and driue them to acknowledge with iohn in this place that indeede

these first words in the text how bare and naked so euer they may seeme at the first front or blush do carry in them matter

of moment they must run in our mouthes if we sound them rightly and significantlie with a kinde of emphasis
thus if you require to know the loue of god why heere you may learne it saint iohn tels you that was the loue of god made manifest in that he sent his sonne
you are bought with a price saith the apostle the words make but a bare shewe but they are very significant as if hee shoulde haue sayd a price with a witnes
so heerein is loue that is a loue vvith a witnes
for god so loued vs that he spared not his onely sonne but gaue him for vs all to death
him that knewe no sinne
god made to be sinne for vs that we should be made the righteousnes of god by him
it is not possible for vs to expresse the greatnes of this loue of god in this behalfe for it is infinite it is as great as god is great whose glory filleth the world the heauens the earth and the creatures

no man can vnderstand this loue but they that haue the benee of it meane the redeemed of the lord as no man could learne the elders newe song the

forty foure thousand which were brought from the earth
reuel

this loue of god we all doe behold like the brightnes of the sunne whose fierie beames and christall rayes proceeding as from the father of all lights passe forth to the ends of the world
but where be they that in beholding this loue of god this cleerenesse of gods rich grace will bee ready with the to present vnto god all holie vvorshyp
where is the rich thankfulnes aunswerable to this rich grace vvee read of lepers that vvere clensed and of the tenne but one returned to giue thanks
so we are all clensed by the bloode of christ but scarce one of ten returnes to giue thankes to him that clensed him thereby to testifie our dutifull affection to christ as christ testified his to vs in laying downe his life for the many sealing vp remission of sinnes by his blood

the sicke is cured but he hath forgotten the physition that cured him
the diseased is deliuered and the mortall wounde is salued but the patient now become a whole

man remembers neyther his sore nor yet the physition
heerein is loue not that we loued god
saint iohn in speaking of this loue doth not presently acquaint vs with the particularitie of this loue but hee first suspendeth the matter the rather to drawe from vs attention and carefulnes
before proceede to tell you what thys loue is will first tell you what it is not
a thing that is sought for being presently found is no longer thought on and so if the apostle should vppon the sudden discouer to vs this so great a mistery of gods loue it would be but lightly regarded
therefore hee offers it and yet drawes it backe againe and then presents it againe stil offering and yet to make vs the rather long after it with a more eager and feruent affection
like children in this respect vvho the more they be denyed of that they woulde haue the more they cry do neuer leaue crying till it be giuen them
not that we loued god

the loue meane sayth saint iohn· is not the loue that you meane
it is not

vaine loue nor nor carnall loue nor the loue of the worlde nor the loue of honours nor the loue of pleasures nor the loue of riches it is none of all these for this is our loue but am to tell you of gods loue
it was not loue in vs but in god was this loue that caused christ to come vnto the world nay there was in vs no loue at all the contrary was in vs euen hatred and enmitie therfore it is sayd cum hostes essemus
and therefore well might the apostle make this conclusion against vs not that we loued god
and wee our selues doe iustifie the truth therof in our selues for we know that we loue our lusts and our vanities and the world more then god

adams corruption hath it selfe into adams children euen all his posteritie
god had giuen him all the kingdoms of the earth and placed him in paradice this worlds heauen heere god exhibited plentifull testimony of his loue but adam could shewe forth no loue to god for this so prooued by his wilful disobedience
the taste of one apple made hym forget both himselfe and god his maker

and haue not our pleasures the same soueraigntie ouer vs iudas solde his maister for thirtie pence he loued his mony better then his maister and many mammonites now whose cares are vppon theyr coffers and whose mindes are vppon the bagge as iudas was if they would not be corrupted with mony to betray christ yet they could be contented to betray the members of christ theyr brethren and neighbours for fewer shekels of filuer then delilah tooke from the princes of the philistims

no man would willingly be leprous yet many worldlings that are carried away with the loue of riches could be co~tented to buy a leprofie with lesse then two bags of siluer

as gehazie did

esau as hee had an earthly name so vvas he earthly minded his prophanenes is laid open to all eyes where it is registred of him that hee solde his for a messe of pottage
and he is no lesse infamous for so dooing then hee that burnt dianas temple at ephesus or that tyrant who harped

at romes flames

that esau is long agoe dissolued into

earth and dust but out of his ashes others like him are risen vp like cadmus brood and the same prophannes that was in esau is growne vp with them
many edomites liue now that can be content to sell a better patrimonie then he did euen their spirituall inhearitance which they should haue in christ and all for the transitory pleasures of this life
to be short we should loue god onelie principally before all things
we should loue god more the our parents our countrey our friends our selues hee that loueth father or mother or sister or brother or wife or or kinsfolkes more then mee saith our sauiour christ is not woorthy to be my disciple
this ought to be but wee cannot yet apply our selues to this loue which christ doth here so necessarily require
we are all like demas loth to part with the world like the young rich man in the gospel who was vnwilling to leaue his possessions he loued his vvealth better than christ
and therefore vvhen christ bad him folow him he chose rather to folow the world
and al the in the earth are not able to sette these

two at one the loue of god the loue of the world
for christ hath spoken it if you loue the world the loue of god cannot be in you
you see the truth then of this conclusion not that we loued god but that god loued vs and sent his sonne
heere the apostle sheweth the particularitie of the loue which all this while hee suspended
heerein is that loue manifested in sending his sonne
there was no good thing in vs at all no mirit or desert that might moue god to giue vs his sonne
it was his loue onely and the good pleasure of his wil as the apostle speaketh to the ephesians in the first chapter
our aduersaries ought to blush if christian modestie did rest vpon them vvhen they read this text in iohns epistle that other in his gospel since they denie that truth which is is both places elswhere so strongly maintained
they would perswade men by their doctrine of merit that this loue of god is but a matter of course as if god were bounde to loue vs and that we can deserue at gods hands to be so loued
yea they say we may doe good works of supererogation more then god requireth
wee neede not farre fet scriptures to aunswere such
one text of many shal suffise this now in handling
god loued vs first and not we him
nay he loued vs when we hated him and fell from him by wilful transgression
as soone as adam had sinned god in this his loue salued him with the promise of christ the seede of the vvoman breaking the serpents head
this loue of god was vniuersall it extended to all men of all sorts iewes and gentiles circumcised and vncircumcised bond and free beleeuers and vnbeleeuers
in thy seede shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
all might haue taken hold of this blessing as freely as adam might stretch his hand to all the trees of the garden saue the tree of knowledge
god would haue all men to bee saued and therefore christ was offred to all but in that all bee not saued the fault is theyrs that will not pertake of this blessing

the death of christ was sufficient for al but it was not effectuall for all it was effectuall

onely for the beleeuers
and therfore saith this same iohn in the
chap of his gospel that so many as beleeued on him should not perrish
all were bidden to the marriage of the kings sonne yet all did not come nay they who were first bidden came not at all
so the fault was theirs that refused being so solemnly inuited
in like manner all are not saued that are called to partake of this loue of god vniuersally made knowne to the whole world in christ who would haue all men to be saued
onely the beleeuers haue this prerogatiue for many are called but few are chosen
and sent his sonne to be a reconciliation
infinite are the testimonies of gods loue towards vs as paule said how vnsearchable are thy iudgements lord and thy waies past finding out so may wee say howe deepe is thy loue lord towards vs how vnsearchable past finding out no bucket of mans vnderstanding is able to sound the bottome of this bottomlesse fountaine

thy loue was manifested first in giuing vs a being when before wee were not in

committing to vs the gouernment of this mossie vvorlde and the creatures therein making vs for dignitie but a little to the angelles pouring vppon vs all temporall blessings
for all thinges that euer vvere or are for our sakes they vvere and are created all for the ministerie of all to serue man and man to serue god
this tessth the aboundant loue of our creatoar but more then can be most is this exceeding testimonie of his loue in sending his sonne his onelie begotten sonne christ iesus into the world for our redemption
the worke of the sixe daies creating of the worlde is nothing to the worke of the redemption of the world
which made saint iohn exclaine with a speciall kinde of admiration so god loued the world that he gaue
and againe in this place heerein is loue in that god his to be a reconciliation
hee spared not his onely sonne but gaue him for vs all to death

neuer was there a time since man began to be vpon the earth sitter for the learning and practising of this heauenly lesson than

now for these are the worst and last times wherein the sinns of men are growne ripe for the sickle of gods wrath and men drinke vp iniquity like water
men are so frozen in their dreggs and the world with the lustes thereof so captiued them that they can sinde no leasure at all to enter into this carefull consideration of gods loue
you knowe the parable of the excusers in the gospel one had bought a farme another had bought a yoake oxen the third had married a so is it in this declyning age of the vvorld some are so intangled and wholely prepossest with cares of this lyfe others agayne so solde to carnality and lycensiousnes as if they had bound themselues to the deuil to serue in the stauery of sinne
and a thirde sort so irreligiously carelesse and voyde of all seeling that they can finde no svveetenesse no comfort no tast in gods worde farie wide of dauids affection it vvas in his mouth sweeter than the but to these menne it is more bitter than vvormewood
they thinke euery moment of time too long which is bestowed in gods seruice
onely they come to the temple of god for fashions sake and as it were by compulsion like a beare to a stake drawne by violence as soone as they are in the church they couet to be out of the church far vnlike those lampes in the sanctuary which were alwayes burning
and so by one meanes or other fewe or none can thinke vpon the loue of god
all such are heere pinched by the elbow and are wakened with the alarum that iohn heere soundeth
heerein is loue
and sent his sonne
in the
chap of his gospel hee sayth he gaue his sonne all is one
god giues and sendes his sonne christ vnto vs and yet the papistes will keepe him from vs vnlesse wee will buy him at their hands
god doth giue his sonne freely and the sonne offers him selfe freely and yet the pope wil sell him
hoe euery one that is thirstie come to the waters and you that haue no mony come

the popes proclamation runnes in another

tenor
hoe saith hee you that haue mony come and buy out your sinnes you shall haue bulls and pardons and indulgences and dispensations and priuiledges to sinne while you liue
these are strong delusions sweete allurements and able to all the marchants of the earth to this so great a mart
but he kils all dead in the this is it that marres the market you shal be sure to pay well for it
iohn sayes heere was loue in god to giue his sonne for vs but we may say heere is no loue in the pope saue the loue of lucre the loue of mony
so dooth he throughout shew himselfe a playne antichrist and a not to god but to the deuill euen his chiefe soueraigne
god lookes for no retribution his loue freely presents him he hath giuen vs him and all things with him
in this gift are all things contayned for in him dwelleth all fulnes

hee is omnia in omnibus all in all thinges and had wee all the worlde without him it were nothing
in him we liue and moue

and haue our being in him we are at peace with god and men in him we obtaine remission of our sins it is he who was wounded for our sinns smitten for our iniquities
he was borne for vs that we might be borne againe in him so by that our new birth might haue an entrance into that holy place whether is now ascended
it is he that suffered for vs to the end we should not suffer those indurable torments which by our sins we had incurred
he was for vs that we shold learne to our old man with our crooked affections
in a worde hee is become our redemption sanctification saluation daily preseruation he is our health our wealth our liberty name but christ thou hast named heauen earth all the rich treasures blessings in them both
for in that god hath giuen vnto vs his sonne he hath likewise with him giuen vs all things
for our sinnes
reconciliation importeth a regayning of gods fauour once lost

why then wee cannot consider of the greatnes of this benefit of reconciliation vnlesse we looke backe into our condition

and state before this attonement and reconciliation wrought in christ
we were before in a most wretched and miserable estate subiect to sinne vnder the curse and malediction of the law and the wrath of god quite aliants from god and from the couenant
this was the state wherein adam left vs a state that had in it nothing but wretchednes sinfulnes and corruption but nowe since the exceeding loue of god hath appeared in sending his sonne to be our reconciliation to set vs at peace with god by the vertue of his death since this true sunne of righteousnes shewed it selfe all is salued sinne death and the deuill haue no more power ouer vs for christ hath enlarged vs and set vs at liberty like prisoners at a
all this duly considered wee may sing with paul nulla new there is no condemnation to them that are in christ iesu

and henceforth wee may be ready with our apostle in th place to vp our harts in the midst of all our vvith this song of deliuerance vvhich

a better harmony then all the instruments of musique in the world
heerein is loue not that wee loued god but that god loued vs and sent his sonne to be a reconciliation for our sinnes
it followeth
beloued if god so loued vs we ought also to loue one another
we are not capable of this loue of god except we also loue one another
gods loue going first should beget and forme in vs a like loue one towardes another
heere then wee are to learne a lesson of charity
it is sayd that loue couereth a multitude of sinnes
if wee will haue many sinnes couered we must labour for this charity
wee ought to loue euen our enemies as god loued vs being his enemies but much rather our brethren and neighbours
this is not a common loue but a brotherly loue that is heere meant such a loue as peter commended to the church in his
epistle


loue one another with a pure hart feruently
where we may obserue the properties of true loue which is it must be brotherly pure and feruent
brotherly not after a common affection for brotherhood is the bond that knitteth together christians among the~selues euen as brothers without any respect or difference for we haue all but one christ one baptisme and one fayth so we should haue all one loue
pure it must be without faining without glozing without hipocrisie
for many call their neighbours brethren and friends and yet will not stick priuily and secretly to vndermine them
it must be feruent there is heate in true loue as there is fire in iealousie
vvhere this heate is it will make thee tender thy friend so deerely as that thou wilt not stick to lay downe thy life for him as christ laide downe his life for the brethren

if you will knowne the excellencie of this loue peruse at your leasure the
of the first to the corinthians there you may see the wonderfull effects of it
no vertue in the worlde brancheth it selfe into so many strange operations of godlines it will be a spectacle worth the looking on to behold vpon one stalke so many fruites growing

of infinite varieties
it suffereth long it is bountifull it enuieth not it boastes not it selfe it is not puffed vp it disdayneth not it is not prouoked to anger it reioyeeth not in iniquitie it suffereth all thinges it beleeueth all thinges it neuer falls away

end with this one note if you will be resolued that this loue is in you wherof we speake you shal principally know it by this one fruite among many
you will so loue one another that you wil wholely imploy your endeuours to doe good one to another and not euill all the dayes of our lyues
you will forget and forgiue all iniuries and trespasses committed for his sake who forgiueth you your great trespasses your sinnes a greater debt then vvas forgiuen to the mercilesse debter
we cannot come neerer to god than in the resemblance of this loue iohn proues it if thou loue not thy brother whom thou hast seene how shouldst thou loue god whom thou hast not seene

thou sinnest ten thousand times more against god than thy neighbour can trespasse

against thee yet he forgiues thee all and canst not thou forgiue thy brother some can soone shift of the matter by aunswering it thus
will forgiue him but ile neuer forget him
he shall come to my pater noster but neuer to my creede

god vvill reaunswere such in the same measure
thou shalt come to my presence where thou shalt see me and my holy angels and all the holy company of heauen in that honorable consistory when quick and

dead shall be iudged but thou shalt be debarred from that holy society thou shalt not rest vpon my holy mountaine
thus you haue seene god louing vs and manifesting the same his loue in sending vs his sonne to reconcile vs you haue seene how tender hee is ouer vs how gracious in louing vs more then that howe carefull to manifest his loue in sending vs his onely sonne to reconcile vs and lastly what he requireth of vs in liew of this his carefulnes which is that he louing vs we should also loue one another

god is the first that inuiteth and the last that forsaketh neuer leauing but first left

and euer offering till he be refused
hee still spreadeth his armes like as the cherubins doe their wings
let vs yeelde to his embracings least when wee would he will not and so wee seeke the blessing with esau too late and cannot preuaile though we shedde many teares
and so end this as began to the end that if you be so dull of hearing as that you haue forgotten the sum of all that hath beene deliuered yet at least you may remember the burthen of the song
heerein is loue not that we loued god but that god loued vs and sent his sonne to be a reconciliation for our sinnes
beloued if god so loued vs we ought also to loue one another

dauid being the last and least of all his father house being despised of his owne brethren persecuted by saule and vtterly reiected of the iewes dooth notwithstanding obtaine the kingdome to iustifie the trueth of that scripture
there is no regard of persons with god but in all places and among all nations who so feareth him and worketh righteousnes shall be accepted
and agayne god hath chosen the vile things of the world to confound the honourable

and the virgins song was this
god hath put downe the mighty from their seates and hath exalted the humble and meeke

dauid being the yongest sonne of ishay and of smallest reckoning is taken from

the and crowned a king from guiding sheepe in bethleem to gouerne a

mighty nation in israel
so god alone numbreth wayeth deuideth
hee measureth seasons times and yeares hee setteth vp kings and putteth downe kings at his pleasure as wee reade in the
of dan

the very co~sideration of which kindnes and exceeding fauour of the lord caused dauid to pen this psalme to testifie thereby his thankfulnes
and this is briefely the substance of this psalme
and yet is this but a litterall construction you must knowe that another misticall matter and of greater import is heere deliuered
in the person of dauid christ our lord is most liuely set forth
who being the king of glory the very sonne of god heire and lord of all things was notwithstanding reiected of the iewes among whom hee was borne he came among his owne and his owne receaued him not

but maugre the malice of the deuill and his instruments flesh and blood could not preuaile
herod and all the wayting for

of the people of the iewes could not ouerthrow christ and his kingdome nay they rather ouerthrow themselues
hee is neuerthelesse exalted his enemies quite confounded yea hee hath crushed them with a scepter of iron and broken them in peeces like a potters vessell
to make the tyrantes of the vvorlde to knovve how vayne a thing it is to band themselues against the lord and agaynst his annoynted

the carefull consideration heere of gladded the hart of dauid more then the stablishment of his owne throane
yea it filled him vvith such vnspeakeable ioy when once the spyrite of god had taught him that christ shoulde come from hys loynes to be a prince to his people and to gouerne them vvith righteous iudgements for euer and howe hee alone must make his enemies his say it so reioyced him that hee could not choose but sing tryumphantly to the lord
the right hand of the lorde is exalted the right hand of the lorde bringeth mightie thinges to passe
the stone which the builders refused is become the in the corner
and so in a

heauenly kinde of meditation he contieth the same note to the words of my text proclayming as it were a new to the lord which should religiously be obserued throughout ensuing posterities euen to a thousand generations
this is the day which the lord hath made
let vs reioyce and be glad in it
this text needes no curious diuision for the words deuide themselues
this is the day there is the prophets proclamation
which the lord hath made there is the author from whom it is sent
let vs reioyce
there is the celebration of it
this is the day
dauid beeing endued with the spirit of prophecie could tell that christ shoulde come in the flesh as could the patriarchs and all the holy men before him

and least a matter of so great tydinges should by the malice of sathan or by the practise of bloody tyrants be lapt vp in obscurity both our prophet heere and all the rest did in all ages record the same in sundry places of scripture as well to chalenge

it from forgetfulnes and obliuion as also to take away all excuse from the vnbeleeuing iewes who if they had not beene altogether giuen ouer to a reprobate sence they must of necessity haue acknowledged christ since he was so liuely poynted at by so many prophecies throughout the whole scripture
moses in the
of genesis told it plainly or rather god himselfe by moses speaketh that the seede of the woman shoulde breake the serpents head

zachary telleth sion and ierusalem that her king was comming he commeth poore ryding vpon an asse christ himselfe speaking of abrahams testimony sayth abraham sawe my dayes and reioyced
as a lambe before the shearer so opened he not his mouth
and diuers other testimonies whereof the scriptures are plentifull
dauid as if hee had seene all prophecies sealed vp speaketh in this place of christes day as it were as if he had beene already in the world
this is the day
blessed is hee that commeth in the name of the lord
for sions sake will not hold my tongue for ierusalems sake will not rest till the righteousnes thereof breake forth as the light
what was that lampe light but christ all the law and the prophets did presignify to the world that christ should come euen to the time that the angell appeared to the shepheards and bad them goe see him whom all the world desired to behold
so that we may preach to our selues as christ did to the iewes
in our eares this day are all these scriptures fulfilled
this is the day
this proclamation is very sutable to that in the second of luke beholde bring you of great ioy which shall bee to all flesh that vnto you this day is borne a sauiour
it was indeed tydings of the greatest ioy that might come into the world for then was the world redeemed from her olde silence
then began the true sonne of righteousnes to appeare who alone was able to expell all the clowdy mists of ignorance
what greater ioy can be then for the prisoner to heare of liberty the sicke of his health the sinner of his saluation

in the comming of christ it is to be obserued that god sent his angel he did not

vse the ministerie of man to publish thys which shewes the dignity thereof
this angell was accompanied with heauenly souldiours who so soone as these tydings were published began to sing glory to god on high
peace on earth
good will towards men
three notable wonders wrought in one day
the first part of this heauenly song noteth that the benefite of christes incarnation was not in earth onely but in heauen also and therefore as there was peace on earth so there was glory in heauen among the angels

peace on earth this sheweth that came as a medratour to make peace betweene god and vs good will towards men to shew that as hee was fons charitatis the fountaine of charitie so he would worke loue and charitie among men
what day coulde bring foorth greater matters and therefore wee haue to sing with dauid this is the

the day of our creation is in no sort to be co~pared to this day of our redemption
gods mercy appeared in making vs but his

greater mercy in sauing vs before thys day wee were in a state most miserable vnder the curse wherein adam left vs vnder wretchednes vnder sinne the curse of the lawe and dominion of the deuill
but nowe that christ hath appeared hell is conquered sathan confounded sin put to flight and heauen set open to all beleeuers
so is it verified heauines may indure for a night but ioy commeth in the morning our comming in hath been with teares but our returne to sion is with euerlasting ioy vppon our heads
the first adam brought into the worlde darknes fearefulnes and sorrowe but the last adam brought comfort light fulnes
all is changed in our seconde adam mortalitie to immortalitie mourning to mirth misery to felicitie sadnes to solace now is the sinner iustified the law discharged the dead reuiued and the deuill vanquished according to his mighty power who hath subdued all things vnto himselfe

the iubilee yeere to the israelites vvas not halfe so welcome as this day ought to

be to vs when that yeere came it brought with it freedome and releasing of debts thys day and time this acceptable yeere of christ hath brought vnto vs a greater freedome euen our soules freedome a greater releasing of debts our sinnes for vvee owe vnto god more than the cruel debter not ten thousand talents but ten thousand times tenne thousand talents
neyther was the day of theyr deliuerance from pharao halfe so acceptable vnto them as this day of our deliuerance is to vs
for wee are set free from our spyrituall pharao the deuill
as moses sayd to the israelites remember this day so say remember this day for it is the day of our deliuerance the day of our redemption the acceptable day of the lord
this is a day wherein light first appeared to the gentiles euen to vs that were aliants from god yet to vs hath the light appeared according to symeons saying a light to lighten the gentiles

we that once were not a people are now become a people wee are made through christ to bee the sonnes of the liuing god

for to the israelites pertained the adoption and the glory and the couenaunt giuing of the law and the seruice of god and the promises of whom are the fathers and of whom concerning the flesh christ came
rom

a whole sea of matter is heere laid open to mee if woulde at large discourse of the inestimable good deriued vnto vs by christes birth but the time will not permit this little that hath beene spoken may carry you to the consideration of all the rest
as a certaine geometrician finding hercules foote vppon olympus by that one foote drewe the proportion of the whole body so by this little beeing but as it were a foote in respect of the body of the matter included you may conceiue vvhat might further be amplified in this poynt the absolute fulnesse whereof wee cannot possibly be able to comprehend

onely let vs consider that as at this tyme god sent his sonne to be our sauiour
hee hath giuen vs him and all things with him so that we may nowe say with the apostle saint paule all is ours the world and the creatures thinges present and things to come

all is ours and wee are christes and christ is god
it followeth let vs reioyce
abraham seeing christes daies a farre of reioyced and yet hee was before christ thrice generations how may wee reioyce that liue to those daies alreadie determined neyther abraham nor the patriarchs nor all the prophets coulde say as we can they coulde say no more but christ shall come vvee can say he is come
blessed are the eyes that see the thinges that you see and the eares that heare the thinges that you heare
vvhere it appeareth vvee are rather blessed than all that vvere before christ
the kinges of the earth haue desired to see that which you see
all that vvere before christ sawe but a glymse of that lyght the fulnesse whereof wee nowe behold like the sunne in his strength
wee haue seene the righteousnes of sion breake out like the light and the saluation thereof as a burning lampe
thus haue we a greater priuiledge than the keysars and mighty monarchs might be suffered to enioy
for vs were these better things reserued euen we that now lyue in the time of the glorious kingdome of christ haue obtayned this so rich prerogatiue all to shew foorth the greatnes of our felicitie
great cause haue we then to reioyce
as the babe sprang in elizabeths wombe so shoulde our harts spring within our bodies for ioy of the presence of christ
if annah reioyced for that god gaue her a sonne and so tooke away the rebuke of her barrennes much more cause haue wee to reioyce that god hath giuen vs his sonne to be borne for vs whereby our barrennes of fayth is taken away and vvee are made fruitefull in the workes of righteousnesse

if iephtah his daughter went out vvith tymbrels to welcome home her father how may we prepare to welcome a greater then iephtah nay a greater then salomon
how should we prepare our minslrelsie to welcome home thys victorious lyon of the trybe of iuda since by him we do returne

in victorie and may tryumph as iephtha did not ouer a sew gybeonits but ouer many millions of spirituall aduersaries sin death and hell this worlde and the lusts thereof
wee haue then cause to reioyce and to prepare our musicall instruments
vvee should say with dauid awake vp lute and harpe awake vp my glory my selfe will awake right early
if dauid daunced before the ark which was but a testimony a signe of gods presence how would dauid haue daunced skypt and trypt it if he had liued to see his lord walking vppon the earth as his apostles did what should more say surely this is all can say if this loue of christ this true reioycing were planted in you you would carry lesse loue to the world then you do
neyther the loue of riches nor the loue of honour nor the loue of long life no wealth no friendes no treasure shoulde weare it the gayning of tenne thousande worlds should not be able to draw vs from christ

symeon was wearie of the world vvhen

once hee had founde christ nowe let mee die saith he as if he should say now haue had the fruition of the greatest blessing a greater treasure then this the worlde cannot afford me for mine eyes haue seene my saluation
and so haue our eyes seene the same saluation wee should therefore loue the world no more than simeon did
count all things but losse saith paul in respect of the excellent knowledge of my lorde yea very

and in the eyght to the romaines hee concludeth with a sweete protestation saying neyther death nor life nor angells nor nor height nor depth nor things present nor thinges to come nor any creature shall be able to separate mee from the loue of god which is in christ iesus our lord
oh that now among vs might be found some such like simeon or like paul or like dauid in his psalmes and elswhere euer sending foorth plentifull testimonies of his reioycing in christ
let vs reioyce
this reioycing is not a matter so soone practized as many conceiue it to be
euerie man will be ready to say wee doe reioyce and wee are right glad of thys day of the lorde
and as a signe of our reioycing wee are willing to celebrate not thys day onely but euen this whole feast in remembrance of our lord
and to this purpose wee deck our houses and our streetes our temples vvith boughes like them that strewed branches in the way where christ should come and crying hosanna before him as hee rid to lerusalem
and we with mouth and hart are readie to cry hosanna in like sort blessed is he that commeth is the name of the lord
all this beloued wee may doe and yet come short of the true
it is not in euery man power to reioyce and therefore dauid saith blessed are the people that can

and to shewe who they are that can so reioyce it is added they the light of thy cou continually in thy nesse shall they exalt
their hearts are euer indyting good matters

and theyr tongues are as the pennes of readie writers freely and cheerefully to tell out the goodnes of the lord
they wil not hide the mercies of the lord from theyr children yea to the generation to come will they shewe the prayses of the lord and the wonderfull acts that he hath doone
hence we may learne the manner of true reioycing
wee should be euer meditating vpon the lords mercies and wee shoulde publish them to our chyldren
if it vvere possible we should make it knowne to the whole world what god hath done for our soules
this should bee our continuall exercise not for a day or a month or a yeere but for euer
infinitely happy were wee if we could thus reioyce
but alas our reioycing is in euill wee reioyce not in christ or if we doe reioyce it is but an interim a starting ioy a temporarie and a ioy of no continuance like a buble on the water which dies while it swells

as long as my text runnes or vvhyle you are in the church and do heare christ spoken of you remember him and can

breathe out a short like a schollers grace but no sooner shall you get home to your houses and a fayre payre of cardes or tables throwne vpon the table but all is forgotten the price of our redemption forgotten yea christ himselfe forgotten so dooth a little vanitie like a dampe soone extinguish all the lights of godlines
knowe you would be loath to bee thus censured doe but aske your selues your consciences and they shall tell you whether misdeeme or not
your comming hether nowe commend the simplest that sits among vs in gods house will seeme to present himselfe before the lorde as a sacrifice of thanksgiuing for this great benefit in christ begun to be wrought as vppon this day the ioyfull day of christes incarnation

but thou must know that god requireth no temporary but a continuall sacrifycing of thy selfe a daily presenting of thy christian duties
vvhat is become of you or where are you bestowed all the yere after the church is now ful but a few sabbaths hence scarce the fourth person wilbe found

in this place
heere one and there one like the in the vintage
what doth this argue but that wee celebrate this feast rather for custome than for conscience
thys is called a time of feasting and a time of reioycing and a tyme of merriemaking and so it ought to bee so it bee doone in the lord
but wee greatly prophane the same in bestowing it wholy vpon our lusts in ryoting reuelling and roysting in dycing and carding and in pampering vp our bodies too much with the of gods creatures
all such reioycing is euill
you seemed once thys day as lampes burning in the sanctuary and novve you seeme to haue neyther oyle nor light at all
nowe no lampes but lumpes of sinfulnesse and the earth groneth vnder the massy weight of such a burden

if the prophane iewes should come into your houses and to your tauees and there looke vpon your disorders
finding you not trausing the scriptures nor reading the lawe and the prophers nay all of

you otherwise exercised wholy deuoted to sinsul vanitie some at cardes some at dice swearing and forswearing others carowsing and quing powring in wine strong drinke without measure as if theyr were giuen them to no other purpose
and hee is the iolliest fellowe that can drink his companion vnder the boord
as if they meant to make themselues famous in this as the thought to make themselues famous in another respect
among them hee was reputed the brauest gentleman that had committed the bloodiest
such forget esayes woe in the thirde of his prophecie



verses
hath hell inlarged it selfe and hath opened his mouth without measure
that this one sentence of terrour were ingrauen in the tables of our hearts or inrolled in lead or in stone for euer
this one sentence of the seuerity of gods iustice against such would make vs beware to transgresse and how to carry our selues in a greater measure of sobrietie

surely great and beioynd measure intollerable

is the vanitie of sinfull men in thys behalfe for we dishonour god in our bodies where we should glorifie him
god hath made vs christian men but we shewe our selues no men but beasts among men
hee that loueth father or mother more then me saith christ is not worthy of me
we do worse we loue our follies our vanities and our pastimes more then god
some are giuen to one vanitie some to another as all sinnes are not found in one and yet in one are many founde and without some and all are in vs and among vs all
our true reioycing were rather this to bestow the time in meditation stil to praise god for this rich treasure to penne godlie songs and psalmes of thankfulnes like dauid to be deuising with micah what wee should giue vnto the lord for that which he hath giuen vs wee hang our houses with holies and greene boughes but we our selues should rather be holy boughes euen trees of righteousnes as we are called by esay

if wee will needes feast let vs yet beware of the abuses in feasting
iob can best counsaile

vs heerein
we reade in the
chapter of his booke that when his sonnes and daughters had made an end of banquetting in theyr houses euery one his day hee like a carefull father sent for them and sanctified them and sacrificed for them
and this did iob euery day for he feared his sonnes had blasphemed god in theyr harts
iob doubted that his children had committed many slips and that they carried not themselues in such a sobriety as was required in those holy feasts and therefore hee did both send for them and sacrificed for them
parents ouer their children and maisters ouer their housholds should be armed with like godly iealousie
for if this religious care were had both of our selues and ours fewer offences would be committed or at least beeing committed they would bee soone salued by prayer and sanctisication as iob did

for this example is pend and registred for our good and for our imitation that in all our feastings and meetings and wee should remember our

selues pray that god would pardon our corruptions and prophane carriage of our selues in time of our feasting
for it is an hard and difficult matter at such times to keepe our selues so cleare but some corruption or other will cling vnto vs sinnes then are soonest swallowed lyke the dainty morsells that passe downe our throates and so sinne goes downe as fast and is deuoured with pleasure like the apple that eue tasted
the pleasantnes of it to the eye and the toothsomnes of it to the mouth pricked forward her desire and so in eating shee fell and so in eating vvee fall
and therefore it is sayde woe to the full for the full are apt to sorget god
the deuill neuer fell to tempting till the houre of eating came
and when hunger called for meate hee also called for his temptations and presented before them the most delicious meate such as hee well knewe was fitting to theyr humours

it behooueth vs therefore especiallie to beware howe wee feast not for that feasting

in it selfe is euill nay it is a thing commended and commaunded in scripture as the feastes of tabernacles and the feastes of sabaoths and iubilees and new moones
and christ wrought his first miracle at a feast
the abuse it is that wee speake of which often is committed in our feastinges
for in our pleasures the deuill hath hidde hys snares and therfore a godly man giues this prouiso or caueat
handle your pleasures sayeth hee as you handle bees that is first take out the sting and after you may play with them without harme
it may be that my sonnes haue sinned and blasphemed god in their harts
so let vs say of our selues as iob spake of his sonnes it may be in this tyme of our banquetting we haue sinned and blasphemed

it may be our good cheere and delicious fare and our and our dauncing and our reuelling and our other vanities haue made vs forgette god

and our selues and forget christ who is the the cause and author of our meeting at this time
now then that haue shewed you the difference betweene the true reioycing and the false aduise your selues which you will follow
as iosuah said at his farewell when hee was to be gathered to his people to goe the way of all the worlde
now saith hee choose you whether you will serue the gods of the heathen or serue the lord
so say whether you will serue your lustes or serue god
if god be god serue him if baal be god serue him
eyther sticke to vanity or sticke to god
god hath not redeemed you to sinne any more but that you should subdue and vtterly kill the whole body of sinne for it is said be ye holy as am holy
but know that if you runne on in your vanities you runne from god who hath created you and from christ who hath redeemed you and from the spirit of god by whom you are sealed

if wee sinne wilfully nowe after we haue receaued the knowledge of the truth there

remaineth no more sacrifice for sinne but a fearefull looking for of iudgement and

violent fire which shall deuoure the aduersarie

full of dreadfulnes is that in the
of the same author to the heb
it is impossible that they which were once lightned and haue tasted of the heauenly gift and were made pertakers of the holy ghost haue tasted of the good worde of god and the powers of the world to come if they fall

away should be renued againe by repentance seeing they crucifie the sonne of god and make a mock of him
but beloued wee haue perswaded our selues better things of you and things that accompanie saluation though wee thus speake
god forbid that should thinke that all the good seede of the worde so plentifully sowed in your harts now the space of forty yeares should fall to the ground in vaine

paul hath not so planted you apollo watred you in vaine that you should still proue faithlesse and barren but there must needes be in you some increasing in knowledge some growing in religion some

prositing in vnderstanding
the thornes choake not all nor doe the birds deuoure vp all nor is all fallen vpon stony ground to hinder the growth of the word
and yet if all this should be so there is hope neuerthelesse in the fourth part it beeing the better part and the fructifying part will make amendes for all the rest yeelding increase an hundred fold like the seede of isaac
licet pars minima sit

thou shalt not walke about with tales among my people
god hath made vs principally and before all thinges to glorifie him and serue him in holines all the daies of our sinfull pylgrimage he hath also for a secondarie purpose created vs euen to be helpfull and seruiceable one to another

as we must be especially carefull howe wee runne into those sinnes that are offensiue to the maiestie of god and doe prouoke his displeasure so must we be carefull in like manner howe wee commit such offences and trespasses agaynst our brethren or whereby wee may incurre their hatred and displeasure
god dooth looke into our carriage behauior among our selues that we offend not one another that so being created after the similitude of god in holines wee might also bee profited

in holding on our course in the same holines by performing all christian duties both towards god and man
the vvhole duty of a christian man consists but in two points viz in holines towards god and in righteousnes towards man aunsvverable to that short diuision made by our sauiour
thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy hart
and thy neighbour as thy selfe
the one dooth necessarily imply the other and they cannot be seperated for iohn prooues it
if thou loue not thy brother whom thou hast seene howe canst thou loue god whom thou hast not seene of the latter onely am to speake in this place and of that but in a particularity neither as my text doth leade me
this portion of scripture nowe to bee handled is one of the branches of the commandements in the second table inforcing righteousnes towards man

it is one of the edges of that more than one edged sword to cut in sunder the very of false
for a false tale is a false testimony and the secret accusing of our neighbours by bad reports

whereby their name and fame may be impeached is a species or kind of false witnes bearing and it is such a trespasse as doth quite ouerthrow the peaceable state of all christian societies
thou shalt not walke about with tales among my people
god in this place vseth two principall arguments to inforce this co~maundement
the one taken fro the person of our selues in the word thou and the other from the person of god in the word shalt
thou being as thou art my creature the workmanship of my hands whom haue formed and fashioned out of the clay and so by breathing into thee breath of life did make thee a lyuing soule
thou who art but vile earth very corruption and rottennes thou shalt not
the carefull remembrance of our selues in a dutifull remorce is a matter of such force that it is able to batter or at least to mollifie the most obdurate heart of anie christian and to stirre him vp to a sincere obedience toward god his creatour

nature it selfe hath stampt a reuerent impression euen in the vnreasonable creatures

working a dutifulnes in them towards their benefactours
esay prooues it to reprooue men that somtimes shew the~selues worse then beasts
the oxe knoweth his owner and the asse his maisters crib yet israel knoweth not me
my people forgotten him that made them
though it were practised by a prophane man yet was it a practise of christianity that which we read of phillip king of macedon hee caused this lesson of mortality to bee euery morning sounded at his dore memento philippe te esse hominem
this lesson did hee learne euen in the morning in the beginning of the day least his kingly tytles and honours and magnificence might make him forget him selfe as coruinus forgot his name
least hee might vvaxe insolent and proude against god lyke nabuchadnezer when hee ietted it in his royall pallace at babell

or like alexander sonne to this king phillippe who after this farre vnlyke his father being rapt away with the high conceite of honour termed himselfe a god
to verifie that which hath beene long agoe

by the propheticall king man being in honour may be compared to the beasts that perrish
this consideration of a mans selfe it is the very eye of the soule vvhereby shee looketh and pryeth into her vvhole estate
it is the very doore of humility and where it is soundly planted in any religious christian it so and inuesteth him that he shall seeme no other than a verie liuely resemblance of christ our lord svvadled vp in cloutes and layde in a manger
this consideration was in dauid when looking first vppon hee after looked vp to god and exclaymed with a rauishing kinde of admiration
lord what is man that thou shouldst be so mindfull of him or what is this mortall generation that thou shouldst so graciously visite it
and agayne in a greater measure of humility in the two and twentieth psalm hee calles a vvorme and no man
haue saide to corruption thou art my father and to rottennes thou art my mother
moses the seruant of god and the meekest man vppon the earth thought there could be no greater argument of perswasion to draw the israelites to the true seruice of god than this we now speake of being taken from the person of man
haue chosen thee from among all nations vnder heauen to be a peculier people to my selfe therefore thou shalt obserue all my ordinances to doe them and againe in the
of exodus thou art my first borne
therefore looke that thou obserue my commaundements
a certaine deuoute man was woont to thanke god for three things first for that god had made him a reasonable creature not a beast

for making him a man and not a woman

for making him a christian man
where this or the like co~sideration goeth before there sinne and sathan following after can no more preuaile against thee than the philistines could against sampson whe he brake the cords

say if wee doe but consider what wee are how weake and corruptible we are and what great thinges notwithstanding god

hath done for vs in making vs of nothing giuing vs the whole worlde to commaund and the creatures in it the sunne to shine to vs the fire to warme vs the earth to beare vs beastes fowles and fishes to feede vs these and a thousand times greater things than these beeing duly considered must needes produce in vs an effectuall operation for performance of this righteousnes we speake of
god being so mindful of vs should force vs to bee mindfull of him in the carefull practise of his commaundementes
and thus much for the first argument drawne from the person of our selues
the second argument is taken from the person of god noted in the word shalt not
before god had published the commandements he pressed them with this speciall charge
am lord that brought thee out of the land of aegipt wherein thou wast a staanger
yeares
therefore bee carefull to doe my commandements
and the same againe is repeated in the second of leuit
am the lord who brought thee

twice seauen times these wordes are repeated

in the nineteenth of leuitticus am the lorde
yee shall not turne to ills am the lorde
yee shall not steale nor doe wrong to your neighbours am the lord thou shalt not walke about with tales among my people am the lord
the originall vvord is iehouah which signifieth the verie essence of god undefined span alphabet quam colunt angeli obseruant osculatur vniuersitatis natura
thys vvorde is lefte vntranslated in scripture in respect of the maiestie thereof
saint augustine sayth that certayne wordes are not alwayes to bee translated eyther propter maiorem sanctuatem as the vvoorde and amen
or because they cannot significantlie bee translated into another tongue as osanna racha
the maiesticall name of god being examined in the weights of the sanctuarie it is able to strike a terrour in the hearts of them who shall violate this law
vvhen moses came to pharaoh hee came vnto him in the person of god and said thus saith the lord
exod
and the booke of god in many places vseth the name of god as a speciall motiue to drawe men to obedience deus exercituum hee that sitteth betweene the cherubines hee that turneth the floods into a wildernes and dryeth vp the hee that sittes amidst the golden candlestickes arayed in a golden garment downe to the feet and girt about the pappes with a golden girdle
whose head and hayre were white as wooll and his eyes a flaming fire
reuel

and againe he that hath the sword with two edges

am he that hath celsitudine dignitatis
rectitudine
magnitudine potestatis fortitudine firmitatis
vnconquerable truth it selfe power it selfe immutable

am he who haue condicionem liberiorem
dilectionem vberiorem
praelationem superiorem
and therfore you are to respect my laws as if hee should haue sayde all these circumstances of maiestie doe euidently declare and clearely prooue to the eyes and eares of all the world that am the lorde iehouah
am god alone and there is no other besides me
therefore thou shalt not violate any of my lawes nor shalt thou transgresse in the least of my commandements
thou shalt not walke about with tales among my people
and thus much briefely for the second argument taken from the person of god
hauing thus proceeded by these two motiues to the charge of this co~maundement he comes in order to the substance or matter of the same
thou shalt not goe about with tales

the principall matter heere forbidden by expresse words in this commandement is the carrying of tales
there are many sorts of passengers that doe intercourse betweene man man
princes haue their embassadours that eyther doe denounce open warre and hostility or else doe intreate for peace

noble men haue their attedants and followers

that post it vpon their maisters affaires in executing theyr commaundements
ministers are gods messengers to preach good tydings the glad tydinges of the gospell thereby to reconcile sinners vnto god through the word of reconciliation
merchants haue theyr factours on thys side and beyond the seas which transport newes and other matter concerning theyr traffique priuate men haue some or other theyr friendes to carry theyr minde in theyr desires whether it be by mouth or by letter to such as they would acquaint with theyr busines beeing separated by distance of place
none of these are charged in this commaundement it concernes them not and yet they are such as carry and
they are a kinde of people that passe repasse still going and returning and walking about from man to man and from house to house and from citty to citty euen through the world

no post no passenger no trauailer nor no embassadour in the world euer carried

about him a larger commission or pasport then these we speake of nay whom god especially noteth by expresse name those that walk about with tales among the people
princes embassadours are necessarie instruments and without such exercising theyr places and offices in all dutifull dilligence fidelity the state of kingdoms can not be maintained
noble men merchants ministers priuate men are special members of the body politick they may lawfully vse others theyr followers to walke about for the executing effecting of their honest desires but these are vtterly to be condemned for that they run before they be sent and doe deuise all the meanes they can to breed dislention and hatred betweene men
where the bee drawes forth honny these like spyders suck out poyson and with the same as by a generall contagion do seeke to infect the whole world

theyr names disery their natures
they are called in this place walkers about beeing they trouble and others with vnnecessary busines
no

body bids them walke and yet they walke
sathans instruments are like sathan for in the second of iob when god asked him where hee had beene his aunswere vvas
come from the world to and fro walking in it
and so heere the suborned by sathan hee comes from the worlde to and fro and walking in it

the deuill is the and these be his souldiours ee walkes in his

greater circuite and these in the lesser circuit they runne to and fro and there and euery where filling the court ce and country
they walk from dore to and from house to house begging for the the slarued beg for bread
there is no name in scripture giuen to the deuill but it may bee as sly giuen to these
he is called a lyar so are they hee is called an accusar· so are they hee is called an aduersary so are they for they are like ismaell who was against all
he in saint peters epistle is called a deuourer and so are they

note well saint peter his description of

sathan and see if they be not sathans
saint peter saith he goeth about as the keeper rayles in his deere so the deuill makes his raile about vs to the end we may not escape him
and euen so do goe about as saint paul hath testifyed of them beeing they learn to goe about from house to house yea they are not onely idle but also pratlers speaking things that are not comly

tim


the second property of sathan is to roare in his walke hee goeth about like a roaring lyon and so dooth the roare as he walkes like a lion but indeed the most part of them are lyonesses
they spare no words that may furnish the matter before they will goe away vnheard they wil make a double and treble repetion of that they speake
thirdly peter saith the deuill seekes as he goeth so doe they they are as glad of a tale by the end as a fryer of a pudding
at last comes in to deuoure seeking who he may deuoure there he ends shewing that to deuoure is his purpose and so to deuoure is their purpose

the deuill hath a deepe swallowe and

therefore he is called diabolos quasi duo bols he makes but two morsels of a man in that respect hee may well be called a deuourer
no lesse deuourer is the
for salomon the only experimented man of the world he that co~sidered of al things considered this also among rest

there is a generation saith hee of people

whose teeth are as swordes and theyr chawes as kniues to eate vp the afflicted out of the earth and the poore fro among men
other men carry their swordes by theyr sides but these carry them in their mouthes because they may draw them forth at their pleasure
these people are worse then crowes for they feede but vpon dead carkasses but these carriers of tales feede vpon them that are aliue
like those who the cospographers speake of such as eate mans flesh
to cut vp the anatomy to embowel it throughly for a cleerer viewe to what shall liken this generation they are like a moath as a moath eates a hole in cloath so these eate holes in euery mans coate
to what shal liken this generation they are like to the camelion which feedes onelie vpon the ayre and so these tale guestes fe vppon the ayre that is the breath of men and yet sometimes they draw soorth from the kchm

to what againe may liken this generation the is like an archer men are his markes and euill reports are his arrowes and therefore saith the prophet they bende theyr tongues like bowes to shoote out lyes
dauid saith the angels pitch theyr campes about them that serue god deliuereth them
but wee may say pitch their of lyes rumors and slaunders about them that feare god and deuoureth them
these wicked ismaelites who oppose themselues against all the worlde are by so much the more odious for that theyr chattering tongues offending all mens eares with a more then talkeatiuenes can neuer come to a period till they haue runne themselues cleane out of breath as they haue runne out of credite

vvhen there shall be no men vpon the

earth then shall the slaunderer cease from slaundering

hell and the are much alike

the one is neuer satisfied with sinners the other with slaunders
there is no way to bee rid of a slaunderer but eyther by cutting out his tongue that though he can deuise and heare yet he cannot vtter what hee hath heard or deuised
or else by shutting him out of all companie that he might neyther heare nor see
for as it was permitted to abraham to see the smoake of sodom but lot might not be to see it so hee that can make a vse of what is done may be permitted to heare and see and to pry into the actions of men but others may not for that they are like spyders which sucke vp nothing but poyson euen out of the most wholesome hearbes that are
as the charitable labour to breed peace and good wil among men so these straine their endeuours to sette men together by the eares

they are alwaies sowing the seed of deuision betwixt one another as the enuious

man sowed ta~res in the husbandmans field while he slept
when men are sleeping then bee these waking and walking about like nightcrowes being ashamed the day should discouer them because theyr deedes are euill
these messengers of sathan as they shew themselues vigilant and diligent so are they pollitick withall and full of craft like theyr the deuill
for when they deliuer any matter of obloquy and manifest vntruth they indent couenaunt with the partie to whom they discouer it that hee shall not bewray them or make them the authors of the report
and all to blinde the truth and to stop all the meanes whereby it may be found out
if men woulde be aduised to take heede howe they entertaine such idle circumcelians or if they did but publish their names to the world much contention and hatred would be slopped

the is as much in some respects to be co~demned as the
for many are light of hearing and are apt to receiue with open eares is told them by whisperers and flatterers and

the like
as the athenians gaue themselues to heare newes so doe these to heare tales
micah was not halfe so willing to entertaine a leuit as a number be nowe to entertaine
others be so light of credit that whatsoeuer they heare told that they beleeue and do so beleeue the first tale that they wil not beleeue the second and these are homines altera tantum parte auriti
and they deserue to haue but one eare that will not heare with both
a third sort there is which is worst of all some are so wayward and so froward that they wil neuer or very hardly be reconciled after they haue beene once prepossest with sinister reports
and this varietie of humors in men spring all from the or from the who cannot in anie wise brooke that peace should rest among men
when the lord had determined achabs fall a spirit came foorth and stoode before the lord and said will goe foorth and bee a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets

so the he also stands vp like

a speedie messenger he like a lying spyrit possesseth both the mouthes and harts of all men to make them fall
if god should make vs see our countrey dispeopled our citties ransacked and our houses spoyled as god graunt our eyes may neuer see such ruines wee might say the enemy hath been here
so when wee see our peace become confusion our vnitie turned to enuy our good lyking turned to froward grudging when friends become foes and neighbours aduersaries one to another vvee may well say the or the slaunderer or the hath beene heere
thus are weeds sprung vp where grapes should haue beene planted
but why goe about to wash a negro vvho vvill still be blacke though hee were washt vvith all the sope of the gospel
doe but like him that purgeth and scoures a stinking channel which the more it is stirred the worse it sauours
hee is yet as to as before and to returne me aslaunder for this his anatomy
scto pro certo quod si cum stercore certo uinco seu vincor semper maculor
vvell though hee be in this place but controlled the slying booke which zachane speakes of in his fift chapter the length whereof was twentie cubits the breadth tenne cubites euen the booke that containes the curses of the wicked shall more largelie decypher him heereafter in his full proportion
for enery one that slaundereth shall be cut off as well on this side as on that
and euery one that telleth tales shall be cut off as well on this side as on that
and it shall bee brought foorth and it shall enter into the house of the sunderer and him that telleth tales and him that delighteth to hatch lyes
and it shall remaine in the midst thereof and it shall consume it with the tymber thereof and the stones thereof

thus as the accuseth others so haue accused him and blazed him to the worlde that yee may the rather beware of him and shunne him nowe you know him
and when he shal intrude into

your company or presume to tread within your houses ye may shut the doore against him and be ready to giue him the like entertainement as christ did to the deuil whe he said auoyde sathan so you may say to this messenger of sathan auoyde taleteller come not at mee
thou art the breeder of my trouble and the authour of my confusion
thou commest as a friend ful of but know thee to be a fiende and a mortall foe to me and mine
therefore defie thee and do debar thee from my societie for euer
now then in time be warned all ye that haue lent diligent eares to such beware how you pertake with theyr sinnes
as no theefe woulde presume to steale without a receauer so no will presume to bring a tale without a receauer
therefore as christ warned his disciples beware how yee heare so say vnto you beware how you heare
be not carryed away with euerie winde be swift to heare good things

if thou hast heard a slaunder against any let it die with thee and bee sure it shall not

burst thee

blessed is the man that hath not offended

in his tongue nor hath fallen by the word of his mouth
peters persecution and his deliuerance
epigraph acts



and when hee sawe it pleased the iewes hee proceeded further he tooke peter also
from the verse to the
sathan the accuser of our bretheren will euer stirre vp one or other to persecute the poore church of christ
he beganne with adam our graundfather euen in paradice prouoking him to eate of the forbidden siuite whereas it had beene told him before in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
hee proceeded further and procured caine to sley abell hee incensed against iacob made saul to persecute dauid sette nabucadnezar against daniell iesabell against eliah not to vpon particulars the scribes pharisces against christ herod the father against the innocents herod the sonne against iohn baptist and this herod against iames and beholde the serpents policie note in what sort he bestirres himselfe euen by seating himselfe in the hearts and consciences of great men by making kings and princes rulers his instruments for the practizing of crueltie against gods church
the mightie men of the earth vvhich ought with their authoritie that they haue from god to maintaine and stablish true religion and to vphold the church when stormes of persecution doe arise theyr handes and theyr endeuours are most forwarde in labouring to suppresse religion and the professours theirof they first lyft themselues vp against the lord against his annoynted
the second herod raged most violently against iohn baptist and against christ and this herod heere mentioned exerciseth like tyrannie against the apostles of christ
iames was alreadie slaine and so had peter beene but for the holy time of passeouer as now commeth to be considered
the text offereth these three thinges worthy our obseruation
first the captiuitie of peter
secondly his deliuerance
thirdlie his thankfulnesse
and when he saw it pleased the people
this bloody persecuting tirant did vex the church of god by killing iames with the sword by imprisoning peter thinking to dispatch him in like manner hauing no cause at all
sometimes men persecute of malice as caine did abel sometimes of enuie as esau did iacob sometimes through idolatry and for religion as nabucadnezer did the three chyldren somtimes of couetousnesse as iudas did his maister sometimes of ignorance as the iewes in putting christ to death father forgiue them they know not what they doe
but thys tyrant could yeeld no cause or reason for his impsoning of peter but this the slenderest and weakest reason of a thousand for that hee saw it pleased the people
hee did it to win the peoples fauour not caring for gods fauour
thus did herod and the same doe the wicked tyrants continually buy the fauour good lyking of their subiects with the blood of gods seruaunts
saul whe he persecuted dauid had some pretence for he feared his kingdome
the philippians in like maner had some pretence when they beate paul and sylas with rods and after cast them into prison
they trouble our citty quoth they preach ordinances that are not lawfull
demetrius had somewhat to colour the sedition and tumult raisd in their citty against paul he feared his craft would little auaile him if paules doctrine had taken place for beeing a siluer smith hee made shrines for diana
the king of babilon had some pretence when he put the three children into the fierie furnace he feared that the gods who he worshipped should be despised
the princes of zedechiah had some pretence when they put ieremie into the dungeon he weakened say they the hands of the men of warre in prophecying that their citty should bee giuen ouer into the hands of the king of babell

these pretences how colourable so euer could not excuse the in their actions they were but base subterfuges no better then coates of nettes or like to couer

the nakednes of their cause of little moment and lesse substance
yet they carried some shew of reason and with men made of the same grist might seeme to bee of force in defence of that they did
but this reason of herod for imprisoning peter is too too vaine and ridiculous onely he did it because hee sawe it pleased the people

the like we reade of pestus in the acts willing to doe the iewes a pleasure he deliuered

paul into their hands
and so pilat for feare of the iewes deliuered christ to be crucified

it skilleth much how the people are affected if the multitude be religious doe loue the word tyrants shall not dare to rage so much their tyrannous purposes howe wicked so euer shal not break out no more then the practises of the scribes pharisies could preuaile against iohn to put him openly to death because of the multitude for all the people counted iohn as a prophet
king and people all in this place ioyned together in a wicked conspiracie against peter
the people encouraged the king and the king prepares himselfe to

satisfie their desires in committing peter to close prison
a king hath a name of soueraignty hee is called rex a regendo he must gouerne and not be gouerned
but hee that should rule is heere ouerruled
the subiect commaunds the king herod plies himselfe to the humour his people
that scripture non multitudinem ad malum
wicked tyrants if they shall perceaue the people like affected to themselues will be the more imboldned in their cruelty
this herod could not abide that peter should him in his sinnes no more than the other could iohn baptist
and finding the applause of the people to concurre with his practise hee is the rather whetted on to doe wickedly

since therefore the successe and growth of religion depends so much vpon the peoples lyking or dislyking the minister of the word ought especially to labour in this that the people bewel informed in the true way be soundly taught to know god if they shall shew themselues zealous professours
though a wicked tyrant did raigne

ouer them yet should hee not preuaile to doe hurt to the children of god
it pleased the people
heere is great ods a manifest inequality one against many and many against one
the whole people oppose themselues against peter to destory him like so many philistims against sampson but as sampson brake the cords so peter brake the prison
or rather god for peter opened the prison and so hee escaped and so herods expectation was frustied the multitude of their purpose disappoynted the glory of god mightily magnisied as shall appeare in the sequell of the story
you haue heard the reason why herod tooke peter heere it followes how he vsed him where wee are first to note in a word the degrees of herods cruelty

first he tooke him or caught him which argues that he lay in waite for him before then he committed him to prison caused him to be kept with a straite guard no lesse then foure quaternions of souldiers
lastly hee purposed after the feast to put him to death that was the mark he aymed at and the drift of his endeuours
his apprehending

of him his committing him to prison his diligence in close and sure keeping him all was to murther him at last
the deuils purposes and tyrants practises are both one hee is an aduersary hee goeth about he seeketh he hee deuoureth so doe tyrants they neuer rest going about seeking watching threating till at length they haue deuoured vs mark the care that herod took to keepe peter that hee should by no meanes start from him hee would neuer haue vsed the like carefulnes in any good matter
a quaternion contayned foure souldiours so the whole make sixteene
there was a keeper before the dore of the prison and two with him betwixt whom hee lay and the rest round about him in their seuerall wards or stations this was notable diligence they meant to make sure worke

this theyr ouer vvarie circumspection was no doubt a testimonie of a guilty and distrustfull conscience
in this tyrant so many circumstances in this scripture deliuered concerning the apprehension of peter may stand in steed of so many witnesses accusing him within of wrongfull imprisonment

hee saw in him selfe that hee had no iust cause to doe it and therefore he feared that this prisoner vvould by some meanes get from him notwithstanding this so sure a watch
such was herods watchfulnes and such was peters vveakenesse that no might bee made
but least this tyrant should growe too insolent god himselfe sendeth his angell to take part vvith peter and to rescue him from herods tyrannie
dalilah did thinke she had made sampson fast enough with ropes and cords but through his strength he brake them
saul thought he had dauid sure enough when hee was in his bed but hee escaped out of his hands his vvife micholl letting him downe at a window
paule was by an earthquake deliuered out of pryson and at another time the iewes tooke counsaile to kill him they laid vvayte day and night at the gates to take him but the other put him out at a wall and him downe in a basket and so he escaped

and in this place the angell deliuereth

peter in like sort from the hands of them who sought to slay him
rather then the enemie shall insult ouer the children of god hee will worke a miracle the rather to procure their safety euen beyond all expectation
as elias was fed by a rauen at the riuers side and daniell refreshed with the pottage that abacuck brought vnto him when he lay in the lyons denne
and as ehsha compassed his aduersaries while they compassed him
so in the midst of all our afflictions god will make a way for vs escape if it bee good for vs and stand with his will
as the hills stand about ierusalem so the lord causeth a whole armie of angels to stand about vs
it followeth that night peter slept betweene two souldiours
peter is all this while in prison what dooth he in the midst of these so great extremities our text tells vs what he did
hee slept

vvhat meanes peter to sleepe in so great a daunger as if hee vvere altogether

carelesse as if hee had beene possest with a stoycall stupidity without all sence and feeling and this security or carelesnes to rest vpon him then when hee was ready to resigne vp his life euen the very night before he should be brought forth to be executed
indeede by reason of long watching before all the former time of his indurance nature might haue forced him to slumber a little but the words are he slept it was a sound sleepe that he slept
his danger so imminent his sorrowes full of terrour and fearefulnes beeing the post· maisters of death should haue beene able to keepe him waking and not to suffer the temples of his head to rest
some there are that expound this sleepe of peter to signifie not a dissolute carelesnes but a godly security confident trustfulnes in him

god commaunds vs to cast our care vppon him for he careth for vs and so peter knowing that god did care for him did cast his care vpon the lord
and therfore he mistrusting no euill suffered his body to take his repose hee knewe that god the

watchman of israell was also his watchman and so the rather might he sleepe in safety
peter had commended him selfe to his prouidence and protection hee knew his quarrell to be good if he were to die it was in the lords cause and these reasons made him sleepe so soundly
others interprete this place otherwise they hold this sleeping in peter to be an infirmity of nature and a great weakenes in him for which he was worthy reprehension then to be sleeping when hee should haue been most watchfull in attending the lords leasure and in laying hold vpon the lords mercies in working his deliuerance
god would haue him to be a spectacle of infirmity to the end wee looking into our selues should acknowledge our owne frailtie
say hee had cast all his care vppon the lord and was assured that nothing should befall him contrary to gods appointment yet should he haue beene watchfull as the angel was watchfull ouer him

the lord indeede hath promised neuer to faile vs nor forsake vs in our troubles

yet he will not haue vs to doe nothing our selues but as god worketh so must wee work with him call vpo our endeuours to further that which god will haue effected
who so falleth into a ditch prayeth to the lord to be deliuered thence yet will not seeke to raise himselfe with one of his fingers shall be sure neuer to get forth
god helpeth by meanes he that contemneth those meanes must not looke for helpe
let vs put to our endeuors if they come short gods helping hand wil be ready to yeeld a present supply
though hee had slept all the time of his imprisonment yet now being the last night before his determined execution he should haue beene watchfull he should haue beslowed this time in prayer meditation
christ rebuked the disciples for that they slept the very night before he was betrayed
peter sleepest thou couldest thou not watch one houre watch and pray least ye enter into temptation
hee came againe the
and third time and found them sleeping
peter was carelesse then for his maister and in this place he is as carelesse for himselfe lyke ionas sleeping vnder the hatches

when hee was in ieopardie of drovvning
hee was so heauy and in such a dead sleepe as we say that the angell was faine to strike him on the side before hee would awake
though peter slept the rest of gods church slept not the other apostles greeuing at his troubles and vexed in spirit at herods cruelty and his imprisonment made earnest prayer vnto god for him
where we are to note the simpathy and mutual feeling that one me~ber hath with another
peters passions wrought co~passion in the brethren and therfore they both sorrowed for him prayed for him
it greeued them to see so notable an instrument of gods glory lie in bonds
to teach vs to haue a feeling each of others calamity to bee touched with compunction in beholding our brethrens distresses and miseries

they could not helpe him out of prison nor set him free they sawe that there was no way possible for him to escape in the iudgment of man therfore they commend him vnto god praying him not to

leaue him comfortlesse nor to suffer him to be swallowed vp by the malicious cruelty of his aduersaries
they were perswaded that these sufferings of peter were inflicted vpon him by the speciall appoyntment of god for the tryall of his faith and patience and therefore they co~mitted him vnto god in their prayers as vnto a faithfull creator
prayer was made
god hath giuen vnto euery lyuing creature his weapon to defend himselfe against the enemie
to the lyon his taile to the elephant his nose to the bee his sting to the bore his tuske to the bull his hornes to the cocke his spurres to the eagle his talents to the hedgehogge his prickles to the horse his heeles· to the beare his pawes to the fish his sinnes but to man to vs that are his reasonable creatures he hath giuen one weapon more forcible then all the weapons of war that is to say prayer issuing from faith out of a pure hart
this hath beene the course of the godly in all ages when the church of god or any one member thereof hath been afflicted
there was comfort in peter though he were eue in bonds for it is said he slept that night
and there was also confidence in the congregation for they prayed for peter hoping that god would deliuer him
we can looke for nothing so long as we remaine distrustfull for fayth alone must support vs
in all troubles that shall assaile vs fayth alone must be sent forth to gaine the conquest and vntill wee be arined with this faith we are not fit to march with christ as none might goe to battell with gedeon which were timorous and fearefull
though wee seeme neuer so weake and our aduersaries neuer so strong let them be mighty and tall like the enakyms
yet if wee haue faith and doe trust in god wee shall be strong enough to saue our selues and to foyle our foes like gedeon vvith his empty pitchers

dauid hauing courage and confidence when hee tooke with him but a sling and stone feared not to encounter with goliah of gath notwithstanding that he came against him with a shield of brasse and his

speare like a weauers beame
earnest prayer was made
this argueth their feruencie and that they prayed in a feeling
be feruent in spirit sayth the apostle and it is heere practised by the

apostles they were feruent in spirit when they prayed for peter

the prayer that god accepteth must be feruent and it must be with watchfulnes perseuerance as paul to the

ephesians
euery prayer is not accepted as euery fire might not bee allowed to kindle the sacrifice onely that prayer is auaileable which faith poureth out and is presented vnto god by zeale and feruencie

the lord accepts not a colde prayer a from the teeth outward such praying or such babling rather is thus cheeked by our sauiour
this people draweth nigh vnto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their hart is far from me
as moses said vnto the people when ye offer vnto the lord ye shall offer freely so say when ye pray vnto the lord pray zealously
let your prayers be earnest lyke the apostles in this place
earnest prayer was made by the church
heere is discoursed not onely the manner of prayer but the persons also by whom it was offered it was a prayer made by the church
the prayer of the iust preuaileth much if it be feruent
and of helias prayer it is noted when he prayed for raine he prayed earnestly
the wicked mans prayer is abhominable
cayn and habell did both sacrifice vnto the lord but habels was onely accepted
to wicked sacrifices marke vvhat the lorde speaketh in esa
what haue to doe with the multitudes of your sacrifices am full of the burnt efferings of rammes and of the fatte of sed beasts
desire not the blood of bullockes nor of lambes nor of goates
when ye come to appeare before mee who required this at your handes to treade in my courts
prayer was made vnto god

this sheweth to whom we are to pray only to god
we may not with our aduersaries the papists runne to saints to seeke

succour of them
god alone must be prayed vnto for that hee alone is able to helpe vs in him dwelleth all fulnes
abraham hath forgotttn vs and israelknoweth vs not
es
the prayer thus offered of holy men in a feeling zeale and feruencie of spirit vnto god
is a sanctified prayer an acceptable prayer a prayer that pearceth the cloudes presseth vnto the presence of god and returneth not empty vnto them that poure it forth
such was the prayer of meeke moses for the israehtes against pharaoh and preuailed
such was the prayer of iehosaphat against ammon and moab and preuailed
such vvas the praver of the godlie for paul in the acts against his persecutours and preuailed
and such was the prayer of the congregation heere for peter and it likewise preuailed

such a prayer doth the lord looke for for such a prayer doth he call vpon dauid and vs in dauid in the
psalm
call vppon me in the day of tribulation and will deliuer

thee and thou shalt glorifie me
it was not the sling but the prayer of dauid that caused the stone to sincke into the of the vncircumcised philisan
and behold the angell of the lord came
see heere the powerfull effect of prayer
as the church sent soorth theyr prayers so here god sends forth his angell to execute that which they prayed for
rather then the prayer of the iust should fast god ceased not to worke peters deliuerance by a miracle
the angell smote peter on the side raysed him vp saying vp quickly and the chaynes fell off from his hands
theyr prayer found a speedy successe in a most strange and extraordinary manner
peter beyond all expectation is deliuered for a greater comfort to gods church and the greater terrour to the persecuting tyrant

so hath god his enemies in derision laughes them to scorne in theyr owne imaginatious

when they thought themselues most sure of peter euen then they finde most deceiued
herod did purpose on the next morrow to put peter to death but hee failed of his purpose as the philistims failed of sampson though he lay bound with great cords in the midst of them
so man doth purpose but god doth dispose man imagineth but god determineth all to the best for them that loue him
hence we are to learne that troubles shall happen vnto vs they bee knowne before hande are especially appointed vpon whom they shall fall so that they cannot come sooner or later vnto vs nor can preuaile further against vs then god shall permit as god gaue herod power to take peter but he had no power to kill him
the lord cutteth short the arme of tyrants at his pleasure hee can put a brydle in theyr mouthes and an hooke in their nostrils as he did zenacharib when he came vp against ezechiah
the angell set peter at libertie
many such examples of the lordes prouidence ouer his elect we find in the scripture as in the sixt of the second of kinges when the seruaunt of eliseus rose vp earely in the morning to goe out an host of men sent thether from the king of aram compassed the citty rounde about with horses and charyots and he cryed to his maister alas we perrish
but he aunswered feare not they that are with vs are more then they that are with them
then elisha prayed that the lord would open the eyes of his seruaunt that he might see and he looked and beholde the mountaine was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha
there we find gods gracious prouidence garding the prophet and heere we find another president of the like prouidence of god in rescuing peter by the ministery of an angell from the violent rage of herod

an angell appeared to paule in that

dangerous viage and told him that none in the shyp should perrish

and here an angell tells peter that hee shall not miscarry nor perrish though hee were euen nowe shutte vp in the lowest

dungeon and kept with foure quaternions of souldiours
lot by angels was deliuered from the flames of sodome
rather then the three children should be consumed in the siery ouen god sent his angell to protect them causing the fire against nature to lose his heate as it were to quench it selfe in his owne flame
the fire lost his heat as the yron chaines lost theyr strength when they fell fro peters hands
what should stand vppon particulars when as the prophet dauid saith the angels of the lord pitch theyr camps round about them that feare him and deliuereth them
so peter came and followed him and knew not that it was true

this deliueraunce came to peter vnlooked for as appeareth by these words
had he knowne of thys happy newes he would surely haue watched for the angels comming and not haue suffered his eyes to sleep being a time so full of peril when nothing but death was presented before him
and vpon the next morrow he was to bee

ledde to the place of execution
well comming vnlooked for it was by so much the better welcome and it was a motiue of forcible efficacie to cause peter enter into a deeper consideration of gods goodnes in so strange a sort working his deliueraunce
this circumstance in peters deliuerance is woorth the nothing viz
the time of the angels comming when now there was almost no hope of any euasion or escape out of their hands for vpon the day following herod thought to dispatch him
euen then in the moment as it were of his greatest extremitie comes the angell openeth the prison doores and causeth the chaynes to fall from his handes and so peter escapeth almost before he awaketh or before he can haue any leysure to consider of his deliuerance
the historie speaketh that hee thought he had seene a vision
so was dauid deliuered from the handes of saul and ierusalem from the tyranny of the king of ashur and samaria from the aramites and this hapned vnto the vpon a sudden when no help was expected
in that it pleased god not to deliuer him sooner it proueth that the lorde will haue the measure of affliction left to himselfe
he will sift vs to the vttermost to try our patience
our sauiour had told peter before that sathan should winow both him and the other apostles as one winoweth vvheate
and here hee findes it true that sathan indeed had winowed him by his instruments of crueltie herod and the rest hee was euen nowe at the next doore to death
but the prouidence of god became vnto him a present helpe in time of trouble he rescued him from the violence of his mighty aduersaries and stayed theyr furie in the very instant
as the angell stayde abrahams hande vvhen the fatall blowe vvas comming
the very night before herod purposed to bring him out to the people came thys vnexpected deliuerance

christ suffered the shyppe to be almost vnder the waues before hee woulde awake
god went farre with heliah when he was forced to flie from iesabell and to cry out

they haue killed the prophets alone

am left and they seeke my soule

and dauid the freend of god was put to his when he cryed out in greefe anguish of his soule why doost thou turne away thy face and why forgettest thou my

tribulation
and in another place christ suffered peter to to be in danger of drowning before he would stretch out his hand to support him
as heere hee sent not his angell to deliuer him forth of prison till the verie night before his execution
and when they were past the first and second watch they came to the yron gate which opened vnto them of it owne accord
this is a further circumstance of his miraculous deliuerance
they passed throgh all the watches and the neuer perceiued it
they came to the yron gate and it opened voluntarily
sencelesse thinges made shewe of pittie when neither king nor people could yeeld compassion
the chaynes linkes fell from him before and heere the yron gate giues way to peter both working out together his deliueraunce
these things must admonish vs of the forcible effect of prayer
haec carceres soluit catenas ferreas aperit portas impetrat liberatores angelos
prayer it is that breaketh the strongest prysons looseth the yron bands openeth the gates draweth the angels out of heauen to come to the earth to worke our deliuerance
nowe knowe of a truth that the lorde hath sent his angell and deliuered mee out of the hand of herod and from all the wayting for of the people of the iewes
heere is layd downe peters thankfulnes after his deliuerance
hee acknowledgeth the louing kindnes of the lorde who had so graciously set him free from the tyrannie of his enemies that thirsted after his blood
we must learne by this example to giue thanks for benefits god shall powre vpon vs
for to receiue gods benefits and not to be thankfull for them is to contemne god in them
the lorde expecteth no retribution at our handes quis enim dedit ei who hath giuen vnto him as the apostle speaketh
yet hee will haue vs to he thankfull that is the speciall dutie that he requireth of vs who so offereth me thankes hee honoureth me and to him that ordereth his conuersation aright will shew the saluation of god
if one man doe pleasure or gratifie another there will be an expectancy of thanks at least and shall not the lorde much rather require the same of vs from whom we receaue our selues our liues and all that we are worth the bread we feede vppon the ground we tread vpon the light wee looke vpon all comes from god and is within vs or without vs all temporall and spirituall graces whereof each one is more worth then a thousand worlds

the consideration whereof caused the prophet dauid to call vpon himselfe others for this thankfulnesse in his booke of psalmes saying that would praise the goodnes of the lord and that they woulde tell

out the wonders that bee dooth for the chyldren of men
hee calleth all the blessings of god mirabilia wonders all haue in the matter of admiration the rather to stamp in vs an impression of gratitude

we haue well waded vnto this thankfulnesse when wee haue learned to say with dauid and with the like spirit that he did will make it knowne to the worlde what god hath doone for my soule
all the day long will be telling of his wonderfull workes
thus haue you briefely heard the summe of thys historie of peters imprisonment his deliueraunce
you haue seene on the one side the people solliciting herod consenting to the death of peter
they in theyr wicked purposes and the king in his cruell practises conspired his ouerthrow
but on the other side the congregation of the faithfull powred forth their important peticions for peter and these more strong then the yron bands preuailed for his deliuerance
prayer went vp from them and the angell came downe to him and so was peter deliuered herode of his purpose disappointed the church comforted gods name highly magnified

epigraph acts


syrs what must doe to be saued and they said beleeue in the lorde iesus and thou shalt be saued and thine houshold
these words consist of question an aunswere
the occasion of the question grewe thus noted in the precedent verses when paule and sylas had beene imprisoned in the citty of philippi for the testimonie of gods truth and beeing now in the lowest dungeon it pleased the lorde to worke theyr deliuerance in a miraculous manner as appeareth in the
verse
for suddainly there came an so that the foundation of the pryson was shaken and anone all the doores opened euery mans bands were loosed and the iayler beeing striken with a great terror would haue slaine himselfe had not paule staid his fury
after a more sober consideration finding all the prisoners to bee there euery man sure and and withall acknowledging the mightie power of god he comes in great humility before paule and silas he brought them forth and sayd syrs what must doe to bee saued where we are to note the suddaine and strange yet not so strange as powerful and mighty operation of gods spirit in this iaylor
he who euen nowe would haue spoyled himselfe seekes to saue himselfe hee that but now was most desperate is becom deuoute and most desirous to be informed in the way of his saluation
so in a moment hee becomes of an heathen man a christian man as if hee had beene made anewe his affections cleane changed his wicked resolution altered his crueltie turned to christianitie
all thys came vpon him in a moment as vvisedom came vpon saul when a kingly spirit vvas giuen him
sirs what must do to be saued

heere it is verified came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance

and again am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of israell
behold the power of god in his effectuall calling of sinners saul in his greatest rage when hee tyrannized most against gods saints was vpon a suddaine made of saul a persecuter paule a professour
the same powerfull spirit wrought in the conuersion of zacheus making him of a publican a zealous christian
so of stones god can and still dooth raise vp chyldren to abraham as in this place he wrought in thys wicked and cruell saylor nowe to seeke the meanes of his saluation
he who had chained others is nowe chayned vp himselfe and by the mighty power of god driuen to seeke releefe at his handes whom before hee despised and shut vp in the basest place of his house
feare made him runne to the apostles as shame draue adam to the
and he who before was lofty and proud disdainfull nowe stoopes downe and humbles himselfe and discouers his ignorance as adam did his nakednes
sirs what must doe to be saued
it is a voyce of passionate fearefulnesse such as is wont to proceed from them that are distracted and as it were at theyr wits end
what shall doe
this iaylour was not carefull howe to aunswere the rulers that had committed them nor doth he deuise what excuse hee might make to the officers magistrates who in all likelihood would exact them at his handes who had the custodie of them
but all these matters layd apart hee is nowe possessed with a deeper meditation which is how he may be saued
syrs the first word noteth his humility and reuerence
syrs or lordes to signifie that there is a reuerence and an honour stampt in the very name and office of ministers and therefore it is said feare god and honour his priestes
and they that minister well are worthy of double honour
howe beautifull vppon the mountaines saith esay are the feete of them that preach peace that publish good tydins saying to syon thy king raigneth
they are called the eyes of the body operatores messis the in the haruest
the messengers inuiting to the mariage of the kings sonne
the and chariots of israell spirituall fathers angels starres
if men did but consider of these honorable tytles which the word of god doth attribute to the ministers of his word thys calling would not receaue that contempt as at this day it dooth gods sacred worde would be more reuerently entertayned and the ministerie it selfe better reckoned
surely great is and beyond measure intollerable the misterie of iniquitie in thys respect which woorketh strongly the chyldren of disobedience
sinne sathan haue both conspired together to broach in mens hearts thys contempt of the ministers of the gospell to the end that in the minister the ministerie it selfe in time might vtterly bee contemned

the authour to the hebrues denounceth an iudgement against the that doe but neglect the meanes of theyr saluation
much rather then must they expect the seueritie of gods iudgements that shall despise and contemne with and high hand

the ministery of the word
he that despised moses law died vnder two or three witnesses but how shall hee be sentenced that treadeth vnder foote the sonne of god and counteth the blood of the testament he was sanctified as an vnholy thing and so despites the spirit of grace
certainly if princes take the contempt as done to them which is done to theyr embassadours
if hanun and ammon stinke in the nosthrils of israell for their ossered to dauids messengers
if iudas tooke of himselfe and became his owne executioner for betraying his lord and maister

if ierusalem and famous ierusalem became an heape of stones and the shame of the world for despising and euill intreating of so many prophets that were sent vnto them how shall god suffer these mocking micholls these oppressing pharaoes and rayling rabshakehs whether they be libertines or neutrals athiests or papists of any religion or of no religion in citty or in country or wheresoeuer they be

how shall god suffer them at last though he suffer them long to escape his wrath
and know you that heare the preacher for fashion sake that goe home and iest at him your bellies full that censure him at your pleasures that eate him at your feasts that buy and sell him at your shoppes that recreate your selues with his faults
the day will come when ye shall know and be driuen to confesse that prophets haue beene among you and then you will wish you had learned that which the iaylor nowe teacheth you which is to humble your selues in all reuerence euen at the feet of gods messengers and so to seeke the meanes of your saluation
sirs
so then the first doore that openeth to gods graces and treasures is humility
many a faire and large house hath but a narrow entry and a low doore
and so the lowe gate of humility is the doore of gods house narrow without but within are many mansions
and we must first passe by the narrow before we come to the broad
hauing made this reuerent preparatiue he comes to the matter
what must doe to be saued this one question is woorth all questions that may bee made for in other demaundes whatsoeuer a aunswere cannot be so giuen at once but wee must demaund againe and againe neuer giue ouer questroning till wee haue a full aunswer that pleaseth vs
but this demaund this one question but once made cuts off all others and beeing but once aunswered wee rest satisfied like this laylour for it ministreth a full contentment to our desires
that all men were like this iaylour to make like questions
this should be our first demaund but wee make it our last after all the lessons that wee haue learned yet wee haue beene schooled in this we haue not learned how to be saued
wee haue no leasure to thinke on this for our other businesses of the world call vs from it

like those lingerers in the gospell
hee that should haue followed christ sayde

nay suffer me first to goe bury my father
still there will be one let or other to hinder vs from saluation like the fowles that cumbered abraham in his sacrifice
eyther we haue bought a yoake of oxen and must of necessity goe proue them or we haue taken a farme we must goe see it or we haue married a wife and cannot come
so we haue no time yet and lesse leasure to learne how to be saued
we will learne this lesson last of all and after all when we are most vnsit to learne and haue almost quite lost our wits our sences then we will goe to schoole
this iaylour did not so so soone as hee felt the motion of gods spirit within him calling him to the knowledge of this holy lesson he lingers not nor deferres the time but hee suffers the spirit of god to worke him and to frame him now he is pliable as the smith doth his while it is hote

he did not suffer this golden oportunity to slip which in no case specially in heauenlie matters ought to be neglected but he runnes to the apostles as the apostles themselues a little before ranne to christ

when they prayed in the prison and saith what must doe to be saued
of all intergatories this is the sweetest yet least thought vppon or practised fewe that haue learned to minister it to themselues or others
all generally settle their mindes vpon other matters meerely contrary to this
the most part study howe they may be rich how they may be honourable how they may aduance themselues and so be magnified in this world
how they may be possessed of house lands how in a word they may reape the crop of all the pleasures that this life can aford them
fewe or none care how to be saued so this that should be the alpha of our desires it is the omega of our endeuours

christ saith seeke first the kingdome of god and the righteousnes thereof but the carnall man saith nay will first seeke afvanity and after my lusts after my pleasures
the greatest are like haman or belshazzar or like the ple man in the gospell
sewe
dauid or solomon or ioliah thab

wisedom that seeke after the sauing knowledge
few like this iaylor that will run to christ or his ministers as he did to the apostles to demaund how they may be saued
well where the graces of god are implanted and where the sweete motions of his holy spirit sind enterance there hath vanity no place but all the whole man the soule and spirit and body all is carried away with heauenly desires as paule was rauished with new visions when he was rapt vp into the third heauen
but this cannot be till wee haue bidden the world farewell with the deceaueable glory thereof vntill the olde man be vtterlie abollished and the whole body of sinne be destroyed
and vntill wee be moulded as it were a new like adam in paradise before his fall
the of this is such that whatsoeuer in face we professe yet our maner of liuing bewrayes our contrary desire
wee all would seeme to haue the smooth voyce of iacob but wee can be content to carry within vs esaus hart and hands

where the iaylour questioneth how hee may be saued the greater part of men of this

age demaund howe they may be damned
no man asketh how he may be made more holy but how be more wicked not how he may becom more humble but how he may waxe more proud not how hee may goe like iohn in cammels haire and girt about after the homeliest fashion with the girdle of a skinne but how he may iet it and ruffle it in silkes and veluets like them that are

in kings courts
this iaylour had been a wicked prophane cruell man but now hee lamenteth his former cariage of himselfe and he now careth to know nothing now but howe to be saued
as if hee should say haue taken great paines to be wicked haue deuised by all meanes how to exercise cruelty against the children of god but if knew now how to recouer gods fauour how to become a christian would refuse to vndergoe no paines in the world
nothing should stand in my way no perrill were it euer so hurtfull no persecution were it euer so hot and raging should me from the recouery of gods rich mercies the happie mans onely prerogatiue

heere wee may see the growth of gods graces in his children first god planteth and soweth in our harts a desire of well doing a desire to knowe gods will secondly a holy knowledge and thirdly a practike obedience of the same will of god according to the measure of our knowledge
a desire a knowledge and a practise like

the seed that is sowne comes vp by degrees first it is grasse then the blade and then the eare
so first wee must labour to haue knowledge and that will soone appeare if we haue in vs a desire to learne as this laylour had
and last of all to worke accordingly and so the christian man is fully perfited and so groweth vp in holines and righteousnes after the similitude of him that made him
what must doe
must importeth the present oportunity which in no case ought to bee neglected specielly in matters of saluation

men are least carefull in this behalfe they deserre their conuersion till theyr last and latest time beeing loath to part with sinne as lot was to goe out of sodome they would not leaue sinne till sinne leaue

them
this iaylor teacheth you otherwise if you aske him when it is best to enter into this holy resolution when it is time to turne to god and so be saued he tells you now you must doe it now is the time
aske solomon hee tells thee in the dayes of thy youth remember thy creatour
aske god himselfe he tels thee to day heare my voyce
if thou wilt knowe the time of the day aske abraham hee tells thee it must be in the morning as he in the morning of the day rose vp to sacrifice his sonne so thou in mane vitae tuae
in the morning of thy life
if thou let the day slip till the morrow to thee belongs that curse
uae qui dicitis cras cras cras non christianorum sed coruorum vox est miserè crocitantium
woe be to you that say to morrow to morrow to morrow is not the voyce of christians but the vnlucky croaking of rauens and crowes
praesens tempus tantum nostrum est
the present time is onely ours
dum dicitur hodie
whilst to day wee liue
qui non est hodie minus aptus erit
he

that endeuoureth not to day will be lesse apt for any good to morrow
all men would gladly goe to heauen but they cannot resolue to goe yet they would a while liue vpon the earth they are not of this laylours mind nor of paules minde
desire saith he to be dissolued and what must doe he doth not so much as giue the apostles leaue and respite to refresh and feed themselues he was so earnest
as abrahams seruant did not eate meate till hee had first tolde his message so the laylour would not suffer the apostles nor himselfe to eate meate till he had told them his message
hee cared like mary rather to feede the soule then the body not respecting the perishing food but rather that which should feed him vp to eternall life

this sheweth a carefull desire in the laylour but we must proceede further than to a naked desire
he that onely desireth to doe well and eyther goes no further or retires backe againe where hee beganne is like to the smoake which goeth vp towards heauen but neuer comes there
or like a cloude that mountes aloft as long as the

sunnes heat lasteth but the sunne once set it falleth downe to the earth faster then it mounted vp
this laylour went further then so for as we find him in this place desiring to know the meanes of his saluation so in the next verse to my text wee finde him vsing the meanes of his saluation
the apostles were diligent to preach vnto him he as diligent to heare them
as our bodies grow so must our soules first we creepe and then we grow and then we runne so we must grow in the spirit encrease in knowledge and profit in religion till the man of god be perfect
as this laylour sayde what shall doe to be saued so let euery man say what shall doe to haue knowledge vvhat shall doe to haue fayth vvhat shall doe to haue charitie vvhat shall doe to haue zeale all these are so many meanes of thy saluation and shall carry thee to heauen faster then the fierie chariot caried elias thither when he was translated
and thus much is spoken briefely for the question of the laylour
now let vs consider of the apostles answere
beleeue in the lord iesus and thou shalt be saued and thy houshold
this is their aunswere hee was not so ready to aske but they are as ready to satisfie his demaund
christes disciples are like christ he in the
of mark answered thus to him that demaunded what he might doe to inherite eternall life hoc fac et viues this doe and thou shalt liue
and heere the apostles gaue like aunswer to this iaylour doe this and thou shalt be saued
beleeue in the lord iesus
heere wee are to learne by this example of the apostles to be helpful to our neighbours or whom so euer we find fit for the kingdome of god wee ought to furnish them with all spirituall knowledge wee must like peter strengthen them that are weake when we our selues are strong
but we see the contrary practised for the greatest part are apt to draw men fro god and from his truth as the athiests papists of these times who straine their endeuours to make others like themselues
boni malos volunt esse bonos vt sint sut similes mali contra bonos volunt esse malos vt sint sui similes
more then a good many can be apt to say with chora the people are all holy and whereto serues this precisenes
they vvould perswade men that they are too good when they are stark naught
they will be in the extremity before they haue attained the mediocrity like the lazie trauailer that sittes downe in the midst of his iourney or like him that running in a race giues ouer in the midst of his course and suffers others to get the goale before him
this is the reluctation betweene the holy and vnholy the children of light and the children of the darknes
good men striue to be holy themselues and to beget holines in others but the wicked striue to be naught and to make others worse than themselues

and the deuill comes in to act vp the tragedy and so he rageth and so sinne suggesteth

so the weaknes of man yeeldeth because he hath not faith in which only we can ouerthrow the world
the apostles sinding this iaylour in the way of his saluation do help him forwards and doe support his weaknes as christ caried the lost sheepe vpon his shoulders as the mercifull samaritane did lay the man that lay by the way side robd wounded vpon his owne beast
beleeue say they in the lord
this may seeme to be a lesson soone learned and the gayning of heauen a matter of short and easie surprize if it may be obtayned only by beleeuing in the lord iesus
indeed the answer is short but the matter of substance included therein is great for as one tree hath many braunches and one branch many blossoms so this one answer hath many circumstances
all which being duly considered we shall be forced to acknowledge it a matter of greatest difficulty and that we haue neede to call vpon gods spirit for his special furtherance in this great frame of our spirituall building

for it is not giuen to all to beleeue in the lord iesus nay it is giuen but to a fewe to

those onely whom the father hath sealed for that purpose
yea euen the best of vs to whom the lorde hath giuen most talents of his rich graces may say notwithstanding looking vpon our imperfections
lord wee beleeue helpe our unbeleefe and the spirit is willing but the flesh is weake
faith in the strongest wil be found to be but a deficient faith as peters was when he began to sinke
god will haue it to be so to the end we should haue recourse to the fulnes that is in christ
that when we see our faith weakned or wounded wee should doe as they did who were bitten by scorpions cast vp our eyes to christ the brazen serpent who will not cease since now he is lifred vp to draw vs vp also vnto himselfe
beleeue in the lord iesus
asour sauiour told martha one thing is necessary so the apostles tell this iaylor one thing is necessary to furnish him for the kingdome of heauen euen faith onely and thou shalt be saued

to beleeue is to giue consent in thy hart

to the worde of truth to subscribe therevnto by an vnfained profession to yeeld all christian obedience aunswerable to the measure of grace giuen vnto vs
this faith is begotten in vs by the immediate gift of god and increased in vs by the word of god read and preached
god giues the word and the word giues faith and faith giues saluation
the iewes reade the scriptures and they heard christ preaching vnto them euery sabaoth in their sinagogues yet they beleeued not because the vaile was not taken from them and they were still in theyr sinnes to shew that faith is the speciall gift of god and all cannot receaue it which makes so many to withstand the truth in vngodlines
where it is said heere beleeue onely and thou shalt be saued wee learne that faith is the onely principall instrument whereby we apprehend christ and so consequently our saluation
for without faith it is impossible to please god and so without faith it is impossible to be saued

heere may the papistes lay their handes

vpon theyr mouthes for they are no longer

able to maintaine theyr doctrine of in the act of iustification
they would haue vs acknowledge with them that fayth without workes is not sufficient to iustifie but with our sayth say they our works must be co~current
which is a manifest errour and this place conuinceth it
true it is that fayth neuer goeth alone but is alwayes accompanied vvith goodworks as the heate is neuer separated from the fire but in the act of iustification faith alone must be co~sidered otherwise christ dyed in vaine
homines meritum quid esse potest vt ait vaus hommis desperatio aut vt alter dei miseratio
for what is mans merrit but as one authour saith mans desperation
or as another saith the mercy of god
vvho can say my hart is cleane can the infant or the tender babe newly drawne from the wombe in no wise they cannot
for quis dabit mundum ex immundo semme of vncleane seede vvhat cleannesse can come num adult us vt sunt annorum sic vitiorum incrementa
in youth as yeeres multiply so vices increase
cum omnia feceritis dicite vos esse seruos in vtiles
when ye haue done all you can say ye are vnprofitable seruants
si dixerimus nos volumus respondet apostolus deus dat velle si dixerimus nos facimus at vt facimus deus facit qui dat et velle et perficere
if wee say we will the apostle aunswereth god giueth the will if wee say wee doe endeuour god giueth that endeuour for in him is both the will and the worke
most excellent is that place of paule in the to the ephe
a voyce for strength so forcible as sampsons hairie lockes euen to foile whole armies of aduersaries undefined span alphabet gratia estis seruati
by grace ye are saued through faith not of your selues it is the gift of god not of workes least any man should boast
uita dei donum est
shall wee so vnkindly entertaine this bountifulnes of gods free mercy as not to accept heereof

yet saith the papist ile not haue it like a disdainfull proud merchant vnlesse may

pay for it eyther ile merrit heauen by my works or ile not come there
if the papist had saide he would neuer come there had the rather beleeued him
certainly if he stay till merit carry him thither vnlesse by merit he vnderstand the merit of christ he is neuer like to come there
in the lord iesus christ
beleeue in the lord he doth not say beleeue the lord
this sheweth the manner howe we ought to beleeue it is one thing credere deum another thing credere in

the one is a generall faith such as the deuill hath and his instrumentes the athiests

and heretiques and all the reprobates

they haue a generall knowledge they

beleeue and they will acknowledge that there is a god that made the world that gouerneth the world
and wee finde this confession of god and of christ in many places of the gospell
thou art christ the sonne of the lyuing god

wee neuer finde that hee confessed him to be filium homines
iesus know and paule know but who are yee

but we are taught another speciall kinde of fayth which is to beleeue in god and in christ
that is to apply by faith vnto our selues all that god hath wrought for vs in his sonne christ as that hee hath created vs redeemed vs preserued vs sanctified vs and in time will glorifie vs all in christ nothing of our selues not for vs but all in christ and for christ for vvithout him we can doe nothing
yea this our faith as it comes from vs as of it selfe cannot iustifie nor please god onely it is his will to accept it and vs in it how imperfect soeuer it be because christ our lord presenteth it and doth perfect it
nam illo habitat omms plenitudo for in him dwelleth all fulnes
this is briefely the substaunce of that saith which beeing planted in vs by the spirit of god will bring with it all sauing knledge

this true beleefe is in vs when wee belue the wholsome worde of truth all that the prophets haue written concerning christ how that hee was borne for vs and

dyed for vs and so entred into his glory
to beleeue this and to doe so making our election sure as the warneth vs this is to haue eternall life this is to finde out that saluation which the iaylour so diligently sought for
shut vp all with this one note the true iustifying faith hath these properties
acquiescit in christo omnes cius promissiones et merita apprehendus
it doth repose it selfe in christ laying holde on all his promises and merrits
non est temporaria semper doctrinae caelesti per prophetas et apostolos traditae eum profitetur de ea gloriatur eius cognitione laetatur non ad tempus sed perpetuo it is not for a time but alwayes agreeable with the heauenly doctrine deliuered by the prophets apostles the same it professeth of it she glorieth in the knowledge thereof shee reioyceth not for a time but for euer
semper est fructuosa operans per charitem it is alwayes fruitfull and worketh by loue
the scripture mentioneth but two kinds of
the one a dead faith without good workes which beleeueth all you say of christ but obserueth not his commandements
the other a liuely a iustifying fayth which dooth not onely beleeue but worke also in charity
and thus much may be spoken of fayth which as chrisostome saith no man knoweth or vnderstandeth but he that receaueth it as no man knoweth the sauour of honey but he that hath seene it and tasted it
this faith as the same holy man also writeth is lumen animae ostium vitae fundamentum salutis
hee that hath this faith hath already the kingdom of god within him and he may say as iacob did when he rested him in bethel and this is no other but the house of god this is the gate of heauen

lord importeth his soueraignty and power in that he is a lord he is able to saue vs and to protect vs if we submit our selues to his gouernment

in that he is called a lord wee must be directed onely by him he must raigne in

vs and ouer vs
the homage wee must pay to this our lord and king is our selues our soules and bodies
a liuing sacrifice holy and acceptable vnto god which is our reasonable seruice of god
if be a lord where is mine honour sayth the lord by malachy
god wil not be our lord vnlesse we will become his seruaunts but if wee serue the world or our lusts or our vanities then we cast his yoake from vs iesus
signifieth a sauiour came not to destroy but that the world in me might haue life
and this is eternall life to beleeue that god hath sent his sonne
they shall call his name iesus for he shall saue his people from their sinnes
there is no other name giuen vnder heauen whereby we must be saued neither is saluation in any other
christ
unctus the lord hath annoynted him with the oile of gladnes aboue his fellowes

kings priests and prophets were first anoynted before they executed their offices
and christ our lorde beeing a king a priest and a prophet is likewise annoynted to execute his office for vs in gouerning sacrifycing and praying for vs

he was a prophet the last of the prophets who now hath sealed vp both vision and prophecie and the whole misterie of godlines which is
god is manifested in the flesh iustified in the spirit· sne of angels preached vnto the gentiles beleeued on in the world and vp in glory
and thou shalt be saued and thine houshold
behold heere the wondersull co~fort presented vpon a suddaine to this laylour
saluation is freely in this place offered vnto him by faith in christ whom paul sylas preached
neuer was the coole shadow so comfortable to the weary traueler in the extremity of sommers drought as this glad tydings of saluation was to this iaylour

sin and seazed vpon him before as the legion of vppon the heard of swine but now he hath separated fro him his sinnes and quite expulsed all the vanities of this world hee

runneth to christ faster then zacheus out of the wilde
before hee was vnder the wrath of god but nowe hee is vnder grace and is vppon a suddaine become an elect vessell of mercy
and thine houshold
see howe full the riuers of god are and how vniuersally they streame foorth to water the harts of all christians that are apt to receiue them
not the iaylour alone hath the benefit of this emplayster but his whole houshold are salued as wel as himselfe they for his sake haue a promise of the like grace
seruaunts may be glad that are in seruice vnder a religious maister for that the blessings of god in the maister are deriued vnto them
here we may cry out with paul· the riches of gods mercisulnes
and with moses dominus domtnus potens et misericors slow to anger and abundant in mercy and truth reseruing mercy for thousands
the housholder himselfe and his family chyldren seruaunts and all are saued

the vnbelceuing wife shall be accepted for the beleeuing husband in this place

the houshold is accepted for the housholder
and this that hath beene spoken shall suffize for the clearing of this story of the iaylour
in whose example we are called vpon to make straite steps vnto our paths and to be alwayes deuising what wee may doe to be saued he ranue to the apostles to learne how he might be saued we must also run to the apostles that is to the word and we shall be sure to be informed as he was in the way of our saluation
we must apply to our sick soules the benefit of the same emplaister and we must beleeue in the lord iesus as he did that is let vs acknowledge him alone to bee our messias our redeemer aduocate and according to this faith let vs work and fructifie by testifying the same both to the world and our own consciences and then shall this vndoubtedly follow
we shall be saued and our housholds
soli deo gloria

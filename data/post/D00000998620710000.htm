appear to the whole world that our engagement being so unanimously agreed upon in this present design is not for any self or sinister ends but only for the preservation and safety of his majesties royall person the full bing and priviledges of our renowned parliament in whose cause we have been willing to sacrifice our lives for the preservation and defence of the same the liberty and proprietie of the subject and the good of the common weale of england neverthelesse notwithstanding all our faithfull actions and dangerous engagements against the common enemy of this kingdome in the behalfe of that cause whom we so often adventured our lives to maintain divers ill affected spirits have improved all opportunities and advantages by false suggestions to make us odious to the kingdome by casting such a blot of infamy upon this army for which it is determined by the officers and souldiers ingenerall not to cease in their present action untill such time that they have right and satisfaction in these particulars and grievances which they have so often demonstrated to the publike view and that the authors and fomentors of the same may be brought to a legall tryall and justice executed upon them which is hoped will not be denyed and to that end his excellency our renowned generall lievtenant generall cromwell and the rest of the colonels in our armie hath sent a letter to the lord mayor of london declaring the grievances of the whole army

and representing our desires and demands concerning that perpetuall blot of infamy which hath been cast upon this armie by some wicked persons who endeavour to involve this kingdome in a second vvarre and so overthrow both the priviledges of parliament and people

sir we are now upon our march towards your hohourable city hoping to find redresse for all our grievances which if granted am consident it will tend much to the honour of his majestie and his royall posteritie the preservation of both houses of parliament the good of the common weale and the safety of the whole kingdome ingenerall by reason whereof we do conceive the woole nation to be concerned in it having a long time suffered under the and mercilesse sword
and therefore for the prevention of a second warre and the speedie effecting of a safe and peace within the kingdome of england and dominion of wales
it was resolved by the officers and souldiers through out the whole army at a late randezvouz as foloweth


that having some cause of suspition of a new design lately contrived by a false and party for the involving this kingdome in a new warre and to that end are very active both in the city of london and severall other parts of the kingdom

to accomplish the same
it was resolved with one unanimous consent by the officers and souldiers under the command of his excellency sir thomas fairfax immediately to demonstrate and represent their grievances and also to declare the grounds of their intentions concerning their approach and advancing towards the city of london the army being now upon their march from their quarters near cambridge toward ware and so to proceed on as occasion shall require
ii
their desire is to preserve and not to spoyle and to that end are determined both officers and souldiers horse and foot not in the least to be accounted the wicked of men and destroyers but preservers of that remnant and talent which god hath bestowed upon those who serve him in truth and sincerity

iii
that although they are now near approaching towards your vast and populous city yet it is no waies prejudiciall to the state but for the preservation and security of those priviledges for which divers poor

souldiers have lost their lives for the maintenance of the same
iv
that if there be an answer returned somewhat suitable to their desires and their reasonable requests granted they shall proceed no further but retreat to any convenient place which shall be thought fit and convenient
that their desire is that they may receive a faire suitable answer to their requests professing that their intentions are reall and not in the least prejudiciall either to state or but for the advantage of the publike good
and that the citizens of london with whom they have so often hazarded their lives withall against the common enemy of the kingdome may not in any waies stand in opposition against them but really and unauimously knit their hearts in one link against all opposers and disturbers of the publike weale of england in which troublesome disasters both the citizens of london and the renowned prentices of the said city in the army have wded through many difficulties

vi
and lastly it is the desire of the whole army

that all things may be composed in love and that all possible means may be ued for a safe and peace that so his majesties honour and prerogative may be maintained the priviledges and being of parliament preserved and the peace and welfare of the kingdome defended against all opposers and disturbers whatsoever

a brief vindication of the royal society

if it were not that some worthy persons no better informed than mr stubbe seems to be of the design and business of the royal society which he hath lately endeavoured in no less than four ignorant and railing pamphlets to wound through the sides of some particular persons might be induced to have a sinister opinion of that illustrious body established by his most excellent majesty that now is for the improvement of noble and useful knowledge should altogether disdain even to touch such disingenuous and foul papers as those which this virulent pen hath of late troubled the press with are justly esteemed to be by all truly generous and considerate men both domesticks and forainers who are acquainted with the

true state of what he doth most maliciously and undeservedly labour to defame

since therefore it is necessary that something should be said for the sake of those that may upon the reading of such libelling pamphlets frame to themselves wrong conceptions of that royal foundation so immorally assailed by this petulant writer shall endeavour in a short vindication to represent the true end and work of that institution and by doing so manifest to the world that this calumniator hath with all his late scribling done nothing but filled a great deal of waste paper with a lively character of his own perverse vain and turbulent genius reviving the memory of his former wayes and confirming the opinion had of him before of his discomposed and malitious nature

must therefore say that if envy and malice and other cursed motives had not blinded him he would have been so far from reviling one of the noblest establishments that ever was erected by any prince that he would have found as well as all considering and sober men do that the aime and purpose of the royal society is not any thing at all of what he taketh so much pains and useth so much craft to insinuate to espouse or reject this or that sect of philosophers or to meddle with religion divinity medical practises much less to endanger the religion established in england the monarchical government the two famous universities

the received education and the profession on of physick all which he goes about in those vile books to bear the world in hand they intend to do but that their desires and attempts are to increase knowledge and to discover truth whereever it be in natural mechanical and mathematical things to help old inventions and encourage new ones and all for the raising and enobling the dignity of humane nature and the serving of mankind

and since they are perswaded with the excellent lord verulam and many other judicious moderns that hitherto all sorts of naturalists have been too hasty in establishing systems of natural philosophy before they had laid a solid and comprehensive foundation to build upon they have esteemed it a laudable and useful undertaking to endeavour that all industrious and sagacious inquirers of nature every where may conjoyn their researches studies and labours to examine what hath been performed hitherto to retain what will endure the test and to add thereunto what they can in order to the composing a faithful history of nature and art that may contain a competent stock of observations and experiments frequently and carefully made by intelligent and cautious men which may serve for a magazeen of materials of which hereafter by duly considering the whole and comparing all the parts together may be raised if possible such a systeme of

natural philosophy as may give a rational accompt of the appearances and effects of nature and enable men to infer from confronted causes and effects such consequences as may conduce to the greater benefit and ampler accommodations of humane life

this then being the true design of this royal establishment and the sole prospect of those that are ingaged therein it alone is able to scatter that heap of unsavory talk put together by this vain writer wherein tis palpable that he never would understand the true ground and end of this institution and that in all his airy and empty discourses where he strikes at the
royal society he doth but fight with his own fancy and shadow
for whosoever is impartial and will but give himself the leisure to consider the nature of such a design and the happy effects which its serious prosecution may have such an one will soon conclude that what ever is said in those fardles as far as it tends to detract from the said society contains nothing but spiteful misrepresentations and calumnies poured out on purpose to try whether something of it would not stick with credulous men to whom the actings and design of the society are not known

therwise who is there pray that being in his right wits can conceive that such an institution and such studies can tend to undermine the protestant

religion whose design business and glory it is to encrease light and knowledg or that it can as is suggested by this pretended champion of the church of england known to be indifferent to all religions introduce popery which wants that latitude of pursuing the sense of the motto nullius in verba chosen by this corporation

who can believe that it endangers monarchy which formerly this railer hath been shrewdly suspected to hate without calling in question the prudence of one of the wisest and most potent monarchs in the world that hath incorporated it by his royal charter and by doing so encreased his renown abroad to admiration witness several english ambassadors and other publick ministers innumerable travellers and abundance of letters written from all parts and added also to his singular luster at home among all those that know what value to put upon virtue and knowledge and how shall this be said without throwing dirt upon those eminent and illustrious prelates nobles officers of state and other loyal and learned persons of all sorts who have honoured the register of the royal society with the subscription of their names after their royal founder his royal highness his highness prince rupert and one of the dukes of brunswick and luneburg

again who can affirm without a front of brass

cation of youth whereas it is evident that they intermeddle not with any such thing but if they should have any influence upon it it can be none other but to render it more manly and more polite in regard that this society consists of many of the best extraction and breeding noblemen gentlemen travellers persons that have studied men and conversed with things knowing in the most solid and moil useful parts of knowledge such as are the mixt mathematiques natural philosophy chymistry anatomy physick mechanical arts and practices of which persons there are no such deserters as this malevolent writer goes about most falsly to perswade

who can truly say that this society is prejudicial to the two great universities of this kingdom considering that it cannot be denyed that the sciences and studies which are the work of the royal society are both highly noble and exceeding necessary for the several professions of the world and though perhaps they be not the chief business of those illustrious nurseries of all learning where the youth of the kingdom is fitted for the service of the church and state yet they are countenanced there and pursued within their walls by some of their most worthy members as far as other studies and exercises concerning languages logick history divinity law will permit
it is

evident that the royal society is so far from derogating any thing from them in that learning which they are chiefly addicted to that the same is by them supposed or rather implyed and made good use of as being very necessary rightly to apprehend and to compare things that are examined and performed amongst them
besides that the experimental operations insisted upon by that company are a further improvement of some of the academical studies and an application of them to publick uses

again who can rationally esteem that that society is detrimental to the profession of physick which is built upon and can by no surer way be advanced than by good observations and experiments he being certainly the ablest physitian that hath improved himself by the noblest and certainest of them and as to the practice of physick that society doth not at all interfere with it they neither pretending to judge of diseases nor setting rules for it nor prescribing or administring medicines but only doing what they may upon occasion to encrease the stock medical by discovering more and more of the secrets of nature which as it tends to enlarge the power and empire of man over other creatures so it may particularly contribute to suggest to physitians of whom many very eminent for learning and practice are of the chief inquirers constantly remaining in this society a more ample

matter both to preserve and to recover the health of man for the doing of which none will be maligned by any but him that is an enemy to mankind

and as the fellows of the royal society make it their business to render themselves as much as in them is serviceable to all so they do not assume to themselves any discoveries or inventions of others
and if any such should by this or that particular member perhaps less knowing in the history of such things be attributed to them possibly out of an excess of affection which may be accompanied even with a belief of the truth as to what is thus ascribed yet is the society so just as not to own any thing more than is their due and their modesty is such to my knowledge that the body it self pretends hitherto to no more but this that they have begun to remove some rubbish to lay in some materials and those yet unhewn and unapproved and to put some things in order for the building by making tryals and observations of several kinds in publick by encouraging and directing some of their number to do the like in private and by examining improving and carrying on of some things which others had set upon before them either at home or abroad
and therefore as none not the very spirit of calumny nay even mr stubbe himself can possibly have the impudence to blame their designe as it is above declared so

none can justly charge them with any arrogance since they as a body assume nothing to themselves but what hath been just now related and specified

to which think have right to add that they need nor be very solicitous to give particular satisfaction to impertinent and captious inquirers into their proceedings in regard they are a body made up of meet volunteers that have engaged themselves generously and freely to promote the designe and therefore have no obligation at all to give an account to any but his sacred majesty their founder and patron of their performances which they have hitherto carried on at the expence of their own purse and hope to continue notwithstanding the dismall auguryes of this for the increase of the honour of this great nation and the general benefit of mankind
and this think may suffice both to inform all candid men of the truth and with all to shame if he be not past shame this hectoring writer for having so groundlessly and uncivilly attacqued many of the most noble and the most intelligent and vertuous of his own who certainly will be ashamed to own such a ranter for an english man for all the shew he makes of petulant wit and scraps of crabbed learning

if he should say that have passed by the arguments he hath produced to support his pretences

shall boldly answer that had no reason to value them or to trouble the reader with a rehearsal and particular refutation of them which perhaps will be done so as to make his heart ake by those whom he hath particularly assailed considering that the things represented by me being onely weighed whatever he hath alledged will fall to the ground of it self as being propped up by nothing but malice envy calumnies vain surmises and crafty of the undertaking and actions of that society am pleading for which hath the applause of discreet and intelligent men both at home and abroad as hath been already represented and can be made out by scores of letters from divers of the most eminent persons in learning and those forementioned studies that are in europe which gives me sufficient ground to hope and ominate that this royal establishment will thrive and flourish notwithstanding the mischievous project for its destruction aimed at by this mercenary and vile rhapsodist
however the rest abundantly satisfyed in their good intentions and endeavours stopping the mouths of all such malignant calumniators as himself with that heroick saying

virtus repulsae nescia sordidae intamina is sulget honoribus

and that other virtutem videant intabescánt{que reticta

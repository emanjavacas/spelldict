Of vnwryten very tyes Cum priuilegio, Of vnwrytten very tyes.
IN the day of Pe~tecost wha~ the holy goost desce~ded vpo~ the apostles discyples of Chryst, they receyued suche grace goostly knowlege, that they hade forth wt the gyfte of the vnderstandynge of scrypture: and to speake in the tonges of all men.
And al+so that vpon whome soeuer they layde theyr handes, the holye ghoste shoulde descende vpon them.
And ther vpon they by theyr prechyng good doctryn co~uerted i~ short tyme, great multitude of people vnto the fayth of Christ And after that dyuers blessed me~ i~ strength of the fayth, wrote the lyfe, miracles, do+ctryne, passion deth, and resurrectio~ of our mayster Chryst: but foure of those writinges were only receyued by al the hole chyrche of Chryst. that is to say, of
Marke, Luke Ihon. they receyued them to be of such aucto+rytye, yt it should not be lawfull to any man, that wold co~fesse Chryst, to denye the~, they were called ye foure gospels of Christ.
And ye epystles of Paule, the Actes of ye apostles, the epistles that be called canonyke.
And ye apocalips were receyued to be of lyke auctorytye, as ye gospels were.
And thus by assent aswel of the people, as of the clergye, was the newe testament affyrmed to be of suche auctorytye, as it is now take~ to be of, as it is of in dede. so yt it is not lawfull to denye any thing that it affermeth, ne to afferme any thyng that it denyeth, it is no meruayle though it be take~ to be of such strengthe, for it was auctory+sed whan the people that were newelye co~uerted to ye fayth, were ful of grace of deuocion, replenished with vertues, desyryng alwaye the lyfe to come, the helthe of theyr owne soules, of theyr
Tha~ also were blessed bis+shops, blessed preestes, other blessed persons of the clargy: and what could suche men aske of god ryghtwisly, that sholde be denyed them.
And who maye thinke, but that they al the people, at ye sayd auctorisyng of scripture, praied deuoutly for ye assistau~ce of ye holy gost that they might haue grace to auctorise suche thyng as shold be to his honour to the encrease of his fayth, to ye helth of the soules of al his people.
The tyme also that this auctorysynge of the new testament, and ye gatherynge of it togy+der was made, was (as suppose) the tyme of the moost hygh gracyous she+dynge out of the mercy of god into the world, that euer was fro~ ye begynnyng of the world vnto thys daye: meane the tyme that was fro~ the incarnacio~ of Christ vnto the sayd auctorysyng of the newe testament was accomplished: for in part of ye tyme our lord was here
himselfe in bodyly presence, preachyng and teachyng his lawes gatherynge chewsynge hys apostles disciples ye sholde teache preache his lawes wha~ he was gone: which they dyd not onely by word, but also by good exa~ples, that yet remayne vnto thys day: so that al ye tyme may in maner be called the golde~ tyme.
And not onely the newe testament was tha~ receyued, but also ye olde testament.
And by preachyng teachyng of these testame~tes, was ye fayth of Christ meruaylously encreased in many coun+trees.
After all this, by a co~me~ speking among ye people, the byshops, preestes and other of the clergye, which were as lanternes vnto the people, ye specyall maynteyners of the chryste~ fayth, were called the chyrche, or men of the chyrch: and vnder ye colour of ye name chyrche many of ye clergy in proces of tyme, pre+tended yt they might make exposicions of scripture, as the vniuersal chyrch of
Christ, yt is to say, as ye hole congregacion of christen people myghte, thervpon whan couetyse pryde somwhat encresed in many of the clargie, they ex+pounded very fauourably dyuers textes of scripture, yt sounded to ye maynte+naunce of theyr honour, power, iurisdi+ction ryches.
And ouer ye toke vpon them to afferme, yt they were ye chyrche that myght not erre and that Chryst his aposteles had spoke~ taught many thynges, that were not expresly put in scripture, that the people were as wel bou~de to beleue them, and that vnder lyke payne, as yf they had ben expressed in scripture, and called them vnwryten veryties, where of shal, as for an exa~+ple recyte part.
Fyrst ye Christ after his maundye, and after he had wasshen the fete of his apostles, taught them to ma+ke holy creame, for mynistracio~ of ye sa+crame~tes: and yt they haue as ful aucto+rytye to do ye same, as yf it had bene co~teyned
in scriptuere, that christ had gy+uen the~ power to it.
That it is a tra+dicio~ of ye apostels, that ymages ought to be set vp.
That ye apostels ordeyned that al faythful people should resort to the chyrch of Rome, as to ye moost hygh and principal chyrche of al other: yet it can not be proued by scripture, ne by any other sufficiente auctoritye, yt they made any such ordynaunce.
Also that ye Crede, which is co~menly vniuersally vsed to be said by the co~me~ people, was made by the .xii. apostels: though ye artycles therof, ar fermely stedfastly to be beleued of euery chrysten man, as artycles sufficie~tly proued by scripture yet that they were gathered togyder by the .xii. apostels: specially that euery one of the apostels made one article, as paynters shewe yt they dyd, can not be {pro}ued by scripture, ne is not necessari to be beleued for our saluacio~, and though it were but a smal offence in the people
to beleue yt it were an article necessarye to be beleued for our saluacyo~, because the clergie, which be the lanternes leders vnto the people, do instruct them that it is so: And it is nether agaynst ye lawe of god, nor the lawe of reason, but that it may be so: yet it is a great offe~ce to the clergye, to afferme for certayne yt thyng, that is to them selfe vncertayne, and therfore it wold be reformed, for es+chewyng of offences vnto the clergye.
Also yt the people shal praye into the est is not proued by scripture: and yet they saye, that by the tradicio~ of the apostles it is to be beleued.
Also yt our lady was not borne in orygynal synne.
That she was assumpte into heuen body soule, Al these many other, diuers of ye clergie cal vnwrytten veryties, lefte in the worlde by the tradicion relacio~ of the apostles, which as they saye, the people are bou~de to beleue aswel as scripture: For they say, yt syth no man were bou~de
to beleue scripture, but bycause ye chyrche sayth, this is scripture: so they saye that in the thinges before rehersed, the chyrche wytnessethe the~ to be true, and that ye people haue assented to them ma+ny yeres: wherfore it is not lawfull to doubte at them, ne to denye them: To thys reason it may be answered: that yf it can be proued by as good as hygh auctoryte, that these thynges were left in the world by the tradicion relacyo~ of the apostles, as the auctorysynge of scripture was: that than they are to be beleued as verely as scripture: But yf they be wytnessed to be so by some bysshops and priestes, and some other of ye clergye onely: or that they be witnessed to be so by decrees lawes made by bis+shops of Rome, by ye clergye of Rome or by opinion of doctours only: tha~ no man is bou~de to accept them, ne beleue them, as they ar bounde to beleue scrip+ture.
was auctorysed by ye hole church of god and in the most electe moost gracious tyme, yt of lykelyhode hath ben syth the begynninge of christes chyrche.
And yf it be sayd, that many of ye sayd opynio~s haue ben affermed approued by general cou~selles, in whom no errour maye be presumed: it maye be answered: that though ye chyrche gathered together in the holy ghost, may not erre in thinges perteyning to the fayth: that yet for as moch as som general cou~sels haue ben gathered, not by ye power of kynges and princes, that be heades of ye chyrch And that lawes haue ben also made at such general co~sels, of dyuers thinges whych haue not perteyned to the fayth but to ye mayntenau~ce of the auctoritye or profyt of the clergye, or of soch artycles as ar before rehersed, that they cal vnwryte~ veryties, which vndoubtedly perteyn not merely to the faith.
soche cou~sels were gathered in the holy goost or not, whether they erred in theyr iudgeme~tes or not, and it is no doubte, but ye in some general counsels they haue done so in dede.
And suppo+se yt there be but fewe maters more necessary, ne more expedient for kynges princes to loke vpo~, tha~ vpon these vn+wrytte~ verytyes, of making of lawes by the clergie.
For yf they be suffered to mayntayne that ther be any verytyes, whych the people are bounde to beleue vpon payne of dampnacio~, besyde scrip+ture, it wyl perswade partly an insufficiencye in scripture, ther vpo~ myght folowe greate daungers many wayes.
And yf it were admytted, that ye clergie myght be receaued to afferme that ther be soche veryties, besyde scripture, yet they could not proue them.
For yf they wold in profe therof say, yt the apostles fyrst taught those verities, that they haue so co~tinued fro~ one to another vn+to
thys daye, shewe none other aucto+rytye therof but that: than al ye sayinge may as lyghtly be denyed, as it was af+fermed, and with as hygh auctorytye.
And yf they wyl ferther attempte to ap+proue it by lawes made by the bishops of Rome, by the clergye at Rome: yea or by lawes decrees made at general cou~sels: yet these lawes decrees may be lawfully doubted at, as before appe+reth: so that they cannot by reason ther+of dryue any necessitye of belefe i~to any person.
Wherfore kynges and prynces yt haue receaued of god the high power and charge ouer the people, ar bou~d to prohybyte soch sayinges vpon greate paynes: and not to suffre a belefe to be grou~ded vpo~ thynges vncerteyn.
But yet yf some of the sayd articlys that be called vnwrytte~ verities were suffered to co~tinue as thinges that be more like to be true, tha~ otherwyse: and no necessitie of belefe to be deryued ther vpon.
suppose verely it myght wel be suffe+red that they shuld stand styll not prohabyte, as it is of that article yt the .xii. apostles made ye Crede: that it is good to praye into the est: that our lady was not borne in original synne: yt she was assumpted bodye soule, And therfore yf it were ordeyned by kynges pri~ces that no man vpo~ payne, to be taken as a breaker of the quietnes of the people, shuld denye any of the sayd articles: it were well done to kepe vnytie amonge the people: but diuers realmes may ordre soch thynges diuersly, as they shall seme co~uenyent, after the dysposicio~ of the people ther.
For they be but thi~ges indiffere~t, to be beleued, or not beleued and ar nothing lyke to scripture, to the articles of the fayth, the .x. co~maundeme~tes, ne to soch other morall lerni~ges as ar merely deryued out of scripture.
For they must of necessitie be beleued obeyed of euery christe~ man.
There muste be one God, one fayth, one Baptisme But to suffre them to stande as vnwry+ten veryties, that may not be denyed: to haue theyr auctorytie onely by lawes made by ye clergie, it semeth dau~gerous For it might cause many of the clergye to esteme more power in the clergie tha~ there is in dede: and that myghte lyfte many of them into a hygher estimacion of them selfe, than they ought to haue: wherby myght folowe greate daunger vnto the people.
For as long as ther be disorders in the clergye, it wyl be heard to bryng the people to good ordre.
And all this yt haue touched before, maye be reformed, without any rebuke to the clergye that now is.
For the pretence of soch vnwryten verytyes, ne yet of makyng of lawes, to bynde kynges prin+ces and theyr people: ne yet that bothe powers, that is to saye, spiritual tem+poral, were in the clergye, began not in
And as to ye sayd other prete~ced vnwryte~ verities, yt is to say, yt alme~ shuld resort to Rome, as to ye most high principal chyrche.
And yt it is a tradicion an vnwryten verytie, ye ymages oughte to be set vp, it were wel done, yt they soch other opinio~s, wherby prdie couetyse or vayne glory myght springe her after, were prohabyte by auctoritie of the parlyame~te vpon great paynes.
And as to ye sayd vnwryte~ verytie, that holy creame shuld be made after ye mau~+dye, it perteyneth only to the~ that haue auctoritie to iudge whether it be an vn+wryten veritie, or not, and to iudge also what is the very auctoritye of making of that creame.
And therfore wyll no ferther speke of ye matter at thys tyme.

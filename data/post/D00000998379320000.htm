Made by M. ROBERT RECORDE, D. in Physick, and afterwards augmented by M. IOHN DEE.
And now lately diligently corrected, beautified with some newe Rules and necessarie Additions: And further endowed with a thirde part, of Rules of Practize, abridged into a briefer methode than hitherto hath bene published: with diuerse such necessary Rules, as are incident to the trade of Merchandize.
Whervnto are also added diuers Tables instructions that will bring great profite and delight vnto Merchants, Gentlemen, and others, as by the contents of this treatise shal appeare.

THat which my friend hath well begon For verie loue to common weale, Of good will hath bene ouer runne directing ech part euerie deale.
And bewtified for thy behoofe With breifer wayes for practise lore, As by the triall and the proofe Was neuer yet in print before.
Of numbers vse the endlesse might No wit nor language can expresse, Apply, and trie, both day and night And then this truth thou wilt confesse.
To please or displease sure am, But not of one sort to euerie man.
To please the best sort would faine, The froward displease shal certaine.
Yet wish wil, though not with hope, All eares and mouthes to please or stoppe.
To the Right worshipfull M. ROBERT FORTH Doctor of Law, and one of the Maisters of the Queenes Maiesties high Court of Chauncerie.
BIAS the wise Philosopher of Greece, when his Country was spoyled, and the people caried their goods away, being demaunded why he did not the like? answered, that he caried all that he had with him, meaning his vertue and learning: So (my Right worshipful singular good Master) hauing nothing of value in substance to bestow, doe here present you with such treasure as the Lord hath vouchsafed vpon me, which according to Bias opinion and mine owne likewise, is the greatest Iewell haue, not doubting but you wil accept the giuers mind more than the gift, which confesse is small.
But being throughly acquainted with the great fauor your Worship bereth to such as delight in any good exercise, it hath imboldned me to put forth this simple Addition vnder your Worships defence.
The entyre loue exercise of this excelle~t Arte, with drawing of proportions, Mappes, Cardes, Buildings, Plattes, &c. were the only studies whereunto euermore haue bene enclined.
Touching Drawing it was onely Dei beneficio, naturally giuen me from my youth, without instruction of any man, more than Loue thereof, delectation, desire, and practise.
In this Art also hauing great delight, had no other instruction at my first beginning but onely this good Authors Booke, but afterwards greatly encreased the same during the time
serued your Worship in Cambridge, in going to the Arithmeticke Lecture at the common Schoole: And more furthered since the time that left your Worships seruice, which is about
yeares past, by continuall exercise therein (the mother and nurse of Science,) during which time my onely vocation hath bene (thinking it a meete exercise for a common welth) in training vp of youth to write and draw, with teaching of them the infallable principles and briefe practises of this worthie Science, hauing (I praise God for it) brought vp a number to become faithfull and seruiceable to their masters in great affaires, and many of them good members of a common wealth, which is no small comfort to me in Christ.
Amongst which number, a countriman of mine hath oftentimes bene verie inportunate with me, to do a deede of Charitie vpon the ground of Arts, vz. to peruse and amende it of the imperfections and faultes, that haue crept into it through negligence of often printing.
Which ernest request of his bred two strifes in me: The one was, was loth to do it, knowing my selfe inferior to a great number that might better do it than I.
And yet considering it is a Booke hath done many a thousand good, which when a young beginner commeth to a confused or mistaken figure, it bringeth him into a wonderful discoragement and maze: which thing considered, for meere loue to a common wealth, and to the Booke, being my first Author, willingly graunted to do my goodwill.
And passing vnder the file of correction, heere and there encreast it with such necessarie Additions as knewe might encorage a yong learner, and more woulde haue done, but for feare the Booke would rise too thicke or grow too dere.
And being thus entered into the vaine thereof, and knowing that this Author was the onely light and the chiefest Lodestone
vnto the vulgar sort of English men in this worthy science, that euer writ in our naturall tong, haue (according to my simple knowledge) yelded againe some part of my receiued talent with aduantage: and endowed him to the further encrease of his memorie, with Rules of breuitie and practize, abridged into a briefer method than hitherto hath bene published in our English tongue, with other right necessarie Additions, Rules and Tables, whiche truste will doe my countrie good, and be right commodious to all sorts of men: all which commit to the fauorable censure of your worship, and al such as loue knowledge, desiring their fauorable correction herein if ought be amisse.
The which with greater affection than am able to vtter, Dedicate to your Worship, as a meete Patrone, both for lerning godlines, and loue of the same, which comming from your worship into the hands of many (shall doubt not) do many good, as heretofore it hath alreadie done.
So shall you (as the best benefactor of these labors) be partaker of all their prayers that shall reape profite or knowledge by this worthy Art, in Commendation whereof if should write, should rather blemish tha~ adorne it.
For the Authors Epistle vnto that famous Prince of worthy memorie K. Edward the sixt, and his Preface to the Reader, are sufficient.
Thus crauing fauourable acceptation of this my homely and dutifull present, humblie leaue you to the conduction of the Almightie, whom beseech long to preserue you in continuall health, with dayly encrease of worship, to the glorie of his name, and to the ioy of all such as loue you.
TO THE MOSTE mightie Prince Edwarde the sixt, by the grace of God King of Englande, Fraunce, and Irelande. &c.
THe excellencie of mans nature, being such, as it is by Gods diuine fauoure (most mightie Prince) not onely created in highnesse of degree farre aboue all other corporall things, but by perfection of reason and search of wit, much approching toward the image of God, as not onely the holy Scriptures doe testifie, but also those naturall Philosophers, which exactly did consider the nature of man, and namely the farre reach and infinite compasse of the workes of the minde, were inforced to confesse, that man scarcely was able to knowe himselfe.
And if he would duly ponder the nature of himselfe, he woulde finde it so strange, that it might seeme vnto him a verie miracle.
And thereof sprang that saying: magnum miraculum est homo, maximum mariculum sapiens homo.
For vndoubtedly as man is one of the greatest miracles that euer God wrought, so a wise man is plainely the greatest.
And therefore was it that some did account the heade of a man the greatest miracle in the worlde, because not onely of the straunge workemanshippe that is in it, but much more of the efficacie of reason, witte, memorie, imagination, and such other powers and works of the mind, which can more easily conceiue any thing in a manner, than vnderstande it selfe.
And amongst all the creatures of God it findeth none more difficult to be perceiued than these same powers of it selfe, whereby it doth conceiue and iudge as it may be well coniectured by the diuersitie of opinions, that the wisest Philosophers did vtter touching the spirite of man and the substance of it: whereof at this present intende to make no rehearsall, but who so sisteth to reade thereof, may finde it largely set forth not onely in Aristotle his bookes De anima but also in Galene his booke called Historia philosophica, againe in Plutarch his worke, De philosophorum placitis, whose wordes are also repeared of Eusebius in the xv. booke, [undefined span alphabet], vnto whom them that haue desired to vnderstande the intricate difficultie of knowing our owne selues, as touching our best part, and that part whereby we deserue to beare the name of men.
This matter seemed so obscure and difficulte, in knowledge, that Galen, who for his excellent wisedome and iudgement in naturall workes, is called of many men a Miracle in nature, yet in searching the nature and substance of the spirite of man, he not onely confesseth himselfe ignorant, but counteth it plaine temeritie to attempt to finde it: so farre aboue the hope of mans knowledge is that parte, whereby man doth knowe and iudge of
And although the ignorant sort (which hate all things that they knowe not) doe little esteeme the profoundnesse of mans spirit and of reason, the chiefe power and facultie of it, yet as there is a kind of feare and obedience of vnreasonable beastes vnto man by the working power of God, so is there in those small reasoned persons a certaine kinde of reuerence towarde wisedome and reasons, which they doe shewe oftentimes, and by power of persuasion are inforced to obey reason, will they nil they.
And hereby came it to passe, that ye rudenesse of the first age of man was brought vnto some more ciuill trade, as it is well declared by Cicero in the beginning of his first booke De inuentione Rethorica, where he saith thus: Nam suit quoddam tempus quum in agris homines passion bestiarum more vagahantur, sibi victu ferino vitam propagabant, nec ratione animi quicquam, sed plera{que} viribus corporis administrabant.
diuine religionis, non humani officij ratio colebatur: Nemo legitimas viderat nuptias, non quisquam inspexerat liberos, ius aequabile quid vnlitatis haberet, acceperat: ita propter errorem atque inscitiam. caeca ac dominatrix animi cupiditas, ad se viribus corporis abutebatur, perniciosissimis satellitibus.
Quo tempore quidam, magnus videlicet vir sapiens, cognouit quae maria esset, quanta ad maximas res oportunitas in animis si quis eam posset elicere, praecipiendo reddere: Qui dispersos homines in agris, in tectis syluestribus abditos ratione quadam compulit in vnum locum, congregauit: eos in vnamquamque rem inducens atque honestam primo propter insolentiam reclamantes, deinde propter rationem atque orationem studiosius audientes, ex feris immanibus mites reddidit, mansuetos.
to them which loue but little, and care much lesse for the knowledge of reason, but vnto your Maiestie (I dare say) it is a delectable remembrance, and vnto mee it seemed so pleasant, that coulde scarse staye my penne from writing all that mine eyes did so greedily reade.
This sentence of Cicero am lothe to translate into Englishe, partly for that vnto your Maiestie it needeth no translation, but especially knowing howe farre that grace of Tullies eloquence doth excell any English mans tongue, and much more exceedeth the basenesse of my barbarous style, yet for the fruite of the sentence, had rather vnto my meere English Countrymen vtter the rudenesse of my translation, than to defraud them of the benefite of so good a lesson, trusting they will also gladly and greedily imbrace all good sciences that may helpe to the iust furniture of the same, when they consider that informed reason was the onely Instrument, or ar least ye chiefe meane to bring men vnto Ciuile regiment, from barbarous manners and beastly conditions.
For the time was (saith Tullie) that men wandered abroad in the fields vp and downe like beasts, and vsed no better order in feeding than they, so that by reasons rule they wrought nothing, but moste of their doing did they atchiue by force of stre~gth.
At this time there was no iust regarde of religion towarde God, nor of duetie towarde man.
No man had seene right vse of mariage, neither did any man knowe their owne children from other, nor no man had felt the commodity of iust lawes: so that through errour and ignorance, wilfull lust, like a blinde and heady ruler, abused bodily strength as a most mortall minister for the satisfying of his desire.
At that time was there one, which not onely in power, but also in wisedome was great: and he considered, howe that in the mindes of men was bothe apte instrumentes, and greate occasion to the
due accomplishment of most weightie affaires, if a man coulde applie them to vse, and by teaching of rules frame them to better trade.
This man with persuasion of reason, gathered into one place the people that were wandring about the fieldes, and lay lurking in wilde cotages and woods: And bringing them into one common societie, did trade them to all such things, as either were profitable or honest, although not without repyning at ye first, by reason that they had not beene so accustomed before.
Yet at length through reason and persuasion of wordes they obeyed him more diligently, and so of a wilde and cruell people, he made them curteous and gentle.
Thus hath Tullie set forth the efficacie of reason and persuasion, howe it was able to conuert wilde people to a mildenesse, and to change their furious cruelnesse into cure.
Were it not nowe a great reproch in this our time (when knowledge raigneth so large) that men should shewe themselues lesse obsequious to reason? vnlesse it may be thought, that now euery man hauing sufficient knowledge of himselfe, needeth not to hearken to the persuasion of others.
Indeede he that thinketh himself wise, will not esteeme the reason of any other, be he neuer so wise, so that of such one it may well be saide, He that thinketh himselfe wiser than he is, may iustly be counted a double foole: wherefore such men are not to bee permitted in open audience to talke, but must be put to silence, and made to giue eare to reason, which reason consisteth not in a multitude of words, heaped rashly together, and applyed for one purpose, but reason is the expressing of a iust matter with wittie persuasions, furnished with learned knowledge.
Such knowledge had Moses being expert in all learning of the Aegyptians, as the Scriptures declare, and therefore was able to persuade the stubborne people of the
Such knowledge and such reasons did Druys shewe, which was the first lawe maker of all the West partes of Europe.
Like reason and wisedome did Xamolxis vse amongest the Gothes: Lycurgus vnto the Lacedemonians, Zeleucus to the Locrians, Solon to the Athenienses, and Donwallo Molmitius two thousande yeares past, amongst the olde Britanes of this realme.
And therby ti came to passe, that their lawes continued long, till more perfite reason altered many of them, and wilfull power oppressed moste of them.
At the beginning when these wise men perceiued howe harde it was to bring the rude people to vnderstande reason, they iudged the best meanes to attaine this honest purpose to depende of learning in euerie kind, for by learning, as Ouid saith: Pectora asperitas{que} fugit: Stoute stomackes doe waxe milde, and sharpe fiercenesse is exiled.
Therefore as Berosus doth testifie, Sarron that was the thirde King ouer all this West parte of Europe, for to bring the people from beastly rage to manly reason, did erect Schooles of liberall Artes which tooke so good successe, that his name continued in that sort famous aboue two thousand yeares after: for Diodorus Siculus, which was in the time of Iulius Caesar maketh me~+tion of the learned men of the Gothes, and named them Sarronides, that is to say, Sarron his Scholers and
Among these Artes that then were taught, some did in forme the tongue, and make men able both to vtter aptly their minde, and also to persuade, as Grammer, Logike, and Rhethorike, although not so couriously as in this time: some other did appertaine to the iust order of partition of Landes, the true vsing of waights, measures, and reckenings in all sorts of bargaines, and for order of building
Againe, to incourage men to the honour of God, they taught Astronomie, whereby the wonderfull workes of God were so manifestly set forth, that no mans tongue nor pen can in like sort expresse his infinite power, his vnspeakable wisedome, and his exceeding goodnesse toward man, wherby he doth bauntifully prouide for man all necessaries, not onely to liue, but also to liue pleasantly.
And so was their confidence in Gods prouidence strongly stayed, knowing his goodnesse to be such, that he woulde helpe man as he coulde, and his power to bee so great, that he could doe what he woulde: and thirdly his wisedome to be so pure, that he would doe nothing, but that was best.
Beside these Sciences they taught also Musike, which most commonly they did apply partely to religious Sciences, to drawe men to delight therein, partly to songs made of the maners of men in praise of Vertue, and discommendation of Vice, whereby it came to passe, that no man would displease them, nor do any thing euill that might come to their hearing:
for their Songs did make euill men more abhorred in that time, than any excommunication doeth in this time.
The posteritle of these Musitians continue yet both in Wales and Ireland called Bardes vnto this day, by the auncient name of Bardus, their first founder.
And as these Sciences did encrease, so did vertue increase thereby.
Againe, as these sciences did decaye, so vertue lost hir estimation, and consequently was little in vse: whereof to make a ful declaration, were a thing meet for a Prince to heare, but it woulde require a peculiar treatise.
Wherefore at this present count it sufficient lightly to haue touched this matter in generall wordes, and to say no more of the particularitie thereof, but onely touching one of those sciences, that is, Arithmetike, by
which not onely iust partition of landes was made, but also touching buying an selling, all assises, weights, and measures were deuised, and all reckenings and accounts driuen: yea by proportion of it, were the true orders of Iustice limited, as Aristotle in his Ethikes doth declare) the degrees of estates in the common wealth established.
Although that proportion be called Geometricall, and not Arithmeticall, yet doth that proportion appertaine to the Art of Arithmetike: in Arithmetike is taught the Progression of such proportions, and all things thereto belonging.
Wherefore may well say, that seeing Arithmetike is so many wayes needefull vnto the first planting of a common wealth, it must needes be as much required to the preseruation of it also: for by the same meanes is any common wealth continued, by which it was erected and established.
And if shall in smal matters in appearance, but in deede verie waightie, put one example or two, what shall we say for the statutes of this realme, which be the onely staie of good order in maner nowe? As touching the mesuring of ground by length and bredth, there is a good and an auncient statute made by Arte of Arithmetike, and now it shalbe to little vse, if by the same Art it be not practised and tried.
For the assyse of breade and drinke, the two most common and most necessarie thinges for the sustentation of man, there was a goodly ordinance in the Lawe made, which by ignorance hath so growen out of knowledge and vse, that fewe men doe vnderstand it, and therefore the statute bookes wonderfully corrupted, the commons cruelly oppressed: notwithstanding some me~ haue written, that it is too doubtful a matter to execute those Assises by those statutes, by reason they depend of the standerd of the coine, whiche is muche chaunged from the state of that time when those statutes were made.
the Abridgement of Statutes in the title of Waightes and Measures, in the seauenth number of the Englishe Booke, where hee shoulde haue translated a good ordinance, which is set forth in the French booke: but no maruaile if the Abridgement doth omit it, seeing the great booke of Statutes doth omitte the same Statute, as it hath done diuers other verie good lawes.
And this is the fruite of ignorance, to reiect all that it vnderstandeth not, although they vse some clokes for it: but such clokes, as being allowed, might serue to repell all good lawes, which God forbid.
Againe there is an auncient order for assise of fyre wood, and coales, which was renued not many yeares past, and nowe howe Auarice and Ignorance doth canuas the statute, it is too pitifull to talke of, and more miserable to feele.
Furthermore, for the Statute of Coinage, and the standerd thereof, if the people vnderstoode rightly the statute, they shoulde not, nor woulde not (as they often doe) gather an excuse for their follie therby, but as said, these statutes by wisedome and good knowledge of Arithmetike were made, by the same must they be continued.
And let Ignorance no more meddle with the vse of them, than it did with the making of them.
Oh in how miserable case is that Realme, where the Ministers and interpreters of the Lawes are destitute of all good sciences, which be the keyes of the laws? How can they either make good Laws, or maintaine them, that lack that true knowledge wherby to iudge them? And happie may that realme be accounted where the Prince himselfe is studious of learning, and desireth to vnderstande equitie in all lawes.
Therefore most happy are we the louing subiectes of your Maiestie which may see in your highnesse not onely such towardnesse, but also such knowledge of diuers Artes as
seldome hath bene seene in any Prince of such yeares, whereby we are inforced to conceiue this hope: Certainly, that he which in those yeares seeketh knowledge when knowledge is least esteemed, and of such an age can discerne them, to be enimes both to his royall person, and to his realme, which labour to withdrawe him from knowledge to exeessiue pastime, and from reasonable studie to ydle or noysome pleasures, he must needes, when he commeth to more mature yeares, be a most prudent Prince, a most iust Gouernour, and a right Iudge, not onely of his subiectes commonly, but also of the ministers of his lawes, yea, and of the Lawes themselues.
And to be able to conceiue the true equitie and exact vnderstanding of al his Lawes and Statutes, to the comfort of his good subiectes, and the confusion and reproch of them which labour to obscure or peruerte the equitie of the same lawes and statutes.
Howe some of those statutes may bee applied to vse, as well in our time, as in any other time, haue particularly declared in this Booke, some other haue omitted for iust considerations, till may offer them first vnto your Maiestie, to weigh them, as to your Highnesse shall seeme good: for many things in them are not to be published without your highnesse knowledge and approbation, namely because in them is declared all the rates of alloyes for all standerds from one ounce vpwarde, with other mysteries of Mynte matters, and also most part of the varieties of coynes, that haue beene currant in this your Maiesties realme by the space of sixe hundred yeares last past, and many of them that were currant in the time that the Romaines ruled here.
All which, with the auncient description of Englande and Irelande and my simple censure of the same, haue almost compleated to be exhibited to your Highnesse.
to accept this simple treatise, not worthy to be presented to so high a Prince, but that my lowly request to your maiestie is, that this amongst other of my bookes may passe vnder the protection of your highnesse, whom beseeche God most earnestly and dayly, according to my duetie, to aduaunce in all honour and princely regalitie, and to increase in all knowledge, iustice, and godly policie.
SORE oftetimes haue lamented with my selfe the infortunate co~dition of England, seeing so many great Clerks to arise in sundrie other partes of the world, and so few to appeare in this our nation: whereas for pregnancie of naturall witte (I thinke) few nations doe excell English men: But cannot impute the cause to any other thing than to the conte~pt or misseregard of learning.
For as Englishmen are inferior to no men in mother witte, so they passe all men in vaine pleasures, to which they may attaine with great paine or labour: and are as slacke to any, neuer so great commoditie, if there hang of it any paineful studie or trauelsome labour.
Howbeit, yet all men are not of that sort, though the most part be, the more pitie it is: but of them that are so glad, not onlie with paineful studie and studious paine to attaine learning, but also with as great studie paine to communicate their learning to others, and make all England, if it might be, partakers of the same, the moste part are suche, that vnneth they can support their owne
necessarie charges, so that they are not able to beare any charges in doing of that good, that else they desire to do.
But a greater cause of lamentation is this: that when learned men haue taken paines to do things for the aide of the vnlearned, scarce they shall be allowed for their wel doing, but derided and scorned, and so vtterlye discouraged to take in hand any like enterprice againe.
So that if any be founde (as there are some) that do fauour learning and learned wittes, and can bee content to further knowledge, yea only with their word, such persons, though they bee rare, yet shall they encourage learned men to enterprise some things, at the least, that Engla~d may reioice of.
And haue good hope that England wil (after she hath taken some sure taste of learning) not only bring forth more fauorers of it, but also such learned men, that she shall bee able to compare with anie realme in the world.
But in the meane season, where so few regarders of learning are, how greatly they are to be esteemed that doe fauour and further it, my penne wyll not suffice at ful to declare.
Therefore, gentle reader, where as doe vppon moste iust occasion iudge, yea and know assuredlie, that there be some men in this realme, which both loue, and also much desire to further good learning, and yet am not well able to write their condigne praise for the same, thinke it better with silence to ouerpasse it, then eyther to say too little of it, or to prouoke againste them the malice of suche other, which do nothing themselues that is praise worthie, and therfore can not abide to heare the praise of any other mans good deede.
And considering their greate fauour vnto learning, though my selfe be not worthie to be reckoned in the number of great learned men, yet am bolde to put my selfe in preace with such abilitie, as God hath lent mee
thoughe not with so greate cunning as manye men, yet with as great affection as any man, to help my countrymen, and wil not cease dayly, (as much as my small abilitie wil suffer me) to endite some such thing, that shall be to the instruction, though not of learned men.
yet at the least of the vulgare sort, whose argument alwayes shall be such, that it shall delight al learned wits, though they do not learne any great things out of it.
But to speake of this present Booke of Arithmetick, dare not nor wil not set it foorth with any words, but remit it to the iudgement of all gentle readers, namelie such as loue good learning, beseeching them so to esteeme it, as it doth seeme worthie.
And so either to accept the thing for it selfe, either at the leaste to allowe my good endeauour.
But perceiue neede not vse anye persuasions vnto them, whose gentle nature and fauourable minde is readie to receiue thankefullye, and interpreate to the best, of al suche enterprices attempted for lo good an ende, though the thing do not alwayes satisfie mens expectation.
This considered, did bolden me to publish abroade this little Booke of the Arte of numbring, which if you shal receiue fauourablie, you shal encourage me to gratifie you hereafter with some greater thing.
And as iudge some menne of so louing a minde to their natiue countrey that they woulde much reioyce to see it to prosper in good learning and wittie Artes, so hope well of all the rest of Englishmen, that they wyl not be vnmindeful of his due praise, by whose meanes they are helped and furthered in anye thing.
Neither ought to esteeme this thing of so little value, as manye men of little discretion oftentimes do: For who so setteth small price by the wittie deuise and knowlege of numbring, he little considereth it to be the chiefe point (in manner) wherby men differ from all bruite beastes:
for as in al other things, (almost) beastes are partakers with vs, so in numbring we differ cleane from them, and in manner peculiarlie, fith that in manie things they excel vs againe.
The Fox in craftie witte exceedeth most men, dogge in smelling hath no man his peere, To foresight of weather if you looke then, Many beastes excel man, this is cleere.
The wittinesse of Elephants doth letters attaine, But what cunning doth there in the Beeremaine? The Emmet foreseeing the hardenesse of winter, Prouideth vitailer in the time of Sommer.
The Nightingale, the Lines, the Thrush, the Larke, In Musical harmonie passe manie a Clarke.
The Hedgehog of Astronomie seemeth to knowe And stoppeth his caue, where the wind doth blowe The Spider in weauing such are doth show, No man can him mende, nor follow trow.
When a house wil fall, the Mice right quicke, Flee thence before, can man do the like?
Many things else of the wittinesse of beasts byrdes might heere saye, saue that another time entende to write wherein they excel in manner all men, as it is daylie seene: but in number was there neuer beast found so cunning, that coulde know or discerne one thing from manye, as by daylie experience you may well consider, when a Bitch hath manie whelpes, or a Hen many Chickens: and likewise of other whatsoeuer they be, take fro~ them al their yong, sauing onlie one, and you shall perceiue plainly, that they misse none, though they wil resist you in taking them away, and wil seeke them again if they may know where they bee, but else they wil neuer misse hem truelye, but take awaie that one that is
left, and then wil they crie and complaine: and restore to them that one, then are they pleased againe: so that of nu~ber this may iustlie say, It is the only thing (almost) that separateth man from beastes.
He therefore that shal contemne number, he declareth himselfe as brutish as a beast, and vnworthy to be counted in felowship of men.
But trust there is no man so foule ouerseene, thoughe manie right smallie do it regarde.
Therefore wil now stay to write against suche, and returne againe to this booke, whiche haue written in the forme of a Dialogue, bicause iudge that to bee the easiest way of instruction, when the Scholer may aske euerie doubt orderlie, and the maister may answer to his question plainelie.
Howbeit thinke not the contrary, but as it is easier to blame an other mans worke than to make the lyke, so there wil be some that wil finde fault, bicause write in a Dialogue: but as coniecture, those shal be suche, as doe not, cannot, either will not perceiue the reason of right teaching and therefore are vnmeete to be aunswered vnto, for such men with no reason wil be satisfied.
And if any man obiect that other bookes haue bene written of Arithmetike alreadie so sufficientlie, that needed not now to put pen to the booke, except will condemn other mens writings: to them aunswer.
That as condemne no mans diligence, so know that no one ma~ can satisfie euerie man, and therefore like as manye do esteme greatly other Bookes, so doubt not but some wil like this my Booke aboue any other English Arithmetike hitherto wrtiten, and namely such as shall lacke instructers, for whose sake haue so plainely set foorthe the examples, as no Booke (that haue seene) hath done hitherto: whyche thing shall bee greate ease to the rude readers.
small aide to the learned sorte, yet vnto the simple ignorant (which needeth most help) it may be a good furtherance and meane vnto knowledge.
And though vnto the King his Maiestie priuatelye doe it dedicate, yet doubt not (suche is his clemencie) but that hee can bee content, yea and much desirous, that all his louing subiects shal take the vse of it, and employ the same to their most profit: Which thing if perceiue that they thankefullie do, and receiue with as good will as it was written, then wil shortly with no lesse kindnesse set forth suche introductions in to Geometry and Cosmography, as haue at other times promised, and as hitherto in English hath not bene enterprised, wherwith dare say al honest heartes wil be pleased, and all studious wittes greatlye delighted.
wil say no moreÂ· but let euerie man iudge as he shal see cause.
And thus for this time will staye my penne, committing you all to that true fountaine of perfect number, which wrought the whole world by number and measure: he is Trinitie in Vnitie, and Vnitie in Trinitie: To whom be all praise, honor and glorie.
Here folovveth a Table of al the Contents of this Booke.

dialogue betwene THE MAYSTER and the Scholer, teaching the Arte and vse of Arithmetike with penne.
SYR, SVCH is your authoritie in myne estimation, yt am content to consent to your saying, and to receyue it as truthe, thoughe sÃ©e none other reason that doth leade me there vnto: wheras else in mine owne conceite it appeareth but vaine, to bestowe any time priuately in learning of that thing, that euery childe maye and doeth learne at all times and houres, when he doeth anye thyng hymselfe alone, and
Lo this is the fashion and chance of all them that sÃ©eke to defende their blynde ignoraunce: that when they thinke they haue made strong reason for themselfe, than haue they proued quite co~trary.
For if nu~bring be so co~mon (as you grant it to be) that no man can do any thing alone, and much lesse talke or bargayne with other, but he shall stil haue to do with Number: this proueth not Number to be contemptible and vile, but rather right excellent and of high reputation, sith it is the grounde of all mens affayres, so that without it no tale can be tolde, no communication wythout it can be long continued, no bargayning without it can duely bÃ©e ended, or no busynesse that man hathe, iustlye completed.
These commodities (if there wer none other) are sufficiente to approue the worthynesse of Number.
But there are other vnnumerable farre passing all these, whyche declare Number to excÃ©ede al praise.
Wherefore, in all great workes are Clerkes so muche desired? Wherefore are Auditours so richely fedde? What causeth Geometrians so highlye to be enhaunced? Why
are Astronomers so greately aduaunced? Bycause that by Number suche things they doe finde, whiche else shoulde far excel mans minde.
Verilye Syr if it be so, that these men, by numbring their cunning do attaine, at whose great workes most men doe wonder, then see well was much deceyued, and numbring is a more cunning thing then toke it to be.
If Number were so vile a thing as you did estÃ©eme it, then nÃ©ede it not to bÃ©e vsed so muche in mennes communication.
Howe manye dayes in a wÃ©eke? howe many wÃ©ekes in a yeare? What lands hath your father? Howe manye men doth hÃ©e kÃ©epe? How long is it sith you came fro~ hym to me? Scholer.
So that if Number want, you answeare all by Mummes: How many myle to London? Schole.
Why, thus you may sÃ©e, what rule Number beareth, and that if Number be lacking, it maketh men dumbe, so that to moste questions, they muste aunswere Mum. Scholer.
This is the cause sir, that iudged it so vile, bycause it is so common in talking euery while: For plentie is not deintie, as the common saying is.
No, nor Store is no sore: perceiue you this? The more common that a thing is, being nÃ©edefully required, the better is the thyng, and the more to be desired.
But in Numbring as some of it is light and playn, so the most parte is difficulte, and not easye to attaine.
The easyer parte serueth al men in commune, and the other parte requireth some learning.
Wherefore as without Nu~bring a man can doe almoste nothing, so wyth the helpe of it, you maye attaine to all things.
Sc. Yea sir? Why? then it wer best to learn the Art of Numbring firste of all other learning, and then a man neede learn no more, if all other come with it.
Nay not so: but if it be firste learned, then shall a manne be able (I meane)
to learne, perceyue, and attayne to other sciences, whiche without it, he shoulde neuer get.
perceyue by your former words, that Astronomie and Geometrie depende muche of the helpe of Numbring, but that other Sciences, as Musicke, Phisicke, Lawe, and Grammer and such like, haue any helpe of Arithmetike, perceyue not.
maye perceyue youre greate Clerkelinesse by the ordering of your Sciences: but wil let that passe now, bycause it toucheth not the matter that entend, and wyll shewe you howe Arithmetike doeth profit in all these, somewhat grossely, according to your small vnderstanding, omitting other reasons more substantial.
Fyrste (as you recken them) Musicke hath not only greate healpe of Arithmetike, but is made, and hath his perfectnesse of it: for all Musicke standeth by Number Proportion.
And in Phisicke, beside the calculation of Criticall dayes, with other things whiche omitte, howe can anye manne iudge the Pulse rightlye, that is ignoraunte of the
proportion of Numbers? And as for the Lawe, it is playne, that the man that is ignorant of Arithmetike, is neither mÃ©ete to be a Iudge, neyther an Aduocate, nor yet a Proctour.
For howe can hÃ©e wel vnderstande another mannes cause appertayning to distribution of goods, or other dettes, or of summes of money, if he bÃ©e ignorante of Arithmetike? This oftentimes causeth righte to be hindered, when the Iudge either deliteth not to heare of a matter that he peceyueth not, or cannot Iudge it for lacke of vnderstanding: This commeth by the ignoraunce of Nowe as for Grammer, mÃ©e thinketh you shoulde not doubte in what it nÃ©edeth number, sith you haue learned that Nounes of al sorts, Pronouns, Verbs, Participles, are distinct diuersly by Numbers: besides the varietie of Nounes of Numbre, and Aduerbs.
And if you take away Number from Grammer, then is all the quantitie of Syllables loste.
Whereby were al kindes of meters found and made? Was it not by Number?
But howe nÃ©edefull Arithmetike is to all parts of Philosophie, they may soone sÃ©e, that doe reade eyther Aristotle, Plato, or anye other Philosophers writing.
For all theyr examples almoste, and their probations, depende of Arithmetike.
It is the saying of Aristotle, that he that is ignorante of Arithmetike is mÃ©ete for no science.
And Plato his Mayster wrote a like sentence ouer hys Schoolehouse dore.
Let none enter in hyther (quoth he) that is ignorant of Geometrie.
SÃ©eyng he woulde haue al his Scholers experte in Geometrie, much rather he woulds the same in Arithmetike, wythoute whyche Geometrie cannot stande.
And howe needefull is to Diuinitie, it appeareth, seeing so many Doctors gather so greate mysteries out of Number, and so muche doe write of it.
And if should goe about to write all the commodities of Arithmetike in ciuil actes, as in gouernaunce of common weales in time of peace, and in due prouision and order of armyes in time of warre: For numbring of the summing of their wages, prouisions of victualles, vewing of Artillerie, wyth other armoure:
Beside the cunningest pointe of all, for casting of ground, for encamping of men, with such other like.
And howe manye wayes also Arithmetike is conducible for all priuate weales, of Lordes and all possessioners, of marchauntes, and all other occupyers, and generallye, for all estates of men, besides Auditours, treasorers, receyuers, stewards, bayliffes, and suche lyke, whose offices without Arithmetike is nothing.
If should (I saye) particularlye repeate all suche commodities of this noble Science of Arithmetike, it were ynoughe to make a verye great booke.
No, no sir, you shall not nÃ©ede: For doubt not, but this that you haue said, were ynoughe to perswade anye manne to thinke this Arte to be righte excellent and good, and so necessarie for man, that (as thinke nowe) so muche as a man lacketh of it, so muche he lacketh of his sense and witte.
What? are you so farre chaunged since, by hearing the fewe commodities in generall? By likelihode you woulde be far chaunged, if you knew all the commodities particular.
besÃ©eche you sir, reserue those commodities that rest yet behynd, vnto their place more conuenient.
And if ye will be so good as to vtter at thys tyme thys excellente treasure, so that maye bÃ©e somewhat enriched thereby, and if euer shall be able, wil requite your paine.
Mayster, am very glad of your requeste, and will doe it spÃ©edely, sith that to learne it you be so ready.
And to youre authoritie my witte doe subdue, whatsoever you say, take it for true.
That is too muche, and mÃ©ete for no man to be belÃ©eued in all things, without shewing of reason.
Thoughe mighte of my Scholler some credence require, yet except shew reason, do it not desire.
But now sith you are so earnestly set this Arte to attaine, beste it is to omitte no time, least some other passion, coole this greate heate, and then you leaue off before you sÃ©e the ende.
Thoughe manye there be so vnconstant of mind, that flitter and turne with euerye winde, whyche often beginne, and neuer come to the ende, am none of their sorte, as truste you partelye knowe.
For by my good will what ons beginne till haue it fully ended woulde neuer blin Mayster.
So haue Founde you hytherto in deede and truste you will increase rather than go backe.
For better it were neuer to assaye, than to shrinke and flÃ©e in the middle way.
But trust you wil not so do, therefore tel me briefly.
What call you the science that you desiere so greatly? Scholer Why sir? you knowe.
For, greate rebuke it were to haue studied a Science, and yet cannot tel howe it is named, Scholer.
Bothe names are coruptly written, Arsmetrike for Arithmetik, as the GrÃ©ekes call it, Augrim for Algorisme, as the Arabians sound it, whiche bothe betoken the science of Numbring.
GrÃ©eke, is called number: and of it commeth Arithmetike, the Art of Numbring.
So that Arithmetike is a science or arte teaching the maner and vse of Numbring.
This Art may be wrought diuersly, with Penne or wyth Counters.
But wil first shew you the working wyth the Penne, and then the other in order.
But how many thinges are to be learned, to attayne this Arte fullye? Maister.
There are reckened commonlye seauen partes or workes of it.
Numeration, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication Diuision, Progression, and extraction of rootes: to these some men adde Duplation, Triplation, and Mediation.
But as for these laste thrÃ©e, they are contained vnder the other seauen.
For Duplation and Triplation, are contained vnder Multiplication, as it shall appeare in their place.
And Mediation is contained vnder Diuision, as wyl declare in his place also.
Yet then there remaine the firste seauen kindes of Numbring.
So there dothe: Howbeit, if shall speake exactelye of partes of Numbring
muste make but fiue of them: For Progression is a compound operation of Addition, Multiplication and Diuision.
But it is no harme to name them as kindes seuerall, sÃ©eing they appÃ©ere to haue some seueral worki~g.
For it forceth not so much to conte~d for the number of them, as for the due knowledge and practising of them.
Then you wil, that shall name them as seauen kindes distinct.
But nowe desyre you to instructe me in the vse of ech of them.
So will I, but it muste be done in order: for you maye not learne the last as soone as the firste, but you must learne them in that order, as did rehearse them, if you wyll learne them spÃ©edily and well.
Then to begin, Numeration is the firste in order: what shall doe with it? Maister.
Firste you muste know what the thing is, and then after learne the vse of the same.
NVMERATION is that Arithmeticall skill, whereby we may duely value, expresse and reade anye number or summe propounded: or else in apte figures and places, set down any number knowen or named.
Why? then me thinketh you put a difference vetwÃ©ene the value and the Fygures? Mayster.
Yea so doe I: For the valewe is one thing, and the figures are an other thing: and that commeth partely by the diuersity of figures, but chieflye of the places wherein they be set.
Then muste knowe there thrÃ©e thinges: the Value, the Figure, and the Place.
Euen so: but yet adde Order to them as the fourth.
And firste marke, that there are but tenne figures, that are vsed in Arithmetike: and of those tenne, one doth signifie nothing, whiche is made like an and is called priuately a Cyphre, thoughe all the
The other nine are called Signifying figures, and be thus figured.
But here muste you marke, that euery Figure hathe two values: One alwayes certain that it signifieth properly, which it hath of his forme: and the other vncertaine, which he taketh of his place.
Place is called the seate or roome that a Figure standeth in.
And looke howe manye Figures are written in one summe, so manye places hathe that whole number.
And the firste place muste bÃ©e called that that is nexte to the ryghte hande, and so reckoning by order towardes the lefte hande, so that that place is laste, that is nexte to the lefte hande.
As for example: If there stoode before you sixe men in a rowe, side by side, and you shoulde tell them as they stand in order, beginning wyth the man that were nexte to youre righte hande: then hÃ©e that were nexte hym shoulde bÃ©e called the seconde, and so foorthe to the farthest from
your ryghte hande, whyche is the sixt and the laste.
Syr, perceiue you well: so might recken letters or anye other thing.
As if shoulde write eight letters after this order, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, now muste say h, is the first the ij, the iij, the iiij, the v, the vj, the vij, and a the viij.
And after the same sort vse hereafter, that what declare by one example, doe you expresse by an other, and so shall perceyue whether you vnderstande it or no.
And so passe ouer nothing, till you perceiue it well, and be experte therein.
Sir, pray you howe manye of these places be there in all? Maister.
There is no certaine number of them, but they are sometimes more and somtimes fewer, according to the summe that is expressed.
For so many as the figures are, so many are the places: and the laste place is so called, not bycause it is laste of all other, but it is the laste of that present summe, and it maye bÃ©e the middle place in an other summe.
Me sÃ©emeth perceiue this verye well, as touchyng the order of reckoning
of the places: But as for the number of them, you say there is no certaintie.
Nowe there resteth to declare the value of the figures by diuersity of places, which you called, the Value vncertaine.
But firste let me heare whether you knowe perfectly the certaine value.
Write these thrÃ©e numbers eache by it selfe as speake them .vij.iiij.iij.
How write you these foure other, ij, j, ix, viij? Scholer.
Sir, truth it is, was too blame, tooke for but will be warer hÃ©reafter.
Nowe then take hÃ©ede, these certaine valewes euerye figure representeth, when it is alone written withoute other Fygures
And also when it is in the firste place, though manye other doe followe: as for example: This figure is ix. standing now alone.
Howe? is he alone and standeth in the middle of so many letters? Maister.
For if you were in Fraunce in the middle of a M. Frenche men, if there were no English man with you, you woulde recken your selfe to be alone.
Then without more figures of Arithmetike, betokeneth ix, whatsoeuer other letters be aboute it.
Euen so, and so dothe it, if it be in the firste place ioyned with other, how many soeuer do followe, as in this example,
you sÃ©e in the firste place, and doth betoken nine, as if he were alone.
And dothe not that standeth in the seconde place, betoke vij? and in the third place, betoken vj? And so in the fourth place, betoken thrÃ©e? Maister.
Their places be as you haue said, but their valewes are not so.
For as in the firste place, euerye figure betokeneth hys owne value certaine onelye, so in the second
place euery figure betokeneth hys owne valew certaine ten times: as in the example, in the seconde place is seuen times x, that is, lxx.
And in the third place, euery figure betokeneth his owne valewe a hundreth times, so that in that place betokneth vj.C.
And in the fourth place, euery figure betokeneth his owne value a M. tymes, as in the foresaid number
And in the place, euerye figure standeth for his owne valewe x.M. times.
And in ye place a M.M. times: And in ye viij. place x.M.M. so yt euerye place excÃ©edeth the former x. times.
As thus: if make Number at al aduentures, heere are eyght places.
In the first place is and betokeneth but foure: in the second place is and betokneth x. times that is, In the third place is and betokeneth sixe hundreth: In the
And in the fifth place is x.M. times that is, fiftie M. So in the sixte place, is a C.M. times that is CCC.M.
And in the eighte place tenne thousande thousande times that is xc.M.M.
First putte a ouer the fourth figure, and so ouer the seauenth.
And (if you haue so many) ouer the tenth, thirtÃ©enth, sixteenth, and so forth, still leauing two figures betwÃ©ene eche two prickes.
And those twoo roomes between ye pricks, are called ternaries.
Then begin at the last pricke, and see how many figures are betwÃ©ene him and the end, which can not passe thrÃ©e, reconing hymselfe for one: then pronounce them as if they were written alone from the reste, and adde at the end of theyr valewe so many times thousand as your number hath prickes.
After that come to the nexte thrÃ©e figures, and sounde them as if they were aparte from the rest, and adde to their valewe so manye tunes thousandes, and there are prickes bÃ©etwene them, and the first place of your whole number.
And so do by euery other three Figures following, if you haue moe.
Put a pricke ouer in the fourth place, and ouer in the seauenth place, and then no more, (for your places come not to tenne) as thus:
Nowe go to the last pricke ouer and take it and the figure that foloweth it, and value them alone.
So is it: but then adde for the number of your prickes twice M. Scholer.
Then take the thrÃ©e other figures from one to the next pricke, and value them.
Now adde for the one prickeÂ· that is betwÃ©ene them and the firste place, M. Scholer.
And at the end of the laste number you shall adde nothing, bicause there remayneth no pricke nor number after it: yet proue in an other number, as thus,
haue pricked them as you taught me: but am in doubt, whether haue done well or no, bycause of the Cyphars: for remember, you tolde me that they doe signifie nothing, and
therefore doubte whether shoulde recken them for a figure in setting of the pricks: and againe, know not wherefore they serue.
IndÃ©ede they are of no value themselues, but they serue to make vppe number of places, and so maketh the figure following them to bÃ©e in a further place, and therefore to signify the more value: as in this example the Ciphre is of no value, but yet he occupieth the fyrste place, and causeth to be in the seconde place, and so to signifie tenne times that is, xc, so that two Ciphres thrusteth the figure following them, into the thirde place, and so forth.
Then perceiue in the example aboue haue pricked wel ynough: for tho gh that Ciphre that is pricked signifie nothing, yet must he haue the pricke, bicause he came in the xiij place.
And what shall nowe doe? There is a Cyphre in the third place, and no figure after him, but they that haue reckened.
He didde serue for them that you haue alreadye reckened, to make them in a
place further than they shoulde be if he were away: and therefore nowe you shall let him goe.
And so doe alwayes when he occupieth that place next before any pricke, whiche is the laste of that Ternarie, and a Cyphre in the laste place doth nothing.
Nowe are all my prickes spent, and yet remaine so that muste value them CCC.xl. only.
Nowe can you recken after thys sorte: and remember, that euery such roume so parted, is called a Ternarie or Trinitie.
Some doe parte such great numbers with letters, after this manner.
In whyche example yÃ©e maye sÃ©e, that a supplyeth the roume of your pricke.
And some doe parte the numbers with lines after this forme. math. where you sÃ©e as many lines as you made prickes, and is one intente, saue that the lines doe more plainely parte euery thrÃ©e figures, according as they shoulde be valewed vnder one Denomination.
Yea sir, but if you shoulde shewe me a number so parted, shoulde take it for many numbers, and not for one.
But what if didde set forth the number without lines, and your selfe (for the ease of reckning) did so part it with lines, woulde you forget wherefore ye did it, and then take them for many numbers? Scholer.
Thou vse that that you like best, for all the thrÃ©e wayes are to one intent, saue (as said) that the lines vs more plainely distinct the denominations.
It is the laste value or name added to any summe.
And likewise in saying: as men, men is the Denomination, and so of other.
But in this place (that spake of before) the laste number of euery Ternarie, is the Denomination of it.
As of the first Ternarie, the denomination is vnites, and of the seconde.
Ternarie, the Denomination is thousandes: and of the thirde Ternarie, thousand
thousandes, or millions: of the iiij. thousande thousand thousandes, or thousande Millions: and soforth.
And what shall call the value of the iij. figures that maye bÃ©e pronounced before the Denominators? as in saying: that is CCiij. millions.
perceyue by youre wordes, that millions is the Denomination: but what shal call the CCiij. ioyned before the Millions? Maister.
That is called the Numerator or valewer, and the whole summe that resulteth of them bothe, is called the Summe, value or number.
Nowe is there anye thing else to be learned in Numeration? or else haue learned it sully? Maister.
might here shew you who were the firste inuentors of this Arte, and the reasons of all these things that haue taughte you, but that wil reserue till ye haue learned ouer all the practise of this Arte, leaste shoulde trouble your witte, with ouer many things at the firste.
But yet this muste you marke, that there are thrÃ©e kindes of number: one called Digits, an other articles, and the thirde mixte
And with al other that maye be diuided into tenne parts iust, and nothing remaine, are called Articles: suche are &c. &c.
And that number is called mixt, that containeth Articles, or at the leaste one article, and a digit: as
And for the more ease of vnderstanding and remembraunce marke this: The diget number is neuer written wyth more than one figure, but the article and the mixt number are euer wrytten wyth more than one figure.
And thus they differ, that the article hathe euermore this Cyphre c, in the firste place: and the mixte number hathe euer there some Diget.
By these laste wordes, perceiue it muche better than did before, and now (I thinke) wil neuer misse to knowe those thrÃ©e asunder.
If you remember nowe all that haue sayde, you haue learned sufficientlye this firste kinde of Arithmetike, called Numeration, Howbeit, will yet exhorte you
nowe, to remember bothe this that haue saide, and all that shall saye, and to exercise your selfe in the practise of it: For Rules without practise, are but a light knowledge: and practise it is, that maketh menne perfect and prompt in all things.
And as you haue learned to gather and expresse the value of a summe propounded, and set downe before you: so muste you practise to marke note, or write downe, with apte figures, and in due places, any number, onely named or recited to you, or of your selfe imagined: as for a proofe: How note you, or write downe this summe, fiue thousande, two hundreth, fiftie and seuen.
This troubleth me nowe, whether shoulde beginne at the firste figure or at the last.
For reason (me thinketh) should cause me to beginnne at the firste: and yet if write it as you speake it, muste beginne at the laste.
When you knowe youre places perfectly, you maye beginne where you list.
But the more ease for your hande is to begin with the laste, that is to say, as did speake them.
Yet for the more suretie, a while you maye beginne with the firste, repeating my
wordes backewarde thus: Seauen, Fiftie, two hundreth, fiue thousande: or else sounding them all by their diget or valewer, as thus: seauen, fiue, two, fiue: for that way is easiest.
But then muste you looke wel, whether there be any Ciphre in your summe that he may be sette in his place.
As if youre last valewer of youre summe (as you speake it) be aboue then is there a Cyphre in the first place.
And if it be a hundred or aboue, then is there two Cyphres one in the first place, an other in the seconde, and so forth.
But bicause this thing is such that cannot be set forth without manye wordes, think beste here nowe at the ende of Numeration to adde a table easie and ready for the first exercise of it.
This Table (as you may sÃ©e) hathe eleuen places, and in eche of them are sette al the digites, whose certaine value is written in the right hande of the Table, the value vncertaine
So that by this table you may learne bothe howe to expresse anye number that you liste, (if that it excÃ©ede not eleauen places) that is to say, lxxxx. thousand Millions, and so maye you by the helpe of it, value all summes proposed vnder the sayde number.
For example: take the summe that proposed before, which was fiue thousand, two hundred, fiftie and seauen.
And if you wil expresse it, take the firste number (as speake it) which is fiue M. whose valuer or certaine value is v. and his vncertaine value or denomination is M.
First you shall sÃ©eke at the right hand of the valuer v. Then sÃ©eke along vnder the tytle of Denomination towarde the left hande, til you find thousands, and vnder it right at the soote of the Table, is the number of the place, that is the fourthe, wherein you muste write youre diget or valuer fiue.
Afterwarde come to the seconde parte of the number, two hundred, whose valuer is and his denomination C. SÃ©eke two at the right hande of the Table, and goe along vnder the denominations towarde the lefte hande, til you come vnder C: then looke to
the table, and there shall you sÃ©e the number of the place, that is to say, thrÃ©e, wherein you muste set your diget
Then doe so by your other two numbers that remaine, and you shall finde fiue in the second place for your fiftie, and in the first place for your seauen.
perceiue you sÃ©eke to instruct me most plainly and brieflye, and not to hide youre knowledge with subtile wordes as many doe.
For this rule is so plaine, that can desire it no plainer.
And though it seeme somwhat long, yet perceiue it to be a sure way.
So is it, and thoughe it be long, yet it is neyther too long, neyther too plaine for yong learners that lacke practise: for this table is in steade of a teacher, to them that lacke one.
But nowe truste haue said ynough of Numeration: which after you haue wel practised, then may you learne forth.
Yet praye you in one thing to tel me your iudgement.
Why do men recken the order of the places backewarde, from the right hand to the lefte? Maister.
which first inuented this Arte did set these figures as they set all their letters: for they wryte backewarde as you terme it, and so do they reade.
And that may appeare in all Hebrue, Chaldeye, and Arabike bookes, for they bÃ©e not only written fro~ the right hande to the lefte, and so muste bÃ©e read, but also the right end of the booke is the beginning of it: whereas the GrÃ©ekes Latines, and all nations of Europe, do write reade from the left hande towarde the right: And all their bookes begin at the left side.
It neyther mÃ©e, neyther lyketh me well, bycause sÃ©e that the Chaldeys and Hebrues doe not so vse their owne numbers, as at another tyme will declare.
But this playne reason may best satisfie you presently: That sÃ©eing in pronouncing of numbers we kÃ©ep the order of our owne reading, from the lefte hande to the right: And againe, we doe euer name the greater numbers before ye smaller: it was reason, that the lesser places conteyning the lesser numbers, should be set on the right hand, and the greater places conteining the greater numbers, to procÃ©ede toward the left hande.
This reason is to me so plaine, that it sÃ©emeth now againste reason to make a doubte of that order.
So that nowe for Numeration am satisfied: so that onelye practise shal make me fully ready and expert in it.
And in the meane season, desire to learne the other kindes of Arithmetike.
That is well saide: but what should you next learne can you tel? Scholer.
Euen so, and what that is muste you firste knowe, ADDITION.
ADditio~ is the gathering togither and bringing of twoo numbers or more into one totall summe: as if haue Bookes in the Latyne tong, and in the GrÃ©eke tongue, and would know how many they be in all, muste write these two numbers one ouer an other, writing the greatest number highest, so that the first figure of the one, bÃ©e vnder the firste figure of the other.
When you haue so done, draw vnder them a right line, then wil they stand thus.
math Nowe beginne at the firste places, toward the right hande alwayes, and putte togither the two first figures of those two numbers, and looke what commeth of them, write vnder them, right vnder math the line.
And then go to the second figures, math and doe likewise: as in saying, and is write vnder and as here you sÃ©e.
And like wise do you with the figures math that be in the third place, saying: and be write vnder the~, and then will your whole summe appeare thus.
So that now you sÃ©e, that and doe make in all,
What? this is very easie to doe, me thinketh can do it euen sith.
There came thorough Cheapeside twoo droues of cattell: in the first was shÃ©epe, and in the second was other beastes.
Those two summes muste math write as you taughte me, thus.
Then if put the two first figures math togither, saying: and they make
First, in going about to adde togyther two summes of sundrie things, whiche you ought not to doe, excepte you sÃ©eke onelis the number of them, care not for the things.
For the summe that should resulte of that addition, should be a summe neither of shÃ©epe, nor other beastes, but a confused summe of both.
Howbeit sometimes yÃ©e shal haue summes of diuers denominations to be added, of which will tell you anone: but first will shew you, where you were deceiued in an other pointe, and that was in writing (which came of and vnder and which is vnpossible.
For, howe can twoo figures of twoo places be written vnder one figure, and one place? Scholer.
saide indÃ©ede, that you shoulde write that vnder them, that did resulte of the~
both togither: which saying is alwayes true, if that summe do not excÃ©ede a Digit.
But if it be a mixte number, then muste you write the Digit of it vnder your figures, as haue said before: but and if it be an Article, then write vnder them, and in both sortes you shall kepe the article in your mind.
And therfore when you haue added your seconde figures, which occupy the place of tennes, you shall put that therto, which you kept in your minde: for though it were ten indÃ©ede, yet in that place it is but as one, because, that euerie of that place, is ten, for it is the place of tens.
And in like manner: if you haue in the second place so great a number, that it amounteth aboue then write the digite, and reserue the article in your mind, euer adding it to the next place following: and so of all other places, how many so euer you haue.
And if you haue a mixt number, when you haue added your last figures, then write the digit vnder the last figures, and the article in the next place beyond them: so shall your number resulting of Addition, haue one place more than the numbers which you should adde togither.
reason of this is, (as vnderstande) because that no one place can contain aboue which is the greatest figure that is, and then all tens or articles must be put to the next place following: for euerie place (as may sÃ©e) excÃ©edeth the other place next before him, by
Now (if it please you) will returne to my example of Cattell.
But remember you saide, might not adde summes of sundry things togither, and that might sÃ©e by reason.
Trueth it is, if you sÃ©eke the due summe of anie things, but if you onelie seeke a bare summe, haue no respect to the thing, then were it better to name the summe onely without anie thing, as in saying wythout naming shepe, or any thing else.
Now let me see: howe can you adde those two summes? Scholer.
must first set them so, that the two first figures stand one ouer an other, and the other each one ouer his fellow of the same place: then shall drawe a line vnder them both.
And so likewise of other figures, setting alwayes the greatest number highest, thus, as foloweth:
Then must adde to which math maketh that is mixte number: therefore muste take the diget which is and write it vnder kÃ©eping ye article in my mind thus.
Nexte that doe come to the second figures, adding them togither, saying, and make to which put the reserued in my minde, and that maketh of which number write the diget vnder and kepe the article in my mind thus: math Then come to the thirde figures, saying: and make and in my minde maketh
Then of write the cipher vnder and and kÃ©epe the article in my mind.
What nÃ©edeth that, sÃ©eing there followeth no more figures? Scholer.
The~ sÃ©eing am come to the last figures, muste write the cipher vnder them, and the article math in a further place after the cipher, thus: Mayster.
So now ye sÃ©e, that of and added together, there amounteth
There are two armies of souldiours: in the one are and in the other How many are there in both armies say you? Scholer.
Firste sette them one ouer an other, beginning with the firste math numbers at the right ha~d, thus.
But the neather nu~ber wil not match the ouer number.
Then doe adde math to and there amounteth that must write vnder ye first place, thus.
Then likewise in the seconde place adde to and there math ariseth which write vnder the second place, thus.
Then come to the thirde place saying: and make of whiche write the diget and kÃ©epe the math article in my minde, thus.
Then adde to whiche math maketh to that adde the article that was in my mind, and it is
write vnder and and keepe one in my minde, thus.
Why doe you not write bothe figures, sÃ©eing you are come to the last couple of numbers? Scholer.
that must adde that article that is in minde, vnto the next figure of the ouer summe, thoughe there be no more in the neather summe.
Then say I, in the ouer summe, and in my minde, maketh that write vnder Then foloweth there yet one more in the ouer summe, which hath none to be added to it, for there is none in the neather summe, nor yet in my mind, therfore thinke must write that euen as it is.
If you marke this, you haue learned perfectly the co~mon addition of all summes
which are of one denomination: so that ye obserue this also, that in Additio~ you must haue two numbers at the least, or else how ca~ you say that you do adde? And euer let the greatest number be writte~ highest, for that is the best way, though it be not necessarie.
And forget not this, that if you haue many numbers to adde togither, you shall haue oftentimes an article of a greater value tha~ sometimes sometimes sometimes more, yea, peraduenture
Therefore, as you did with the article so do with them, reseruing them in your minde, and adding to the number next following, so many as their valuer or value certaine is: that is to say, for for and so forth of other.
then must you not adde the article to the next figures following, but to the third figures from them, as will shewe you anone by example.
And if it chaunce the number to be such, that it doe comprehende twoo sundrie articles, (that is, one of tennes, and an other of hundreds) then muste you reserue them both in your minde, and adde the article of tennes, to the figures that folow next, and the article of hundreds, to the figure of the third place from thence.
would ad these xiij. su~mes in one, whiche set after thys maner.
Then do beginne and gather the summe of the first figures, whiche commeth to
ther x. times, and that is then and is that is in all
of whiche summe write the vnder the firste figures, and then haue an article of an hundred in my minde, whyche eyther must kÃ©epe in my minde till come to the thirde figures, which are in the roomes of hundreds, or else maye for feare of forgetting, write this one (bÃ©eing of the third place in your of come) vnder the third rowe of figures, making two lines, as you see here done.
And then must write the digites vnder the lowest line: and this is the surest way, when the summe is so great, that the addition of one row passeth
When haue so done, must then come to the seconde rowe of figures, and adde them togither, whiche doeth make
summe write the dygitte math vnder the same seconde row, and then haue a mixt number remaining of two figures, of which the (that standeth for must be added to the second or next place after them that did last adde.
And the other yt standeth for muste be added to the thirde place from thence.
That is to say, the fourth place from ye first line or row of figures.
with the two vnities betwÃ©ene the line, and the summe amou~teth to of which write the Cypher vnder the same thyrde rowe, and the vnder the nexte figures toward the lefte hand.
And with my pen giue a dashe to the two vnities betwÃ©ene ye lines, whose valew haue already added vnder the lowest line.
Then adde the figures of the fourth row, with the and that are vnder them betwÃ©en
the two lines, they make math then dashe the the with my penne, as did before the two vnities: so write vnder ye lowest line the (yt is the digit) vnder the fourth place: the that is the article, beyonde it, toward the left hand.
This seemeth somewhat harde, by the reason of so many nu~bers togither.
Howbeit think if do often proue eue~ with this same example shal be able to do so shortly, wc any other summe.
For it is often practise that maketh a man quicke and ripe in all things: But bycause of suche great summes there may chaunce to be some errour.
will teach you howe you shal proue whether you haue done wel or no.
Begin first with the highest number, and then to all the other orderlie, adde them togither, not hauing regarde to theyr places, but as though they were all vnities:
Then goe forth, euer casting away as often as it amounteth thereto: and so do till you haue gone ouer all the numbers that you intended first to adde, and whatsoeuer remaineth after such addition and casting awaie of write it in some void place by the ende of a line for the better remembraunce: then putte togither the figures that result of the Addition, still casting away also.
And then that that remayneth, write at the other ende of that line: and if those two figures be like, then haue you well done by likelihoode: but if they be vnlike, then haue you missed.
As for example in this present summe: The firste figure of the ouer line is lette him go: then and is take awaye and there remayneth adde to it that followeth, and that maketh
from whiche if you take there resteth then come to the next row, whose first and seconde number are thereore ouerpasse them both, and take the to which did remaine in the first row, that maketh putte thereto the folowing, that maketh thence take and there remayneth nexte that, goe to the thirde line, whose two firste numbers you maye lette
passe, bycause they are nines: then take the twoo whiche with the other two that remayned in the seconde rowe, make then goe to the fourth rowe, whose two firste numbers let goe, and take the to the that remayned, and that maketh take awaie and there resteth which with the that is next, maketh
And so goe throughe all the other numbers, and you shall finde that there remaineth after you haue cast away as often as you find it: therfore write at one end of a line in a voide place thus.
math Then gather all the figures of the totall summe which is vnder the lowest line, and cast away as often as you finde it, as thus: seauen and make take awaie and there resteth to that if you adde the that is laste (for you may let goe the then doth it make whiche you must write at the other ende of the line that you made in the voide place, and it wil be thus.
math And then you see that those two figures bÃ©e like, whereby you maye knowe that you haue done well, and so maye you proue in anie other.
If it please you, wil proue in an other summe.
Then wil take one of your former examples, which was this.
First in the highest line, and make then taken away, there remaine math to which adde the that foloweth, and that maketh
Then come to the second line, where finde first which with maketh from that take and there resteth the next figure is and therefore let him alone, so find one remaining, which set at the ende of a line thus.
math Then come to the totall summe, and there finde that al the figures put together make from which take and there resseth also, which put at the other ende of the line thus, math And because they be like, know that haue wel added.
So you knowe nowe both howe to adde two su~mes or more together: and also how to proue whether you haue done well or no:
But because you cannot yet skil of it, will let that passe till anone, and will teache you now how to adde su~mes of diuers
denominations: whiche thing can neuer be but whe~ the one denomination is such that it conteineth the other certain times.
And yet you shal adde them to the other, not after this sort as you did them that were of one denomination, but after such a sort as will now shew you, that is to say.
If you haue a summe of diuers denominations, then loke that ye set euery denomination by himself, with some note or figure of his denomination, as they be wont to be written.
Then write your other su~mes so vnder that first, that euery one be set vnder the other of the same denominations, as for example: if your denominations be poundes, shillings, pens, write pounds vnder poundes, shillings vnder shillings, and pens vnder pens, and not shillings vnder pens, nor pens vnder pounds.
Nowe that you haue spoken it, me thinketh it needeth not to warne me of it, for it were against reaso~ so to co~found su~mes: but yet if you had not spoken of it, peraduenure should haue bene deceiued in it.
If you doe say it is so plaine, will speake no more of it, but with an example make the matter to appeare euidently.
And an other oweth mÃ©e lb would know what this is altogether.
math Therfore must first set down my greatest sum the~ the other, euery one vnder his denomination grÃ©eing to the greatest summe, as here you see.
Then muste beginne at smallest numbers, (whiche must alwayes be set nexte the right hand) and adde them togither, and if the summe of them will make one of the next denomination, then muste kÃ©epe it in my minde till come to that place, or else for more easinesse write it vnder that place betwÃ©ene the double line, and vnder that place must note the residue, if there remaine anie of the same denomination, but if there remaine none, then nÃ©ede to write vnder it nothing.
And this is all that you muste marke in this Addition: for all other things are like to the other manner of Addition before mentioned.
Therefore the chiefest point of this Addition is, to knowe the valewes of common coynes and rated summes.
many shillinges be in a pounde: how many pence in a shilling, of which and of other like things, will instruct you hereafter, in teaching of Reduction: But now maye not disturb your wit from the thing that we are about.
Therefore let vs returne to math that former example, which proposed of thrÃ©e detters, whiche summes when had sette orderly they stoode thus, with a double line vnder them.
Then to adde them vnto one sum, must begin at the right hand, where the smallest denomination is, and adde the~ togither first, saying: and make
Nowe sÃ©eing these are pennies, and that pence make one shilling, which is the next math valewer, take awaye from and there resteth which write vnder the pennies, and for the other which maketh shilling write vnder the tytle of shillings, thus:
Then do adde all the shillings togither, and finde them to whiche adde that
betwÃ©ene the two lynes, math that maketh but bicause that shillinges do make pound, take away from and for that write vnder the pounds betwÃ©ene the two lines, and the other that remayneth, write vnder the shillings, as appeareth in the exa~ple before.
Then come to the pounds, adding them all togither, and finde them to be thereto adde the betwÃ©ene the math two lines, that maketh whiche su~me write downe whole, because there resteth no greater denomination, and then my whole su~me appeareth thus.
And this maye you prooue in an other lyke summe.
Then will caste the whole charge of one moneths commons at Oxforde wyth batteling also.
Goe to, let me sÃ©e how you can doe. Scholerr.
One wÃ©ekes commons was ob. and my batling that wÃ©eke was q.
The third wÃ©ekes commons ob. and my batling q. c.
The fourth wÃ©ekes commons and my batling ob. math These eyghte summes woulde adde into one whole summe, and therefore will sette them one ouer another, thus.
But had forgotten, shoulde haue set the greatest summe highest.
So is it commonly best, howebeit, here it forceth not: and in such summes as this is, that go by order of wÃ©ekes, dayes, or yeares, it is better to kÃ©epe that order, than to alter them, and to sette the greatest number highest, for that serueth for such summes as go not by order.
Then if haue set them well ynough, will begin to ad them thus.
Firste of the smallest math valewers at the right hande, which are called cÃ©es, find and sÃ©eing that cÃ©es, do make one q, wil write nothing vnder the cÃ©es, but will write for cÃ©es, vnder the kewes betwÃ©en the lynes, as the example sheweth.
Then come to ye next valewers, where finde q, and to math them adde the that is betwÃ©ene the lines, and so are they q: but because q, maketh one write one vnder the farthynges betwÃ©ene the lines, and the that remaineth must write beneth the nethermoste line vnder the kewes, thus.
finde and the other that is betwÃ©ene the lines, maketh farthings.
And bicause make iust pennie, shall write nothing vnder the farthings, but must write vnder the pens, betwÃ©ene the lines.
Next that must adde the halfe pence togither, of which there are
ob. make must write vnder the pens betwene the lines: but how shal do it, for there is alreadie? Maister.
Haue you forgotten how didde in addition of the great summe before?
you must set it vnder the other, so shal they bothe stande for
For if you shoulde set it before or behinde the other, they should make
Then wil write ob, vnder the halfepence, and for the other two halfepens, which make write vnder the pens: Then come to the pens, finde, that there are of them
then put to them the betwene the lines, and that maketh which amou~teth to
must set (I suppose) farther toward the left hande by themselues.
But tell me, why did you writ kewe, cÃ©e, thus, q, c. not rather thus qc, as the fashion is? Schol.
Because thoughte it was the best way for due gathering of euery denomination by himselfe.
Wel now, can you tell how to proue this addition, and such other like of diuers denominatio~s, and to trie whether you haue done well or no? Scholer.
First as you did begin to ad so recken agayne euery denomination by it selfe, and when you finde so many small that doe make any other denomination, let them go, and kÃ©epe in minde only the residue that wil make no greater denomination, and looke
whether there be any such like value vnder the nether lyne, and if there bÃ©e, you haue well done, and so goe from one denomination to an other, vnto the ende.
But here must you note, that in gathering of the summes, ye must recken those figures that are written betwÃ©ene the lynes, with them that are written aboue them: as for an example, will examine the summe that did last adde, which stoode math thus.
Firste finde and whiche maketh from whiche take bicause it maketh one of the next denomination, and there remayneth and vnder that place sÃ©e a like figure, therefore knowe that well to be done.
Then come to the where find and that maketh cast away for they make another denomination, that is to saye poundes: and the which remaineth, is lyke to the that is written vnder them beneathe the lowest lyne, thereforeÂ· that is well done also.
And thence goe to poundes, where finde that is to whiche summe agrÃ©eth another lyke
Nowe will attempte the same in the summe that did adde, whiche when had ended adding, stoode as you maye sÃ©e in the example following.
Firste amongest the cÃ©es find but two, which make one euen, therfore there must nothing bee vnder the line for them: And amongste the kewes math fynde of whiche two make therefore let them goe, and the one q, that is lefte, hath an other lyke vnder his place, therefore that is well done.
Then the Farthinges are iuste which make and therefore let them goe.
must cast away, bycause they made one penny) and vnto it answereth a like sum vnder it.
And last of all remayneth the which the abiected pens did make: so perceiue that haue wel done.
if the addition be made with two lines, (as were these) else it wil not serue, bycause that those summes whyche are here added betwÃ©ene the lines, in Addition by one line, are vnderstanded and not written: but let that way passe, bicause as it is commo~, so is it more deceiueable than this way, namelye if a mans memorie be either dull or troubled.
Doe euerie thing as you did in this sorte of Addittion, saue that where you made here two lines, you shall make there but one: and those summes that you did here write betwÃ©ene the lynes, you must kepe in your memorie, and vse them (as you dydde here) each one when you come to his place.
that this addition with two lines leaueth nothing to memorie, but writeth downe all: and the other way committeth certaine numbers to memorie, as you taughte me in the first examples of addition of small summes of one denomination.
But what if a man vse it (as you say men do commonly) how shal it be examined? Maister.
SÃ©eing you are so desirous of it, will shewe both an example of the addition, and also the manner to examine it.
propose these thrÃ©e summes math to be added, and gather firste the pence, as did in the other sort, and finde of them that is of which summe bate away whiche make and kepe that in my minde, and the rest, that is write vnder the pence.
Then do adde the shillings togither, and finde of them that is whereof bate that make lb whiche kÃ©epe in minde, and to the other that remaineth, adde that one that came of ye pens was in my mind, whiche make and them write vnder the shillings.
that is and to them adde the in my mind that remayneth of math the shillings, which make them doe write vnder the poundes, and then my summe totall appeareth to be lb
Now to examine this sum and all suche like, you shall doe thus.
and take from them that are aboue the lyne, as often as you can: then that that remayneth shall you double, and ioyne it with the shillings, and take awaye from that as often as you can, and whatsoeuer remayneth, yÃ©e shall take for it thrÃ©e tymes so muche, and putte to the pence: then take from all that summe as often as you can, and what so remayneth after you haue wythdrawen as often as you can, write that at the ende of a line, as taughte you in the other Addition.
And then come to the sum vnder the lire, beginning with the pounds, and doe euen as you did with the summes aboue the line, till you come to your pennies: and if the figure of
the summe that remayneth after casting awaye (as often as you can) doe agrÃ©e wyth the other that remayned before of the other summe, whyche you did write at the ende of the line, then haue you done well, else not: and for an example, will examine that laste summe which was thus:
First shal begin at the math left ha~d with the pounds, putting them togither, whiche make in which summe finde twice, (for twice is that deducte, and there remayneth that must double (as saide) bicause it is the remayner of the poundes, and it will be
Then gather the summe of the shillings, whiche is to the whiche adde the foresaide and then it is wherein finde thrÃ©e times, and there remayneth nothing.
This remayner should take thrÃ©e times, but thrÃ©e times nothing, is nothing: therefore in this place is there nothing left to be added to the pennies.
Wherefore muste take the summe of penies alone, whiche is from thence if take twice, there remayneth but whych putte vnto the ende of a lyne
Then come to the poundes of the vnder number or totall summe, and there finds from whiche take awaye twice, and there remayneth that double, and it is then doe adde that to the shillings, and it maketh from which withdrawe and there resteth one: then doe take that thrÃ¡e times, and it maketh whyche adde to the and it maketh fro~ whiche if bate there resteth which is equal to the number noted at the ende of the line: and therby perceiue that haue done well.
no more doe you of manye things else, but hereafter will shewe you the reasons of all Arithmeticall operations: for this iudge to be the beste trade of teaching, first by some briefe precepts to instruct a learner somewhat in the vse of the Arte,
before he learne the reasons of the Art, and then may you afterward more sooner make him to perceiue the reasons: for harde it is to occupie a young learned witte with both the arte and the reasons of it all at once: howbeit hÃ©e
shall neuer be cunning in dÃ©ede in an arte, that knoweth not the reason of euerie thing touching it.
But for this worke, bycause the reason is easie, wil shew it you nowe.
You knowe that if one pounde do remaine, it being tourned into shillings, woulde make in whiche number there is contained twice, and beside.
And therefore for one pounde you shal take and so for euerie one pound
sÃ©e it well, for if there remained lb after the nines were cast away, must take for that lb.
And so haue caste away times and yet remayneth of euerie pound which maketh
Like wayes in shillings, whiche containe for euerie shilling, if you abate pence there resteth pence.
And so if shillings doe remaine, muste take for it that is thrÃ©e pence for euerie shilling, and yet in that so doing, haue caste awaye fiue times nine pence.
Other workes haue as good reason, but wil not stande aboute yÃ©elding reasons now.
shewe me, why did you write your number that remayned (after you hadde withdrawen all the nines) at the ende of a line? for sawe no reason why that line did serue.
Did you euer marke a Carpenter when he wrought? Scholer.
And haue you not sÃ©ene him when he hath taken measure of a boarde, that hÃ©e hath pricked it, and hath with a twitch of his hande drawen a line from the pricke that hÃ©e made? Scholer.
Yes haue marked that and haue sÃ©ene some marke or lines by the pricke, some also haue sÃ©ene make a crosse by it, but that perceiued was for the easie finding of their pricke.
And euen so is this line for the easie finding of your remainer, and therefore some doe make a crosse, thus.
[Figure: And set the one remainer aboue the crosse, and the other vnder the nether part of the crosse, as if should set my two remainers thus.
to whiche the crosse serueth more mÃ©eter: that is whe
the addition is of diuerse denominations: and would examine euerie denomination by it selfe, which waye though it be not much vnlike to the first proofe that brought of suche diuerse summes, yet will declare it, leasts you shoulde thinke that would hide it from you.
You muste make so manie lines in your crosse, as you haue sundrie denominations: as if you haue but two denominations, then you may make it thus, that the ouer [Figure: part and the nether part may serue for one denomination, and the two sides for the other.
And if you haue thrÃ©e denominations, as poundes, shillings, and pennies, then muste you make thrÃ©e [Figure: lines thus.
The vpright line may serue for poundes, and the highest thwart line for shillings, and the lowest for pens: as for example will take a summe thus added.
For the proofe of the which, bycause it contayneth thrÃ©e denominations, must make a crosse of thrÃ©e lines, as in the page afore.
The~ recken first at the righte hand the pennies: make from whiche take for the next denomination, that is to saie, a shilling, and there resteth which muste write at one end of the neather thwart line.
After that gather the summe of the shyllings, which maketh to them put one that toke of the pennies, and that maketh from those take the quantitie of the next greater denomination, that is to say, a pound, and there resteth which write at the ende of the highest thwart line.
Thirdlie, adde togither the pounds, whiche make to them adde the that came of the shillings, and then there is wherein finde times and ouer, that write on the vpright line.
That doone, come to the totall summe, and examine it, beginning at the pennies, where finde but one, and cannot take fro~ him, therfore set him at the other ende of ye neather thwart line: Then come to the shillings, where finde only which bicause it is lesse than sette it at the other ende
of the line of shillings, that is, the ouermoste thwart line.
Last of all, of the lb take foure times which is and there remayneth which write vnder the vpright line.
The~ consider euerie number, comparing it to the number that is againste it, and bycause finde them to be euerie one like hys match, know that haue wel done.
This crosse perceiue doeth serue for those thrÃ©e denominations, pounds, shillinges, pennies.
But what if had ob, q~, q, and c? Maister
You thinke you be at Oxforde stil, you bring forth so faste your and c.
These lines, as haue saide, doe serue for thrÃ©e denominations, such as they be: as here they do serue for poundes, shillings, and pennies: but if yÃ©e haue no poundes in your summe, then may they serue for shillings, pennies, and halfe pennies: yea for and c, if you haue no greter denomination, so that you remember that the vpright line serueth for the greatest denomination, and the highest thwarte line, for the nexte, and the lowest for the least,
you must make your crosse with [Figure: so many lines.
And if that your summe be of more denominations, make so many lines in your crosse.
Examples of Addition. math The Proofes. math An other Example.
THen haue learned the two first kindes of Arithmetike: nowe as remember, doeth folowe Subtraction, whose name me thinketh doth sounde contrarie to Addition.
So is it in dÃ©ede: for as Addition encreaseth one grosse summe by bringing manye into one, so contrarie waies, Subtraction diminisheth a grosse summe by withdrawing of other from it, so that Subtraction or Rebating is nothing else, but an art to withdrawe and abate one summe from an other, that the Remainer may appeare.
So me thinketh: but yet it is good to aske the trouth of all such things, leaste in trusting to myne owne coniecture, bÃ©e deceyued.
And as sÃ©e cause, wyll still declare thyngs vnto you so plainelie, that you shall not neede to doubte.
Howbeit, if doe ouerpasse it sometimes (as the manner of men is to forget the small knowledge of them to whome they speake) then do you putte me in remembraunce your selfe, and that way is surest.
And as for this worde that you laste asked me, take you this description:
The Remainer is a summe lefte after due Subtraction made, which declareth the excesse or differe~ce of the two other numbers: as if woulde abate or subtract out of there should remaine which is called the remayner, and is the difference betwÃ©en those two numbers
perceiue then what Subtraction is: Nowe resteth to knowe the order to worke it, Maister.
that if you should go about to rebate, you must haue two sundrie summes proposed, the firste which is your grosse summe or summe totall: (and it must be set highest) and then the rebatement
or summe to be withdrawen, which must be set vnder the firste (whether it bÃ©e in one parcel or in many) and that in suche sort, that the firste figures be one iuste ouer an other and so the seconde and thirde, and all other folowing, as you did in Addition: then shal you drawe vnder them a line, and so are your summes duelie set to beginne youre working.
Then beginne you at the righte hande (as you did in Addition) and withdrawe the nether number out of the higher, and if there remaine anye thing, write that righte vnder them beneth the line: and if ther remaine nothing (by reason that ye figures were equal) then write vnder them a ciphar of noughte.
And so doe you with all the other figures, euermore abating the lower out of the higher, and write vnder them the Remainer still, til you come to the ende.
And so will there appeare vnder the line what remayneth of youre grosse summe, after you haue deducted the other summe from it, as in this example.
receiued of your father of whiche haue layde out for you nowe woulde knowe what doeth remaine? and therefore
set my numbers thus in order: First write the greatest summe, and vnder him math the lesser, so that the figures at the right side be euen one vnder another, and so the other, thus.
Then do rebate out of and math there resteth two, which write vnder them right beneath the line, thus.
Then go to the second figures, math and do rebate out of where there remaineth which write vnder them righte, and then the whole summe and operation appeareth thus.
Whereby it appeareth, that if withdraw out of there remaineth
Nowe will proue in a greater summe: And wil Subtract out of
Then doe beginne at the righte side, and deducte out of and there resteth whiche write vnder them.
Then goe to the seconde figures, and withdrawe out of and there remaine
two, whiche set vnder the~ also: then take out of and there resteth which write vnder them: for you say, that if the figures be equall, so that nothing remain, must write this ciphar vnder them.
Then come to the fourth place and draw out of and there remayneth which write vnder them also.
Then in the fifte place take from and there resteth nought, for it write vnder them a ciphar, Then in the sixt place rebated from there remayneth which write vnder them: and likewise in the vij. last place, taken from there is lefte whiche math write vnder them: so haue done my whole working, and my summes appeare thus.
And that you maye be sure to perceiue fullye the Art of Subtractio~. let me see how can you subtract out of
summe, and after that write vnder if the lesser number, beginning math at the righte syde: and then my figures will stand thus.
Then take from and the reste is whiche write vnder them: then doe withdrawe from and there remayne which write vnder them.
Then take out of but that cannot, what shal now doe? Mayster.
how you shall doe in this case and in all other like.
If any figure of the nether summe be greater than the figure of the summe that is ouer him, so that it cannot be taken out of the figure ouer him, then muste you put to the ouer figure, and then consider how muche it is, and out of that whole summe withdrawe the nether figure, and write the rest vnder them.
Now then in mine example where shoulde haue taken out of and coulde not, put to that which maketh from it take awaye, and there resteth also, whiche
So haue you done well, but nowe muste you marke another thing also: that whensoeuer you doe so put to any figure of the ouer number, you must adde one stil to the figure or place that followeth next in the nether line, as in this example there followeth to which you must put and make him then go on as haue taught you.
Then shall say: and (which must put to him for the that added to before) make which should take out of but that cannot be, therefore must put to it also then it will be from whiche take and there resteth to be written vnder them: and because of that added to the must ad to that followeth in the nether line, that maketh which should take out of and cannot, therefore put thereto and that maketh from take and there remayneth whiche write vnder them.
Then doe adde likewise to the nexte figure beneath, which is and that maketh that should take out of the figure aboue, but cannot, for it is therefore
put to it, and so take out of there resteth to be written vnder them.
Then come to the next figure which is and to him doe ad which maketh that can not take out of nought, therefore of yt nought make and thence do take so remaineth there to be written vnder them.
Likewise do put to that followeth, and then is it that would take out of and cannot, therefore adde to that and make it from which rebate and there remaineth which write vnder them.
Now haue spent all the nether figures, what shall doe more? Maister.
You should haue added to the next figure following (if there had bene any) because you added to the last figure before of the ouer line: but seeing there is no figure following, you must adde that to the place following, and then deducte that from the number aboue.
Then shall saye because borrowed to the ouer muste put in the next place beneath, that is vnder then must subtracte that from and there resteth to be written vnder that, in the ninth place.
for there is neuer any figure remayning beneath, nether yet any vnite to be added, because borrowed not to the figure laste before,
and yet is there remayning in the ouer line, which (I thinke by reason) shoulde be set at the ende of the figures in the lowest row whiche is vnder the line, for because there was nothing taken from it.
That is wel considered, and reason teacheth so in dÃ¡ede.
But syr besÃ©eche you, shall alwayes when any number so remayneth alone (as this did) write him vnder the lyne straight against his owne place? M. Yea, what else? Whether they bÃ©e one or many: and this wel remembred, you haue sufficiently learned Subtractio~.
How be it, because of certaine thinges that might deceiue you, if you did not take good hÃ©ede to your working, wil propose to you another example of many numbers to be subtracted, as thus,
receyued of a friende of mine to kÃ©epe Crounes, of which at one time deliuered him againe at one time and at another time and an other tyme and an other time nowe would know
Therefore firste set downe my math grosse sum, and a lyne vnder it: vnderneath it set all the parcels, thus: and vnder them a double line.
Then firste begin at the first place, gather togither the sum of al those lynes (saue the ouermost) in their first figures, and so do with all the figures of the second place, so forth as did in Addition, saue that leaue out the highest row of numbers (as the line warneth me) and that summe so gathered betwÃ©en the double line, doe subtract out of the highest row of numbers, and the remayner doe sette vnder ye nethermost line: math as for example.
set the summes as before: than doe gather the first figures together, where fynde but that make (for thrÃ©e Cyphers increaseth no summe
in addition, as you learned before) of the therefore doe write the digite betwÃ©ene the double line, and kÃ©epe the article in my mind, til come to the seconde place, where finde that make to them put the article in my mind, and it is of which write vnder the seconde place, and kÃ©epe the digite in my minde for the third place, where finde that make to the which adde the in my minde, and it maketh thereof write the vnder the thirde place: and because there remayneth no more figures to be added, write the digit in the fourth place, as you see in the example.
Then come to subtracting of this su~me betwÃ©ene the lines, for by Addition it is equall to the fiue parcels ouer it.
Therefore procÃ©ede to subtracte it from the ouermoste summe, saying: from remayne to bÃ©e written vnder the~ beneath the lowest line.
Then in the seconde place take from and there resteth, to be written vnder the~.
And thus sÃ©e that after those summes are subtracted from the Remainer
This perceyue: but is there no shorter way and more spÃ©edier? Mayst.
when you are a while exercised in it: for you may as fast as you can gather the numbers togither, withdrawe them out of the highest su~me if so be it, that all the parcels which you doe gather, do not excÃ©ede nine, but and if they excÃ©ede nyne, then must you subtract onelye the digit that is in it, and reserue the article till the nexte place, where you shall adde it with the other figures and so subtract the whole out of the figure aboue them: but and if in this place the summe of the parcels do excÃ©ede then (as sayd before) subtract the digit only, and reserue the article to the nexte place, and so still goe forth, till you haue ended your working.
As for example: In the last summe proposed, gather firste in the firste place and that maketh of whiche deducte the digitte out of and write vnder the remayner, which is and the article kÃ©epe in my minde.
Then in the second place gather the parcels which amount to to that adde the article which
haue in my minde, and then is it then do take (that is the digitte in this number) fro~ that is in the seconde place of the highest summe, and there remayneth but to bÃ©e written vnder them, and nowe doe kÃ©epe the article in my minde still.
Then in the thirde place, maketh and the article in my minde maketh then take (which is the digitte) from that is ouer them, and there resteth whiche write vnder them.
Then haue the article yet in my minde, which shoulde adde to the parcels next following, but sÃ©eing there is no number following, take that digit alone, and deduct him out of the next su~me aboue, which is and then is the remayner which write in the fourth place vnder
like both wayes well, and perceiue both well, yet as in the one the working sÃ©emeth somewhat long, so in the other it leaneth very much (me sÃ©emeth) to remembrance, and therefore maye cause errour quickly, except a man haue a quick and an exercised remembraunce.
What? would you then haue suche a way that should not be so long as the
still as you gather your parcels, when they excÃ©ed a digit, maketh him or more, take the article, and write him betwÃ©ene two lines (as in the first example) vnder the next place towarde the left hande: and then deducte the digitte from the figure that is ouer him, and wryte the remayner.
And then when you gather the next parcels, you shall adde to them the figure that is vnder them, betwÃ©en the two lines.
And if it excÃ©ede do as said before, write the article vnder ye next place betwÃ©en ye lynes, and subtracte the digitte from the Figure that is ouer those parcelles: and if that all the parcelles togither and the number betwÃ©ene the lines do make but a digit, then deduct it wholy from the figure aboue: as in this example.
then gather the parcels of the firste place, which are that is of whiche take away the article, and sette him vnder the second place betweene the lines: and the digit that remaineth, deduct out of and there resteth to be written vnder the first place beneath the lowest line.
Then come to the second place, and gather the parcels of it, and the betweene the lines, which make of whiche take the article, and set him vnder the third place betwÃ©en the lines, and the digit take from and there remaineth which write vnder the second place beneth the lowest line.
which with the between the lines, doe make therefore write the article agayne vnder the fourth place, and the digit take from and there remayneth which write vnder them beneath the lowest line.
And the~ come to the fourth place, where gather betwÃ©ene the lines, that maketh which because it is but a digitte plucke from and the Remayner is
and must be written vnder them in the fourthe place.
After that come to the fifte place, where are onely three cyphars, which make
nothing, the~ should take that, that is to say nothing, from the figure ouer them, whiche is also a cyphre, therefore must saye thus: if take nought from nought, there remayneth nought: so must write a cyphre vnder them.
The~ in ye sixt place find but which take out of ouer him, and the Remainer is that must be written beneth the lowest line in the sixt place.
So go to the seuenth, where find only cyphres, and in the grosse sum ouer them a cyphre also, therefore must write their remainer (whiche is nothing) with a cyphre also.
Then in the eighte and last place, gather that make which if take out of that that is ouer the~, there will nothing remaine.
And that must be noted with a cyphre beneath the lowest line, as haue often sayde, and so haue ended my worke, and the figures math stand thus.
Syr, remember you taughte me that cyphers shoulde not come in the last place, for because they serue onelye to encrease the valewe of other Figures whiche followe
them, and serue not for those figures that goe before them: and nowe in your example you haue set two ciphers in the two laste places.
And truth it is, should not haue set them here, but only because that would make you plainly to perceiue the art of Subtraction.
Therfore sÃ©eing that you do now perceiue it, whensoeuer you shoulde write downe a cyphar, looke whether anye other figures be yet behinde.
And if not than let go the cyphar also, for it nÃ©edeth notto write him in any latter places, where no other figure doth followe, excepte it be (as did) to teache the vse of Subtraction the playner.
Therefore my figures math must stande thus when haue ended my worke.
But because this thing (as all other) must be learned surely by often practise, will propounde here two examples to you, wherein if you often exercise your selfe, you shalbe ripe and perfecte to subtract any other summe lightly, for in them is contained all the obseruaunces of whole number.
And because you shal perceaue somewhat both how to doe it, and also whether it be well done when you haue prooued to doe it, therefore haue written vnder them, both the Remayners: And to one of them also adioyned his proofe. math Scholer.
But thinke might the better doe it, if you did shewe me the working of it.
Yea, but you must proue your selfe to doe some thinges that you were neuer taught, or else you shall not be able to doe any more than you were taughte: And that were rather to learne by rote (as they call it) then by reason.
And agayne there is nothing in this example or anye other of whole number, but haue taughte you the rules of them alreadie.
Then trust by practise to attaine the vse of it.
And is this all that shall learne of Subtraction? Mayster, Yea, sauing that (as you haue sÃ©ene in Addition) there are numbers of diuers denominations, in whiche the working is not muche vnlike, yet without some instructions be giuen of it, it might sÃ©eme to a learner more difficulte, then in dÃ©ede it is.
Therefore will brieflye shewe you the vse of it onely, by one example or two.
certayne man owed to me lb of which he paide me at one tyme lb at an other time lb and at an other lb and last of all,
Syr, pray you why doe you write lb. for the common spÃ©eche vseth rather to say
We must here vse the denomination that is greatest in any summe, so that we maye not write according as we vse to speake, saying:
and suche other, but we muste write euerye denomination that is in any summe by it self, namely shillinges and poundes.
So that we maye not write in Arithmetike pennies, when the summe amounteth to shillings, nor shillinges when tho sum maketh poundes.
When my summes are so set as shewed, then must begin with the smallest denomination, saying: are
doe make must take math from that (which commeth of the parcels)
for them write betwÃ©ene ye lines vnder ye shillings, than the that remayneth take out of ye highest sum, which is also, then remayneth nought: wherfore vnder the pence write nothing.
whiche with the betwÃ©ene the lines, make that must take out of the summe that is ouer it.
But sÃ©eing that summe is but cannot take out of must borrow one of the lb and put to the and that maketh for lb is worth then take out of and there resteth to be written vnder the shillinges.
that is in all and one more must adde therto, because of the that borrowed before vnto the and than is there whiche must take oute of so doth there remain to be written vnder the poundes: so doeth my remainer appeare to be lb
This doe perceiue verie well, and if there be none other thing to be learned in Subtraction, then maye come to Multiplication, for that you reckened to bÃ©e in order next.
We haue done in dÃ©ede wyth the arte of Subtraction, as touching the working.
wil instruct you how to examine your work whether it be well done or no, and that is by casting away as ofte~ as you can finde it, as you did in Addition, sauing that you muste here examine the highest number alone, and note the residue of it at a lines end, as you did in Addition.
And when you haue done with the highest number, then examine all the other togither, casting thence as often as you can: and if the last remayner be like the other, then haue you done wel.
yet for them all shall you make but one seuerall line, as you did in Addition, remembring to begin the examination at the greatest denomination, and to double the remayner of pounds, and triple the remainer of shillings, as you did also in Addition.
As for a proofe, will examin math this work where in the highest line finde of pou~ds
from thence bate there resteth which doe double, because they are pounds, and the~ are they thereto ad the it maketh fro~ whiche take twise, there resteth whiche because they are shillinges, triple, and then are they thereto adde the then are they the~ce take twise and yet resteth whiche write at the one ende of a line thus,
Then examine all the other parcelles the remayner together, euery denominatio~ by it selfe.
that doe double, and it maketh to it doe put the shillinges,
that is (for the one betwÃ©en the lines must not be reckoned nor none in that space) and that maketh in all
yt doe take thrÃ©e times, and it is wherfore cast it away: then doe take the pennies
whiche write at the other end of the proofe lyne.
And bicause sÃ©e that those two numbers are equall, saye that haue well wrought.
And if you will you may make for euerye denomination a line, as you learned in Addition: but then must you beginne your examination at the smallest denomination, as you did in Addition, for their proofe is altogither like, sauing that in Addition you examine the nethermost summe alone, and all the other togither: and in Subtraction yÃ©e must examine the highest number alone, al the other togither.
And if you marke it wel, it is euen all one, for that summe that in Addition is lowest, in Subtraction is highest:
and that summe is called the Grosse or Totall summe.
Therefore if you marke what sayde in Addition, you may easilye perceiue what is to be done for the proofe of Subtractio~.
And to the intent that you may perceaue it ye better, will shew you an other proofe of Subtraction, and that shall be by Addition, thus.
Draw vnder ye lowest nu~ber (which is your remayner) a line: then ad that number,
and all the other that you did subtract before, together,
and write that that amounteth, vnder the lowest line: and if the summe that commeth thereof, be equall to the highest of the subtraction, than was the math subtraction well wrought, or else not.
As for example: in the laste summes, which stoode thus.
whereof take awaye, bycause they make one shilling, and write for them vnder the shillings: and the that is lefte, write beneath the lowest line, then adde the shillings
that make from whiche take and for it write vnder the poundes, and the that remayneth, write vnder the shillings.
Then come to the poundes, adding them togither, which are
that maketh then doe write vnder the lb and so haue ended the Addition.
And sÃ©e that the lowest line of number and the highest be like, wherfore know that haue wel done.
For my figures appeare as you may plainlie sÃ©e in the page folowing.
And thus nowe haue math taughte you the arte of Subtraction, and the means to proue whether it be well wroughte or not.
And this last proofe of Subtraction is most aptest and beste allowed of any other proofe: whether it be of lb or a+ny other grosse some whatsoeuer.
Nowe and you remember, omitted in teaching the proofe of Addition one way whi: che said was by subtraction.
Scholer Trueth it is, and then was it deferred, because that had not the~ learned the feate of Subtraction, whereby should haue proued it, but now thanke you, haue wel learned the arte of Subtraction, the proues of it, both by
And nowe would be glad to know, howe may proue Addition by Subtraction.
Whe~ you haue ended your addition: take the numbers all that you did adde, to the highest summe, and deduct or subtract them from the grosse
summe that doth resulte, and if the remayner be like to the highest number, then haue you done well, else not.
take one of the summes that did adde before, which math was this that followeth here.
Then doe come to the middle number (because here in this example are onelye thrÃ©e numbers) and subtracte that from the nether nu~ber, beginning at the right hande, and first saye, out of there remaineth that write vnder an other line.
Then againe, in the second place from remaineth vnder it write also.
Next that in the third place, out of wil not be, therfore ad to that and make it from that take and there resteth
Then saye farther: in the fourth place, and (whiche must adde for the borrowed before) make that must take from and because canne not, adde to the and then is it from then take and there resteth to be written vnder them.
Againe in the fift place where finde nothing written, must sette for the last borrowed, and that doe take from the vnder him,
Now haue done with the subtraction: and yet in the grosse summe remayneth whiche must sette right in the same place, in the remayner, and so the remayner appeareth to bee lyke vnto the highest summe of math the Addition, as here appeareth.
And note, that if you had subtracted the vppermost from the product or totall su~me, then the residue thereof woulde be equall to that middlemost number.
But if the parcelles which you added, be more then two: (as thrÃ©e foure, fiue, sixe, or more) than from your grosse or totall summe subtracte first one of the percels: and note that newe residue.
Out of that new residue, subtract an other of your percels, (whiche you will) and Note that second new residue.
And if you haue no mo percels added, but three, than is that second new residue equall alike to the thirde parcel, whiche you haue not (as yet) subtracted, if you haue wrought wel: both in your first Addition, and now in youre subtracting.
And so in this wise, (if you haue foure, fiue, or more parcels) maye you procÃ©ede to make your selfe sure of your totall summe, first, by Addition of the saide parcels, produced and gathered.
And thus may you doe in any other summe of one denomination or many: Sauing that wil tel you by the way, the laste manner of proofe that was shewed you in Addition, is the beste, and the aptest proofe for the Rule of Addition.
Therefore nowe will make an ende of Subtraction, and will instructe you in Multiplication.
MVltiplication is such an operation, that by two summes produceth the third: whiche third summe so many times shall containe the firste, as there are vnities in the second.
When would know how many are times if should ad thirtie times, it would be a lo~g work.
Therfore was this worke of Multiplication deuised, which shall doe that at once, that Addition should do at many times.
perceiue the commoditie of it partlie, but shall not sÃ©e the full profit of it, till know the whole vse of it.
Therefore sir besÃ©ech you, teache me the working of it.
So iudge it beste, but because that greate summes can not be multiplyed, but by the multiplication of digits, therefore thinke it best to shewe you first the way of multiplying them: As when saye, times or times
And as for the small digits vnder it were but follie to teach any rule, seing they are so easie, that euerie childe can doe it.
But for the multiplication of the greater digits, thus shal you do.
Firste set your digittes one ouer the other righte, then from the vppermost downward, and from the neathermost vpwarde, drawe straighte lines, so that they make a crosse, commonlie called Saincte Andrewes crosse,
Then looke how many eche of them lacketh of and write that agaynst eche of them,
at the end of the lynes, and that is called the Differences, math as if would know how many are times muste write those digittes thus.
Then doe looke how much doth differ from and math finde it to be that doe write at the right hande of at the end of the line, thus.
After that, take the difference of likewise math from that is and write that at the righte side of as you see in this example.
Then doe drawe a lyne vnder them, as in Addition, thus.
Laste of all multiplie the two differences, saying: times make that muste euer set vnder the differences, beneth ye line: then must take the one of the differences (whiche will, for all is like) from the other digit (not from his own) as the lines of
the crosse warne me, and that math that is left, must write vnder the digits.
If take from or from there remaineth that must write vnder the digits: and then there appeareth the multiplication of times to be
And so likewyse of anye other digits, if they be aboue for if they be vnder then will their differences be greater than themselfe, so that they cannot be taken out of them.
And agayne, such little summes euerye childe can multiply, as to say: times or times and such like.
And sÃ©eing me sÃ©emeth that vnderstand the multiplying of the greater digits, will proue by an example how can doe it.
It is all one in value to saye times or times but yet the order is best to put the lesse summe firste, saying: times and so of al other summes.
Then would know, howe math many are times therefore set ye digits thus, make the crosse thus.
Then doe set their differences math at the right side: the difference of which is againste it, and the difference of whiche is againste it also, as in this example.
Then doe multiplie the math digites togither, saying: one tyme maketh that doe write vnder the differences thus.
Then take one of the differences from the other digite, as one from or else from and eache wayes there resteth which math do write vnder the digits thus.
Thus see the feate of this manner of multiplication of digittes.
Now mighte you goe straight to the multiplication of greater numbers, saue that both for your ease and suertie in working, wil draw you here a table, whereby shall appeare the multiplication of all digits, and this is it that followeth in the next page.
In which figure, when you would knowe the producte in anye multiplication of digits, sÃ©eke your first or last digit in the greater figures, and from it go righte forthe towarde the right hande, til you come vnder the number of your second digite, which is in the highest rowe: and then the number that is in the mÃ©eting of the rowes of little squares (whiche some directlie from both your propounded digits) is the multiplication that amounteth of them.
As if woulde knowe by this table the multiplication of times sÃ©eke first in the greater figures, and then go right foorthe toward the right hand, till you come vnder of
the highest rowe, in which place where so come vnder the other digit (as here for example you come vnder is alwaies contained the of come or product, which you sÃ©eke and that place we tearme to be in the common angle, in respect of the two numbers taken on the outsides, as here in that common angle, where ye rewes of little squares (directly procÃ©eding from and do mÃ©eteÂ· you haue which is the summe of the multiplication of by
When you would multiplie any summe by an other, you shal marke that it is the mÃ©etest order to set the greatest nu~ber highest, which is the place of the nu~ber yt must be multiplied: and likewyse the lesser number vnder it, for that is the place of the Multiplier or multiplicatour, that is to say, the nu~ber by which multiplicatio~ is made: and is in Englishe alwayes put before this worde, Tymes: in suche speaking when say, times
And the number that followeth this word, Times, is that whiche
Therefore when would multiplie one number by another, must write the greatest highest, and the lesser vnder it, as in Addition.
As for example: If would multiplie by must set them thus.
math Then must multiplie euery figure of the higher row by euery figure of the nether rowe: and that that amounteth, must set vnder the line, as thus.
First doe multiplie by math saying: times (or times whiche is all one) and that maketh as the table before of digittes doeth declare, of that muste write the that is the digitte, vnder the and the in the next place towarde the lefte hande.
Then come to the seconde figure of the higher rowe, and saye: times make of which write the vnder the and the vnder the next place (as the reason math willeth me) thus.
After that come to the next figure, which is and do multiply it by that maketh
whereof write vnder the math thirde place, and the article in the fourth place, thus.
And so haue ended the first figure of ye multiplier.
Wherfore giue it now a fine dash with my pen.
Then beginne with the math nexte figure, and multiply it into all the higher figures, as thus,
First, times make that doe write vnder the second place: for euermore the digite or first figure of multiplication that amounteth of the first figure of the higher number, must be set vnder the multiplier of it, and the other in their order, toward the left hand.
vnderstande you thus: that the digit of the summe amounting of the multiplication of the first figure of the higher row, by the firste figure of the lower row or multiplyer, must be set vnder the first place: that that amounteth of the same first figure by the seconde multiplier, muste be set vnder the seconde place, so of the other, if there be more multiplyers.
there amount but a digit, then must it be set vnder the multiplyer.
And now to go forth: multiplie by the same the second figure of the higher rowe, which is saying: times math make whereof write the digit vnder the thirde place, the artice write vnder the fourth place.
Then do multiplye the last figure of the higher sum, by that same saying: times is whiche write vnder the math fourth place.
And so haue ended the whole multiplication: wherefore also giue the a dashe with my pen, thus: and so do euer assoone as haue dispatched any digit by whiche multiplie.
Than must draw a line math vnder all those summes that amount of the multiplicatication, and must ad all them into one summe, as in this example you may sÃ©e.
Where in the first place find but and therefore write it vnder the line.
Then in the seconde place make whereof write and kÃ©epe one in my minde, and so forth, as you learned in Addition.
And so appeareth the whole summe to be which amounteth of the multiplication of by
If there be no more to be obserued in it, then can do it, suppose, as by this example shall proue.
Then doe multiplie by saying: times make of whiche write the ciphre in the first place, math and the article in the seconde place.
multiplie math the seconde fygure of the higher summe, whiche is sayinge: tymes make of which write the vnder the seconde place, and the vnder the thirde place.
Then doe multiplie the math thirde figure whiche is by the same and that maketh of that sette the vnder the thirde place, and the in the fourth place.
Then come to the last math Figure of the higher sum, and multiplie it by saying: tymes make that doe write vnder the fourth place.
And so haue ended the firste multiplier, and dash him slightly with my pen.
Then begin with the second math multiplier, and say first times that maketh of which sette the vnder the second place, because that the multiplier is there, and the set vnder the thirde place.
Then come to the seconde math figure, that is and multiplie it by whiche maketh of which sette the vnder the thirde place, and the article in the fourth place.
Than come to the third math figure, which is and multiply it by saying: times make whiche because it is but one digit, set vnder the fourth place.
And then comming to the laste figure multiplye it by and it maketh
which set in the math fift place, and then haue two of the multiplyers, and the summes stande thus.
And then giue his dashe. math Then come to the thirde multiplier, and multiplye it into euery figure of the higher summe, and firste saye: times makes of whiche set the cipher vnder the multiplyer in the third place, and the article in the fourthe place.
And so multiplying the seconde figure by that same there amounteth whereof
write the digitte vnder math the fourth place, and the article vnder in the fift place.
Nowe doe multiplye by the thirde figure of the higher summe, which is and that maketh which set vnder the fifte place, as appeareth in the example following.
math Than come to the last place, and multiplye that by and there amounteth which sette in the sixte place, and then doth the sum stande thus.
But now (as you taughte mee) to knowe what this whole summe is, must ad all those parcelles together, and then vnder the line will appeare as you maye see the grosse or totall summe, that is,
Then me thinketh would call it well done, when knew whether had well done or no.
Maister It may be tryed by as addition was, but the surest proofe is by Diuision, and therefore will reserue that till you haue learned the art of Deuision.
And before we passe from Multiplication wil yet shew you another way of multiplication, which is counted of some men, and is in dÃ©ede, both more readyer, and more certayne, whiche differeth nothing from this that haue taughte you, saue that it doeth vnderstande alwayes the articles, and ioyne them to the nexte summe, and therefore will declare it onelye by an example.
If woulde multiplie by must set them as sayde before, and then do multiply by and it maketh math of which write the article vnder the firste place, and kÃ©epe the digit in my mind.
Then saye forth: times doe make and the in my minde, are
thereof write the vnder the math second place, and kÃ©epe the in my minde.
Then come to the third figure math saying: times make the in my minde make whereof write the vnder the thirde place, and kÃ©epe the article in my mynd.
Then comming to the last figure, math saye: times make and in my mind make that doe write vnder the fourth place.
And then haue ended my firste multiplier, and therefore dashe it.
Then doe likewise with the second multiplier, saying: times make math therof write the digit vnder the seconde place, and keepe the article in my minde.
Then say forth: times maketh math and in my minde make
so set that vnder the thirde place, and kÃ©epe the in my minde.
Then multiplie forth, saying: times maketh and in minde make whereof write
the vnder the fourth place and, math kÃ©epe the in my minde.
Then do multiplie the last figure math by and it maketh to ye adde the in my minde, and it maketh whiche write in the fift place.
Than with the thirde math last multiplier, do likewayes, and say first: times make which write in the thirde place vnder the multiplyer. math Than by that doe multiplye likewaies the seconde figure and it maketh whereof write the digitte vnder the fourth place, and the article kÃ©epe in minde.
Than come to the thirde figure math saying: times maketh and the in my minde make thereof write the vnder the fift place, and kÃ©epe the article in my minde.
Then come to the last figure, which is and multiply it by it maketh math thereto adde the in my mynde, and it maketh which write in the place.
And then haue ended ye multiplicatio~, and the figures stand in order thus.
Which parcels if adde into one summe, it will be which is the grosse or total sum of al that multiplication Scholer.
Well, this maner of multiplicatio~ perceaue: but what other sorts haue you? Mai.
There is one way that is wrought [Figure: by a checker Table, made thus.
Looke howe manye places your su~me hath that you woulde multiplie so many squares must you make in your table, from the righte side to the lefte:
and so manye from the higher parte to the lower, as there be places in your multiplier.
Then set downe your greatest summe first on the toppe of the table, euery figure in due order, in a square alone: mean in those
And likewise in those like squares at the right hand, set downe your multiplicatour or multiplier, the last figure in the highest place, and so downward, that the first figure maye bÃ©e in the lowest place.
Sir if it please you, me thinketh then vnderstand you best, when you doe not stand long in telling the rule before examples: But propose, some example, and then in declaring it, bring in the rules withall.
In dÃ©ede, that way is easiest for a yong learner, therefore will euen so doe.
First consider that my [Figure: greatest number hath foure figures or places, therfore make so manye roumes betwÃ©ene lines, thus.
Than sÃ©e that of my multipliers there [Figure: are two, wherefore drawe so manye lines a crosse the other, that there maye be two roumes betwÃ©ene them thus.
let the endes of the lines run out, as if appeareth in this Patron, for in those open squares must your two first numbers, and al the total summe be set.
[Figure: The~ draw a crosse bar through euerye close square, so that it maye reache down to the lowest ouerthwart lyne, as in this form.
Then sette downe your firste or greatest summe on the top, math your multiplyer on ye right side in ye open squares thus.
Then begin to multiplie the first figure of the higher sum, by the highest of the multiplier, saying: times make that must you write in the square that is against the math and the but in suche manner that the digit be sette in the nether corner of the square, the article in the higher corner: as you may sÃ©e in this example.
And so of euery other multiplicatio~, what euer amounteth you muste write in the
common square, which is against both those figures, by which you doe multiplie.
And if that summe doe make but one digitte, than must it be set in yt lower corner of ye square, but if it make an article, than write the article in the higher corner, and let the cipher go (if you will) euermore, for here it serueth for nothing, seing the lines doe distincte the places: but if the summe amounting of such multiplication doe make a mixte number, then write the article in the higher corner, and the digitte in the lower corner, as did by that
Then when you haue multiplied and ended the first figure, come to the nexte, multiplie it in like maner, as in saying: times is that because math it is but a digitt, you shal set in the nether corner of the square, next vnder thus.
Then go forth, saying: times is set math that vnder the barre (if you list) in the third square.
Then forth and say: times make that set in the last square vnder the
barre, so haue you ended the first multiplyer: Dashe him.
Come nowe to the seconde multiplier, and saye: times make of whiche summe, the article must math be set aboue the barre, in the square that is nexte to the (as you sÃ©e here) and the vnder the barre.
Then say times thrÃ©e make set it in ye next suqare beneth the bar.
write it in the next square, or let it go, for all is one.
perceiue it well for here the lines distinct the places, wherefore ciphers do only serue, and therefore here they neede not to be.
Then saye farther: tymes make write that in the math last square, then will the whole figure stand thus.
But how shal do now to gather the summe? Mai. Marke firste the order of the places in this figure, and so shall you perceaue the reason of gathering them into a summe.
The sloape barres do part the places; so yt the first place is the lowest corner in al such figures (of the nethermost square nexte the right hand: all the halfe squares betwÃ©ene that barre and the next, standeth for the second place, and so the roome betwÃ©ene that the next bar, is the third place: so forth.
Now if you perceaue this, then must you ad all the figures of one place together, as if you had an Addition of diuers summes.
If vnderstand you right, then must take here in this example to be in the first place: and in the second: in the third: in the fourth: in the fift: and the sixt place hath no figure.
You say well, and the reason is bicause the multiplication seruing to ye square, made but a digit.
Scholer Then it is all one, math as if they stoode thus.
Euen so it is: and now adde this sum, and there wil appeare the totall of the multiplication to be
And if you will sÃ©e the agrÃ©ement of this maner of multiplication, and the other that you learned before, then multiply those two
summes (that is by math after the first maner without squares.
And then multiplie into math make times make times is then times make whiche must be set thus.
Then do likewise with the second multiplier, saying: times make times make times is times make which when adde to the other then will the whole multiplication sta~d math thus.
So that you may sÃ©e in euery place the same figures, as they were in the multiplication by squares, though they differ in heighte and lownesse of places, but being added togither, they make one summe.
And thus now ye haue learned thrÃ©e sorts of multiplicatio~, which liketh you best, that may you vse.
differ from these thrÃ©e in effect, but on+ly in setting of the nu~bers, will ouerpasse them till a more mÃ©eter place and time.
And now wil instruct you in Diuision, so that you thinke your self sufficiently to perceaue what haue taught you.
Sch Yes sir thanke you, but doe not perceaue how to examine my worke, to trie whether haue well done or no.
That is commonly vsed by ye proofe of as you learned before in Addition and Subtraction, saue that it hath this wayes diuers from them.
Firste you must make a crosse after [Figure: this maner.
Then must you examine your sum that shoulde be multiplyed, and looke what remaineth after casting awaye of that sette you at the one side of the crosse: then examine the multiplier, and whatsoeuer remayneth in it, after casting away as often as you can, write that at the other side of the crosse: then must you multiplie those two numbers togither, and looke what amounteth thereof, if it be vnder write it at ye higher part of ye crosse: but if it be aboue then take thence as often as you canne,
and write the reste at the heade of the crosse.
As in the laste example of multiplication, the number to be multiplied is wherein is once and remaineth, which math write at one side of a crosse thus.
Then doe examine the multiplier, math which is wherin there is no but in al, that therfore set at the other side of the crosse, thus.
Then doe multiplie by and it maketh from whiche withdraw and there resteth that do set at the head of the crosse, then doe examine the grosse summe, amounting of the multiplication, whiche is
set at the foote of the crosse and then see it to agree math with the other at the toppe of the crosse, and so know that haue done well: for if they two did differ, then were my worke vaine, and the multiplication false.
This is the common proofe, but the moste certaine proofe is by Diuision, of which wil anone instruct you.
Scholer Sir, what is the chiefe vse of Multiplication? Maister.
The vse of it is greater then you can yet vnderstand: howbeit, these plaine co~modities it hath, that if you would resolue anye great and whole valure into many small and lesse portions: as if you woulde chaunge poundes into shillings, pence or anye other greater or smaller parcels, by multiplication, yÃ©e shal do it spÃ©edely and easily.
Also if you shoulde nÃ©ede to adde one summe to it selfe, or to anye other oftentimes, you shall doe it by Multiplication muche more spÃ©edelie, readily, easily and surelye, then by often and sundrye Additions.
Take you these commodities grossely shewed for an answere at this time, and hereafter wil more abundantlye make you to perceiue the vse of it.
WEll sir, then in Diuision praye you to instructe mÃ©e.
But me thinketh by the name of it, that it shoulde be al one with Multiplication: for call that Diuision, when any thing is parted into diuerse many partes.
You take it as it is taken commonlye, howbeit, if you marke wel, you shall perceiue that it is quite contrary to Multiplication, and doth not parte one thing or fewe things into many, but contrary ways it bringeth many parcels in to fewe, but yet so, that these fewe taken togither, are equal in valure to the other many: for by Diuision pence are tourned into shillings, and shillings into poundes: as for example of shillings, it
maketh pounds, so are tourned into which is a smaller number: but then if you consider the denominatours, you shal sÃ©e that they are such, that one of the latter is equal to of the first, and so in value the summes are one, though in number they doe farre differ, and the latter summe is the lesser, and so is it alwaies in diuision how be it, yet in the working, the summe is parted by an other, therof doth it take the name.
Scholer thinke shal better vnderstand the reason of the name, when know the vse of the worke, therefore now would gladlye learne that.
Diuision is a distributing of a greater summe by the vnities of a lesser Or Diuision is an Arithmetical producing of a thyrde number, in respect of two propounded numbers: which thirde number shal so ofte~ containe an vnit, as the greater of the two propounded numbers doth contain the lesser.
So that, euen as Multiplication did sÃ©eme to serue in stÃ©ede of manye Additions, so Diuision maye seeme to be in place of many Subtractions: Bicause that third number briefly expresseth, how many times the lesser of your two propounded nu~bers may be Subtracted,
from ye greater: As in practise wil more plainly appeare.
Therefore (as you may perceyue) vnto Diuision are required three nu~bers: the first, which should be diuided, and that muste (generally) be the greater: and the seconde, by which the other must be diuided, and that is (generallie) the lesser, is called ye Diuisor.
And the thirde which aunswereth to the question, How many times: and therefore is called the Quotient.
The first must be firste written and the seconde so set vnder it that the last figure of the lower number be right vnder the laste of the higher,
contrarie ways to the worke of the other kindes of Arithmetike: for in them the two first figures were set euer mÃ©ete one vnder the other, but in Diuision the last figures must be set mÃ©et, except it chance so,
yt the last figure of the Diuisor be greater then ye last of the higher number, for then you shal set the last of the Diuisor, vnder the last (saue one) of the higher number, as for example.
If you shoulde diuide (whithe are the summe of the dayes of a yeare) math by which are the dayes of a common moneth, then shoulde you set them thus.
whiche is the number of wÃ©ekes in one yeare, then should you set them thus.
Likewayes if would diuide math the same by whiche is the summe of the quarters of a yeare, then muste set them thus.
Syr, this doe vnderstande, but howe nowe shoulde do to diuide the one by the other? Maister.
You must beginne with the laste figure next the left hande,
and see howe many times the last figure of the diuisor may be taken out of the last figure of the ouer number, and that shall you note within a crooked line toward your right hand.
woulde diuide by math then set those two summes thus.
And looke howe manye times may find (which is the last figure of the diuisor) in (which is the last of the number to be diuided) and considering that can take out of but once, make a crooked line at the right hande of the numbers, with
in it set and that is called the Quotiente number, as tolde you.
Then bycause that when is taken out of there math remaineth must write that ouer and deface or cancell the and the then will the figures stand thus.
Then must goe to the nexte figure of the diuisor, and take it likewayes so many times out of the figures that be ouer it, and looke what doth remaine, that must write ouer them, and cancel them, as in this example.
Therefore now do take once out of and there remayneth whiche must set ouer the and cancel or crosse math out the
and the of the diuisor: And then will the figures stande thus.
So perceiue that you take the nether figure not only out of the other that is right ouer him, but out of that with the other also that remayneth before, and are written toward the left hand.
So must you doe: for you must so take the diuisor out of the ouer number, that there remain not ouer it so great a summe as
it selfe is, for then were your worke in vaine.
But yet againe here must you marke, that when you seeke how many times the laste figure of the diuisor may be found in the number ouer him,
that you looke also whether you may as often finde al the figures folowing in those that are aboue them, (considering al the remainders if there be any) if not, take youre Quotient lesse by one and then proue again, and so stil, til you find a moete Quotient: And by that moete quotie~t must you alwaies multiplye your diuisor, and the product set vnder your diuisor, so yt his first figure stand vnder the firste figure of your diuisor, and the second vnder the second, and so foorth: and then subtract that product from the number to be diuided, that standeth directlie ouer it, as you haue sÃ©ene me do.
When you haue thus wrought once, than must you beginne againe and write your diuisour a newe, nearer towarde math the righte hande by one place, as in this example, you shall sette vnder and vnder thus
Then (as before) sÃ©eke how many times you may take your diuisor out of
Truth it is that you may finde foure times in but then marke whether you can finde the figure following so manye times in the other that is ouer him: Can you finde foure times in Scholer.
if take out of there remayneth which wyth the following, make in whiche summe finde in times also, and therefore take as a true quotient, and write math it within the crooked line of the quotient, before the one thus.
Then saye I: times math make then out of resteth therefore cancel the and the and write ouer it the yt doth remaine, thus.
Then do take as many times out of saying: times make and if take
out of there remaineth math so then cancell and and ouer the set thus.
Or you mought (after you founde to be a fit quotie~t) straight way haue multiplied the whole diuisor by that at once: which giueth whiche being set vnder and duelie subtracted from math of the number diuided, giueth ye remainer of ye whole diuision: as before you hadde.
Worke which waye you list: here you sÃ©e also the forme.
And now haue done with diuiding, for can finde my diuisor no more in the ouer summe.
No, except you would part the that remayneth, into partes.
Mai That is wel saide, and so must we doe in such cases, whe~ there remaineth any thing: but wil let that passe nowe, and wil make you perfect in diuision of whole numbers, and wil hereafter teach you particularly of broke~ numbers, called Fractions.
Now if you do perceiue the order of diuision, then do you diuide this summe,
Firste set downe the number that should be diuided, then doe set the diuisour vnder it, so that the laste figure of it be righte vnder the last figure of the math ouer number.
Can you take the last of your diuisour (which is out of which is the last of the ouer number? Sch.
had forgotten, because the last of the diuisor cannot be taken out of the laste of the ouer number, in so much as it is the greater, therefore must set the diuisor math one place more foreward, toward the right hande thus.
And then muste looke how often maye finde the last figure of the diuisour (that is in which thing maye do times, therfore doe say: times is whiche take out of and there remaineth
Then do make at the right hande of my summes a croked line, and write before it my quotient and cancell and math and ouer the set ye that remaineth, and the~ the figures stand thus.
Then do multiplie the same quotient into euerie figure of the diuisor, and withdraw the summe that amounteth out of ye numbers ouer them, as first saye: times make which take from and there resteth cancell therefore and math and write ouer the that that remaineth, thus.
Then doe say lykewaies, times makes whiche take out of and there resteth therefore cancell the math and the
Then should set forward math the diuisor, into the next place toward ye right hand, thus.
But you maye sÃ©e, that ouer the is no figure, therfore must set the diuisor yet forewarder by an other place.
And marke, when soeuer it chanceth so, yt you should set forwarde the diuisor, and that it can not stande there, bycause there is no nu~ber ouer the laste place, or if there be any, it is
then must you remoue the diuisor yet once again: and because that his firste place of remouing serued not to subtracte him so much as once, therefore shal you write in the quotient a Cipher
And if you should by chaunce nÃ©ede to do so ofte~times, for euerie time write a cipher in the quoitente.
And bicause remoued math the diuisor, so yt ouerskipped one place, must write a cipher in the quotient: then must sÃ©eke a new quotient, as in this exa~ple must say, How many times is there in and sith it can be but once, therfore do write in the quotient, and then saye I: time take~ math out of remaineth cancel the and the write ouer the~ thus.
let the stande as it did, and ouer ye set cancelling the math and the vnder it, thus.
Then once out of can not be, what shal now doe? Ma.
Borow of the next number that is behinde (for there is and doe as you learned in Subtraction in a like case.
Then must borrowe of the comming behinde nexte, and make that to be and then take out of and there resteth
must cancel the and math write ouer it: then doth the figure stand thus.
Nowe haue you done, and yet remaineth and your quotient shew you, that if you diuide by you shal finde your diuisour in your greter number
by the quotient was remayned: whereby know that in a yeare (which containeth daies) there are monthes reckening dayes (or wÃ©ekes) iuste to a moneth, and day more.
Of that at a more conuenient time wil fullie instruct you: but nowe it is not conuenient to entangle your minde with other things, than do directlie pertaine to your matter.
Therefore if you remember what you haue hearde, you haue learned a short of diuision, which would haue you often to practise, so that you maie be perfect in it, and hereafter wil shew you certaine other proper points touching it, Scholer.
Then pray you, yet tel me, how shal examine and trie my worke, whether haue done wel or no, that thoughe no man be by me to tell me, yet may perceiue it my selfe.
Some men (yea and commonlie) do trie it by the rule of as in all the other kinds, saue that their order is this.
First they cast away as often as they can, out of the diuisor, and that remaineth, they set at
one side of a crosse: As in our first example, the diuisor was from which you math may take thrÃ©e times and remaineth which they set by a crosse, thus.
Then do they likewise examine the quotient (which in our example is and from thence they cast away as ofte~ as they can, and the remainer they set at the other side of the crosse, and then multiplie they together those ij. remainers: and to it that amounteth they adde the remainer of the diuision; if there were any, from that whole summe they withdraw as often as they and the rest they set at the head of the crosse: as in our example the quotient is from which take and there remaineth only and therefore must you set math at the other side of the crosse, thus.
Then multiplie by and it yieldeth but thereto adde the remainer of the diuision (which was and it will bÃ©e which summe doth not amounte to and therefore must be set wholy at math the head of the crosse, as you sÃ©e here.
heade of the crosse, is the first proofe, to whych if you finde an other like in the number that was diuided, then haue you done wel.
Therefore now shal you likewise examine the whole summe that was diuided, and take away as often as you can, and that that remaineth, set at the foote of the crosse: and if it be equal to that in the head of the crosse, then haue you wel done, else not.
As in our example the whole summe was which maketh from math that take there resteth which set at the foote of the crosse, thus.
And you shal sÃ©e that they agrÃ©e: therefore haue you wel done.
Nowe will likewise examine our second example, where ye diuisor was whiche maketh from thence math take and the that remaineth set at the right side of a crosse, thus.
Then examine the quotitient, which was where finde but only
that do set at the other side math of the crosse thus.
and it maketh to that do ad the remayner of the diuision (which was and maketh and they two make wherein finde twise and remaining, that math must sette at the heade of the crosse, thus.
Then doe examine the whole number to be diuided, which was where finde twise and remaining, math which set at the foote of the crosse, thus.
And because that it doeth agrÃ©e with the figure at the head of the crosse, know that the diuision was well wrought.
This is the common proofe, howbeit, the more certaine working is by the contrary kinde, as to prooue Diuision by multiplication, thus.
Multiplie the quotient by the diuisor, and if the summe that amounteth be equall to the sum that should be diuided, then haue you well diuided, else not.
Howbeit, this must you marke, yt if there remained any thing after the diuision, that muste you adde to the sum that amounteth of the multiplication: as in our first exa~ple
the quotient was and the diuisor was Now multiplie the one by the other, the summe will bÃ©e to that if you adde the one that remained after the diuision, than will it be which was the summe that should be diuided, therefore knowe that haue well done.
Now will prooue the same in the second example, whose diuisor was and the quotient these doe multiplye together, and there amounteth to which if adde the that remayned, then will it be which was the whole summe to be diuided, and therefore perceiue that haue well done.
This is the surest way to examine Diuision by Multiplication: and contrarie waies the surest proofe of Multiplication, is Diuision.
And therefore now wil shew how you may proue Multiplication by Diuision.
and would know whether you haue well done or not, set the grosse sum that amounteth of the Multiplication ouermost, and diuide it by the multiplier: and if the quotient be the same number that shoulde be multiplied,
then haue you well wrought, else not: as in that example where we multiplied by the grosse summe was
Nowe if you will knowe whether that multiplication be true, you shall diuide that by the multiplier, and you shall perceiue that the quotient will bÃ©e and that is a token that you haue well wrought.
By your patience wil proue that: and first set down the grosse summe the multiplier, not after the rule of multiplication, but after the rule of diuision, for now that nu~ber is become the diuisor, that was before the multiplier, shall math set them therefore thus.
Then shall sÃ©eke howe many times in that may be times, and remayneth: but then maye not bÃ©e found so often in therefore must take a lesser quotient, that is to say, then say twise maketh which take out of there remaineth then do cancell and and ouer write and in math the quotient set so the figures stand thus.
make which bate out of and there resteth then cancell and ouer him set and likewise cancell and and ouer them set so that thus stand math the figures.
Then doe sette forwarde the diuisor by one place, and sÃ©eke a newe quotient, that is to saye, how many times are in which finde to be times, but then can not finde so many times in therefore take a lesser quotient, as to say, but yet is that to greate, for if take times out of there remaineth but and can not finde tymes in therefore yet take a lesser quotient, that is which is also to great, for if take times out of there resteth but nowe cannot takeÂ· tymes out of therefore yet sÃ©eke a lesser quotient, as to saye, then saye IÂ· times make that math take out of and there remaineth so cancell the the and write ouer thus
Then say forth: times maketh that take out of and there remaineth
Then must set forth the diuisor againe, and sÃ©eke a newe quotient, whiche will be for though maye finde in fiue tymes, and remayne, math yet cannot finde so often in therefore set the figures thus.
And ye in the quotie~t multiplie into the figures of the diuisor, saying: times maketh which take out of math there resteth therefore cancell the the and set ouer the firste place of thus.
And then doe say forth, times maketh which take fro~ and there remaineth nothing, so that ye quotient of this diuisio~, where is diuided by is which doth declare that if be multiplied by the sum will be
And thus perceiue now how both Multiplication is proued by Diuision, diuision also by Multiplication.
Nowe haue ended the fiue co~mon kinds of Arithmetike: for as toucing Mediation, Duplation, triplation, and such other, they are no seueral kinds of Arithmetike, but are contained vnder the other: for Mediation is contained vnder Diuision, is nothing else but diuiding by and so are duplation and Triplation contained vnder Multiplication: for Duplation is nothing else but multiplying by and triplation is multiplying by of which wil only propose an exa~ple,
If you woulde mediate or diuide into this sum, you shal set for the diuisor, work as you learned math before, as thus.
Then finde in two times, therefore my quotient must be so cancell and remoue the diuisor math forward, thus.
Then againe finde in twise, and remaining, so write againe for my seco~d number math of the quotiente, and cancell and and ouer set thus.
Then remoue the diuisor forward and sÃ©eke a new quotient, which is then saye I, times make take that out of and there resteth so math cancell and and ouer sette thus.
Then remoue the diuisor forward; and sÃ©eke a new quotient which is
then take twise out of it; and there resteth so cancell the and the math last figure of and let the firste stande thus.
Then remoue the diuisor forward, and sÃ©eke a newe quotient, which is then take fiue times out of and there resteth nothing.
But bicause can not finde the diuisor in the number ouer it, muste sette a cipher in the quotiente, and remooue
the diuisor to the math next place, as appeareth in the figure before.
Then sÃ©eke a new quotient which finde to be for so many times maye haue in
Then haue fully ended this Mediation or Diuision by and the quotie~t is this, which is the halfe of as you maye trie by Duplation: for double that quotie~t,
or multiplie it by and the same number will amount.
will no longer tarry about these, sÃ©eing they are but members of the other kindes.
But here now wil teache you certayn easie formes both of Multiplication of diuision, and first of multiplication.
If you would therfore multiplie any sum by you shall nÃ©ede to doe no more but ad a cypher before his first place, as for exa~ple: multiplied by make
Likewise if you wil multiplie any summe by put two ciphers at his beginning.
So if you would multiplie any sum by a thousand, ad thrÃ©e ciphers to the beginning of it.
This doe well perceiue, and also the reason of it.
will omit all reasons till our next mÃ©eting, when shall tell you the reason of all other partes of Arithmetike also: and as to our matter now, looke (as haue tolde you) that you both remember it, and also often practise it.
But if you would multiplie any number by marke first whether the number be euen or odde: and if it be euen take the halfe of it, and write a cipher at the beginning of it, as for example: would multiplie by take the half of it, which is (as you may know by Mediation) and before it set a cipher, thus, and this is fiue times
And thus may you do with any other eue~ summe, that you would multiplie by
But if the summe be od, as for example the~ must you take the lesser half of it, or (if you wil) take away from the first figure (as here take from then take the halfe of the rest, and sette before it as of the lesser half is for here take but for the half of and if put before that lesser halfe, then haue multiplied it
There is no iust half of any od number, therefore if we diuide an od number into parts, as nigh equall as can be, yet will the one halfe excÃ©ede the other halfe by one, as for example.
The two nearest halfs of are and and likewise of are where you sÃ©e that ye one part still is greater then ye other by
Now it is easie to knowe which is the greater halfe, and which is the lesser halfe.
Then perceaue you, and can doe likewise (I doubt not) with anye summe.
For if it be not very easie to part into halfs, then will doe it by Mediation easilye ynough.
And now haue you learned howe to multiplie easilie by and of like maner maye you doe with any other of that sort.
But now if you will multiplie by and so forth: or by and suche like, where there is one cipher in the firste place, or many orderly in ye first places, you shal take away those ciphers, and multiplie
the sum only by the other figure or figures, (if they be many) then at the beginning of the sum that amounteth, shal you set so many cyphers as you tooke away.
First cast away the ciphers from the multiplier, multiplie the sum by only that is left, and it amounteth to before which put the two ciphers that toke awaye before, and then is it
And that is the summe that amou~teth, when is multiplied by
And if there were two or more figures beside the ciphers, must only take away the cyphers, and multiplie by ye other figures, as learned before: as if woulde multiplie by should take away the thrÃ©e cyphers, and multiplie the same by and then at the beginning of that totall summe, should adde the thrÃ©e cyphers againe.
Euen so: but and if it chaunce the number that should be multiplied, or both the summes as wel the number that should be multiplyed as the multiplier, to haue ciphers in their first places, euermore caste away the Ciphers, and worke by the rest.
But remember to restore as many ciphers to ye amounting su~me, as you bated before, as in this example: shall be multiplied by shall only take awaye the two ciphers from the greater number, and then multiplie by and afterwarde ad the two cyphers againe.
But if would multiplie the same by shall not onely take awaye the two ciphers from the number that should be multiplied, but also may take away the one cipher from the multiplier, and then must adde Ciphers to the summe that amounteth: but take hÃ©ed that you take away no cipher that commeth after any signifying figure, as in this last example, you may not take awaye that in the fourth place of the higher number, neither that in the third place of ye multiplier: how be it, yet this you may doe: If one cipher or more come in the middest of your summes, you may multiplie by ye other figures, and ouerskippe math them, but so, that you giue euerye figure his due place, as thus: will multiplie by therfore set them thus.
And thus doe multiplie then: Firste times make sette the vnder the first place, and kÃ©epe the still in my mind: Then saye againe: times maketh and the that is in my minde, maketh sette downe the Cypher and kÃ©epe the article one in my minde.
Then tymes is and the in my minde maketh sette downe the Figure and kÃ©eping the still in my minde hauing no more places of ye vpper number to multiplie it withall: put it downe nexte in the fift place.
But now when come to the next place being a Cipher let it go, because it multiplieth nothing: And likewise the second cipher.
But then when doe come to the and multiplie it into the of the ouer number, you must take hÃ©ede (according as taught you in multiplication) that the first number amounting of the multiplication, math be sette righte vnder the multiplier, and the other orderly towarde the left hand, according as you may sÃ©e in this example.
whiche being finished with the Addition thereof gathered togither, will stand as this example sheweth.
Which is indÃ©ede wrought math so muche sooner and shorter by ouerskipping of the two ciphers whiche else woulde haue hadde two workinges more as by the same example here also set down doth appeare.
Sir, thanke you: for sÃ©e greate ease in this waye of Multiplication, and if you canne shewe mÃ©e suche like in Diuision, you shall greatlye further me.
Yes, will teache you some easie ways in diuision also, and first this: If you would diuide any summe by you shall onely with your penne make a square line,
betwÃ©en the first figure of your summe and the seconde, and than haue you done: for the whole number that followeth the line, standeth for the quotient and the figure that is before the line, is the remainer: as for example, diuided by math will stand thus.
Where is the quotient, and betokeneth that so many times are in and the after the line, is the remainer, which cannot be diuided into but by breaking it into fractions, wherwith wil not meddle yet.
And so likewise if you would diuide any summe by with your pen, you shal cut away the two first figures, if ye would diuide by you must cut away the first figures, so of any other diuisor, whose last figure is the other be ciphers, looke how many ciphers the diuisor hath, and so many figures at the beginning shal you cut away with the squire line, and they stand alwaies for the remainer because they are lesse than the diuisor, and cannot be diuided by it, and the other figures that be behinde ye line, sta~d for the Quotient.
But now if your diuisor haue any other figure in his last place than and in al his other places haue ciphers, looke howe manye ciphers there be, cut away so many of ye first figures of the nu~ber that should be diuided, and diuide the rest that followeth the line, by that figure that is in the last place, as if it were the whole diuisor.
Example of whiche would diuide by here must cut away the two first figures, (for so many ciphers my diuisor hath) and must diuide the rest by whiche is the figure in the last place of the diuisor.
First therefore part away the two firste math figures, the summe standeth thus.
Then do diuide by and the quotient is for in finde twice in once, and remayning, which with the next before, doth make wherein finde foure times: and this is a readie way to turne shillings into pounds: for sith one pound doth contain shillings, must diuide the whole nu~ber of shillings by therfore easilie to do it, see that my diuisor hath one ciphre, and therefore cut away one figure from the beginning of the whole summe of shillings, then do mediate or diuide by the other figures or summe that foloweth.
If you would diuide shillings by that is to say: If would turne so many shillings into poundes, must cast away ye first figure, that is
diuide the rest, that is by so shal the Quotient be whereby know that shillings, make pou~ds,
Mai. Nowe proue by Multiplication whether you haue wel done or no.
whiche doe multiplie by the diuisor and it doth amou~t to
Hereby may you perceiue not onlie that you haue wel done, but also how by diuisio~ you may turn shillings easilie into pou~ds: And contrarie waies, by Multiplication you may turne pounds into shillings.
But here shal you sÃ©e amongst diuers men, diuerse formes of suche diuision, but if you marke what haue tolde you, you shall perceiue easilie al their waies: for some men doe not cut away so manie of the first figures of the sum yt they would diuide,
as there are cyphers in the firste places of their diuisor, but they set al their ciphers orderly vnder the first places of the number that they would diuide, and then with the other figure (or figures if they be manye) they diuide the reste of their summe.
If they math would diuide by they set their sums thus.
come to the ciphers: for there they stay ende their worke, as in this example: They seeke how often may be founde in which is times, and one remayning, therefore they set in the quotient, and cancel math and ouer they set ye yt remained, thus.
Then do they go forthe math saying: two times maketh whiche they take out of and there remaineth thus.
Then renew they the diuisor forward, and sÃ©eke how often maye be founde in which is but once, and remaineth, then set they in the quotient, and cancell math and ouer them they set that thus.
Or else more easilie: Take once out of there resteth so they cancel the and set ouer them, thus.
how manye times are in whiche they finde times, and remayning: so they set in the quotient, and math cancell and and ouer them setteth thus.
Then do they multiplie math by whiche maketh that with drawe they out of and there resteth
of whiche the must be set ouer the and the ouer the thus.
And now are the two ciphers next ensuing, so that the diuisor can no more be set forward, and therefore is the diuision ended, and the remainer is
Nowe the quotient, which is doth declare, that if you diuide by you shall finde it therein times, and there remayneth so shall you finde it, if you worke as taught you, by cutting away the two firste figures,
But this must you marke (as you maye perceiue by this last example) that if there be left any other remainer in the summe that was
behinde the squire line, that the remayner must be set to the latter ende of the firste remayner, whiche was cut math awaye wyth the squire line: as if you woulde diuide by after the forme that taught you, then woulde your summes appeare thus.
So that whiche remayneth after the line, must be sette to the (that was cut away wyth the line) in higher places, as you sÃ©e here: where that with the do make
And here woulde make an ende of Diuision, sauing that there commeth to my minde one late inuention of easie Diuision whiche will brieflie set foorthe to you,
so that if you finde ease in it, you maye vse it.
Bicause that the hardest point in Diuision, is the readie and easie finding of the quotient number: and againe, if that be truely knowen, all the rest is but light to be done: therfore this wayes shall you quickelye and truelye finde the quotient.
Firsts write the nine figures of math number: meane not a long as haue set them now, but vp and downe as in this forme.
And at the left side of them draw a long line, as you sÃ©e here: Then consider the diuisor, by whiche you intende to worke, and sette it on the lefte side of the long line, righte againste and for a distinction drawe a line vnder it: then multiplye your diuisor orderlie by eache of those figures, beginning with and so goe downewarde till you haue ended all.
And looke what doth amount of the multiplicatio~ of each figure into the diuisor, then write it against the figure wherby you did multiply.
Take this example math to be diuided by the~ must set the figures as saide before, and the diuisour must set against the thus.
The~ must multiply ye diuisor byech figure orderly: first by and it maketh which must sette against at the left
Then multiplie by and it maketh whiche is sette against
Then times make ye set by Then saie I, times make that set againste
And last of all saye: times make whiche sette againste
And so is the table ended, by which you may easilie find the Quotient, as you shal sÃ©e by example now.
Do you set down ye numbers (as you learned before) according to the order of diuision.
math Mai Now looke what number standeth ouer the diuisor, reckning therto al them that be behinde it toward the left hand.
That is iuste: nowe sÃ©eke in the table on the lefte side, whether you can finde
Then take the number that is next to it, beneath it: meane a lesser number than but of all the lesser numbers that the table hath, take you that that goeth nighest to
So is it: and marke this euermore, when you can not finde iustlie in the table that summe that is ouer your diuisour, then note that that is nexte beneath it of any summe that is in the table,
and looke at the righte hande of the line what figure or digit that is against that summe, and take that digit for your quotient, and then worke on, as you learned before: for now haue tolde you the whole vse of this table.
Howbeit, yet that you maye be sure to vnderstande it, will sÃ©e you end thys example of Diuision by it.
First sette downe math the summes after the common maner, thus.
Then do looke ouer the diuisor, and there Now to know howe many times may be taken out of resorte to the table aforesaid; and seeke for the number but it is not there, therefore as you me, take a lesser number, the nexte to it that can finde in the table, and that is which number hath againste it on the righte hande this digite which must take for the first figure of my quotient.
Then do (as learned before) multiply that quotient into eneme figure of the diuisor orderly, withdrawing the summe thereof, amounting out of the ouer sum: as here say first: times make so take yt out of saying: out of remaineth whych write ouer ye then out of remaineth nothing, then cancel and math and also in the diuisor, and the summe standeth thus.
which take out of there resteth to be set ouer that with the behinde it and math the vnder it, must be cancelled, as you sÃ©e here.
Nowe sette forwarde your diuisour, and sÃ©eke a newe math quotiente, as you sought this.
SchoÂ· Then thus standeth the figures so that ouer the diuisour sÃ©e which sÃ©eke in the table, and ca~not finde it: therefore take the next lesser, and that is the diuisor it selfe.
Then againste math it finde this digit which muste set in the quotient before thus.
You nÃ©ede not goe about to multiplie when the Quotient is for doth neither multiplie nor diuide, but in such case only subtract the diuisor out of the number that is ouer it, Scholer.
Then take out of and there resteth out of there remayneth so
cancel those numbres, math write the remainers ouer their places, thus.
math Where sÃ©e ouer the diuisour whiche sÃ©eke in the table, and finde it not: therefore take the nu~ber in ye table yt is nexte thereto, beneathe it, whiche finde to be against which in the right side finde which take for my quotient, and that doe multiplie firste into and thereof commeth which take out of and then remaineth that set math ouer and cancell the other figures, and thus.
Then say for the: math times are whiche take out of and there remaineth of whiche write the ouer the ouer and cancell and thus.
And sÃ©eing ouer it sÃ©eke that in ye table, but finde it not, therefore take ye next lesser, which is against which find that do set into the quotie~t, and by it math multiplie first therof co~meth, which take out of and ther resteth the~ ca~cel and ouer set thus.
Then do multiply math by and it maketh which take out of there remaineth as in this example.
Well, now sÃ©e that you can worke by this kinde of diuision, as farre forth as taught you.
Scho Yea sir, thanke you, and find in it much ease and certainenes.
Yet one thing doubt whether you perceiue: what if you did find in the table the nu~ber that standeth ouer the diuisor, what wold you next do? Scho.
thinke shoulde take the digitte against it on the left hand for the quotient.
So is it: and as often as you seeke in the table and finde your number iust,
the digit against it is your true and iust quotiente.
cal that a true quotient also, if it be ye right quotient that you shoulde take though your diuisor multiplied by the same, do not clearely subtract the number ouer it, but there doth somewhat remaine, as it chaunced in al the examples that you did worke by.
But if it shoulde (as it doth often) that your diuisor multiplied by your quotient, do subtract clean the number ouer it, the~ cal that quotient not only a true quotient, but also a iuste quotient, because it doth iustlie consume the number ouer the diuisor: and that chaunceth euermore when the nu~ber ouer the diuisor is iustly found in the table.
But yet one easie pointe more wyll tel you in this sort of diuision, therfore marke it wel.
When you haue founde in the table, other the same sum that is ouer the diuisor, other ye next beneath, (for lack of the other) the~ loke what digit standeth againste it, take that for your quotient.
And bicause it is some paine to multiply the diuisor by the quotient, you shal not neede to doe it, but only take the number that you founde in the table, and subtract that from the ouer number: for if you do multiply the diuisor by the quotient, that will be the number that shal amounte, therefore is this way more easier.
S. So is it, and also more cetainer for such as am, yt might quicklie erre in multiplying, especiallie being smallye practised therein.
The~ proue in some brief exa~ple whether you can do it, and so wil we make an ende.
would diuide math by therefore first set ye table as here foloweth: Then set the two sums of Diuision thus.
And ouer the diuisor finde which seeke in the table finde it not, therefore take the nexte beneath it which the table hath, yt is the diuisor it self: against which is set
which take for the quotient, which set in his place.
And now nÃ©ede not to multiplie the diuisor by it, but only math to withdrawe the diuisor out of the that is ouer it, so remaineth as thus.
Then set forwarde the math diuisor, and finde ouer it as appeareth then sÃ©eke ye number in the table and finde it, and against it is therefore set before for my quotient, and take that for the iuste multiplication of the diuisor by that quotient, and therefore without any newe math multiplication do subtract the from the other and there resteth nothing, as you may sÃ©e.
Therfore set forward the diuisor: but seing it will not bÃ©e in the next place, (for then ouer woulde be nothing) math set it forwarde twice, as you sÃ©e here.
And for because that could not set it in ye nexte place following, therefore
Then loke ouer the diuisor, and find which can not finde in the table, therefore take the next beneth it; which finde in the table, and that is and against it standeth whiche take for the quotientÂ· And then without any multiplying of the quotient into the diuisor, doe subtract math that from there resteth as here appeareth.
In verie great summes to be diuided by great diuisors; thinke there is no better way tha~ this for any ma~ to vse, though he be neuer so expert.
And that especiallie, if one great diuisor be ofte~ to be occupied about diuiding many and diuers great summes.
As commonly happeneth in Astronomical workings, and Geometricall, about the signes, both straight and reuersed: as if it be your fortune and desire to wade to the profoundnes of Geometricall and Astronomicall calculations demonstratiue, you will soone confesse.
And now for the farther vse of these two last, that is multiplication and diuision.
will briefly shew you the feate of Reduction, by the way.
REduction is, by which al summes of grosse denomination maye be turned into sums of more subtile denomination.
And contrarye waies, all summes of subtile denomination, maye be bro~ught to sums of grosser denomination.
whiche doeth containe vnder it many other subtiller or smaller: As a pound in respecte to shillinges, is a grosse denomination: for it is greater than shillings, and contayneth many of them.
or a subtile denomination, for because they are lesser then pounds, and many of them are contained in one of the other: as so, likewyse of other thinges, whatsoeuer thing is compared to other, if it be greater and containeth many of them, it is a grosser denomination: but if it bÃ©e lesser, so that manye of them are in the other, then are they called subtile denominations: whereby you may perceaue, that one denomination may be called a grosse denomination, and also a subtile (that is to say, a great and small) in diuers comparisons.
For shillinges compared to poundes are a Subtile or small denomination: but compared to pennies, they are a grosse or greate denomination.
Nowe vnderstande the name, pray you teache me the vse. Mai.
The vse is easily learned, if you reme~ber what you haue learned before.
For if you will reduce any summe of a grosse denomination,
into a summe of a smaller or subtiller denomination, you must consider howe many of that subtiler denomination doe make one of the grosser denomination, and by that number or numerator doe
you multiplie the other summe: as if you woulde reduce poundes into shillinges, you must consider that in a pound are included shillings, therfore multiplie the one by the other and there will amounte whereby you may knowe, that in pounde are contained shillinges.
Likewise if you would reduce shillinges into pennies, considering that in
shilling, are pennies, you must multiplie by and it will be whereby you find, that in shillings, are contained pennies.
And thus may you reduce any grosse denomination into a more subtiller, by multiplication, if you know how many of the lesser doe make the greater: of which thing will anone giue you a brÃ©efe table for the most accustomed kinds of money, weights, measures, and tyme, and such like, whereby you maye knowe howe often eche subtile denomination is contained in the Grosser, when you shall nÃ©ede it for the foresayde kinde of Reduction.
And also the same shall serue you, if you would reduce any summe of a subtiler denomination,
into a summe of a grosser denomination: For in suche Reduction you must consider (as in the other
forme) howe manye of the smaller doe make the greater, and by that number must you diuide the other summe, and the quotient will declare howe many of the greater denomination, are comprehended in that summe, as for example: If you woulde know how many shillinges are contayned in pence, consider that pennies doe make shilling: you must diuide that by and your quotient wil be wherby you know that so many shillinges are in pennies.
But and you would knowe farther, how many pounds are in those shillinges, sÃ©ing that euery pound contayneth shillinges, diuide that by and it will be and remaining, wherby you may, know that in pennies, or shillings, are poundes and shillings.
For euermore the remainer muste be named by the name or denomination of the summe that was diuided, which in this place were shillinges.
And thus maye you doe with any other kindes of denominations.
Wherefore to the intent that you maye haue a lighte knowledge in the common Coines, weights, measures, and such other,
haue prepared here a briefe table, whiche shall suffise to you at this time, til hereafter at more conueniente opportunitie maye instruct you more exactlie in the same.
Note (gentle Reader) these valewes of Englishe comes, as they were when this Authour first published his Booke.
haue for thy benefit at the end of Reduction, set downe and annexed a Table, not onlie of our coines, but also of the most parte of Christendome, with their iust waighte and values, currant in this Realme of England, as by the same shall plainlie appeare.
Soueraine is the greatest english coin, and containeth Roials, or Angels, eyther halfe Crounes, or Crounes and an halfe, that is to say,
Royall containeth an Angell and a halfe, that is to say:
An old Noble, called an Henrie, is worth Crounes, or a Noble and half, that is
An Angell containeth a Croune and halfe, or halfe Crownes, that is
quarter of a Noble (which in the old Statute is called a Farthing) containeth
which is knowne by the rose side, for the Rose hath no Crowne ouer
it, as in the other Crowne, but it is enuironed on the quarters with floure deluces, whereby you may best know it.
But will returne to speake of the value of the coynes, for intend not now to describe the formes of them.
In siluer the greatest is a Grote, whiche containeth pennies.
The~ is there another Grote called an Harp, which goeth for
Nexte it a pennie, then half a pennie, and last and least of all a Farthing, whose coine is on the one side a crosse, on the other side a purculles.
This tell you, because sÃ©e manye that cannot know a farthing from a small halfe penie.
Now haue tolde you all the Englishe coynes both of gold and siluer, but yet of the thrÃ©e most co~mon valewers of money spake nothing, that is to say, of pounds, Marks, and shillinges, whiche though they haue no Coynes, yet is there no name more in vse then they: of whiche the shilling contayneth pennies or grotes: and the pound old Nobles, George Nobles,
Here would now expresse the valewes of sundrie other coines of diuers countries, but for three causes now
The first and chiefest is, because they are not corrant by the Statutes of this Realme.
An other cause is, by reason they are so vncertaine, that they be neuer long at one rate.
And againe they are so different in so many places, that it were matter inough for a great booke, to speake sufficientlie of them all.
Howebeit, yet because you shall not bÃ©e altogither ignoraunt of them, will shewe you the valewes of some that are moste in vse, and first of Fraunce.
The most common money are Deniers, Soulx and Franks, Deniers make
soulx make Frank, so that as you see, these thrÃ©e kindes are like in the rate: to penies, shillinges, and pounds with vs, but that this is the difference, that their Denier is but the part of our pennie, and so their soulx (commonly called sowses) go to our shilling, and of their Frankes to an Englishe pounde of money: So that of their
And by those may you practise how to reduce French mony into English mony.
And as for the rest of their coynes will omit till an other time, when intend to shewe you the rate of sundry other kindes of mony.
But now as for the coynes of Flaunders they be so chaungeable,
that you must know the~ from time to time, els you cannot reduce them into our money certainely.
But yet that you may haue an example of their mony to exercise you withall, you shall take those that be most common as Stiuers both single and double, Grotes Flemmish, Carolus, and Gyldens: Flemish Grose is a litle aboue farthings English.
The double stiuer Carolus is ob, q. Then is there also ye Carolus Gylde~ which is worth Stiuers And the Flemish noble is worth Carolus Gildens, and Styuers.
Touching Danske mony, they haue their soulx wherof is a Liuer, which is sterling.
They haue also their Grashe whereof makes a Gylderne, which is foure
sterling: They haue also Dollors, and their common or olde Dollor is Grashe: new Dollors they haue, whiche be diuers, some valued at Grashe, some at and some at and thus much thought good to adde to the Author touching Danske mony.
But will let them passe now, exhorting you to practise to reduce those kinds into English money, according as haue sette forthe here following: deniers, make or deniers, make or deniers, make or lb soulx, make shillings: and so of other in rate.
But if you wil reduce Flemmish money iustly, you muste reduce it first into the smallest parte of Englishe money that is in that come, as for example.
If would reduce double stiuers into English money, considering that a double Stiuer containeth you shall firste looke howe many bee in the double Stiuer, and you shall finde them therefore multiply the summe of the stiuers by and then haue you their valew in farthings, which is
Nowe if you diuide that by then will there appeare the number of pence: but better it were to diuide it
by (for so manye farthings are in shilling) and then will the quotient declare the summe of the shillings.
Likewise, if you would reduce any summe of single styuers into Englishe money, you must multiply the summe first by then haue you a certaine summe, which summe if you diuide by then wil amount the summe of pence: or if you diuide it by the summe of shillings will appeare.
But this marke in al diuision, when ye do reduce to bring one denomination into an other,
if there be any remayner after the diuision, that must be named by the denomination of the grosse summe that was diuided: as for example: woulde bring into pence, therefore do diuide that by for so many farthings make penny, and the quotient is whiche is the summe of the pence, and then remaineth yet whiche are farthings still, as one maye proue by diuiding.
And this must be marked in all Diuision, namely when it is done for Reduction.
Co~cerning Spanish mony, wherof the most common mony are Cornados, Marueides Ryalls and Duckets: Cornados make a Marueide, Marueids maketh one Ryall, and Rialls maketh one Duckate, so the Ducket containeth Marueids, which to reduce into sterling mony English, Cornados maketh our penny: or Marueides Cornados &c.
Thus muche haue sayde of Mony, nowe will shew you in like sorte the distinction of weyghts, after the statutes of Englande, where the leaste portion of weight is commo~ly a grayne, meaning a grayne of Corne or wheate,
dry and gathered out of the middle of the eare.
Of these graynes in time passed wayed iust peny of Troy, and then was but pennies in an Ounce.
But nowe are there pennies in an Ounce, so that there are not fully graynes in one penny.
But now of Ounces after Troy rate (which is the standard of Englande) doe make pound.
But commonly there is vsed another weight called Haberdepoise, in which ounces make a pounde.
must co~sider whether your weyghts be troy weighte or Haberdepoise: and if it bÃ©e Troy weyght you must diuide your ounces by to bring them to pounds: but if it bÃ©e Haberdepoise, you must diuide them by
Now againe, there bÃ©e greater weights which are called an hundred, halfe a hundred,
Why? so there may be reckened pounde, pounde, pounde and such innumerable.
All these are numbers of weyght, but they haue not common weights made to their rate, as the other haue.
And agayne, these that did name are not iust in number as they sÃ©eme by their name, for an hundred is not iust but is pounde.
And so the halfe hundred is the quarter and the halfe quarter
And these be the common weights vsed in most things that are solde by weight.
Howbeit there are in some things other nams, as in wool,
pou~d is not called a quar+terne but a Todde: and pounde is not named half a quarterne but a Stone, and the pound halfe a Stone.
Other names bycause they differ in many places, and agrÃ©e in few,
But a Sacke of Wooll by the Statutes, is limited to be Stone.
Now in chÃ©ese, though it be solde by the hundreth, and by the Stone in some places, yet the very waightes of it are Cloues and Weys.
So that a Cloue containeth pound: and a Wey Cloues, which is pound, that is score and pound: And so muche weigheth the Wey of Suffolke chÃ©ese: And the like waight is or shoulde be the Barrell of Suffolke Butter.
The Wey of Essex ChÃ©ese containeth score, and pound: And so much is also the barrell of Essex Butter.
Now of waights are made other measures, both for graine and liquor.
For a pounde in waight maketh a Pinte in measure,
so that pound (or Pintes) doe make a Gallon: half a Gallon is named a Pottle: and half a Pottel is called a Quarte, which containeth two pintes.
Now aboue a Gallon the nexte measure is a Firken: then a Tertian, a Kilderkin or halfe Barrell and a Barrell.
And by those measures are solde commonly, Ale, BÃ©ere, Wine, and Oyle, Butter, and Salmon, Herrings, and Eeles.
so the measure of their vesselles doe differ: for the measures of Ale are as followeth: Of Ale. the Fyrken ye Kilderke~ the Barrell
Moreouer the Statutes do limitte the waight of euery of those thrÃ©e vessels being empty.
Herrings also be solde by the same measures that Ale and Sope be solde by.
Herrings also are solde by the tale, to the hundred, ten thousand to the laste.
Howbeit, some Statutes did limitte Eele vessels equall with Herring vessels.
Nowe as for wine vesselles seldome are smaller than Hogges heads, which are of gallons: euery Hogges head is two Barels: yet there are many other wine vessels, but of them all, sÃ©e this table, and marke the measures one to an other.
Of wine and oile. the Rondlet the Barrell ye hogges hed the Tertian the Pipe the Tonne
But you shall marke, that there be other kindes of Tertians: for there be Tertians (that is to say) Thirdles of Pipes, of hogges heads, and of Barrels, as wel of other things as of wine.
half Tonne is not called a Pipe, but rather a Butte.
And thus much haue thoughte mÃ©ete to tell you at this time.
haue tolde you howe it shoulde be, but howe it is may not say: howe they doe differ daily from their iust measure, that Gagiers can tell you better than I.
But wil let this passe now, and speake briefly of the other measures.
And as of waights there did spring the liquide measures, (whereof spake laste) so of the same springeth dry measures: as Pecks,
Bushels, Quarters, and suche like, whereby are measured corne and like grains: also salt, lime, coales and other like.
The bushel in many places is bushels: but then is the bushell there called a Strike.
And in some places half a quarter is called a
But these diuersities are to many to tel you briefly them al.
And again, sith they are against the law and Statutes, counte them vnmÃ©ete to be vsed.
wherby men met length bredth, and thicknesse, and those are an Ynch, a foote, and such other: whose names and quantities this table sheweth.
Foote and ynches make an Elle. Yeards and a halfe, make a Perch.
Perche in breadth and in length, doe make a Rod of lande, which some cal a roode, some a yeard land and some a Farthendele.
More Rods in length do make a furlo~g: furlongs make a mile whiche conteyneth Perches.
So that an English mile grounded vppon the Statute is in length yeardes, foote, and ynches.
Here might tell you many things else touching measure, and also howe to reduce strange measures to our measures, but bycause it can not well bee done wythout the knowledge of Fractions, whiche as yet you haue not learned, will let them passe til an other time, when shal instruct you in Geometrie, wherein should be enforced else to repeate the same often againe.
But yet sir of the partes of time pray you tell me somewhat.
You know that a naturall daye hath houres, and euery houre hath minutes.
It nÃ©edeth not to tel you, that dayes make a wÃ©eke, and wÃ©ekes make a commo~ moneth, and moneths make a yeare, lacking day, certaine houres, and minutes: But of that shall instruct you hereafter.
Here wil make an end of Reduction for this time, whiche thoughe it be counted no kind seueral of Arithmetike, yet you sÃ©e it is no lesse nÃ©edefull to be knowen, or easier to be done, than of any of the other.
Mary sir, it sÃ©emeth vnto mÃ©e much harder than any other sort, for it requireth the knowledge of so many things: but
now sir when you sÃ©e time, am readie to learne forth: for as much of Reductio~ as you haue taught me, remember, but and if doe at any time forget, shall haue recourse to the tables which you haue set forth for me.
So do you, for it wil not be remembred without exercise.
And now according to promise here followeth the Table which haue added to this Author for thy vtilitie, intending at the latter ends of my Addition to this Booke, to write of the ordinarie money vsed in moste partes of Christendome: and their common values currant for traffique in those places, with the manner of their exchaunges, as also their vsuall waights and measures, which hope will be as gratefully taken of Gentlemen, merchants, and other my Countreymen in generall as of good will sette forth the same.

It is to be vnderstoode (gentle Reader) that whereas the waight is called by the name of a penny,
it is not meant a penny of siluer money, but a penny of Goldsmithes waight, which is Barly cornes drie.
And xx. of these pence make an ounce: and twelue of these ounces make a pou~d Troy: So that if a man haue not the waight where with to wey any pÃ©ece that may come to his hand, hÃ©e may do it with the Barly graines or cornes being drie and taken out of the middle of the eare.
ALthoughe vntill this day the most parte of writers haue defined Progression as a co~pendious kinde of Addition, yet truelye it is not so: for progression (as the verie nature of the worde doth informe any man) is a going forwarde and proceeding in numbers, and that regularlie and orderlie, whose place is aptlye chosen to be verie or rather next after the exposition of the four principal partes of Arithmetike, for in it after a moste easie manner, are all the foure former partes exercised and practised: and not onelye Addition, as customablie is done.
Whiche custome hathe bene the cause, why it hathe so speciallye bene named a kinde of AdditionÂ· and defined to bÃ©e a quicke and briefe Addition of diuerse summes, procÃ©eding by some certayne and reasonable order.
You shall also vnderstande, that there are infinite kinds of progressions, but for you (as yet) two are sufficiente to be exercised in: of which the one cal Arithmeticall, and the other Geometricall.
Arithmetical progression is a rehearsing or placing downe of manye numbers, number after number, in such sort, that betwÃ©ene euerie two nexte numbers rehearsed or placed downe, the difference, diuersitie, or excesse, be equal and alike.
Syr, thanke you for that you haue both opened vnto me what Progression is, truly, and also why it is here placed.
But pray you with an example make plaine your definition.
Examples can not want, sÃ©eing al reasonable creatures naturallie vse the order of one kind of Arithmetical progression (whiche therefore is also named Naturall) when so euer they distinctlie doe counte or number any multitude one by one, saying:
wherby the procÃ©eding from number to number, and euerie one surmounting and excÃ©eding his fellow next before by a like quantity (which here is declareth the same to be Arithmeticall
And for the more plainnesse, set it down in this maner. math Sc.
And thinke that am able to tel you now of any progression Arithmetical propounded, what is that common excesse or difference wherby it procÃ©edeth if this order be kept in it.
And that may set down in such euident order, as you did your example of Natural progression, in this wise. math Maister.
And doe you not also nowe perceiue, that the whole table of Multiplication maye be made by the order of progression Arithmetical? either if you wil begin at the first number of any of them on the left hande, and so procÃ©ede right ouerthwarte: or at any of the first numbers of the vpper rowe, and goe directly
pray you let me consider the thing a little, and wil answere you.
By this triall perceiue it nowe verie well: for the common excesse or difference betwÃ©ene any two next, is continually as much as the firste number of euerie rowe, either from the lefte hande ouerthwarte taken, or from any of the vppermost ouerthwart rows downward.
Nowe then if of any suche progression you woulde spÃ©edelie knowe the totall summe, muche quicklier tha~ by common additions
first tell howe many numbers there are (which numbers here we cal places or parcels) and if they be odde, write theyr summe downe by it selfe, as in this example, where the numbers are as you may sÃ©e, therefore set done in a place alone: then adde togither the firste number and the laste, as in this example: adde to and that maketh take halfe of it, and multiplie by the whiche you noted for the nu~ber of the places, and the sum that amounteth, is the summe of all those figures added togither, as in this example: multiplied by make and that is the summe of al the figures.
Then putte the first number and the last togither, and they make
take the halfe of it, that is, and multiplie by and it maketh
That you saye is the summe of all the numbers.
if you adde all the parcels togither, you shall see the same summe amounte, if you dydde worke well.
And that manner of Addition trieth all kindes of summing anye Progression.
Then can summe a progression, if the numbers of the parcels be odde.
But what if they be euen? as in this example, Ma.
When the number of the parcels is euen, then note that also as you did before, and likewise adde the first summe to the last, and by the halfe of the number of the places do you multiplie it: as in your example, the parcels are that note I? then adding ye firste summe to the last, there amounteth that do multiplie by the halfe of parcels, that is by and it maketh whiche is the summe of the parcels.
But if you wil take one rule for these both, doe thus.
Multiplie the halfe of the one by the other whole, and the summe wil amounte al one.
For sometime it chanceth that the number of the parcels be odde, so that their halfe can not be taken: and sometime it chaunceth the Addition of the firste number and the last, to bring forthe an odde number, so that the
halfe of it can not be taken: but they will neuer be both odde.
The~ perceiue this, if there be no more longing to it.
As accustomablie it hath bene taughte, thys hath bene the chiefe and onelie exercise in Progression vsed.
But that you maye perceiue howe diuerse wayes and to howe great profitte so simple a thing (as this Arithmetical Progression is) maye be considered and vsed, will here propounde you sixe propositions, of which four of them were inuented by a friende of mine, and neuer before this published: and the firste two, were neuer to my knowledge written of, but by thrÃ©e men.
This dothe greatlie encourage me to be attentife vnto your wordes, seeing shall not onelye be instructed at your hands in the common knowen rules of this excellent art, but besids that, so aboundantlie in other new rules informed, as my verie entrance shall sÃ©eme to passe a great many me~s farther studie, and longer continuance.
Therefore sir, besÃ©ech you, let me know your sixe propositions.
To know the last number without proceeding by continual addition, til you come vnto it, that the common excesse, the first number and the number of the places bee knowne.
The first number of the Progression and the laste being knowen, with the common excesse, to finde the number of the places.
The excesse being giuen, and the firste or laste, to know the quantitie of anye middle number, whose place is giuen from the first or last.
The totall summe being giuen, and the first and last, to finde out the number of the places.
The total sum of any Arithmetical progression being giuen, and the first and last, to finde out the common excesse.
The totall summe being giuen, and the mutual excesse, with the number of the places, to giue the firste or laste number of the same progression.
Many moe considerations could propou~d you in these Arithmeticall progressions, but these are sufficie~t to giue you occasio~ to think,
that rules of knowledge and artes are infinitely capable of enlargement.
Sen. Happie were I, if did but well vnderstand that which is alreadie inuented and written.
And yet in my simple fantasie. these thinges offer themselues (in manner) to be studied for about Progression, therefore pray you to procÃ©ede to the rules answering to these propositions.
will orderlye for euerye of these sixe propositions giue you rules, and with euery one an example, vnlesse ye plainnesse and easinesse need no further exemplefying.
Multiplie the excesse by a number lesse by than the number of the places, and the offcome adde to the firste number, so shall you haue the laste number, whiche is soughte for.
As (for example) if there were seuen places in a progression Arithmeticall, whose continuall encrease, or mutual excesse were and the first number were and would know what the last seuenth number is, multiplie which is lesse then (the nu~ber of the places by thereof commeth
whiche adde to that maketh and that is the last number, whiche desired to know.
And this you maye straighte waye proue, by continuall procÃ©eding from till the seuenth place, encreasing euerye one by as thus.
perceiue already one good propertie in this rule, which in all workes is to be desired: yt is, it wil ease one fro~ great labor, if a progression were propounded of or places, or moe, And also it is verye easie to worke, and most necessarie for the totall summe finding, in a very long progression.
From the last subtract the first, the remainer diuide by the common excesse, to the Quotient ad and you haue the number of the places, which you wold know: As in this progression.
If know only and and that they encrease by than according to the rule, from subtract there remaineth which
diuide by (the common excesse) the quotient commeth forth to which ad that maketh and so many are the places, as you sÃ©e.
This rule is so easie, that were muche to blame, if coulde not remember it.
The third proposition may alwaies thus be soluted: Multiplye the excesse by a number lesse by
than the distaunce of the place is from the first or the last number giuen: the of come ad to the first, if the distance be reckned from the first, and the firste also known or subtract from the last: if the distaunce be from the last counted, and ye laste giuen also, and that whiche commeth forth, either in that addition to the first, or subtraction from the last, is the number sought As for example propound you this progression.
And for the apt considering ye maner of this questio~, will note ouer euery place his distance from the first and vnder euery place his distance inclusiuely from the last, thus.
Now, if that excesse whereby this Progression standeth, be knowne to be and the first number giuen, being woulde know what number standeth vnder that is to say in the fourth place.
multiplie by (which is lesse by than the number of the place propounded) that yÃ©eldeth to which adde (the first number) so commeth which say to belo~g to the fourth place, as ye sÃ©e in the example it also doeth: or if in the third place from the last, you would know what number in this example should stand, the last number being known to be and the common excesse than by (which is lesse by than the place propou~ded) multiplie that giueth whiche subtract from so remaineth which appertaineth to the thirde place inclusiuely reckned from the last, so my example giueth you.
perceiue right good vse of this rule: for if had forgotten what the firste number were, and remember still but the laste, the common excesse, and the number
of the places, then mighte come by the knowledge of my first number againe.
And me thinketh, that it differeth not much from the first proposition sauing that which you make here a middle number, there was made the last: and also in this point it differeth, that in it the last was only sought, and no consideration hadde in numbring the places from the last, as here marke in your numbers noted vnder your progression.
And thinke you not the middle numbers of a Progression standing of a hundred or thrÃ©e hundred places or moe, may as much cumber a man to come to the knowledge of them by continuall encreasing from the first (by the common excesse) or abating from the last continually (the common excesse) as the very final numbers in a shorter Progression would doe? Scholer.
Yes sir, that thinke righte well, and therefore am glad of this newe framed proposition, and the maner of the working of it.
Adde the first and the last together, and by the ofcome diuide the totall summe.
the quotient, and that will be the number of the places.
Then if in a Progression, whose sum were and the first number and the last if adde and together, that maketh and by it diuide the Quotient will be which double, and so haue and so many must be the number of the places, that this progression standeth on.
Whether it be so or no, howe will you trie? Scho.
Halfe whiche is being multiplied by must make the totall sum, if be the number of the places.
For so the whole worke of your rule in summing any Arithmeticall progression did enforme math me.
must muche herein commende your promptnes, both in memorie and in well applying your rule: although in manifest wordes if did contayne no suche matter.
am well pleased, so that ye be short, for you make me more longer here, then willinglie would haue bene: but can not perceaue how could haue omitted any thing as yet, without your greate lacke thereof.
If had receiued pounds of certaine men but of how manyÂ· haue forgotten, yet remember that the first gaue mÃ©e lb and the last lb and euerye paymente after other did rise by a like sum.
And the man for whom receiued this money, conditioned with me, that of euery payment should haue pence for my labour: nowe vnlesse can by arte find the trueth of this case, am like to lose the moste parte of my reward.
perceaue you can hansomly frame an example, which shoulde concerne your owne gayne: praye you lette me sÃ©e howe you woulde doe Iustice in this poynte.
adde the firste math and the laste together that maketh by which diuide thus.
is a remnant of in which cannot bÃ©e had, so that nowe am in the briars for doubling of my quotient, and farewell then both my Iustice, and a good lumpe of my gaines.
Ye are neuer the farther from the matter, though it fall into a fraction.
For you shall vnderstand that the fractio~ which of any such worke procÃ©edeth, is euer halfe of one such,
And that you may trie, if you double that which so remaineth, for then it will be equal to your diuisor, as if ye double (the remna~t) it maketh and your diuisor also was this noteth the remainder to bÃ©e half of one.
For with it haue a generall rule for the Fraction that maye hap in this worke.
So that the quotient being two a halfe, double that, it maketh therefore shoulde my gaine be shillinges.
And to be sure (by your leaue) will trie it for math will multiplie halfe of (whiche is the firste and laste number ioyned together) by thus.
The fift proposition hath this rule appertaining vnto it: By the fourthe rule finde the number of the places, that bÃ©eing done, from the last subtract the firste, and the residue diuide by a number lesse by than the number of the places, and the quotient will shewe the excesse whiche is sought for.
An example hereof shal be this: If ye had disbursed lb. to a certaine number of men, you neither can tell howe manye they were or how muche the ones money excÃ©eded his next before, but you are sure that ye excesse was equal betwÃ©en euery two next: also you remember that the firste had and the last poundes, how woulde you finde both the number of the men the excesse, continually obserued in the succession of their reiments.
ScholerÂ· Your rule doth plainlie bid, first to find the number of the places, math whiche will doe according to she fourth rule.
Seing there is no fraction, math but a whole nu~ber, being
double that, and than muste the number of ye places be Now from ye last subtracte the first, as fro~ thus: And so remaineth
This diuide by a number lesse by than the number of the places, and seing the places were diuide math by thus.
The quotient is and so was the excesse, if haue followed your rule right.
You haue wrought euery part of this question both well in order and truely in the practise of your rules.
will than set it downe also formablie, so that the number of the places, the excesse and the total sum may streighte appeare, as your first example stoode.
the first to the last the commo~ excesse is perceiue most euidently, but whether the total summe be haue not yet proued, which will now doe.
adds and togither that maketh multiplie that by halfe the number of the places math thus.
All thinges agrÃ©e most exactlye, so that am perfecte ynough in these rules, if forget the~ not agayne.
By the number of the places diuide the totall summe, double the quotient, and that will be the first and the last ioined in one sum.
Than by a number lesse by than the number of the places multiplie the excesse, that ofcome subtracte from the first doubled quotient, and the half of the residue is the first number.
The laste number you may diuerslye finde out, as by the first of our sixe rules, or by subtracting this first number from the sum which here contained both the firste and the last ioyntlye (or thirdly) by continuall adding the excesse.
If euery moneth in the yeare (counting them now as thirtÃ©ene) you gayned clearely shillinges more than you didde the moneth next going before, and at the yeares ende you find the whole gaine shillinges, but yÃ©e remember not howe much either the gaine of the first moneth, or the last was, by this rule it maye be tried out.
So that here ye sÃ©eme to applie the moneths to places ye shillings euery one more then the other next before it, to be the common excesse, and to be the totall summe.
It is true: by math then diuide in this maner.
double this quotient, so haue for the firste, and the last sinne ioyned togither, by which is lesse by one than the math number of the places, multiplie (the common excesse) so commeth
is the firste number whiche we desired to know, that is
And as for the last number, can giue you it wayes: As by the first of my sire rules, multiplie the excesse by a number lesse by than the number of the places: as by that giueth whiche adde to the first being so shall the laste bÃ©e
And thirdly, if beginne and so procÃ©ede, encreasing by shall at the thirtÃ©enth place haue as thus.
Now if it be your pleasure, would heare and learne somwhat of Progression Geometricall.
There are yet very many rules and propositions, which fall into this Arithmeticall progression: but these shall suffise for this time.
And in Geometricall progression will be more briefe, both because haue bene so long in this part of Arithmeticall progression, and also for that it woulde require the knowledge of Rootes, and numbers surde, (whereof ye haue yet learned nothing) if shoulde frame the like propositions in them as haue done in these.
Therefore will only teache you two practises, aboute it, and so ende the considerations works of these progressions.
Progression Geometricall is when the numbers increase by a like proportion, that is, if the second number containe the first, or times, and so foorth: then the third containeth the seconde so manye times also: and so the fourth the third, and the fifth the fourth: math wherefore sette these thrÃ©e examples.
Here in the firste example you see, that euery number containeth the other (that goeth next before him) times: and in the seconde example times in the thirde example times.
Now if you will know how to finde easilye the summe of any suche numbers, do thus.
bÃ©e multiplyed, whether by or anye other, and by the same number doe you multiplie the last summe in the Progression.
pray you worke it by this example, whiche haue framed by procÃ©eding from and continually multiplying by
Then must multiplie the last sum (which is by also, and it will bÃ©e
Nowe must bate from this summe the first number of the progression, whiche here is then resteth which summe must diuide by lesse then was the number that multiplied by.
Seing then multiplied by must diuide by so diuiding by the quotient will be which is the summe of all the Progression.
And now to proue whether you can doe the same, giue you these numbers to adde by this rule,
cannot well tell by what number this Progression doth increase.
In any such doubte, doe thus: Diuide the seconde number by the first,
Then is that number in this example for so many times is in
The laste number is whiche multiplie be and it yÃ©eldeth from which abate the first number of the Progression, that is and there resteth which diuide by for yt is one lesse the~ the quotient is which is the whole summe of the progression.
Now that you know the summing of Geometricall Progression, will shewe you a compendious manner eyther to procÃ©ede by, or to finde out the quantitye of a number whose distance from the first may be very greate,
whiche to doe by continuall multiplication, would be very tedious, if the numbers be great and the places many.
Sc. Nothing can pleasure me more then breuitie, if it be playne.
thinke am not yet in anye point so darke or hard, that you nÃ©ede to feare any obscuritie now.
this: set downe of your progression foure or fiue of the first places, and vnder the first put a cipher, vnder the seconde vnder the third &c. as if yee had a progression encreasing by a fiue folde quantitie: as here, then vnder put a cipher, and vnder the figure of math and so foorthe if yÃ©e will: but to a wise and warie worker, a fewe places were sufficient to procÃ©ed by to any number of places in this sorte, if anye two of your numbers progressional be multiplied the one by the other, and the ofcome diuided by the firste of your progression, the quotient is one of your numbers progressionall, and belonging to ye place of your vnder numbers, that is equal to that summe, that is made of Addition togither of your two numbers which stoode vnder these two of your Progressionall numbers; that were multiplied the one by the other, math as in thys example.
whiche diuide by (the firste number of the Progression,) and the quotient is whiche muste stande in the thirde place, because the number whiche standeth vnder is and that vnder
Therefore say, that belongeth to the thirde math place of this progression, as yÃ©e sÃ©e also here it doeth.
Moreouer If multiplie into it selfe, thereof commeth that diuide by the Quotiente is whiche muste be sette in the fourthe place: bicause added to himselfe againe, maketh and in our example occupieth the fourth place.
Then for that fifth place multiplie the Progressionall numbers ouer and one by the other: and for the sixt, multiplie that ouer in it selfe. &c. M. YÃ©e must wel reme~ber that these places that we nowe speake of, belong to the vnder numbers, for the true places of the vpper nu~bers is euer one place more.
the vnder numbers begin one after, and againste the first place of my progression sta~deth a cypher, so that the which you saide before did belong to the third place, sÃ©e belongeth to the number of among your vnder numbers, but from the true progressions beginning, it is the fourth.
Therefore for your exercise of both the rules here giuen for Geometricall progression, will aske you a question, muche vsed among the common people, (as they haue a greate many the like) If woulde sell you a Horse, hauing shoes, and in euerie shoe six nailes, with this condition, that you shal pay for the first naile ob, for the second ob, for ye thirde and for the fourth and so forth dubbling vntil the last naile.
Now demaunde of you how muche the price of the Horse woulde amount vnto? Scholer.
Seing the Horse hathe shoes, and in euerie shoe nayles, perceyue here wil bÃ©e places.
If coulde nowe haue the laste number, woulde quicklie dispatch this question.
wil therefore with as fewe multiplicatio~s as can deuise, to come to the
In double math set foorth than a few of my progression, thus.
If nowe multiplie the numbers ouer and the one by the other, shall haue the number of the eleuenth place for the vnder numbers, but of the twelfth for the vpper nu~bers in which my progression standeth, and then that of ye eleuenth place vnder, if multiplie in it selfe, shal haue for the place vnder, but for the of that aboue, whiche multiplie by that ouer of my nether places, and shall haue the of my nether places, and the of the vpper, which is the number sÃ©eke for.
Me thinketh you haue forgotten youre rule for abridging your multiplications: for in it, the ofcome ouer of anye multiplication, is to be diuided by the firste of the progression.
Sir nÃ©ede not, as my progressio~ beginneth now: for if should diuide by it maketh no other quotient, then the number is, it doth diuide.
It is verie wel remembred math and noted of you, to youre worke then according to youre prescribed manner, which like well.
whiche is the eleuenth place vnder, but the twelfth math aboue, and this, multiply in it selfe, in this manner.
And this of come math is my foure and twentith place, whiche haue found now by multiplications.
Then doe resort to the rule of summing this Progression, where consider that the encrease of this summe procÃ©edeth by multiplication of and therefore doe multiplie the laste summe by also, and it yÃ©eldeth
from whiche abate the firste nu~ber which is and then resteth whiche shoulde diuide by lesse then did
math multiplie: but sÃ©eing that it is nÃ©ede not to diuide it, for (as haue before saide) doth neither multiply nor diuide, therefore take that summe for the whole summe of the pence, which by Reduction finde to be and ob that is lb ob. Maister.
That is well done, but thinke you wil buy no horse of the price.
Yet for my assurance wil take so muche paine, as to come to this laste by co~tinual multiplication by as in thys example you maye beholde my worke till haue done.
Well fare my shorte rule, for introth it hathe more cunning and more
Lorde deliuered to a Bricklayer a certayne number of loades of bricke, wherof he willed him to make
walles, of such sorte, that the first wall shoulde receiue thirdeles of the whole number: and the seconde thirdles of that that was left.
And so euerie other thirdles of that that remained: and so did the bricklayer: And when the walles, were made, there remaineth one lode of Bricke.
Nowe aske you, howe many loade went to euery wall, and howe many loade was in the whole? Scholer.
Why sir, it is impossible for me to tel. Mayster.
Nay, it is very easie, if you marke it well.
Marke well that saide, that euery wall shoulde receiue thirdeles of the sum that was lefte.
Nowe take away thirdels from anye summe and you must nÃ©edes graunt that that whiche remaineth is thirdle of the summe laste before: example of from which if you take thirdels, there will remaine whiche is one thirdel of
This is true, and nowe perceiue, that the leaste wall had but two loade of bricke.
And by the same reason maye you knowe howe manie loade euerie wall hadde, according as this figure folowing doth shew, and likewayes what the whole summe of briekes was: for if you make summes, multiplying by stil fro~ the last remayner, as you maye sÃ©e here on the lefte side of the table, there will appeare all the remayners of euerie wall: and if you multiplie the last of those summes by also, then will that be the sum of the loades whiche were deliuered to the bricklayer.
Againe, if you doe double euery remainer, as you maye sÃ©e at the right side of this table, those numbers will showe the sum of loades that went to eache wall: whereby you maye perceiue, that each wall was times so great as the next lesser.
Now surely sÃ©e that Arithmetike is a right excellent arte.
of the vse of it: For this is nothing in comparison to other points that may be wrought by it.
Then besÃ©ech you sir, cease not to instruct me further in this wonderful cunning.
The remainer after euerie wal. Loades due to each wal. Some of the Loades deliuered.
BY order of the science (as men haue taughte it) there should fellow nexte the extraction of Rootes of number, whiche because it is somewhat harde for you, yet will let it passe for a while, and will teache you the feate of the rule of Proportions, whiche for his excellencie is called the Golden rule.
Whose vse is, by thrÃ©e numbers knowen, to finde out an other vnknowen, whiche you desire to knowe: as thus.
If you pay for your boorde for thrÃ©e moneths shillings, howe muche shal you pay for moneths.
To know this and all such like questions, you shall consider which two of your numbers be of one denominatio~, and set those two the one ouer the other, so that the vndermoste
be it that the question is asked of: as in my question and be both of one denomination, for they both be monethes, and because is the number that the question is asked of, set them one ouer the other, math and vndermoste, thus, with suche a crooked draught of lines.
Then doe set the other number whiche is againste at the right side of math the line, thus.
And nowe to knowe my question, thys must doe: muste multiplie the lowermost on the left side, by that on the right side, and the summe that amounteth muste diuide by the highest, on the left side.
Or in playner wordes thus: shall multiplie the number of whiche the question is asked (whyche is called the Thirde number) by the number of an other denomination,
(whiche is called the Seconde) and that summe that amou~teth muste diuide by the summe of lyke denomination, whiche is called the Firste.
Then for the knowledge of this question, multiplie into and there amou~teth whiche diuide by and it yÃ©eldeth shillings, and remaineth, whiche turne into pennies, and they be of whiche
the third part is so the third part of is which summe write at the right hande of the figure against math thus.
Hereby knowe, that if thÃ©e monethes boording doe come to that monethes bording wil come to and likewise of any other like question.
But here must you marke, that the firste number and the thirde be of one denomination, and also the seconde and the fourth, the whiche you sÃ©eke: or else be of suche denominations, that you in working may bring the~ into one.
*Twelue wÃ©ekes iournying coste me fourtÃ©ene French Crownes at the pÃ©ece, how many poundes is that in one yeare.
Here you sÃ©e no two nu~bers of one denomination, But yet in working, you may turne them into like denominations, as thus: turne the one yeare into weekes, and the fourth summe wil be French Crownes, by the order of the working: Then to knowe this question, multiplie the thirde summe by the second and the summe will be that diuide by your firste number and the quotiente
Crownes: And Crownes remayning: whiche if you turne into shillings they will be shillings which if you doe diuide by your firste number the quotiente will be whiche signifyeth put these
French Crownes (which make poundes) with the shillings: for math the summe that answereth to the question: And it is the iust expe~ces of a yeare: And the summe wil be thus.
And take this euermore for a general Rule touching this whole Arte, That the doubtful or vnknowen number, that you woulde be resolued of, shall alwayes be set in the thirde place, note also the first number and the third, must euer be of one nature and denomination, or else must in working be brought to like denomination and then of necessitie must the other number be in the second place.
Remember also, that the place of the firste number is the highest on the left side: and the place of the seconde right against it on ye right side: the place of the thirde number is vnder the firste, as by those examples you haue sÃ©ene.
But and if the question be asked thus: In wÃ©ekes spend
howe long wil shillings serue me? Here you sÃ©e that wÃ©ekes aunsweres himselfe, and saieth shillings.
But how long time shillings wil serue, you know not.
Therefore you shal set in the thirde place, according as tolde you euen now.
And the first place must alwayes be of the same nature or Denomination, that the third is of, which here is
Now multiply by and it will be which if you diuide by it will yÃ©elde whiche is the Fourth number, and sheweth howe manye wÃ©ekes will serue, if you spende in eight wÃ©ekes.
The figure of thys question math is this: as if you should saye: If serue for wÃ©ekes, serue for wÃ©ekes.
Other diuersities there be of working by this rule, but hadde rather that you woulde learne this one well, than at the beginning to trouble your minde with many formes of working, sith this way can doe as much as al
the other, and hereafter you shall learne the other more conuenientlie.
And for your further aide and instruction to make you better acquainted wyth thys Goldon Rule, haue here proponed questions, and their aunsweres, whiche thinke moste conueniente and mÃ©ete to preferre the desirous to perfecte vnderstanding.
The firste foure are all braunches of one Question sproong out of the beste trÃ©e, (for a young learner to taste of) that groweth in this Grounde of Artes, for that no manner of Question in the Rule of what so euer it bÃ©e, can be proponed, but it muste be comprehended, vnder the reason or style of one of these foure.
If elles of Cloth coste lb. what comes, elles too at that price: Aunsweare.
If elles coste lb. howe manye elles shal haue for lb.
If sell elles for lb. howe manye elles are to be deliuered for lb.
If lb. of anye thing coste what money wil pound of that commoditie cost.
Of all which questions omitte the work of purpose, you shoulde whet your wit there by at conuenient leasure, to climb ech branch and gather the fruite of them: And doe minde nowe, before we make ad ende of this Rule, to giue you some Instructions of the Backer Rule of
whose order is quite contrarye to thys that you haue learned.
For in thys Rule hitherto euermore looke how muche the thirde number is greater than the firste, so muche the fourthe number is greater then the seconde.
And contrarye wayes: loke howe much the firste summe is greater then the thirde, (if it doe chaunce so)
so much is the second summe greater then the fourth.
But in this Rule, there is a contrary order, as this: That the greater the third summe is aboue the first, the lesser the fourth sum is beneth the seconde: and this rule therfore you may call the Backer rule,
of yards breadth, and woulde buy canuas of yards brode to line it withall, howe manye yards should nÃ©ede? Sc. Why, there is none so broade.
doe not care for that, doe put this example only for your easie vnderstanding: For if should put the example in other measures, it would be harder to vnderstand.
But nowe to the matter: If you woulde know this question, set your numbers as you did before: but you shall multiplie now the first number by the seconde, and that ariseth thereof, you shall diuide by the third: which thing if you doe here, meane if you multiplie by it will be which summe if you diuide by there will appeare whereby knowe, that if yardes of cloth of two yardes broade, should be lined with canuas of thrÃ©e yardes
broade, yards of canuas math woulde suffice, as this figure sheweth.
And nowe because yÃ©e found fault at my example, how say you, perceaue you this? Sc. Yes sir.
Then aunswere me to this questio~: how many elles of canuas of elle breadth, will serue to line yards of Saye, of thrÃ©e quarters brode.
In good faith sir, cannot tell, for know not how to bring the summes to like denominations.
Then wil tel you: sith there is mention here of quarters, and againe euerye one of the measures both elles and yardes may be parted into quarters, do you parte them so both in the breadth and length, and then put forth the question by quarters.
Howe manye quarters of canuas of fiue quarters broade, wil line quarters of quarters brode.
First wil set them math downe in their forme thus, for is ioyned with ye question, and is therefore the third number: then is the number of the same denomination, meane because they be both referred to breadth.
Now multiplie by and it is which diuide by and it yieldeth
Then saye I, that quarters of quarters broad, will suffice to line quarters of quarters brode.
Then say, that elles and thrÃ©e quarters of a yarde of elle math broade will serue to lyne yardes of thrÃ©e quarters brode, as this figure sheweth.
Now what say you to this questio~: lent my friend lb for months, now how much money ought he to le~d me again for moneths, to recompence my curtesie shewed him.
Yes sir suppose, for wil set down my nu~bers thus
where multiplie into and it maketh whiche diuide by and it yieldeth lb and there is lb. remaining of my Diuision, what shall doe therewith.
Turne that same lb into and then diuide it by as you did before.
Well sir it shall be done, so haue for my quotient, and yet remaineth vpon my diuision.
You must also reduce into pence, which maketh and diuide that also by your first diuisor.
So haue done, and finde pence for my quotient and nothing is left.
This must you alwayes doe, when any thing remaineth vppon your diuision: whether it be mony, weight, measure, or any kind of thing whatsoeuer.
This rule is so profitable for all estates of men, that for this rule onlie (if there were no more but it) all men were bound highly to estÃ©eme Arithmetike.
By this Rule maye a Captaine in warre worke many things, as Maister Digges in his Stratiaticos doth notably declare: Onlie nowe in this my simple addition, for a taste
and incourageme~t wil enlarge ye Author with a questio~ or ij. more, wishing you, euerie my cou~triemen or Gentleme~, whatsoeuer, that by nature be anye thing giuen to Millitarie affaires, to be familier and wel acquainted with this Exceliente Arte, the whiche he shall finde not onely at the Sea, but also in the Campe and Fielde seruices, aboundantly to aide him, either in fortificatio~, or in paying of Souldiors wages, how differente soeuer their paye be: Charges of Ordinaunce pouder, shot, Munition and instrumentes, whatsoeuer, but now to the question.
to be so inclosed with his enemie that he could haue no fresh purueiance of vittailes, and that the vittailes which he hath, would serue that armie but only moneths, how many men should hÃ©e dimisse, to make the vittaile to suffise ye residue, moneths? math Sc.
As you taught me, set the nu~bers thus, saying: If moneths suffise to howe manye will moneths suffice?
To know this multiplie the first number into seconde it yieldeth which sum diuide by there wil be in the quotie~t which if doe subtract from the math remainer will declare that hÃ©e muste dismisse as this figure sheweth Maist.
Nowe aunswere me to this question: If Masons in a moneth bÃ©e able to builde a Forte, to preserue the Souldiers from the enemie: And suche expedition requireth that woulde haue the same finished in eighte dayes, how manye workemen saye you is there to bÃ©e appointed.
As you taught me math set the numbers thus, saying: If daies require Masons, what number of men by proportion will dayes bring forth.
To know this multiplie the first nu~ber into And it yieldeth me whiche diuide by
And my quotiente is which is the iust number of Masons that shall supplie this worke.
Truly if you take delectation herein you shall finde this Art not onely easie, but wonderfull pleasant profitable: Now answere me this question, so wil make an end of this rule, in whole nu~bers hasting ye sooner to broken nu~bers.
For had you yt vnderstanding of the~ perfectly, not only in this Rule, but in all other: the question in sight might haue ben times more harder to absolue, yet as easilie as soone wroughte as this.
Your words doth greatly encorage me to be studious to attaine whole numbers, which me think are wo~derfull.
But might once attain to be a practicioner in broke~, should think my self a happy lad.
Now what say you to this, If carpenters in dayes can make Staues: estÃ©eming they work but howers a day: And such nÃ©ede requireth yt carpenters are set to the finishing of these staues, in what time say you wil they make the~ vp Scholer.
see here that muste turne my daies into howers, And math so doing sette my numbers thus
For it is grounded vpon an olde Prouerbe, many hands make quick spÃ©ede.
multiplie into and it amounteth to whiche diuide by and my quotient is houres which is my desire.
take this for a note worthie the marking either in the Rule of thrÃ©e, forwarde, or backwarde, when the two numbers art multiplied togither, the Producte is of the same nature, and denomination that the second number is of.
Well, sithe you perceiue nowe the vse of this Rule,
will shewe other which ensue of the same, firste the double Rule, which is so called, because there is in it double working, by which thing onely it differeth from this.
So shall you, and let this be the example: If the cariage of pound weight miles, doe cost how much will the cariage of weight cost, being caryed miles? Scholer.
If pound weighte cost how much will lb. cost? Set your figure thus.
math And multiplie by and therof amou~teth which if you diuide by the quotie~t wil be that is the price of for miles.
The~ begin the second worke, saying: if miles cost how much wil miles cost? Set your figure thus.
Than multiplie a by wherof amou~teth which being diuided by will yield
Than you may say, that so many penies shall cost the cariage of pound waighte miles, after the rate of pence for the caried miles.
These and such other like questio~s, are to be aunswered much quicker, at one working by the Rule of composed of fiue numbers, whiche here will not trouble you withall.
But at the ende of this Rule will shewe you the worke thereof: not onlye of this and the nexte question, but also will there deliuer thrÃ©e or other examples,
wishing you then to make a comparison the one with the other: And so to vse which way you thinke good.
Sc. Sir thanke you much for your curtesie, and long now til this rule be ended, that shall sÃ©e howe maye behaue my selfe with that newe Rule of numbers, for that haue euer since you taughte mÃ©e hetherto, in the Golden Rule both forward and backward wroughte but with numbers only.
Till we haue done with this, lette vs go on forward: and answere me to this question: bushels of wheat sowed, yielded in one yeare how manye will bushels yield in yeare.
First saye, that if bushels will yield in yeare, then bushels will yield in yere.
Then for the seconde worke say: If one yeare yield then yeare will yielde as these two figures doe shew. math
But now sir, if set forth bushels of corne to another man for yeare, agrÃ©eing
so that he shall sow euerye yeare the whole encrease of the corne, and at the ende of those seuen yeares to haue the halfe of the whole increase: would know how many bushels will there amount to my part supposing the increase to be after ye rate of the last question, for bushels in one yeare,
In such a question you must haue so manye seuerall workinges, as there be yeres, as for example: In the first yere bushels yield then to knowe the yielding of the second yeare, must say: If yield how many yieldeth Work by your rule, and you shal find
Then say for the third yere: if yield how manye will yielde? you shall haue and so euery yeare multiplying the whole encrease by and diuiding it by the increase of the next yere wil amou~t, as these figures (in ye next page) do orderly declare: where haue set letters for ye yeres, of which the first is set without art because that is the increase whiche you doe presuppose: the last number of eche other doth shewe the increase of the yeare that it standeth for; which the letters doe declare,
so that the increase of the seuen yeare, is bushels: how manye quarters that is, and also how many wayes, you may by Reduction soone finde. math Now with one question more will proue you.
If Mowers doe mowe acres in dayes, how many mowers wil mow acres in dayes? Sch.
Now agayn: if dayes require mowers, then dayes nÃ©edeth but mowers.
Why do you not make mention of the that remaineth in the last diuision? for the last part of the question is wroughte by the Backer rule, where the first number is multiplied into the seconde that is whereof amounteth whiche if you diuide by the thirde number the quotiente will be as you said, but then will there remaine which cannot wel be diuided into parts: how be it, you may vnderstand by the sixt part of the thirde parte of one mans work, which you must put to the or else you may say, that workemen wil ende all the acres in dayes, saue two mens worke for one day, or dayes worke for one man.
But such broke~ numbers called Fractions, you shall hereafter more better perceiue, whe~ shal wholy instruct you of them.
Yet one question more of field matters will propone, and so will make an end of this double Rule of
With all my hart sir thank you, and wil dispatche it as soone as can, because
would faine sÃ©e the order of the nexte Rule of numbers.
Then this is my question, If Pioners in houres, will cast a trenche of Rods: demaund how manie Labourers wil be able with a like tre~che in thrÃ©e houres to entrench a Camp of Rods.
thinke am nowe in the diche, for knowe not well whiche way to go about it: And besides that trulie think shall neuer come to prefermente that way my grouth is so small.
You know not how God may raise you hereafter by seruice, into the fauour of your Prince, for ye auaile of your Countrie.
Example, Sir Francis Drake, as worthy a man as euer England bred, is not the tallest man, and yet hath made the greatest adue~ture for the honour of his Prince Countrie, that euer English man did.
Sc. Sir, thanke you for your good encouragement, my mind, though be little, is as desirous of knowledge, as any other: haue pondred now a little math of it, thus set forthe the worke.
men what shall Rod require: multiplie by and it yieldeth which diuide by and my quotient is men.
Then must say for my second work, if in houres men be able to discharge it, how many shall performe the same in houres? now if should worke by ye Golden Rule of proportion forwarde, should find a lesse nu~ber of men, because houres is lesse then houres: but because reaso~ teacheth me that the lesser the time is, wherin ye french must be made, the more Laborers ought to haue, wherevpon vse now the backer Rule as in example.
So many Pioners must haue, to entrenche the camp in houres.
You haue answered the question very artificiallie: And truelie commende you for your diligence and apte vnderstanding: and now according to my promise, will (in whole numbers) giue you a little tast of the Rule of compounded of numbers.
THis Rule of composed is distinct for most nÃ©edefull questions into two seuerall parts or workinges: And there belongeth vnto it alwayes numbers, wherof in this rule being the first part: the seconde number and the fift are alwayes of one nature and like denomination, which rule is to be wrought thus: you must multiplie the first number by the seconde: And that shalbe your diuisor: Then again, multiplie the other thrÃ©e numbers, the one by the other and their product shall be your diuidend.
And now according to my promise, wÃ©e will first work the question of weighte and cariage whiche deliuered you in ye double rule of to be absolued by this Rule, which was this.
coste what wil the carriage of lb. weighte stande me in being carried miles.
Then marke math wel how these numbers stand: multiplie by as thys figure sheweth: And that number keepe for your diuisor:
numbers the one by the other, and they amount as you see to which you shall diuide by your quotie~t is Now you see it agrÃ©eth with the conclusion of the double Rule.
S. Sir thanke you most hartely: it is euen so.
loke what nature or denominatio~ your middle number is: and of the like denomination or nature is alwayes your quotient.
Well nowe and it please you by your patience, will sÃ©e howe can ende, the question then nexte following of Bushels of Wheate sowed, yÃ©elded in one yeare how many then will bushels yÃ©elde in seauen yeare: and according to youre reasons, set my numbers thus:
which math diuide by and my quotiente is bushels my desire.
Yet one question more will propound vnto you and so leaue this rule, till it please God hereafter, that may make you worke it in broken numbers.
What comes the interest of lb for fiue monethes after the rate: of pounde taken in the lb for monthes: Sch Sir as this is a question of gaines So will warelie worke this question in hope one day to reape someting for my paines: and thus propone it.
But beseech you if it bÃ©e not well set downe to shewe me myne errour.
Then doubt not by the grace of God but to ende it: multiplie by it yÃ©eldeth and the other numbers multiplied togither produceth which diuide by and my quotient is poundes.
according as you haue taught me heretofore, turne the lb. that is left: into shillings: and diuiding it by my firste number my quotient is
So answeare that the lone of lb for monthes, after the rate of lb. in the lb for a yere, comes to lb
You say true, commende your diligence, now beholde the manner of the second part of this rule.
In the second part of this rule of composed: the third number is like vnto the first.
And the rule is to be wrought as thus: you shall now contrarie to the last rule multiplie the third number and the fourth togither: and that product shal be your deuisor: Then multiplie the fift by the seconde and the producte therof by the first: and that is ye number that shall be diuided.
For example propond this question: for a proofe of my last question of interest.
Merchant hath receiued lb for interest for months terme, which he receiued after the rate of lb. in the lb. for a yere.
The question is nowe how much monie was deliuered to raise this interest: Behold therefore the math maner howe the question is set foorth.
Sir perceiue it verie wel: and according to the doctrine whiche you prescribed for the working thereof: if it please you nowe it is set downe thinke can followe the worke.
Nay staie a while, and afore you worke marke wel how deliuer a reaso~, for the perfect vnderstanding of this rule which is thus:
if lb. in monethes do yÃ©eld me lb To take lb for moneths, muste nÃ©edes yÃ©elde a great deale more.
So vpo~ the knowledge that haue in this Arte, The first part of this rule is aunswerable to the rule of forwarde: And this latter part accordeth to the rule backward.
S. Sir yÃ©elde you most hartie thankes for these your last instructions, they haue giuen me great light into these two Rules, wherby maye the better by deliberation conceiue how to vse them hereafter, whe~ occasion shall require.
You say wel, go too now if you wil, and trie your cunning in the question:
But thys note take with you by the way, in as much as here is mention made of shillings: turne all your mony as you worke, for your more ease in worke.
If it please you to behold me a litle, wil quicklie end it: for haue but my first: my seconde: and my last number to be multiplied togither for my diuidende: And my third into my fourth for my diuisor: math Whiche diuide by
and my quotient is shillings, which in poundes yÃ©eldeth my desire.
will here for this time in whole numbers ende this rule, and wil instructe you in the rules of Felowship.
You may at your co~uenient leasure, for your exercise worke the
at twice: And for your aide and encouragement therein, set down here a profer how to apply it. math The Rule of Felowship.
BVt now wil shew you of the rule of felowship or Companie, which hath sundrie operations, according to the diuers number of the companie.
This rule is sometime without difference of time, and sometimes there is in it difference of time.
Firste will speake of that without difference of time, of which let this be an example.
Foure Merchaunts of one companie made a banke of money diuerslie, for the first layde
in lb the seconde lb the third lb and the fourthe lb whiche stocke they occupied so long, till it was encreased to lb. Nowe demaunde of you, what shoulde eache man receiue at the parting of this money.
perceiue that this rule is like the other, but yet there is a differe~ce, which perceiue not Ma Then wil shew it to you.
Firste by Addition you shall bring all the particular summes of the Merchaunts into one summe, whiche shall be the first summe in your working by the Golden rule, and the whole sum of the gaines by that stocke shal be the second summe.
Now for the third sum, you shall set the portion of each ma~ one after an other, and then work by the Golden rule, and the fourth sum will shewe you each mans gaines: as in example.
The parcels of those foure Merchaunts make in one sum lb set that in the firste plare, the gaines in the second, math and the firste mans portion of stocke in the place thus.
Now multiplie the second by the third, and it will be whiche you shall diuide by
Now for the second man, set the lb. that he brought, in the thirde place, and worke as before: and his part will math be lb. as this figure sheweth.
Likewaies for the thirde man set his mony math which was lb and his parte of gaines wyll be lb as here appeareth.
And so for the fourth man, if you sette his summe whiche is lb math his gaines wil be lb as the proofe wyll declare.
This perceiue: but is there any way to examine whether haue wel done er no? Maister.
That muste you doe by one common proofe which serueth to the Golden rule and al other insuing of the same: and that is this: Change the standings of the numbers, and set the thirde in the first place, the in the seconde place, and the firste in the third place,
and they worke by the Golden rule, and if you haue done well, the fourth number now will be the same that was the seconde before.
As for example, will math take the last worke whiche was this.
math Which to examine alter as saide, thus: Nowe if multiply the second number by the thirde, and diuide that that amounteth by the firste, then will the fourth number be math whiche was the seconde before, as you sÃ©e here, whiche is a token, that haue well done.
But as in a single rule one proofe thus is sufficient, so in a rule where many operations be, you must turne euery of them as haue done with this one.
Then for the math proofe of the firste worke of this rule, shold turn the numbers thus.
Wel, nowe an other example will put to you, not of gaines, but of losse: for one reason serueth for both.
If thrÃ©e Merchauntes in one shippe and of one fellowship, had bought marchandise, so that the first had laide out lb the seconde lb and the thirde lb and it chaunced by tempest that they did cast ouer board into the sea merchandise of the value of pou~d, howe muche shoulde eache man boare in this losse? Scholer.
If shal doe in this as you did in the other question, then muste ioyne theyr thrÃ©e portions togither, and whiche maketh
Then saye I, if leefe then shal loose and shal loose shall loose as by these thrÃ©e figures it doth appeare plaine. math Ma.
wil propound a questio~ of more importance, which shal make you not only ye abler to vndersta~d this Rule, but also it wil greatly aide you in the next rule of fellowship with time, if such nÃ©ede be that your money be of diuerse denominations.
For this may not be forgotte~ in al such questions, if the number be of diuerse kinds: you must by Reductio~ bring it into one kind, that is to say to the leaste value that is named in ye question.
And likewaies shall you doe, if the time be of diuerse kinds, as some yeres, some monethes, wÃ©ekes and dayes, you shall make al months, wÃ©eks or days according as ye least name of time in ye questio~ is: As for example.
And the third paide lb How many shÃ©epe must each of them haue? Answere: The first shal haue
Firste considering that your money is of diuerse denominations, you shall (by Reduction) bring it all into the smallest denomination
whiche is in it, that is to saye, pence, and so will the total sum bÃ©e
Now, if you turne eache mans mony into pennies also, the firste mannes summe will be pence: The second mans summe
Now to know how many shÃ©epe euery ma~ shal haue, let the whole sum of money that is
pence, in ye first place in ye seco~d place set the number of shÃ©epe, and then orderly in the thirde place set eache mans money, and then multiplying the thirde and the seconde summes togither, and diuiding that that amounteth by the firste, there will appeare the number of shÃ©epe that eche man ought to haue: as these thrÃ©e figures do shewe, math Scholer.
Why doe you set the mony in the first place, sÃ©eing in the question you saye,
You remember, taught you at the beginning of this Goulden rule, that the firste and thirde numbers must bÃ©e of one name, and of like thyngs: and euermore the number that the question is asked of, must bÃ©e sette in the third place.
Now is the question playnely this: If foure men bought sheepe for pence, howe many sheepe shall each man haue? But seing in this question there ought more respect to be had to the summe of mony, than to the summe of the persons, (for in ye su~mes of mony is there proportion toward ye sheepe, and not in the number of persons) therefore must wÃ©e turne the question thus.
If pence bought shÃ©epe, how many did buy? Agayne, how many did buy? how many bought pens.
perciue it reasonable, and so shall doe in all like questions.
Euen so, But for easinesse of the work marke this:
When soeuer the first and second numbers haue ciphers in the first places, you may bothe in the multiplication
and in the diuision leaue out those ciphers, so that you leaue out like manye out of bothe summes, as in this question the first number hath thrÃ©e ciphers, and so hath the seconde that is therefore caste awaye their ciphers, and so will the first number bÃ©e and the second set them in their places, and worke according to the rule, and you shal perceiue that it wil be al one, sauing that this is the shorter and easier way, as these thrÃ©e figures do shew. math And this you sÃ©e is both easier, and also the more certaine waye to know the answere to this question.
S. Truth it is as you say: but sir, me sÃ©emeth might aske a further question here, not onlie how manye shÃ©epe eche man should haue, but also what euerie shÃ©epe cost.
belong to this rule, but may also be discussed by Diuision, especiallie if the questions number be one onelie: as thus.
Diuide the totall summe pence, by (or by omitting the ciphers) and the quotient wil be pence, that is howbeit, by this rule you maye doe it, and beste when the number of the question doth excÃ©ede as if shoulde aske this question, coste
howe math muche did coste? Then shal set my figure thus.
And doing after the rule, there wil amou~te pence, that is lb the price of one score: But if you wil vse that easie waye that did teach you, you may math change the firste and seconde number thus.
Thus doe you perceiue the vse of the rule without time.
And that you may as perceiue the same with diuersitie of time, propose this example.
whiche at the yeares ende was encreased to lb. Nowe to knowe what shall be ech mans portion of gaines, you muste know
lb which hÃ©e did take from the stock agayne, at the end of
This question shall you examin as you did the other before, sauing that where as in the third place of the figure you did set eche mans summe alone,
here you shall set the same bÃ©eing multiplyed by the number of their time likewise in the firste place of the figure, you shal set that number which amou~teth of their whole summes so multiplyed by their time, added into one whole summe as thus.
(that was the number of his time) and it maketh
multiply the one by the other, and and it will be
These foure summes thus multiplyed by their time, must be set orderly in ye third place
of the figure: and in the first place must bÃ©e set the whole summe of all foure, whiche is and the gaine must be in the second place, which is
Now to end the question, say firste: If did get what did get? math Answere, lb as by this figure appeareth.
Likewise the second man had to his part lb the third must haue lb And the fourth ma~ shal haue for his part lb as these figures doe partly declare.
This like verye well: but what proofe is there of this worke? Mai.
there is vsed both for this worke and the other also this manner of proofe, to adde all the portions togither,
and if they agrÃ©e to the whole summe, then seemeth it well done: but this is no sure rule.
The foure parcels are these, math which if adde togither, there will amount and that was the whole summe: so is this rule true here.
And so will it be still when the worke is truely done.
But if you lift to sÃ©e it prooued false, take lb from the fourth man, and put it to any of the other and then be yÃ©e sure that you haue not done well, and yet wil the proofe allow it, for the Addition will still be all one.
It must nÃ©edes be so: but what haue now to learne? Maist.
There are many other excellent partes behinde, of which will not, as nowe, make mention because that without the knowledge of Fractions, they cannot be duely taught, and much lesse vnderstanded.
Therfore wil propose to you two or thrÃ©e questions more, whereby you may practise the better the feate of the rule of felowship,
(that thereby you may better perceiue ye vse of all other) so make an end for this time.
those maye spende by yere lb but euery Ca~nnon must haue to his part times so much as euery Vicar hath: howe muche is euery mans portion say you? Sc.
pray you make the aunswere your selfe, so shall perceiue best the meanes to aunswere to such other like.
In this question you must doe as in those that haue diuersitie of time, for here is diuersitie of portions: Therefore shall you multiplye the number of the persons by their difference of portion: (as you did in the other by time) Then must you multiplie the
(which is the number of Cannons) by (for that is the number of their portion) so will it be Then (that is the number of Vicars) by (that is the number of their portion) and it will be put those two summes togither, and they make then say thus: If spe~d lb what maye spende? The rule sheweth lb.
pound, what may spend? Answer lb as these figures shew, math
But if euery Ca~non should haue so often times lb as the Vicar should haue lb the~ should multiplie by (that were and by (that were and then both were
math But this sort is to hard for you, by reaso~ of the Fractions, therefore will let it rest to that place.
And by this rule you sÃ©e what the Cannons may spend, which summe if you diuide by you shall sÃ©e eche Cannons portion: and so of the Vicars, if you diuide their summe by the quotient wil declare euery Vicars portion.
NOw that you haue learned the commo~ kindes of Arithmetike with ye pen, you shall sÃ©e the same art in Counters: whiche feate doth not onely serue for them that cannot write and reade, but also for them that can doe both, but haue not at some times their pen or tables readie with them.
This sort is in two formes commonlye: The one by lines, and the other withoute lines.
In that that hath lines, the lines doe stande for the order of places: and in that that hath no lines, there must be set in their steade so many counters as shall nÃ©ede, for line one, and they shall supplie ye steade
For example of math the Lynes, loe hÃ©ere you see sixe lines, which stande for sixe places, so that the nethermoste standeth for the firste place, and the next aboue it for the seconde, and so vpwarde, til you come to the highest, which is the sixt line, and standeth for the sixt place.
Now what is the value of euery place or line you may perceiue by the figures which haue set on them, whiche is according as you learned before in Numeration of by the pen: for, the firste place is the place of vnits or ones, and euerye Counter set in that line betokeneth but one: and the second line is the place of for euery cou~ter there standeth for
The thirde lyne the place of hundreds, ye fourth of thousa~ds, and so forth.
Sir, doe perceiue that the same order is here of lines, as was in the other figures by places, so that you shall not nÃ©ede
longer to stande about Numeration, except there be any other difference.
If you doe vnderstande it, then math how will you set Sc.
You haue set the places truly but your figures be not mÃ©ete for [Figure: this vse: for the mÃ©etest figure in this behalf, is the figure of a Counter round, as you sÃ©e here, where haue expressed that same summe.
So that you haue not one figure for nor nor and so forth, but as many digits as you haue, so many Counters you set in the lowest line: and for euery you sette one in the seconde line: and so of other.
But knowe not by what reason you set that one counter for betwÃ©ene two lines.
You shall remember this, that whensoeuer you nÃ©ede to sette downe or or or so forth any number whose Numerator is you shall sette one counter for it in the next space aboue ye line that it hath his denomination of: as in this
example of that because the numerator is it must be set in a voyde space: and bicause ye denominator is hundred, know that his place is the voyde space next aboue hundreds, that is to say, aboue the thirde line.
And farther you shall marke, that in all working by this sorte, if you shall set down any summe between and [Figure: for the first part of that number you shal set downe and then so many Counters more, as there rest nu~bers aboue
And for example will set downe this summe whiche summe if you marke well you nÃ©ede none other examples for to learne the Nuration of this forme, But this shall you marke, that as you didde in the other kindes of Arithmetike, sette a pricke in the places of thousandes, in this worke you shal set a Starre, as you sÃ©e before.
Then perceiue Numeration: but pray you how shall doe in this art to adde two summes or more togither.
THe easiest waye in this art, is to ad but two sums at once togither: howbeit, you may add more, as wil tel you anon.
Therefore whe~ you wil add sums you shall first set down one of the~, it forceth not which, and then by it draw a line crosse the other lines.
And afterward set down the other sum, so that that line may be between them:
as if you woulde [Figure: add to you must set your sums as you sÃ©e here.
And then if you list, you maye adde the one
to the other in the same place: or else you may ad them both togither in a new place: which way, because it is most playnest, will shew you first.
Therefore will beginne at the vnits, which in the first sume is but and in the second summe that maketh
Those do take vp, and for them sette in the new roome, thus.
Then doe take vp all the Articles vnder a hundred, which in the first summe are and in the second summe that maketh or you may say better, that in the first summe there are articles of and in the seconde summe whiche maketh but then take hÃ©ede that you set the~ in their
Where haue taken away from the firste summe, and from the seconde, and in their stÃ©ede haue sette in the thirde roome, which haue set plainelye that you might well perceiue it: how be it, seeing that with the that was in the thirde roome already, doth make [Figure: might better for those Counters set in the thirde line, thus.
For it is all in one sum as you maye sÃ©e, but it is best neuer to sette fyue counters in any line, for that maye be done with one Counter in a higher place.
iudge that good reason, for manye are vnnÃ©edefull where one will serue.
Well, then will adde forth of hundreds: finde in the first summe, and in the second which maketh them do take vp, and set in the third roome, where is one hundred alreadie, to whiche putte and it will be therfore set one counter in the fourth line for them all, as you sÃ©e here.
Then adde the thousandes together, which in the first summe are and in the second that maketh them doe take vp from those two places, and for them set one counter in the fifte line, and then appeareth as you sÃ©e to be
[Figure: for so manye doth amount of the Addition of to
this doe perceiue: but howe shall sette one su~me to an other, not chaunging them to a third place? Mai. Marke well how doe it: will adde togither and which firste set down thus.
Then do begin with the smallest, which in the first su~me is that do take vp, and would put to the other in the second sum,
sauing that two Counters cannot be set in a voyd place of but for them both must set in the second lyne, which is the place of therefore take vp the fiue of the first summe, and the of the second, and for them set in the secounde line, as you see here.
Then doe likewise take vp the counters of the first sum and second line (which make and ad them to the counters of the same line, in the seconde summe, and it maketh but as sayde, maye not conuenientlye set aboue counters in one line, therefore to those that tooke vp in the first summe, take one also of the second
summe, and then haue taken vp for which Counters sette down one in the space ouer the second line, as here doth appeare.
[Figure: And then is there as well with those counters, as if you had set downe the other also.
Now do take the in the first sum, and adde them to the in the second sum, and it maketh therefore take vp the counters in the first summe, and of the~ in the second summe, and for them set in the space aboue, thus.
[Figure: Then take the in the first su~me, vnto which there are none in the seconde summe agrÃ©eing, therefore doe onelye remoue those thrÃ©e Counters from the first sum into the seconde, as here doth appeare.
[Figure: And so you sÃ©e the whole summe that amounteth of the Addition of with to bÃ©e
And if you haue marked these two examples well, you neede no further instruction in Addition of onely summes: but if you haue more than two summes to adde, you may ad them thus.
Firste adde two of them, and then adde the thirde and the fourth, or more if there be so many: as if woulde adde with and
forthe to Subtraction, excepte there be anye wayes to examine this manner of Addition, then thinke that were good to be knowen next.
There is the same proofe here that is in the other Addition by the penne, meane Subtraction, for that onelie is a sure waye: but considering that Subtraction muste be first knowen, will first teach you the arte of Subtraction, and that by this example.
These summes muste sette downe as did in Addition: but here it is beste to sette the lesser number first thus.
[Figure: Then shal beginne to subtract the greatest numbers first (contrarie to the vse of the pen) that is the thousandes in this example: therefore finde amongst the thousands for which withdraw so manye from the second summe (where are and so remayneth there as this example sheweth.
Then do likewayes with the hundreds, of whiche in the firste summe finde and in the seconde summe but out of whyche can not take therefore this must doe: muste looke howe muche my summe differeth from whiche finde here to be then muste bate for my summe of one thousande, and set downe the excesse of hundreds, that is to saye, for so muche is more than shoulde take vp.
Therefore from the firste summe take that and from the seconde summe (where are take vppe one thousande, and leaue but then set downe the vnto the that are there alreadie, and make them thus.
Then come to the articles of tennes, where in the firste summe finde and in
Now considering that can be bated from looke how muche that doth differ from the next summe aboue it, that is or else (which is all to one effecte) looke howe much doeth differ from and finde it to be then in the steade of that doe take from the seconde summe but considering that is too muche, set downe in the nexte line beneth for it, as you sÃ©e [Figure: here.
Sauing that here haue set one counter in the space, in steade of in the next line.
And thus haue subtract al, saue two whiche muste bate from the in the second [Figure: summe and there will remaine thus.
And that this is trulie wrought you may proue by addition: for if you adde to this remainer the same summe
that you did subtracte, then will the former summe amount againe.
That wil proue: and first set the sum that was Subtracted, which was and then the remainer thus.
[Figure: Then doe adde the first to which maketh so take vp of those counters, and in their stead set in the space, and in the lowest line, as here appeareth.
Then doe adde the next aboue to the and it maketh therefore take vppe those counters, and for them set to the hundreds in the thirde line, and foure in the second line thus.
[Figure: Then do come to the hundreds, of which finde in the first sum, in the seconde, yt maketh therefore take vp those counters, in their steade, set in ye fourth line, and in the space next beneath, and in the third line as you sÃ©e here.
Then is there lefte in the firste summe but onelie whiche shall take vppe from thence, and set in the same line in the [Figure: seconde summe, to the one that is there alreadie: and then wyll the whole summe appeare as you maye well sÃ©e, to be whiche was the firste grosse summe, and therefore do perceiue that had wel subtracted before.
And thus you may sÃ©e, howe Subtraction may be tried by Addition.
perceiue the same order here wyth Counters, that learned before in figures.
Then let me sÃ©e how you can trie Addition by Subtraction.
Firste will sette forth thys example of Additio~, where haue added to
[Figure: Nowe to trie whether that summe be wel added or no, wil subtract one of the first two summes from the thirde, and if haue well done, ye remainer wil be like that other sum, as for example.
wil subtracte the first sum from the thirde, which set thus in their order.
Then doe subtract of the firste sum from the second summe, and then remaineth there thus.
[Figure: Then in the third line subtracte the of the firste sum from the seconde sum where is onely also: and the~ in the third line resteth nothing, as you maye sÃ©e in the example following.
[Figure: Then the in seconde line with his space ouer him, finde whiche shoulde subtract from the other su~ then sÃ©eing ther are but onelie must take it out of some higher sum, which is here only therefore take vp and sÃ©eing that is too much by set down so many in the second roome, which with the being there alreadie, do make and then the summes do stand thus.
Yet remaineth there in the firste sum, to be abated from the second sum, wherein that place of vnits doth appeare only then must bate a higher summe, that is to saye but sÃ©eing that is more than (whiche shoulde abate) by therefore shall take vp one counter from the [Figure: second, and set down the same in the firste or lowest line, as you see here.
And so haue ended this worke, and the summe appeareth to be the same whyche was the seconde summe of mine Addition, and therefore perceiue
except that this you may also vndersta~d, that many do begin to subtract with counters not at the highest summe as haue taughte you, but at the neathermost, as they do vse to adds: and when the summe to be abated in anye line appeareth greater than the other, the~ do they borrow one of the next higher roome, as for example.
[Figure: If shoulde abate from they set the summes thus.
First they take whiche is the lower line, and his space, from in the same roomes in the seconde summe, and yet there remayneth counters in the lowest line.
Then in the seconde line must be subtracted from and so remaineth there
Then in the thirde line, and his space, from of the seconde summe can not be, therefore doe they bate it fro~ a higher roome, that is from and because that is too muche by therfore must set downe in the thirde line, after haue taken vp from the
Then is there yet in the fourth line of the first sum, whiche if withdrawe from the seconde sum, then doth al the figures stand in order, thus.
So that (as you [Figure: sÃ©e) it differeth not greatly whether you beginne subtraction at the higher lines, or at the lower.
Howe be it, as some men like ye one way beste, so some like the other: therefore you nowe knowing bothe, maye vse whyche you liste.
BVt nowe touchyng Multiplication: you shall sette your numbers in two roomes (as you did in those other kindes) but so yt the multiplier be set in the first roome, then shall you begin with the highest numbers of the seconde roome, and multiplie them firste, after this sort.
as if it were the lowest line, setting on it some moueable marke (as you list) and looke how many counters be in him, take them vp, and for them sette downe the whole multiplier so many times as you tooke vp counters: reckning (I say) that line for the Vnites.
And when you haue done with the highest number, then come to the nexte lyne beneath, and do euen so with it, and so with the nexte, till you haue done all.
And if there be anye number in a space, then for it shall
you take the multiplier times: and then muste you recken that line for the Vnites, whiche is next beneath that space.
Or else after a shorter waye, you shall take onelie halfe the multiplier, but the~ shal you take the line next aboue that space for the line of Vnites.
But in suche working, if by chaunce your multirlyer be an odde number, so that you can not take the halfe of it iustlye, then muste you take the greater halfe, and set downe that, as if that it were the iuste halfe: and further you shall sette one Counter in the space beneath that line, which you recken for the line of Vnits, or else onely remoue forwarde the same that is to be multiplied.
If you set forth an exa~ple hereto, think shal perceiue you.
Take [Figure: this example: woulde multiplie by therfore set the numbers thus.
Then firste beginne at the in the highest roome, as if it were the first place, and take it vp, setting downe for it so often (that is once) the multiplyer, which is thus as you sÃ©e here: where, for the one counter taken vp from the fourth line, haue set down other which make ye sum of the multiplier, reckening that fourth line as if it were the first, which thing haue marked by the hand set at the beginning of the same.
perceiue this well, for in dÃ©ede this sum that you haue set down is for so much doth amounte of multiplied by
next space finde one counter, whiche remoue forward, but take it not vp, but doe (as in such case must) set down the greater half of my multiplier (sÃ©eing it is an od number) which is and here doe still lette that fourth place stand, as if it were the first: as in these examples you shall sÃ©e.
Where haue set this multiplication with other, but for the ease of your vndersta~ding, haue set a little line betwÃ©ene them.
[Figure: Howbeit, an other fourme to multiplye such cou~ters in space, is this: Firste to remoue ye finger to the line next beneth that space, and the~ to take vp that Counter, and to set down the multiplier fiue times: as here you see.
Which summes if you do adde togither into one summe, you shall perceiue that it will be the same that appeareth of the other working before, so that both sorts are to one intente: but as the other is shorter, so this is playner to reason for such as haue had smal exercise in this arte.
may adde them in your minde before you set them downe: as in this example you might haue sayde, times is and times is also times is which all put togither, doe make whiche you may at one time set downe if you list.
But now to go forth, must remoue the hande to the next counters whiche are in the second lyne, and there must take vp those counters setting downe for them my multiplier times seuerally, or else maye gather that whole sum in my mynde firste, and then set it downe: as to say, times is times are and times make that is in all that shall set downe also, as here you sÃ©e.
numbers it will appeare thus, [Figure: Then to ende this Multiplication, remoue the finger to the lowest line, where are only them do take vp, and in their stÃ©ede doe set downe twice that is for which set one in the space aboue the thirde line for and more in the thirde lyne with that one that is there alreadie, and the rest in their order, and so haue ended the whole summe, thus.
Whereby you sÃ©e, that (whiche is the number of yeares sith Christe his incarnation) being multiplyed by (which is the number of dayes in one yeare) doth amounte vnto
which declareth the nu~ber of dayes sith Christes incarnation vnto the end of yeares, (beside dayes and houres for leape yeares.)
Now will prooue by an other example, as this: labourers (after the day for eche man) haue wroughte dayes: would know what their wages doth amou~t vnto.
In this case must worke doublye: first must multiplie the number of the labourers by the wages of a man for one daye, so will the charge of one day amount.
Then seco~darily shal multiplie the charge of one daye by the [Figure: whole number of dayes, and so wil ye whole sum appear: first therfore shal set the su~mes thus:
Where in the firste place is the Multiplier (that is dayes wages for one man) in the seconde space is
Then saye I: times (reckoning that second line of the line of Vnits) maketh for which summe [Figure: should set counters in the third line, and in the second therefore doe set in the third line, and let the stand still in the second line thus.
So appeareth the whole dayes wages to be yt is
Then doe multiplye [Figure: agayne the same summe by the nu~ber of dayes, and firste set the nu~bers thus, The~ because ther are [Figure: counters in diuerse lines, shall begin with the highest, and take them vp, setting for them the multiplier so many times as tooke vp counters, that is twise, then wil ye sum sta~d thus.
Then come to the second line, and take vp those Counters, setting for the~ the multiplier foure times, so [Figure: wil the whole summe appeare thus.
So is the whole wages of workemen for days (after eche daye for a man) that is or pound.
Now if you would prooue Multiplication, the surest way is by Diuision: therefore will ouerpasse it, till haue taughte you the arte of Diuision, whiche, you shall worke thus.
FIr&st set downe the diuisor, for feare of forgetting, and the~ set the nu~ber that shal be diuided, at the right side, so farre from the Diuisor, that the quotient may be set betwÃ©ene them: as for example.
shÃ©epe cost? To know this, shoulde diuide the whole summe that is lb by but that cannot be: therefore must firste reduce that lb into a lesser denomination, as into shillinges, then multiplie by and it is that summe shall diuide by the number of sheepe, which is these two numbers therefore set thus.
[Figure: Then begin at the highest lyne of the diuident, and sÃ©eke how often maye haue the diuisour therein, and that maye doe foure times: then saye I, foure times are whithe if take from there resteth but thus.
And because founde the diuisor times in the diuident, haue set as you sÃ©e, in the middle roome, which is the place of the quotient: but now must take the rest of ye diuisour as often out of the remayner, therefore come to the seconde line of the diuisor, saying: foure times make take from and there resteth thus.
Then come to the lowest number which is and multiplie it times, so is it that take from there remayneth nothing,
so that sÃ©e my quotient to be which are in valewe shillings, for so was the diuident: and therby know yt if ShÃ©epe did cost lb euery shÃ©epe cost
If soldiours do spe~d euery moneth lb what spendeth ech man?
First because cannot diuide the by therefore will turne the lb into pennies
Now must diuide this summe by the number of souldiors, therefore set them in order thus.
[Figure: Then beginne at the highest place of the diuidend, sÃ©eking my Diuisor there, which finde once, therefore sette in the nether line.
Not in the nether line of the whole summe, but in the nether lyne of that worke which is the third line.
Then sÃ©eke agayne the rest, how often may finde my diuisour: and sÃ©e that in the mighte finde thrÃ©e tymes, but then the will not be so often found in therefore take for my quotient: the~ take twice fro~ and there resteth out of which with the (that maketh may take also twice, and then standeth the numbers thus.
Where haue set the quotient in the lowest line: So is euery Souldiors portion that is
But yet because you shall iustlye perceiue the reason of Diuision, it shall bÃ©e good that you doe set your diuisor stil agaynst those numbers from which you doe take it, as by this example will declare.
If the purchase of acres of ground did cost pound, what did one acre cost?
First set the diuidend on the right hand as it ought, and then the diuisor on the lefte hande agaynst those numbers from which intend to take him firste as here you sÃ©e, where haue set the diuisor two lines higher than is his owne place.
This is like the order of Diuision by the pen.
Truth you say, and now must sette the quotient of this worke in the thirde line, for that is the lyne of vnits in respecte to the diuisor in this worke.
Then sÃ©eke how often the diuisor maye be found in the diuident, and that fynd tymes, then set in the third lyne for the quotient and take awaye that from the diuidend, and farther do set the diuisor
[Figure: And then sÃ©eke howe often the diuisor will be taken from the number agaynste it, which will be times and remaining.
But what if it chaunce that when the diuisor is so remoued, it cannot be ones taken out of the diuident against it? Ma.
Then muste the diuisour be set in an other line lower.
So was it in diuision by the pen, and therefore was there a cipher set in the quotient: but how shall that be noted here? Ma.
Here nÃ©edeth no token, for the lines doe represent the places: onely looke that you set your quotient in that place whiche standeth for vnits in respect of ye diuisor: but now to returne to the example.
finde the diuisor times in the diuident, and remaining, for times make which take fro~ there
resteth as this figure following sheweth; and in the middle space for the quotient set in the second line he is in this worke the place of vnits.
Then remoue the diuisour to the next lower line, seeke how often may haue it in the diuident, which may doe here tymes iust, and nothing remain, as in this fourme.
Where you may sÃ©e, that the whole quotient is that is whereby knowe that so much cost the purchase of one acre.
Now resteth the proues of Multiplication, and also of Diuision.
Their best proues are eche one by the other: for multiplication is prooued by Diuision, and Diuision by Multiplication, as in the worke by the pen you learned.
If that be all, you shall not nÃ©ede to repeate agayn that that was sufficie~tly taught alreadie: and except you will teache me any other feate, here maye you make an ende of this art, suppose.
So will doe as touching whole number: and as for broke~ number, will not trouble your wit with it, till you haue practised this so well, that you be full perfect, so that you nÃ©ede not to doubt in any point that haue taught you, and then maye boldlye instruct you in the arte of Fractions or Broken number: wherein will also shew you the reasons of al that you haue now learned.
But yet before make an end, will shew you the order of common casting, wherin are both pennies, shillings, and poundes, procÃ©eding by no grounded reason, but onelye by a receyued forme, and that diuerslye of diuerse men: for the Marchantes vse one forme, and Auditours an other.
Marchantes vse. BVt first for Marchantes [Figure: fourme, marke this example here, in whiche haue expressed this sum lb
So that you maye sÃ©e that the lowest line serueth for pennies, the nexte aboue for shillings, the third for pounds, and the fourth for scores of poundes.
And further you may sÃ©e, that the space betwÃ©ene and may receiue but one counter (as al other spaces likewise do) and that one standeth in that place for
Likewise betwÃ©ene the shillinges and the poundes, one counter standeth for
And betwÃ©ene the poundes and lb. one counter standeth for lb.
But beside those you maye sÃ©e at the lefte side of shillinges, that one counter standeth alone, and betokeneth
So agaynst the poundes, that one counter standeth for lb.
And against the pounds, the one counter standeth for score pounds, that is pounde, so that euery side cou~ter
is times so muche as one of them againste which he standeth.
But here you see the pence stand towardes the right hande, and the other increasing orderlie toward the left hande.
Againe you maye sÃ©e that Auditours wyll make lines (yea and more) for pence, shillings, and all other values, if their summes extende thereto.
Also you see that they set one counter at the right ende of each rowe, which so set there, standeth for of that roome: and on the lefte corner of the rowe it standeth for of the same row.
But now if you would adde other subtract after any of both those sortes, if you marke the order of the other feate which taughte you, you may easilie doe ye same here without
muche teaching: for in Addition you muste firste sette down one summe, and to the same set the other orderlie, and in like maner if you haue manye: but in Subtraction you muste set downe first the greatest summe, and from it muste you abate the other, euerie denomination from his due place.
do not doubt but with a little practise shal attain these both: but how shal multiplie and diuide after these formes? M. You can not duelie doe anye of both by these sortes, therefore in such case you muste resort to your other artes.
S. Sir, yet sÃ©e not by these sortes howe to expresse hundreds, if they excÃ©ed one hundred, neither yet thousands.
They that vse suche accomptes that it excÃ©ede in one summe, they sette not at the left hande of the scores of pounds, but they set all the hundreds in an other farther rowe, and at the lefte hande thereof, and the thousandes they set in a farther rowe yet, and at the lefte side thereof they sette the and in the space ouer they sette the and in a higher rowe whiche all haue expressed in this example, whyche is lb ob,
thousande, eighte hundred, thrÃ©e score myne pounde, twelue shillings and nine pence halfpeny farthing, for had not tolde you before, where, neither how you should set down farthings, which (as you sÃ©e here) [Figure: must be in a voide space sideling beneath the pens: for one counter, for ob,
counters: for ob, counters: and more there cannot be: for farthings make which must be set in his due place.
And if you desire the same summe after Auditours manner: Lo here it is.
But in this thing you shall take this for sufficient, and the rest you shal obserue as you may sÃ©e by the working of ech sort: for the diuerse wits of men haue inuented diuerse and sundrie wayes, almost vnnumerable.
BVt one feate shall teach you, which not onely for ye strangenesse and secretenesse is muche pleasant, but also for the good commoditie of it, right worthy to be wel marked.
This feate hath bin vsed aboue yeres at the least, and yet was it neuer commonlie knowen, especiallie in Englishe it was neuer taught yet.
This is the arte of numbring on the hand, with diuerse gestures of ye fingers, expressing anye sum conceiued in the minde.
If you will expresse anye sum vnder you shall expresse it with your left hand and from vnto you shal expresse it with your right hand, as here orderly by this Table following you maye perceiue.
Here followeth the Table of the Art of the hande.
In which (as you may sÃ©e) is expressed by the little finger of the left hand, closely and harde crooked.
Is declared by like bowing of the wedding finger (which is the next to the little finger) togither with the little finger.
Is signifyed by the middle finger, bowed in like manner with these two.
Is declared by the bowing of the middle finger, and the ring finger or wedding finger, with the other all stretched forth.
And by the wedding finger onlie crooked: and thus you may mark in these a certain order.
But now and are expressed wyth the bowing of the same fingers, as are but after another forme.
For is declared by the bowing of ye little finger as is saue that for the finger is clasped in, hard and round, but for to expresse you shall bow the middle ioynt of the little finger onelye, and holde the other ioyntes straight.
If you wil giue me leaue to expresse it after my rude maner, thus vndersta~d your meaning: that one is expressed by crooking in
the little finger, like the head of a Bishoppes bagle: and is declared by the same finger bowed like a gibbet.
Then to expresse you shall bowe after the same maner both the little finger, and the ring finger.
And if you bowe likewise with them the middle finger, then doth it betoken
Nowe to expresse you shal bowe your forefinger rounde, and set the end of it on the highest iointe of the thumbe.
And for to expresse you muste set youre fingers straight, and the end of your thumb to the partition of the formost middle finger.
Is represented by the ioyning togither of the heads of the foremost finger the thu~b.
Is declared by setting of the thumbe crossewaies on the formost finger.
Is signified by right stretching foorth of the fingers iointly and applying of ye thumbs ende to the partition of the middle finger, and the ring finger or wedding finger.
Is formed by bending of the thumbe crooked, and crossing it with the forefinger.
Is expressed by the bowing of the foremost finger and setting the ende of the thu~be
Is expressed by setting of the foremoste finger crossewayes on the thumbe, so that differeth thus fro~ for that the forefinger is set crossewayes on the thumbe and for the thumb is set crosse ouer the forefinger.
Is signified by bending the forefinger, and setting the end of it in ye innermost ioint of the thumbe, that is euen at the foote of it.
In dÃ©ed these be al he numbers from to then all the tenthes within but this teacheth me not how to expresse &c. &c. and such like.
You can little vnderstand, if you ca~ not doe that without teaching.
What is is it not and then expresse as you were taught and also, that is and for expresse and for set and and so for you must make and thereto and so of al other sortes.
But now if you wold represent either any number aboue it, you must doe that with the right hand, after this maner.
You must expresse in the righte hande with the little finger, so bowed as you did expresse in the left hand.
And as you expressed in the lefte hande, the same fashion in the right hande doeth declare
And to be shorte: looke how you did expresse single vnities and tenthes in the left hande, so must you expresse vnities and tenthes of hundreds, in the right hand.
vnderstande you thus: that if woulde represente muste so forme the fingers of my right hande to expresse
And as in my lefte hande expresse so in my right hand must expresse a
And so the forme of euerie tenth in the lefte hand, serueth to expresse the number of thousands, so the summe of standeth for
And the forme of (which is the greatest) for and aboue that can not expresse any number.
No, not with one finger, howe be it, with diuerse fingers you maye expresse
So that vnder ten thousande you maye by your fingers expresse anye summe.
And as for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Diuision (whiche yet were neuer taught by any man as farre as doe knowe) will instruct you after the treatise of Fractions: and now for this time fare well, and looke that you ceasse not to practise that you haue learned.
Sc. Sir, with most hartie minde thanke you, both for your good learning and also your good counsel, which (God willing) truste to follow.
Â¶THE SECONDE part of the Arithmetike touching Fractions, brieflie set forth.
ALbeit perceiue your manifolde businesse doth so occupie, or rather oppresse you, that you can not as yet co~pletelie end that treatise of Fractions Arithmeticall, whyche you haue prepared, wherein not onelie sundrie workes of Geometrie, Musicke, and Astronomie be largelie set forthe, but also diuers conclusions and naturall woorkes, touching mixtures of metals, and compositions of medicines, with other straunge examples,
can not stay my earnest desire, but importunelie craue of you some briefe preparation, towarde the vse of Fractions, whereby at the leaste maye be able to vnderstande the common workes of them, and the vulgare vse of those rules, whiche without them can not wel be wrought.
If my leasure were as great as my will is good, you shoulde not nÃ©ede to vse anye importunate crauing, for ye attaining of that thing, whereby maye be perswaded that shal anye waies profite the common wealth, or helpe the honest studies of anye good members in the same: wherefore, while myne attendaunce will permitte me to walke and talke, am well willing to helpe you as may.
Therefore firste to beginne with explication of this name Fraction, what take you if to be? Scholer.
Marie sir, thinke a Fraction (as haue heard it often named) to be a broken number, that is to say, to be no whole nu~ber, but a part of a number.
Fraction in dÃ©ede is a broken number, and so consequentlie, the part of another number: but that muste be vnderstanded
of suche an other number, as can not bÃ©e diuided into any other partes tha~ Fractions: for although may take the third part of or the fourth part of it, and so of other partes diuerslie, yet these partes be not properlie, nor ought not to be called Fractions, bycause they maye be expressed by whole numbers: for the third part of it is the fourth part is the twelfth part is and so forth of other parts, which all be whole numbers.
Wherefore properlie a Fraction expresseth the partes or part onelie of an vnit,
that is to saye, that the number which is the whole or entire summe of anye Fraction, may not be greater than one: and therefore it followeth, that no one Fraction alone can be so gret, that it shall make as by examples will declare as soone as haue taught you to knowe the forme howe a Fraction is expressed or represented in writing.
BVt first to begin with the expressing of a Fraction, which is the numeration of it, you must vnderstand that a Fraction is represented by numbers, set one ouer the other, and a line drawen betwÃ©ene them as thus, which foure Fractions you muste pronounce thus: one thirde parte: Â¾Â· thrÃ©e quarters: two fifte partes: tenne seauentÃ©ene partes.
vnderstande the forme of theyr expression and pronunciation, but their meaning or valuation sÃ©emeth more obscure: yet think that by the two first Fractions vnderstand the valuation of the two later Fractions, and so consequentlie of other.
M. Value them then, that may perceyue your taking of them Scholer.
betokeneth two fifte partes, that is to say, if one be diuided into parts, that Fraction doeth expresse ij. of those fifthe
partes: doth signifie, that if one be diuided into xvij. partes, must take tenne of them.
that is one thirde parte, doth easily declare, that if anye one thing be diuided into three partes, muste take but one of them: so that is thrÃ©e quarters, doeth declare that one being diuided into four quarters, must take (for this Fractio~) thrÃ©e of those quarters.
If there be no more difficultie in their Numeration, the~ pray you go forward to their Addition and Subtraction,
and so to the other kinds of workes for vnderstande that the same kinds of workes be in Fractions, that be in whole numbers.
There are the same kynds of workes in bothe, albeit the order of them is diuerse, as will anone declare: but yet more in Numeration before we leaue it.
You muste vnderstande, that those two numbers whiche expresse a Fraction, haue seuerall names.
The ouermost whiche is aboue the line, is called the Numerator, and the other beneath the lyne, is called the Denominator.
And what is the reason of theyr diuerse names? For in mine opinion both bee
Numerators, sÃ©eing both they do expresse the numeration of the Fraction.
You are deceiued: for one onelye (whiche is the ouermoste) doeth expresse the Numeration: and the denominatour doeth declare the number of partes into whiche the vnit is diuided, as in this example, when say: Diuide a pounde weighte of Golde betwÃ©ene foure men, so that the firste man shal haue the seconde the thirde and the fourth
Now do you perceiue ye by the denominator (whiche is one in al foure Fractions) it is intended, that the pounde waight shoulde be diuided into so manye partes meane and by the foure seuerall numerators is limitted the diuerse portion that each man shold haue, that is, that whe~ the whole is parted into the firste man shall haue of those partes: the second man thrÃ©e of them: the third man and the fourth man
And so may you sÃ©e ye seueral offices (as it were) of those two numbers, meane of the Numerator and the denominator.
And hereby you perceiue, that a man can haue no more parts of any thing than it was diuided into, nether yet aptlie so many: so that
that is fiftÃ©ene partes of any thing, sÃ©eing it were better sayde: You shal haue the whole thing.
So doth it appeare reasonablye: for the labour is vaine, to diuide anye thing, and than to applie the Diuision to no vse.
And much lesse reasonable were it to say for if the whole be diuided into parts only, it is not possible to take of them, that is to say, more than altogither.
This is true touching the proper and apte vse of the name of a Fraction:
yet improperlye, and after a vulgare acceptation (for easinesse in worke) both those formes be called Fractions, because they be writte~ like fractions, although they be none in dÃ©ede for and generally all suche other: where the Numerator and Denominator be equal, are not Fractions: but the whole thing with all his partes.
And so is not to be called a fraction, but a mixt number, of a whole number and a Fraction: for it is as muche, as that is one whole one, and twelue partes, as shall be declared in Reduction.
call them Fractions, where the Numerator is either equall or greater than the Denominator.
But is there any nÃ©edefull cause why they should so abuse the name? Mai.
There is cause why they shal sometimes, for easinesse in worke, write some nu~bers after that sorte, like fractions: but they nÃ©eded not to call them fractions, but as they be whole numbers or mixt numbers (that is whole numbers with Fractions) expressed like fractions.
Nowe must you vnderstande, that as no fraction properly can be greater than so in smalnesse vnder one the nature of Fractions doeth extende infinitelye: as the nature of whole numbers is to increase aboue one infinitelye, so that not onely one, may be diuided into infinite Fractions or parts, but also euerye Fraction maye be diuided into infinite Fractions or partes, whiche commonlye bee called Fractions of Fractions, and they be expressed diuerslye: As for example, that is thrÃ©e quarters of two third partes, of one halfe parte.
Whereby is signifyed, that if one be diuided into two halfes, and the one halfe into thrÃ©e partes, and two of
those thrÃ©e partes, be diuided idyntlye into foure quarters, this Fraction of Fractions doeth represente three of those quarters.
praye you lette me prooue by an example in common money, whether doe rightlye vnderstand you or no.
One Crowne, which take for an vnit, doth containe pennies, therefore the halfe of it is thirtye pence: of that halfe is pence, whereof is fiftÃ©ene pence, so then pence is of a Crowne.
You perceyue this well ynough, but how happened that you founde no doubte in the forme of writing these Fractions, sÃ©eing the two latter Fractions haue no line betwÃ©ene their numbers, as the firste hath? Sc.
Because had forgotten (as Scholers oft times doe) that that was tolde me before: but praye you, expresse the reason thereof.
This forme is but voluntarye, and therefore hath none other reason than the will of the diuiser, which forme many do follow.
Fraction, and adde wordes of distinction, after this sorte, of of Â½, which forme is good also.
Some other expresse them thus math in slope forme, to distincte them from seuerall Fractions of one whole number, for if they were set in one right line thus,
Â½. then oughte it to be pronounced, thrÃ©e quarters, and two thirde partes and an halfe, which maketh almost two whole vnits, lacking but one xij. part.
And so is it nothing agrÃ©eable with the other Fraction of Fractions, wherefore it is a great ouersight in certayne learned men, which doe expresse them so confusedly with such seuerall Fractions, that a man can not know the one from the other.
Therefore some men (as Stifelius doe expresse without a line numbers of proportion, being applied to Addition or Subtraction: because they must be take~ as two, where the line in Fractions maketh them to be taken for one: for of the Numeratour and Denominatour is made one number.
Then perceiue there be thrÃ©e seuerall varieties in Fractions: First when one only Fractio~ is set for one nu~ber, as yt
The second, is whe~ there be set two or more seuerall Fractions of one number, as that is iiij. ninth partes, and two fift parts.
The third sort is Fractions of Fractions, as that is ninth parts of two fifth parts.
You haue said well, if you vnderstand well your own wordes.
If it shall please you, will by an example in the parts of an old Englishe Angell expresse my meaning.
And of the same pence, if take and that is foure ninth partes, and fifth partes, is and is which both make but if take of that is foure ninth partes of two fift partes, sÃ©eing is but then of will yield but for of is but and that taken foure times maketh
This is plainely expressed, and truely and hereby (I doubte not) but you doe perceiue, yt as great a differe~ce as is betwÃ©en so much differe~ce is betwÃ©ene these two Fractions and and of
And now that you vnderstande these varieties, will procÃ©ede to the rest of the works: first admonishing you, that there is an other order to be followed in Fractions than there was in whole numbers, for in whole numbers this was the order: Numeration, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Diuision, and Reduction, but in Fractions (to followe the same aptnesse in procÃ©eding from the easiest workes to the harder) we must vse this order of the workes: Numeration, Multiplication, Diuision, Reduction, Addition, and Subtraction.
That Multiplication and Diuision shoulde goe togither, and Subtraction to followe Addition, naturall order doeth perswade: but why Multiplication shoulde be first in order here next to Numeration, and Reduction in the middle, desire to vnderstand the reason May.
As in the Arte of whole numbers order woulde reasonablye beginne with the easiest, and so goe forwarde by degrÃ©es to the hardest, euen so reason teacheth in Fractions the like order.
And considering that Addition or Subtraction of Fractions can very seldom be wrought without multiplication and Reduction:
and contrariwayes, Multiplication and Reductio~ may be wrought without this forme of Addition or Subtraction.
Therfore was it orderly required, that Multiplication and Reduction shoulde goe before Addition and Subtraction.
And the same reason serueth for the placing of Multiplication before Reduction.
Then if Multiplication be the easiest, pray you declare the forme of it first by rule, and then by example.
THerefore when anye two Fractions be proponed to be multiplied togither, ye Numerator of the one must be multiplied by the Numerator of the other: and the summe that amounteth therof, must be set for a new numerator: likewise the Denominatour of the one must be multiplied by the Denominator
of the other, and that that amounteth, shal be set for the common Denominator: this new third Fraction expresseth the Product of the multiplication of the two first fractions proponed, whereof take this example, multiplied by doth make
perceiue then, that being the Numeratour of the first Fraction, is multiplied by being the Numeratour of the seconde Fraction, whereof amounteth the Numeratour of the thirde Fraction.
And so likewise, being Denominatour of the first Fraction, is multiplied by the Denominator of the second fraction, whereof amounteth the newe Denominator: so that perceiue howe the worke is done, but doe not perceiue howe is greater than For if shall vse my former maner of examination by the partes of some Coyne, sÃ©e that of a Crowne is and of a Crowne, is whereof the one multiplyed by the other, doth make whiche is Crownes: but by your multiplication there amounteth which is but and that is much lesse then anye of both the firste Fractions.
in whole numbers, and multiplication in broken numbers that in whole nu~bers the summe that amounteth, is greater than both the other whereof it came: but in Fractions it is contrarywaies: for the sum that amounteth is lesser tha~ any of the other two fractions, whereof it came.
Although purposed to reserue the reasons of workes Arithmeticall for the perfecte Booke of Arithmetike, yet will shew you this, because of the straungenesse of the worke.
You sÃ©e in whole numbers, that of two numbers being multiplied together, is made the third number: which third number doth beare the same proportion to the nu~ber multiplyed, that the multiplier doth beare to an vnit.
And so in Fractions, the third number which amounteth of multiplication, beareth the same proportion to eache of the two firste fractions, that the other of those two fractio~s doth beare to an vnit.
Sir vnderstande your wordes thus: when is multiplied by there doth amount whiche doeth contayne
so many times in it, as twelue doth contayne vnits, that is to say: twelue times.
And so it appeareth, that doeth contain twelue so many times also, as doeth contayne Vnites, that is times.
But now see not how the thirde number in this exa~ple of Fractions can contain any of the two former (as it happened in whole nu~bers) sÃ©eing it is lesser than eyther of them.
No maruaile if you cannot sÃ©e that thing which is not possible to be sÃ©ene of anye man, how the third number in multiplication of Fractions should be greater than anye of the two former Fractions, but yet this may you sÃ©e (which sayde) that the thirde number in Fractions so multiplyed, doeth beare the same proportion to any of the two former fractions, that the other of those fractions doth beare to an vnite, as in your example being multiplied by doeth make
Now saye I, that doeth beare the same proportion to that doth beare to an vnit, as you may in your own forme of examination by coyne trie it.
For in an olde Angell are halfe pence, whiche set for the intire vnit whose parts (according to the Fractions aforesayde) are these, for sette ob.
for take ob and for put ob Nowe doeth beare the same proportion to that doeth beare to for is of and so is also of
And for easier applying of ech comparison, consider this forme of setting all these nu~bers before your eyes, where the seco~d demo~stration towards your right hand is answerable to the firste in euerye proponed part, where for (of stands his value for stands and for is
math But these reasons may be better reserued till another time, whe~ the knowledge of proportions in due order shall be taught.
Yet in the meane season will shewe you howe it commeth to passe that in Fractions the third summe must nÃ©edes be lesser then any of the other two.
Consider thus, that when a Fraction is proponed, as in the former example if it bÃ©e multiplied by more tha~ it will make more
As if multiplie by that is to saye if take it tymes, it will make thrÃ©e entire vnits: example in a Crowne, of it maketh which if take fiue times, it will amounte to shillinges, that is thrÃ©e intire Crownes: so if take the same but twice, it will yielde that is one entire Crowne and
Now if take it but once it cannot be more tha~ it was before, that is,
And if take it lesse then once, it cannot be so much as it was before.
Then seeing that a Fraction is lesse than one, if multiplie a Fraction by another Fraction, it followeth that doe take that first Fraction lesse than once and therfore the summe that amounteth, must nÃ©edes be lesse than the first fraction.
Sir, thanke you much for this reason, And truste doe perceiue the thing, as by example of this same Fraction wil expresse If take of a Crowne once, that is to say, if multiplie by it will be as it was before, but so if doe multiplie it by Â½, that is, if take it but half one time, then will it be but halfe so muche: likewise if multiplie it by Â½, that is, if take but the thirde part of once, it will yielde but
pence, that is the thirde part of the first Fraction.
If take it but the twelfth part of once, that is, if doe multiplie it by it will yielde but the twelfth part of the firste Fraction, which is but thrÃ©e pence.
And it followeth that if make pence, then must nÃ©edes make fiue tymes so muche, that is pence, which was the summe that hath giuen the occasion of all this doubt.
Then perceiue you haue sufficient vnderstanding in this sorte of multiplication for this time, wherefore will omitte that might saye more of Multiplication, till we come to reduction, and wil passe to the other workes, and firste to Diuision, whose place followeth Multiplication, both by naturall order, and also in ea~sinesse of worke.
WHen so euer two fractions bÃ©e proponed, that the one shoulde be diuided by the other, muste sette downe firste the Fraction that shall be diuided (which is called the Diuidend) and then after it the other, whiche is the Diuisor.
Then shall multiplie the numerator of the diuidend by the denominator of the diuisour, and that which amositeth, must put for a new numerator.
Agayne, shall multiplie the denominator of the diuidend by the numerator of the diuisor, and the number that amounteth thereof, must put for the new denominator.
And this third fraction is the quotient of the sayd diuision.
This sÃ©emeth easie in forme, as by example, thus: If would diuide by first must multiplie (being the numerator of the diuidend) by whiche is the denominator
of the Diuisor, and thereof riseth then multiplie (being the denominator of the diuidend) by being Numerator in the diuisor, and so riseth the whiche muste make in a thirde Fraction, thus
Me sÃ©emeth you are quicker in vnderstanding nowe, than you were when taught you the arte of whole numbers: but that is no maruell, for the more knowledge that any man getteth, the readier shal he find his wit, and quicker in vnderstanding: but yet of thinges will admonish you, which you mighte haue obserued here for ease of worke and lightnesse of vnderstanding the nature of the Quotient.
Whensouer you diuide one Fraction by an other, either they be both equall togither eyther else the one is greater than the other: if they be equall, their quotient shal be such, that the numerator and the denominator of it shall be equall also.
And if ye firste fractions be vnequall, their quotient shall declare the same by the vnequalitie of the numeratour and denominatour, as in these examples following shall appeare.
First of equall Fractions: and bÃ©e equall togither: and if the one be diuided by the other, the quotient will be as you may perceiue by that rule aforesayde.
Now in the vnequal Fractions, as and the quotient wil be where the Numerator is greater than the denominator.
sÃ©e it is so, but see not the reason why it should be so.
The reason is this, when anye Fraction is diuided by an other, the quotient declareth what proportion the diuidend beareth to the diuisor.
So diuided by Â¼, maketh which must be sounded, not two, but twice: declaring that is contained twice in Â½.
And note this, that the Numerator in the Quotient, representeth the Diuidend, the Denominator representeth the diuisorÂ· And this is alwayes true,
whether, the greater fraction be diuided by the lesser, or the lesser by the greater.
But this proportion will not be exactly knowne, till you haue learned the art of proportions: notwithsta~ding somwhat of it will declare in the next rule of Reduction.
But now for the easie remembrance of the Quotie~t in diuision, as soone as you haue
set downe your two Fractions, the one againste the other, then make a streighte line for the quotiente: and as soone as you haue multiplyed the Numerator of the diuidende, by the Denominator of the diuisor sette the number that amounteth, ouer the said line, and then multiply the other two numbers, set their totall vnder the same line.
perceiue you woulde not haue me trust to memorie til wer better expert, least oftentimes happen by misse remembraunce to be abused.
If woulde diuide by must set the numbers one against the other, math (as here doeth appeare) then make an other line for the Quotient in some good distaunce, where maye set the numbers of the Quotient, as soone as any of them is multiplied: So then as soone as haue multiplied by which maketh math shal set that ouer that line thus.
And then multiplye by whiche yÃ©eldeth and that muste set vnder the same line, and then will the whole quotient appeare thus
Whereby appeareth (as remember your wordes) that is in proportion
to Â¼, as is to but howe maye perceiue that? Mayster.
Althoughe you shall better perceiue it by the rule of Reduction, yet this example may be declared in common coine, as in a common shilling of xij. pence, of whiche maketh and dothe make pence, and so you maye easily see that their proportions doe agrÃ©e.
And if you had taken this example before, when you tooke the example ofÂ· and your Quotie~t would appere (as this doth) more easier to vnderstande, whereas that Quotient being is not an easie proportion for you to perceiue, being yet little acquainted with proportions: whereof to giue you some taste, will enter to the rule of Reduction: in which also wil declare other workes, both of Multiplication and also of Diuision, whiche nowe muste for a time omitte, as things that do neede the help of Reduction.
THerefore wil nowe declare the diuersities of Reduction of Fractions,
First, when there be, sundrie Fractions of one entire Vnitie, they muste be reduced to one denomination, and also into one Fraction.
Secondarily, when ther be proponed fractions of fractions, they must be reduced likewise into one Fraction, for other wayes they can not bÃ©e brought into one Denomination.
Thirdly, when an Improper fraction is proponed, that is to say, a fraction in forme, which indÃ©ed is greater tha~ an vnitie, it must be reduced into apt form expressing ye Vnitie or Vnities of it, the proper fraction distinctly.
And some times also it shall be nÃ©edefull to conuerte such a mixte number of Vnities,
with Fractions into the forme of a Fraction, that is into an Improper Fraction, which formes esteeme but as one, bicause they worke on one kind of number.
Fourthlie, there happeneth sometimes Fractions to be written in greate numbers, whiche mighte be written in lesser numbers, therefore is there a meane to reduce suche greate numbers into their smallest tearmes.
Fiftelie, when anye Fraction betokeneth the partes of a whole thing, whyche hath by common partition certaine partes, but none of like Denomination wyth that Fraction, then maye you reduce the sayde Fraction into an other, whose Denomination shall expresse the common partes of that whole thing.
Thys distinction in doctrine delighteth me much, but more with hope than presente fruite, for as yet doe not vnderstande scarselie the varieties, and much losse the practise and vse of their workes.
Reduction is an orderlie alteration of numbers out of one forme into an other, whiche is neuer done orderlye but for some nÃ©edefull vse, as in euery of
Firste therfore, when two or more seuerall Fractions of anye Vnite be proponed,
as for example, and because it is harde to tell what proportion of the entier number those two Fractions doe expresse, therefore was Reduction diuised, to bÃ©e a meane whereby these seuerall Fractions mighte be broughte into one Denomination and Fraction.
And in these Fractions this is the arte for bringing them to one denomination.
and the totall thereof you shall sette twice downe vnder two seuerall lines for two newe Denominators, or rather for one common Denominator: Then multiplye the Numeratour of the firste Fraction, by the Denominator of the seconde, and sette the totall thereof for the Numeratour ouer the firste line.
Likewise multiplie the Numerator of the seconde Fraction by the Denominator of the first, and set that totall ouer the seconde line for the Numerator of that Fraction, and so are those two first Fractions of seuerall denominations, brought to one
If vnderstand you, as thinke do, my example shal declare the same.
The Fractions which you proponed were these, and whose Denominators (being and multiplie togither, and there amounteth which set vnder lines, thus.
math Then multiplie the Numerator of the first Fraction by the Denominator of the second, saying: into maketh that set ouer the first line for a newe Numeratour, and it wil be thus.
math Likewaies multiplie the Numeratour of the second Fraction by the Denominatour of the first: saying: times maketh that set for ye second Numeratour, and the Fraction wil appeare thus.
math So that both Fractions broughte to one Denomination, must stand thus: math Ma.
besÃ©ech you, let me examine it after my accustomed forme, by common parts of coine.
that is the xvj. parte, is sixe pence, and is pence, that is
Againe of the same Angel, is pence, so that maketh that is
And so find the summes to agrÃ©e with the other before.
So haue you nowe the Arte to bring such two Fractions into one Denomination.
then must you multiplie al the Denominators togither, and set the totall therof so many times down as there be Fractions, and then to get for ech one a newe Numerator.
Multiplie the Numerator of the firste, by the Denominator of the second, and the total therof multiplie by ye denominator of the third, and so foorth if there be more.
Likewise multiplie the Numerator of the second, by the denominator of the first, and the total thereof by the Denominator of the thirde.
And in the same sorte multiply the Numerator of the third into ye Denominator of the first: the totall thereof into the Denominator of the seconde, and so foorth, if there were mo.
adding the Numeratours togither, and putting that totall for the common Numerator, reseruing still that same common Denominator, And those Fractions make one Improper Fraction thus.
All this perceiue, and also that thys laste Fraction is more than an Vnitie, and therefore you did call it an Improper Fraction.
There be certaine other formes of working in this reduction, whiche will brieflie touch also, to giue you an occasion to exercise your wit therin.
When you haue made and written downe youre common Denominator (as haue taught before) then to get a Numerator for the first, do thus.
Diuide the common Denominator by the Denominator of the first Fraction, and the quotiente multiplied by the Numerator of the same, yÃ©eldeth a new Numerator for the first new Fraction.
So likewise doe with the second and the third, and with all the residue if there be more.
That will proue in your laste example of these Fractions math.
for into maketh and by yeldeth that sette downe times, thus.
math: then to haue a Numerator for the firste, muste diuide by (the Denominator of the firste) the quotient is which muste multiplye by (the Numerator of the firste) that maketh and so haue for the first Fraction
diuide by and there commeth whiche multiplye by and so haue and the seconde fraction
If it happen so that the lesser Denominator can by any multiplication make the greater, the~ note the multiplier, and by it multiplie ye Numeratour ouer that lesser Denominatour, and for the lesser Denominatour put the greater, as thus in these two Fractions, and thrÃ©e being the lesser Denominatour multiplyed by will make whyche is the greater Denominatour: therefore by the same do multiplie whiche is the Numeratour ouer and that maketh vnder which doe put being the greater Denominatour, whiche is also made by Multiplication of into
so haue these ij. Fractio~s thus shortlye reduced without altering the one Fraction.
Then marke this thirde waye: If the denominators doe not happen so, that one by Multiplication may make the other, the~ loke whether they both maye be partes of anye other one number, as in and althoughe the lesser taken but twice be to great to make yet they both may be parts vnto therfore loke howe manie times is in and that quotient being multiplyed by the numeratour ouer the totall shall be putte in steade of the Numerator ouer for put thus,
So likewise looke howe often is in and because it is twice, therefore by multiplie
whiche is ouer and it wyll be set that for the numerator, and in stead of put and then shall youre Fractions reduced, stande thus, in steade of and
And if you will proue whether you haue wrought well or no, that maye be proued by Reduction of them againe to their former denominations, whiche arte shall be taughte in the fourth kinde of Reduction, where greater
termes of Fractions be reduced into smaller in number, but no smaller in proportio~.
And if in suche Reduction the same termes or nu~bers come again that were before, then is the worke good, else not.
Sir, heare your wordes, but doe not vnderstand many of the~, which it may please you to declare.
With a good will, when conueniente place serueth, but that must be in the said iiij. kinde of Reduction.
In the meane season wil declare the seconde forme of Reduction, which teacheth howe to reduce Fractions of Fractions into one Fraction, and so to one Denomination.
you shall multiplie the Numeratours of each into other, and set the totall for the new Numerator, and then multiplie all the Denominatours likewaies, and take their totall for the new denominator, and so are they speedily reduced.
If that be al then vnderstand it alreadie, as by this example wil declare.
These be the Fractions, of of of which wold reduce to one denomination.
and multiple them all togither, saying: into maketh and by maketh whiche multiplyed by yÃ©eldeth that math set ouer a line for the Numerator, thus: Then multiplie the denominatours, by maketh that by bringeth whiche multiplyed by yÃ©eldeth the new denominatour.
And so the whole math reduced fraction is this, which is to hard a Fraction for me to vnderstand yet.
Mai You thinke so, and no maruaile, but anone you shal learn to iudge it easilie, for this Fraction is no more in dÃ©ede then although it be in greater tearmes, and therefore more stranger and more obscure.
And this sufficeth for this Reduction, saue that will shew you by a figure of measure, the iuste rate and reason of this kinde of Fractions, and also the due vnderstanding of the Reduction.
Here you sÃ©e the longest measure, (whyche standeth for the whole and entier quantitie) firste parted into Diuisions, whereof are seuered by the second measure: and thereof againe are parted out
And that being distinct into partes, of them are parted by the fourth measure, of which fourth measure, being diuided into partes, the lowest measure doth containe Â¾, so that the same muste be named, not of the whole measure, but in dÃ©ede is of of of or as woulde rather expresse it,
This example is so sensible, that can not choose but sÃ©e it.
And furthermore, sÃ©e also, that the same fraction is equall to of the entier measure, as the lines whiche runne vp and downe doe expresselie set forth.
Also sÃ©e here, that is equall to And further yet that is equal to
am gladde that you see it so wel, not doubting but you wil gather greater light of knowledge hereby.
But nowe it is time that we come to the thirde forme of Reduction, which teacheth of Improper Fractions, that is to say, Mixt nu~bers of Vnites and Fractions, although they appeare like Fractions, as this whyche doeth include Vnites wholly, and ouer.
Wherfore first you shall know them, by that the Numeratour is greater than the Denominatour.
In dÃ©ede sir that appeareth reasonable, that if the Numerator doe expresse more partes to be taken of any vnitie then the Denominator doth signifie that vnitie to be diuided into, it must nÃ©edes follow that such a fraction importeth more than the whole, that is to saye, the whole with certaine partes ouer.
There be two seuerall kindes of Reduction, concerning suche Fractions.
Sometimes it shal be nÃ©edefull to conuert those fractions into the Vnites and the proper fraction that wil remaine And sometimes contrarie
wayes it shal be mete to reduce mixt nu~bers, that is vnities, written with fractions into the forme of one simple fraction, so be there two wayes.
What is the meane of the first waye to turne improper fractions into Vnities wyth their proper Fractions? M.
Your Numerator bÃ©eing greater than the Denominator, muste be diuided by the same denominator, the quotie~t therof expresseth the vnities, ye remainer shal be put for the Numerator of the fraction that resteth, and the denominator must be ye same that was before.
And diuiding by the quotient wil be and there will remaine
That must you write thus, where (you sÃ©e) haue written, without any line, as entier numbers ought to be writte~, and the that remained, haue set ouer the former denominator with a line, as a proper fractio~.
And this number doth signifie now Vnits, and of one.
Then if would by Vnites here vnderstand crowns, so it were crownes, and that is
But this happeneth sometimes, that when the Reduction is so wrought, there remayneth nothing.
And then it is not a mixts number, but a simple entier number, represented like a Fraction.
But nowe, what is the seconde forme of Reduction, that you spake of for these sortes of Fractions? M.
Whensoeuer you haue any of these two sorts of numbers, that is to saye, whole numbers without Fractions, or whole numbers with fractions, and you would turne the~ into the forme of a fraction you must multiply the whole number by that denominatour, which you wil haue to remaine stil, and to the total thereof adde the numeratour which you haue alreadie, and al that shall you set for the new numerator, kÃ©eping still the former denominatour: as if you haue which you woulde conuert into an Improper Fractio~ you must multiplie by whereof commeth and thereto adde the numeratour which is and so haue you for the numerator, and still for the Denominator.
Euen iust, and so backward (as appeareth by the former Reductio~) maketh And thus one of these Reductions may be the proofe of the others worke.
This perceiue, but now if you wold turne whole numbers without fractions into any fraction, sÃ©e not how that maye bÃ©e done, because there is no denominatour to make the multiplication by.
That was well marked: but this you know, that no man intendeth to turne any whole number into a Fraction, but hÃ©e hath in his mind that denominator by which the Multiplication must be made:
for the proofe whereof sette downe whiche is a whole number.
And if you will haue this nu~ber conuerted into any certayne fraction, will me to doe it.
Then you care not what the fraction be, so it be some fraction.
Then how can you thinke that you require me to doe any thing certayne, when
you leaue me to doe as list? and sÃ©eing you stande at that staye, whether thinke you that must firste intende in mynde what fraction will make of it, before can doe it indeede? Sc. Else you should doe ignorauntly.
Then will limit my selfe (sÃ©eing you will not) to turne it into quarters.
And therefore multiplie by (whiche is the denomination of quarters) and there amou~teth to be set for the Numeratour, and the must be set for the Denominator, and the fraction will be thus,
Sch. IndÃ©ede perceiue this to be reasonable, for without much triall vnderstand that of any thing doeth make
And so then if would turne into fift parts, it wil make which is all one with
for eyghte crownes turned into fift partes (that is, into shillinges) will make shillinges, that is of a crowne.
Seing you vnderstande nowe these thrÃ©e kinds of Reduction, will declare vnto you the fourth kinde, that is when Fractions be written in greater Tearmes than they nÃ©ede, howe they maye be broughte to lesser Tearmes.
To write anye thing in greater Tearmes than nÃ©edeth, seemeth to be a fault,
It were a fault to do any thing without nÃ©ede which after must be redressed: but in this case it is not so: neither did say absolutely (as you doe) that it nÃ©edeth not to expresse those Fractions in so greate tearmes, but that the fractions doe not neede, meane for their value to be vnderstanded: but yet it maye be nÃ©edefull for the ease of those works whereto they be applyed, as for example: In the firste kinde of Reduction this was youre owne example: and whiche when you would reduce, you were fayne to turne them first into one Denomination, so appeared they thus, and where the Fractions (for their owne vnderstanding) nÃ©eded not to be turned out of smaller tearmes into greater, but yet the easinesse of working nÃ©eded it.
Sir, vnderstand nowe, not onelye the difference of this nÃ©ede (for the Fractions mighte better be vnderstanded as Fractions seuerall, eche in his value,
not so well be reduced) but also vnderstand what you meane by greater Tearmes and lesser Tearmes, whereof before was in doubt, for see you call the Numeratour and denominatour, the Termes of the Fraction.
Now then when you woulde value any fractions (because that maye best be done when the Tearms are smallest) you shal reduce them to the smallest that you can, which thing you may doe thus:
Diuide the greatest of any such two Termes by the lesser, and if any thing remayne by that remainer, diuide the last Diuisour: and if any thing remayne now, by that diuide the last diuisour (whiche was before the remainer of the first Diuisio~) and so continue still, till nothing do remayne in the Diuision: and then marke your laste Diuisour, for it is the number that will easilye reduce your Fraction, if you diuide both the Numeratour and the Denominatour by the same number, and put for the Numeratour the quotient of his Diuision, and for the Denominatour also his quotient, that riseth by his Diuision.
is the greatest number, diuide it by and the quotient is and there resteth what shall doe with this quotient? Maister.
Nothing in this worke, but nowe sÃ©eing there remaineth somewhat, by that remainer must you diuide the last diuisor.
If shal diuide (which was the last diuisour by that was the remayner, so is the quotient and nothing resteth Ma.
As for the quotient omitte him yet: but because there doth remain nothing therfore is (which was your last diuisour) that number by which you may reduce the fraction proponed, Sch.
muste diuide the Numerator by and the quotient is which must put for math the numerator ouer a line, thus.
and then by the sayde must diuide also the denominator and the quotient will be whiche must take for the Denominator, and so is the fraction
And so me thinketh this Rule doth prooue ye work of the first Reduction.
That is true, if the first Reduction were made of Fractions in their leaste
tearmes, and else not, withoute some helpe, as the second number in that place will declare.
The second nu~ber was which was turned into by that rule.
Nowe if shall by this Rule reduce it againe into the leaste tearmes, must diuide by and there resteth by which diuide there remayneth nothing, wherefore must take that for the Diuisour, to reduce the sayde Fraction.
Then doe diuide by and the Quotient is whiche sette for my Numeratour.
Againe, diuide by and the Quotient will be and so haue but Ma.
Muse not at the matter, for you haue done well ynough: but you thinke you haue not the fraction that you looked for, that is yet haue you one equall to it, as by the parts of a shilling you may prooue.
Truth it is, for ech of them will bring forth pence, so that, and and bÃ©e all thrÃ©e equall.
And nowe perceiue that because was not written in the leaste Tearmes that it mighte be, therefore this Reduction broughte forthe not it, but that other whiche is written in the leaste
But is there anye other waye to worke this Reduction.
that if you finde no suche diuisor, to reduce the Fraction till you come to because doeth make no diuision, therefore that Fraction is alreadie in his least tearmes, as by you may prooue and so of and many other like.
But now for your better ayde to find the due proportion in least tearmes, with more ease for a yong learner, you shall mediate or take the halfe of the Numerator, and also the denominator as long as you may vpon a line alwayes parting them with a dashe of your penne as you worke, which maye easilye be done, if the numbers be euen: as or But if they be odde (though it be but in one of them) then must you abbreuiate them by by by &c.
And because Examples doe most instruct, haue in the Page following, set downe the maner of or whose last number at the ende of the lyne, sheweth the least tearme or valuation of that Fraction.
math Sc. Sir thanke you much, this is verye easie, and good for a yong learner.
So it is, but yet notwithstanding, if you can without that diuision by memorie espie the greatest number that maye diuide exactly both Tearmes of your Fraction proponed, then nÃ©ede you not to vse that diuision, as in this fraction sÃ©e that is the greatest number that can diuide them both: and therefore without any work, by memorie onely, turne that into but this abilitie in knowledge is gotten by exercise.
Yet one other waye of easie Reduction in this kinde there is, when your Fraction hath
any Cipers in ye first places of both tearmes, then may you by casting away the ciphers, make a brÃ©efe Reduction, as thus here take away the Ciphers, and it wil be Â¾, which is the same in value with
You are deceiued, for you take away more ciphers from the Numerator,
than you doe take from the denominator, whiche you may not doe. Sc.
confesse my fault, whiche came of too much haste, was more gladder of the rule than wise in vsing it: but now vndersta~d it trust.
Then may go in hand with the fift or last kinde of
which teacheth how to turne any fraction proponed into any other denomination that you list: or into any parts of common coynes, waightes, or measures, or such like.
For declaration whereof, firste you shall mark whether your fraction be a simple fraction, either else a fraction of sundrie parts, meane of more tearmes than
And if your fraction be a fraction of Fractions, or otherwaies compounde, you must reduce it to one
And then marke well the denomination of that other fraction, into which you would turne this, for by that denominatour you must multiplie the Numeratour of your first fraction, and the totall Producte thereof shall you diuide by the denominator of your first fraction, and that quotient shall be the numeratour to the denominatour proponed: as for example haue this fractio~ which would turne into tenth partes, therfore multiplie this by that is the Numeratour of my fraction, and there riseth which diuide by and the Quotient is which must be the Numerator to and so will be
Then shall you see an other example of the same fraction that is not so easie: as if would turne into viij. partes, proue you that worke.
must multiplie by and there amounteth which diuide by and the quotient is then is the new fraction
sÃ©e that when was diuided by there remayned whiche did not passe of,
because ye speake nothing of any remayner, but only of the quotient.
By likelihoode you remember what sayd to you in diuision of whole numbers, that you shoulde not passe of the remayner there, but only note it as a summe that could not be diuided without knowledge of Fractions.
Wherefore now marke this, that in all Diuisions of whole numbers, when there is any remainer, you shall set it ouer a line as a Numeratour, and set the Diuisour for the Denominatour, and that Fraction doeth make the Diuision complete, and is parte of the quotient: as if woulde diuide by the quotient will be so in your former worke when was diuided by the quotient should be and so the new math Fraction shoulde bÃ©e thus: that is of the entire number, and of which you may prooue be example of some coyne.
Now if would prooue whether that bÃ©e and of shall haue a combrous worke to doe. Maister.
In dÃ©ede for whole pennies your example is troublesome: yet tourning
First let me tell you an easie way how to finde any number that will easily be diuided into such parts as you desire, which way is this.
Set down the parts that you desire, and then by one of them multiplie all the other, the totall whereof shall containe all the partes proponed, as if would haue a number that may be diuided into and partes, by multiplie and there riseth then multiplie by it will make which multiplied by will yield and so of any other numbers.
Then in our former example where is mention but of partes and partes, shall only multiplie by which maketh and that number will serue.
Then what is of Mai. Proue by the same rule whiche you confesse easie ynough: times is which being diuided by maketh math and that is iust.
Now to know whether it be equall to firste sÃ©e by the same rule, that is and
is of which must take math and that by the same Rule is
And by the waye note this forme of fraction how it is written, that is to say, both the Numerator and his Fraction aboue the lyne, although know it may be written otherwyse, as thus: and of but accoumpte the other waye more apte a greate deale.
Now pray you sir let me prooue how this and of of a Crown be equal to of a Crown our first proponed fractio~, that hath brought forth these hard fractions to my thinking yet.
First sÃ©e that of a crowne is which is or halfe pence.
Now if can find that this fraction and of be equall vnto then am fully answered.
Because cannot take of a Crowne, turne the crown into half pence, as you wild me, which makes which diuide by my quotie~t is which take~ times makes now resteth me to haue of the wherof is that being parted into parts, ye quotie~t is which take~ times makes
which with my before, amounteth to which are then equall to my desire.
And so may you expresse by an other way then is before mentioned, all math Fractions of Fractions, as thus: That is of and so of other, but remit these fourmes to the arbitrement of euery wise artes man, to vse as he thinketh most apt and readie.
But now one example more for this rule, and then shall we ende it.
If haue of a Soueraine (accounting the Soueraigne shillinges) how many shillinges is that Sc.
must multiplie by and that maketh which shall diuide by and the Quotient will be or else in lesser tearmes, Â½.
That is and one third parte of a shilling, that is as by this same rule you may prooue.
And this for this time shall suffise for Reduction, saue that must now repeate a little touching Multiplication and Diuision, and so go forward.
IN Multiplication it happeneth sometyme that there be whole numbers to be multiplied with Fractio~s: And maye be in two sortes, for eyther the whole number is seuerall from the Fraction, and is the Multiplyer, or else, the whole number is ioyned with one, or both of the Fractions,
If it be in the first sorte, then nÃ©edeth there no Reduction, but onelye multiplie the Numerator of the Fraction by that whole number, and the totall thereof set for the new Numerator.
If haue to be multiplied by then must multiplie that with which is the Numerator, whereof commeth and that must set for the new Numerator, kÃ©eping still for the Denominator, and so the Fraction
And in this sorte of worke you maye abbridge the labour, thus.
If it happen the denominator to be such a number, as maye euenly be diuided by the sayd whole number proposed, then diuide it thereby, and sette the quotient of that Diuision for the former denominator: but reserue still the Numerator, and so is the Multiplication ended.
And because will iustly diuide therefore take the quotient of that diuision whiche is and sette in steade of and so the Fraction will be that is Â¼.
Whiche is all one with that woulde haue followed of the other sort of worke.
Nowe then for the other sorte where the number is mixt, take this waye: firste to reduce the sayd whole number, and fraction into one fraction Improper (as shewed you in Reduction) and then multiplie them togither, as if they were proper fractions.
being set to be multiplied by first muste reduce the mixte number, as appeareth in the margent, by multiplying by
and that maketh wherto must adde the Numerator and so the fraction will be whiche nowe shal multiplie after the accustomed forme, and it wil be
Ma You haue done well: and so maye you sÃ©e, that although moste part of the formes of Multiplication maye be wroughte without Reduction, yet some can not, as namelye mixed numbers.
And yet one note more will tell you of Multiplication, before we leaue it: That isÂ· when so euer you woulde multiplye anye Fraction by whiche commonlie is called Duplation, you maye doe it not onlie by doubling the Numeratour, but also by parting the Denominator into halfe, if he be euen.
Then if woulde double may choose whether wil make it, or else
And in dÃ©ede see that all is one, but that the diuiding of the Denominatour seemeth the better waye to make smaller tearmes of the Fraction, and so they shall neede the lesse Reduction.
It is so: and nowe shall not nÃ©ede to tell you that Multiplication is proued by Diuision, and Diuision likewayes by multiplication, but the like workes that shewed you in Multiplication, will shewe you in Diuision also.
WHen any whole number shall be diuided by a Fraction, you must multiplie ye said whole number wyth the Denominator of the fraction, and sette the totall thereof for the newe Numerator, and for the Denominator, let the Numerator of the Fraction.
Then diuided by math wil make as here appeareth: Mayster.
But if you woulde diuide the fraction by the whole number, the~ multiplie the Denominatour by the same
whole number, and sette the totall for the Denominatour, without chaunging the Numerator.
And by the same example you giue me occasion to remember an other briefe way to do the same:
for if you had diuided the sayde Numerator by and sette the quotient for the Numerator, kÃ©eping stil the olde Denominator, it woulde haue bene not only as well done, but also in a fraction of lesser termes.
gesse it to be euen so, by a lyke worke that you taughte me in Multiplication.
And for proofe thereof being the diuidend, and the Deuisour, diuide the Numeratour by and the quotient is whiche sette for ouer thus
And sÃ©e that it is all one with as by diuiding or abbreuing both these tearmes by and so reducing them to their leaste Denomination, maye easilie math proue: as appeareth in this example: M. You co~ceiue it wel.
And if there bÃ©e mixt numbers (either one or both) you must firste reduce that mixte number into an improper Fraction.
If the Denominatours be like, then diuide the Numeratours as if it were in whole nu~bers, and the quotient whether it be Fractio~, whole number, or mixt, is a good quotient for that Diuision.
And generallie if one of the Numerators may iustlie diuide the other, by that quotient multiplie the Denominator of the lesser Numerator, and set it that doeth amounte in the roome of ye same denominator, and then for a Numerator to it, set the denominator of the other fraction.
Then if woulde diuide by sÃ©e that will diuide and the quotient wil be by whiche must multiplie the other that is the Denominator vnder and then it is whiche set for the Denominator and ouer it in steade of the must set the other Denominator, and so is it
And so is in steade of which woulde haue risen by the common math worke: as here appeareth: And now for Mediation (which is to diuide by marke this: If the Numeratour be euen, set the halfe of it in his place without the Diuisour, and so haue you done: and if the Numeratour be not euen, then double the denominator.
Nowe truste that you haue sufficiente knowledge in Reduction, Multiplication, and Diuision: and therefore will goe in hande wyth Addition and Subtraction, whyche nowe will appeare easie ynough.
WHen&soeuer you haue any fractions to be added, you must consider whether they be of one Denomination or notÂ· And if they be of one denomination, then adde the Numerators togither, and set ye that amounteth, for the Numerator ouer the common Denominator, and so you haue done.
The reason is, bicause that suche differ little in Addition or Subtraction from the worke of vulgare denominations, where the Denominators bÃ©e no numbers: as pence and pence, make pence,
But if the fractio~s be not of one denomination, or any of them be mixt of whole nu~bers and fractions, then must you first reduce them to one denomination, and after adde them.
And if they be manye, then adde first two of them, and to the sum that doth amount of the Addition, add the third, and then the fourth, so forth, if you haue so many.
This sÃ©emeth easie ynough, now that haue alreadie learned to multiplie and to reduce, without which two, could neuer haue wrought this.
And therefore now see good reason, why you did place Multiplication and Reduction before Addition.
It is wel considered, but yet refuse not to expresse your vnderstanding of it, by an example.
Then would adde first with and because the Denominators are like (and so nÃ©edeth no Reduction) adde to which maketh and then is my sum that is in smaller numbers
And if haue many numbers to be added, as here firste must reduce them (bycause they haue diuerse denominatours) into one denomination, and then will they bÃ©e thus.
math or in lesse tearmes whiche by Addition do make that is
SVbtraction hathe the same precepts that addition hadde, for if the Denominatours bÃ©e like, then muste you subtracte the one numeratour from the other, and the rest is to be set ouer the common denominator, and so your Subtraction is ended: but and if you haue manye Fractions to be subtracted out of many, then must you reduce them to one denomination, and into two seueral Fractions, that is, all that muste be subtracted into one Fraction, and the residue into an other Fraction, and then worke as sayde bÃ©efore.
Scholer For the first example take to be subtracted out of and the reste will bÃ©e or
For an other example take to be subtracted out of which must reduce, and it wil be thus, and
there resteth which set ouer the common Denominator for a Remayner, thus, that is
Now for the thirde example, take and to be subtracted from and
And bycause their denominators be diuers, do reduce the~ thus,
Also adde the two laste, and they yÃ©eld Then doe subtract out of and there resteth so is the remainer that is in smaller Tearmes,
And thus haue done with Subtraction, excepte you haue any more to teach me.
Mai. Proue one example more of two Fractions of diuers denominations.
Scho take these two Fractions, and which being reduced, wil sta~d thus,
Then maye you perceiue that you mistooke the Fractions: for you ca~ neuer subtract the greater out of the lesser, althoughe you may adde, multiplie or diuide the greater with the lesser.
And albeit that hathe bothe hys tearmes lesser than yet is the lesser Fraction: for generallie if you multiplie ye
that Fraction is the greatest, of whose numerator commeth the greatest summe, as in this example: multiplied by maketh and being multiplyed by yeldeth but therefore is the first Fraction the greatest of these two, so can you not subtract it out of a lesser Fraction.
But and you should subtract a fraction out of a whole number what would you do? Sc Marrie woulde reduce the whole nu~ber into a Fraction of the same Denomination that my Fraction is, and then worke by Subtraction.
So may you doe, but it is easier much, if your fraction be a proper fraction, that is to say, lesse then an Vnite, to take an Vnite fro~ the whole number, and then turne it into an Improper FractionÂ· and so worke your subtraction.
As if woulde subtracte from maye take one from and turne it into from whiche if bate there will remayne And if the firste fraction be an Improper Fraction, then may take so manye Vnites from the whole number, that they may make an improper fraction greater then that firste, and then worke by Subtraction: As if there
be proponed to be subtracted fro~ because is more than and not so much as
then abate and there resteth so the whole remainer is
Or, else you may at your pleasure take whiche is from whole: Then set one vnder
as thus And then to reduce those fractions into one Denomination as math here appeareth: Then from resteth which maketh youre desire: And thus wil make an end of the works of commo~ Fractions for this time, not doubting, but you can applye them both vnto the rules of Progression, and also vnto the Golden rule, without any other teaching the~ you haue learned before, which might sÃ©eme tedious to repeate, saue that in some special diuersities, which be peculiar to Fractions, can not ouerpasse, but instruct you somewhat by the way.
THerefore as touching the Golden rule for the placing of the numbers proponed in the question, wherby to finde the thirde, and for the forme of their worke, with other like notes, refer you to that which you haue alreadie learned.
But this easie forme of working by fractions shal you note, yt if your thrÃ©e numbers bÃ©e fractions, for an apt worke and certain, multiply the Numerator of the first nu~ber in the question, by the Denominator of the seconde: And all that againe multiplie by the denominator of the third number, and the total therof shall you kÃ©epe for to be the Diuisor.
Then multiplie the Denominator of the first number by the Numeratour of the second, and the whole therof by the Numerator of the third, and the totall thereof shall be youre diuidend.
you founde out before, and that number shall be the fourth number of the question whiche you sÃ©eke for: As in this exa~ple.
If of a yard of Veluet cost of a Soueraigne (esteemed at shillings) what shal cost? Scholer.
If it please you to let me make the answere,
woulde first place math these thrÃ©e numbers, as learned in whole numbers thus.
And then according to your newe rule, must multiplie being Numeratour in the first number, by thrÃ©e the Denominatour of the seconde, and thereof commeth which multiplie againe by the Denominatour of the third number, and so haue
which kÃ©epe for the Diuisor, then multiplie the Denominator of the first, by the Numeratour of the seconde, and there riseth whiche againe multiplie by the Numeratour of the thirde, and it maketh then must diuide by and it wil be that is in lesser tearmes, and then the figure wil stand thus.
But what that is in math money, can not tell except shal worke it by Reduction, as you taught me.
It forceth not nowe, you may reduce it when you list, but it were disorderlie done here to mingle diuerse workes togither, where we do not sÃ©eke the value of the thing in common money, but in an apt nu~ber, whiche you haue wel done.
And therefore will yet shew you an other like way of easinesse in worke, how you may chaunge your Fractions into whole numbers, by whyche you shall worke as if the question were proponed in whole numbers.
The first nu~ber you shall finde as taught you: now to finde the diuisor of the seconde number, take the Numerator for the seco~d fraction: and for the third nu~ber take that, that riseth of Multiplication of the Denominatour of the firste, by the Numerator of the thirde, and then worke youre question.
For example hereof, put this question, If of lb waighte of siluer, be worth of a Soueraigne what is of lb. weighte worth? For the aunswere, math first place the Fractions in order thus.
Then to turne these fractions into whole numbers, multiplie whiche is the Numerator of the first, by (yt
denominator of the seconde) and there co~meth whiche multiplie by the Denominator of the third, and so amounteth whiche set for the Diuisor in the first place.
Then in the seconde place set whiche is Numerator in the seconde Fraction, and in the third place set the summe that amounteth of being the Denominator in the firste number, multiplyed by being numeratour in the third number, so the figure math wil stand as here you sÃ©e.
Then to worke it forth, multiplie by and there amounteth which diuide by and the quotient wil be or in lesser termes, and then the math figure wil stand thus.
These ij. formes nowe you vnderstand wel ynough And as for any other, at this time will not repeate, onlie this shall you marke for ye profe of this rule, whether your worke be well wrought or no.
Multiplie the first number by the fourthe, and note what amounteth:
then multiplie the seconde by the third, and marke what amounteth also Now if those two nu~bers so amounting be equall, then is youre work wel done, else you haue erred.
but in the barker rule, this shal you note for ease of worke, that you multiplie the Numerator of the first by the Numerator of the second, and ye whole thereof by the Denominator of the third, and that amounteth therof, shal be the Diuidend.
Then multiplie the Denominator of the first by the Denominator of the seconde, and that whole by the Numerator of the third, that riseth therof shall be the diuisor.
Example of this: did lende my friend of a Porteguise vij. monthes, vpon promise that he should doe as much for me againe:
and when shoulde borow of him he coulde lende me but of a Porteguise, now demaund how long time must kÃ©epe his money in iuste recompence of my lone, accompting monethes in the yeare? Scholer The first number must be the first money borowed, that is of the Porteguise: the second number the monethes, that is of a yeare: and the thirde number the money that was lent in recompence, that is of a Porteguise: then set the numbers math thus.
Then (as you taught me) multiplie thrÃ©e (being Numeratour in the firsts
number) by the Numerator of the seconde number, and it maketh which multiplie by the denominator of the so haue for the diuide~t: the~ multiply ye denominator of the first, by the denominator of the second, and it yÃ©eldeth
whiche multiplie agayne by the Numeratour of the third, and it will make that is the Diuisor.
Then must diuide by so it wil be in ye smallest fractio~, of a yeare.
And this doe you sÃ©e some ease in working, better than to multiplie and diuide tediously so many Fractions.
An other question yet will propose, to the intent you may sÃ©e thereby the reason of the statute of assise of bread and ale, which in al Statute bookes in Frenche, Latine and Englishe,
is muche corrupted for wa~t of knowledge in this art: for the right vnderstanding whereof propone this question.
When the price of a quarter of Wheate is the farthing white lofe shal wey
then demaunde, what shall such a Loafe weye, when a quarter of Wheate is solde for Scho.
This Question must be wroughte as it is proponed in whole numbers and not
You sÃ©eme to say reasonably, how be it, in that Statute of Assise, the rate is made by the proportion of parts in a pound weight Troie, else could it not be a Statute of anye long continuaunce, sÃ©eing the shillinges doe chaunge often, as all other monies doe: but this Statute being well vnderstanded, is a continuall rule for euer, as will anon declare by a new table of Assise, conuerting the shillinges into vnces and parts of vnces.
Therfore here by a shilling you must vnderstand of a pound weight, and so by pence of an vnce, wherefore although ye mighte worke this question proponed by whole nu~ber well ynough, for ye time when the statute was made, yet to applie it to our time, and to make it to serue for all tymes generallye it is best to worke it by fractio~s, setting for shilling and for shillings, and so for thrÃ©e shillings and then will the figure of the question stand thus.
math In which question because all the denominators be like, you shal worke onely with the numerators Sc.
Then shall multiplie by wherof commeth which if diuide by the
quotient will be but how shal make a Fraction of that to stand with the other? Ma.
Haue you so soone forgotte~ what was taught you so lately? This is his forme.
remember it now and then math it signifieth twentie parts, and the third deale of one twentie part.
So is it, and that maketh in shillings, wherby you may note one greate error in the Statute bookes, which haue constantly in that Assise.
And by this rule, if you examine the Statute you shall finde many summes false, wherefore for the true vnderstanding of that statute and suche lyke as haue made mention of it, and somwhat recognised it, so doe wish that al gentleme~ and other studentes of the lawes, would not neglect this arte of Arithmetike as vnnÃ©edefull to their studies.
Wherfore to encourage them thereto, and to gratifie both them and all other in generall, will exhibite a Table of that part of ye statute in two columnes, and in a third columne wil ad the correction of those errors which haue crept into it.
The vveight of a farthing vvhite lofe by the statute bookes.
In the common bokes there is no farther rate of assise made, than vnto the quarter of wheate: but in an auncie~t copie of years olde (which haue) there is added the rate of assise vnto the quarter, but yet was yt assise also eyther wrong cast at ye first pe~ning, or els corrupt sith that time, for lacke of iuste knowledge in the rule of proportion, whiche wil adde here also, to gratifye suche as be desyrous to vnderstande truth exactlye.
The vveight of the farthing vvhite lofe by the statute bokes.
These tables haue set seuerall, because no man should think that would either ad or take away fro~ any law those parts which might of right sÃ©em either superfluous eyther diminute, but yet may not be so curious as to neglect manifest errors, which is not only my part, but euery good Subiects dutie with sobrietie to correct.
And for auoiding of offe~ce haue rather don it in this priuate booke rather than in any booke of ye statutes self, trusting that all men will take it in good parte.
would wish so, but dare not hope so sith neuer good man yt would reforme error, could escape ye venemous to~gs of enuious detractors, which because they either cannot or list not to do any good the~selues, do delight to bark at yt doinges of other, but besÃ©eke you to stay nothing for their peruerse behauiour.
co~sider many things yt some may obiect, wherevnto am not vnprouided of iust answers, but wil not sÃ©em so hasty to make ye answers before heare their obiectio~s, but as trust that men are of a bettter nature, more grateful now tha~ som hath bin in time passed, as haue don in ye statute of Assise for bread in rate of so wil set forth the like table in pounds ounces, the parts thereof,
that it may be easilie applyed to all tymes: but mean not by this to alter any word of the statute (being so good an ordina~ce, of so great continuance) but onely to make it as a kind of expositio~ declaratio~ of ye said statut, trusting yt therby ye statute may be better vndersta~d, conseque~tly better put in executio~.
yt haue accounted the shillings after the rate of to the pou~d weight, bicause estÃ©em it ye most apt rate for our time.
Wherfore if in ye first column you find ye price of wheat, directly against it in ye second column, you may find ye weight of the farthing white lofe, in this our time: if you double yt number (as haue done in ye thirde columne) then haue you the weight of ye half pe~ny white lofe so in ye fourth column is set ye weight of ye pe~ny white lofe.
It nÃ©edeth not to tel you that, yt the sight doth testifie, how ye euery colu~n is parted into smaller pillers, wherof ye first colu~ne hath these titles, pou~des, shillings, pennies: ye other columnes haue ech of the~ these titles, pounds, vnces, pe~nie weights.
And as in the first colu~ne xij make a make a pounde, so in the other columes pence weighte maketh an vnce. and xij ounces doe make a pounde.

Sir, doe thanke you most hartily for this, not only in mine owne name and in the name of all Studentes, but also in the name of the whole Commons, to whom the restitution of this Assise (I trust) shall bring restitution of the weight in breade, whiche long time hath bene abused.
And if you know any like thinges more, wherein you woulde vouchsafe to declare the errors and set forth the truth, you cannot but obtain great tha~ks of all good harted men that loue the common wealth.
haue sundrie thinges to declare but haue reserued them for a priuate booke by it selfe, yet notwithstanding because the statute of the rate of measuring of ground is so common that it toucheth all men, and yet no more common than nÃ©edefull, but so muche corrupt, that it is to farre out of all good rate, not only in the Englishe bookes of Statutes commonlye printed, but also in the Latine bookes, and in the Frenche also, for haue read of eche sorte, and conferred them dilige~tlye, will giue you a Table for the restitution of those errours, as maye suffise for this present time.
And first will propose one question to you touching the vse of that Statute,
whereby you maye perceiue the order how to examine the whole Statute,
When the Acre of grounde doth contayne foure perches in breadth, then must it contayne perches in length: then doe demaunde of you, howe much shall the length of an Acre be, when there is in the breadth of it perches? but before you shall aunswere to this question, will declare vnto you an other Statute, whiche is the grounde of the former Statute.
It is ordayned that Barlye Cornes, drye and rounde, shall make vp the measure of an inche: ynches shal make a foote,
and foote shall make a yarde (the common English bookes haue an elne) fiue yardes and a halfe shall make a perche, and perches in length, and in breadth, shall make an Acre.
This is that statute: whereby you may perceiue that the intent of the Statute is,
As perceiue by the wordes of that Statute, a perche to be of an Acre, so could make those numbers all in Frations,
and so worke the question: but sÃ©eing may doe it also in whole numbers take that forme for the moste easie, math therefore thus set the question in forme.
Then doe multiplie by and it maketh which diuide by and the quotient is
Now turne that into the common partes of a perche, as they be named in the former Statute: how be it, it shall be best to take one of the least partes in Denomination for auoyding of much labour, as fÃ©ete, whereof the perche contayneth
Then to turne into feete, Multiplye by and it maketh whiche muste diuide by and the Quotiente is
So finde that if the acre holde in breadth xiij perches it shall containe in le~gth perches, foote, and of a foote, which is not fully an ynche, for the ynche is of a foote.
But here all the Statute Bookes in Latine and Englishe (that haue sÃ©ene) doe note it to be perches, foote and inche: which maketh aboue perches to many in the acre, so that woulde haue thoughte the
errour to haue crept into the printed bookes by the great neglige~ce that Printers in our time doe vse, saue that in written Copies of great antiquitie, doe find the same.
Yet haue one frenche Copie, which hath perches and one foote, and that misseth verye little of the truth.
Then sÃ©e it is true that haue ofte~ heard say, that the truest copies of ye statutes be the Frenche copies.
That is often true, but not generally, as haue by conference tried diuerslye: but in this statute the frenche booke is most corrupt in all other places lightlye.
But now to performe my promise will set forth the Table for measuring of an Acre of ground onely by suche partes as the Statute doth mention, because at this time doe of purpose write it for the better vnderstanding of the statute, and hereafter with other thinges intende to set forth this same more at large.
In this Table following, haue not done as in the other statute before co~pared by restitution with the faults crept into the Statute, but onely haue written that true measure, which the equitie of the Statute doeth
For it were to vile to iudge of so noble Princes and worthie Councellors, as haue authorised set forth this statute, that they would make one acre in any form greater than an other, but euery one to be iust and equall with ech other, which is the grounde also of my worke, and hereby maye all men perceiue how nÃ©edefull Arithmetick is vnto the Studentes of the law.
But now think best to make an end of these matters for this present time, sith the table hath in it none obscuritie, that should nÃ©ede to declare.
The breadth The length of the acre. perde. perde. feete.
In deede Sir, vnderstand the Table (as thinke) by those other whiche you sette forth before.
For in the first Columne is set the perches of the breadth of any Acre, and then in the columnes following appeareth how many perches and how many foote the same Acre must haue for his length Ma.
You take it well: how be it to speake exactly of breadth length, the first columne doth sometime betoken the breadth: sometime the length,
for properly the longest side of any square doth limit his length, and the shorter side doth betoke~ the breadth, yet it is no great abuse in such tables, where a man cannot well change the title, to let the name remayne, although the proportions of the numbers doe chaunge: for still by the first columne, is expressed the measure of the one side, and by the two other pillers in one Columne, is set forth the measure of the other side.
And this shall be sufficient now for the vse of the golden Rule.
NOwe somewhat will touch certaine other rules, which for theyr seuerall names maye sÃ©eme diuerse rules distinct from this, but in dÃ©ede they are but braunches of it: yet bicause they haue not onelie seueral workings in appearance, but also pleasant in vse, will giue you a taste of eche of them.
As for the rule of Felowshippe, both single and double, with time and without time, shall nÃ©ede to saye little more than haue alreadie sayde in teaching the workes of whole numbers, yet an example or .ij. wil we haue to refresh the remembraunce of the same, and to declare certaine proper vses and applications of it, as this for one.
Foure men get a bootie or prise in time of warre, the prise is in value of money lb
and bicause ye men be not of like degree, therfore their shares may not be equall, but the chiefest person wil haue of the bootie the third part, and the tenth parte ouer: the second will haue a quarter and the tenth part ouer: ye third
will haue the sixt part: and so there is lefte for the fourth man a verie smal portion but such is his lot, (whether he be pleased or wrothe) he must be content with one xx. parte of the praye.
Now demaunde of you, what shall euerie man haue to his share? Sch.
You must be faine to answere to your owne question, else is it not like to be aunswered at this time.
The forme to vnderstande the solution of this question, and all suche like, is this:
Reduce al the Denominators into one number by Multiplication, except that anye of them be partes of some other of them, for al suche partes you may ouerpasse, and take for them all those numbers, whose parts they be: as in this example the shares be these if multiplie al the Denominatours togither, beginning with and so go on vnto it will make but considering that is a part of shall ommitte that and likewayes whiche is a part of maye ouerpasse also, and then is there but denominatours to multiplie, that is and whiche make whiche summe take for my worke, bycause all the Denominatours wil be founde in it.
partes of it as the question importeth, that is for the firste man, the is the is whiche put in one summe for the firste mans share, and it maketh
Then for the seconde mans share, take Â¼, whiche is and whiche is and that maketh in the whole
Now for the thirde man whiche muste haue take And for the fourth man there remayneth but whiche is of the whole summe: so that if the whole pray had bene but lb. then were the question answered: but bicause the summe was of greater value, by this meanes nowe shall know the partition of it.
must set my nu~bers by the order of the Golden rule, putting in the firste place the number that founde by multiplying the Denominatours, and in the seconde place the summe of the bootie.
And looke what proportion is betwÃ©ene the firste number and that seconde, the same proportion shall be betwÃ©ene the partes of that first number and the partes of the seconde, comparing eache to his like.
Therefore muste put in the thirde place, one of the partes or shares, and then worke by the former rule of proportion or Golden rule.
haue seueral partes of the first number, by which would finde out like partes of the seconde number, therefore muste make seueral figures.
Nowe truste can aunswere to your question, as by your fauoure wyll proue. math
And to trie it, set the figures thus, marked with A, B, C, D, to shewe their order.
And then in eache of them multiplie the seconde number by the thirde, and diuide their totall by the first, and so amounteth the fourth sum whiche sÃ©eke for, for if do multiply by it maketh whiche being diuided by maketh in the quotient for the first mans portion: And so workyng with the other thrÃ©e figures, find for the second man Â½, and for the third ma~ and then for the fourth man Â½.
euerie mans share set forth in the figure here annexed. math And thus thinke haue done wel. Ma.
If you misdoubte your working and liste to proue it, adde all the shares togither: and if they make the totall, the~ sÃ©emeth it wel done.
maye sette them thus: math and then by Addition the iuste summe doeth amounte, that is and therefore (as you saye) it sÃ©emeth to be wel wrought.
But besÃ©eche you, is there anye doubte in this tryall, that you vse that word,
You maye easilie coniecture, that if you did assigne the firste mans share to the laste, and so chaunge all the rest, that
one had an others share, yet woulde the Addition appeare al one, and therfore is not the proofe exact.
But if you wyl make a iuste proofe for the firste mans parte take of the whole sum, and if it agrÃ©e with the number in the figure, then it is well done.
And so doe for the seconde, thirde, and fourth summes, and this proofe faileth not.
Nowe will propounde certaine other questions whiche haue bene sette foorth by certaine learned men, albeit not without some ouersighte whiche questions protest heartilie doe not repeate to depraue those good men, whose labours and studies muche prayse and greatelie delighte in, but onelye according to my profession, to sÃ©eke oute trueth in all thinges, and to remoue all occasions of errour, as muche as in me lyeth: and for that cause will onelie name the questions wythout hurting the Authours name.
Foure men did builde a house, whiche coste them crownes, their shares were such, that one man should pay of the summe, and crownes ouer: the seconde should pay and crownes ouer: the third man must lay out
abating crownes and the fourth ma~ shold pay Â¼, and crownes more, ca~ you answere to this question? Sc No in good faith sir, and that you knowe best of anye man, for knowe no more than you haue taught me.
Then dare say you can not doe it neither yet the best learned man that euer did propose it, for the question is impossible:
for declaration whereof wil be bolde to vse first the representation of the nu~bers in their aptest form, (Although haue not yet taught you that manner of worke) bicause it maye apppeare plainelie that the question is not possible, for here haue math set the parts, and added them, and they make the whole summe and and more.
Now howe is it possible to diuide truely either gaines eyther charges so, that the particulars shall be more than the total.
It is against the forme of proofe by Addition of partes.
shal perceiue it the better, math wil trie it after the vulgare forme, as in this figure you see where the with ouer is for the totall is as you heard before the and the more, is the woulde be but then abating it is but and then laste of al, the is and the more maketh which al being added in one summe, doe make where the totall summe shoulde be but which sum if you diuide by so shall you haue of it, that is and thereto adde more, then wil those summes make math wherby you may see how this forme as well as the other, doeth declare that the particulars in that question woulde make more than the whole sum by Â¼, and more: and therefore can that question not be accepted as a possible thing, but yet doe certayne learned men propound suche questions, and aunswere to them.
Therefore somwhat to say to their excuse rather of their good meaning than for their doing, will anone declare what may be saide for their defence:
but in the meane season will propounde the question as it may be wrought by good possibilitie.
As if foure men build a house togither, and it cost them crownes, and then for the partition they agrÃ©e thus: that as often as the firste man doth paye crownes, so often the seconde shall paye foure, the third man and the fourth man thrÃ©e.
Or els thus: that the firste man shall pay double so muche as the fourth, and the seconde man shall paye of the firste mans charge: the third manne shall pay double so much as the second: (And these two wayes are to one ende) but further for their agrÃ©ement it is appointed also, that the firste man shal giue crownes ouerplus, and the seconde and the fourth shal giue but the third man shal giue no ouerplus, but shal haue crownes abated of his charge.
Now is the question possible to be assoyled, and this is the way to doe it.
and set out small numbers in that rate, by whiche you may reduce the worke to the Golden rule, as here in the first forme, the nu~bers are alredie named, and in the seconde forme, although they be not plainly named, yet they may be the same nu~bers: for is double to
Now adde these togither and they make whiche must be set in the first number in the Golden rule: for if it with the ouerplus of eache mans charge woulde make the totall su~ of the charges, the~ were those seueral sums the charges of ech man, besids his ouerplus: but now it is not so.
But yet this is true, that looke what proportion each of these seuerall sums doth beare to the same proportion doth the iust charges of euerie man (beside his ouerplus) beare to the totall of the charges, the ouerplus being deducted: wherfore this maye you note, that before you do apply the total of the charges to the Golden rule: you must deducte the ouerplus whiche is and that is in the whole but then must be restored for the abatement of the thirde man, and then remaineth to be deducted Take therfore out of and there will reste whiche must set in the Golden rule for the seconde summe: and for the third summe must put ech of the smal numbers before me~tioned, whiche although they be not the seuerall charges, yet they represent them in proportion.
charge a seuerall question, the figures wil be which marke with foure letters, a. b. c. d. thus.
math Where haue set for briefnesse the summe of euerie mans charge in the fourthe place, presupposing that you can tel how to trie out that fourth sum by so many examples as yÃ©e haue had.
As truste that vnderstand thys fourme, so desire muche to knowe what maye be saide for the~ that mistooke this question.
You sÃ©eme so desirous to know this errour, that you haue forgotten to examine whether this worke bee wythoute Scholer.
MÃ©e sÃ©emeth this worke to bÃ©e well done, bycause the Addition of the seuerall numbers doth make the totall summe
of whiche was to be diuided into suche foure parts.
But then haue you forgotten that the firste man must pay crownes more besides this share, and the seconde man twelue crownes more: the third ma~ crownes lesse: and the fourthe man crownes more, for without these, your first total of crownes wil not be made.
Then must adde to the first mans summe more, and it wil be and to the second summe must adde and it wil be from the thirde summe muste abate and then wil the sum be then adding vnto the summe it will be and these sums will make whiche is the whole charge, as in this example it maye appeare, where firste math gather the
that maketh and so procÃ©ede in the Addition to the end.
Nowe haue you wel done, and this worke in the same sums is brought of other learned men for the true solution of the question as it was first proponed, which as (I saide) was impossible: and nowe examine it by these seuerall
summes, and sÃ©e whether it do agrÃ©e with the summes in the question proponed.
The first man must pay and ouer of the total sum: how thinke you, is the halfe and more of Sc.
No that it is not, for it would be and for the second man and for ye thirde man and for the fourth ma~ wherof not one summe agrÃ©eth to this worke.
But maruaile that so wise me~ could be so much ouersÃ©ene.
It is commonlie sÃ©ene, that when men wil receiue things from elder writers, and will not examine the thing they sÃ©eme rather willing to erre with their auncients for companie, than to be bolde to examine theyr workes or writings, which scrupulosity hath ingendered infinite errours in all kindes of knowledge, and in all ciuill administration, and in euerie kinde of arte: but these learned men did not meane anye other thing by this question, than to finde suche numbers as shoulde beare the same proportion togither, as those numbers in the question proponed did beare one to an other: whiche thing you shal perceiue more plainelie by an other question of theirs, that is this.
man lying vpon his death bed, bequeatheth his goods (whiche were worthe Crownes) in this sorte.
Bycause his wife was great with childe, and he yet vncertain whether the childe were a male or female, he made his bequest conditionally, that if his wife bare a daughter, then should the wife haue halfe his goods, and the daughter but if she were deliuered of a sonne, then that son should haue of the goods, and his wife but
Nowe it chaunced hir to bring forth both a son and a daughter, the question is: How shal they part the goods agrÃ©eable to the testatour his wil. Scholer.
If some cunning Lawyers hadde this matter in scanning, they woulde determine this Testamente to be quite voide, and so the man to die intestate, because the testament was made insufficient, sith this condition was not expressed in it, and also it might haue chaunced that she shoulde haue brought forth neither sonne nor daughter, as often hath bene seene: so is the will vnsufficiente in that point also.
Suche scanners shoulde sÃ©eme to cunning, and yet not so cunning as cruel: for the minde of the Testatour is to be taken fauorablie,
for the aid of ye legatories whe~ there riseth such doubts.
But let vs trie this work, not by force of lawe, but by proportion Geometricall, sÃ©eing the testatour did minde to prouide for each sort of them.
If the sonne shal haue by force of the Testament, so must the mother haue
Again because she hath a daughter also, therefore ought she to haue and the daughter that is both wayes and whiche commeth to the whole goods, and more.
In this matter the minde of the Testatour is so to be vnderstande, that suche proportion shoulde be betwÃ©ene the portion of the wife and the sonne, as is betwÃ©ene and that is, the sonne muste haue for to his mother, so shall he haue to that is as much as his mother, and half as much more: and the mother muste haue the like rate in comparison to hir daughter.
Then muste finde out numbers in suche proportion, that the firste may be as muche as the second, and halfe as muche more (that is) in proportion sesquialtera, and the seconde to the thirde in the same proportion, suche numbers be
pray you sir, how shal find out those numbers? M. That wil gladly tel you.
Whatsoeuer the proportion be of any thrÃ©e numbers, multiplie the Termes of that proportion togither and the number that amou~teth, shall be the middle number of the the~ multiple that middle number by the lesser tearme, and diuide that totall by the greater, and the least number of the will amounte.
So if you multiplie that middle number by the greater extreame, and diuide that total by the lesser extreme, then wil the greatest number of that progression amount.
Then in this example, to finde the proportion of to muste diuide (as you taught me in Diuision) by the quotient will be Â½, that is Â½, whereby perceiue that the proportion in this question is, as to
Therefore (as you taughte me euen nowe) multiplie by and the summe is which must be the middle number: then multiply the middle number by which is the least terme, and the summe is that doe diuide by being the greater Terme, and the quotient is so is the leaste number of the
commeth and that diuide by and so haue which is the greatest number of the
An other way yet maye you finde the third number in any progression, if you haue of them: for if the middle number be one of them which you haue, then multiplie it by it self (as in this example by maketh and that totall diuide by the other number which you haue, and the third number will be the quotient.
Then if diuide (which commeth of multiplied by it selfe) by the quotient will be if diuide by the quotient will be
But what if knowe the first nu~ber and the thirde, and would haue the middle number? May.
Multiplie the two numbers togither, and in their totall you must sÃ©eke the roote of that number, and it shall be the middle number: but because as yet you haue not learned how to extract rootes, therfore vse the first forme which haue taught you, till teache you to extract rootes.
And now go forwarde with the aunswere to the same question.
perceiue then that the son muste not haue of the goods, neither the mother nor yet the daughter but yet muste the goods be diuided in suche proportion, that the sonne shall haue crownes for to hys mother: and the mother shal haue crownes for euerie to the daughter.
Then applie it to the Golden rule in thrÃ©e math examples thus: where the firste number is the Additio~ of those thrÃ©e numbers and the thirde is one of them seuerallie: the seconde is the totall of the goods in the testament: then by the worke of the Golden rule finde out ye fourth number in euerie work that is for the sonne for the mother math and for the daughter which thrÃ©e summes added togither do make the su~ of the whole goods, as may be sÃ©ene by this example.
And this (me thinketh) doe perceiue, that bicause in this case ther is a necessary remedy diuised againste an vrgente inconuenience,
therfore those lerned me~ thoght they might vse the like liberty in that other question.
Maister Your gesse is good, but they had so good reason for them in the one, as they haue in the other: as in another example of theirs, it may better appeare, that is this:
sons crownes, to be parted in this sorte, that the firste sonne should haue Â½, the second sonne and the third sonne Â¼, which is not possible, for doth make or that is so is it more than the whole: but reduce these fractions into one denominatio~, the least that they wil come to, and they wil be and so may you part the goods in such proportion as these Numeratours beare togither: that is, the firste to haue for euery to the seconde: and the seconde to haue as ofte~ as the third hath and so their portions wil be for the firste, for the second and for the thirde and those shares added togither, math will make the totall summe of the whole goodes, as you may easily sÃ©e in this example Another question is there proponed thus:
There is Crownes to be diuided bewÃ©en men, so that the first man must haue the second man Â¼, the thirde man shall haue
maruaile that anye manne should be so ouerseene to propound that question as a thing possible, sith Â½Â· Â¼Â· doe make that is almost double the whole summe.
But perceiue it might be thus proponed, that as often as the first man did receyue Crownes, so often the second man should receyue and the third man for is equall to and so is equall to and is and so working the question, the figures will appeare in this forme: whereby the firste mannes math portion is founde to bÃ©e the seconde mannes parte is the third mans share is which in ye whole doth make crounes yt was the whole summe to be diuided betwÃ©ene them.
And thus you are (I thinke) sufficiently instructed in the rule of Felowship.
NOw will go in ha~d with the rule of Alligatio~,
which hath his name, for that by it there are diuers parcels of sundrie prices, and su~dry quantities alligate bou~d or mixed togither, whereby also it mighte be well called the rule of mixture, and it hath great vse in composition of medicines, and also in mixtures of metals, and some vse it hath in medicines of wines, but wish it were lesse vsed therein than it is now a dayes.
When any summes are proponed to be mixed, set them in order one ouer an other, and the common number wherevnto you will reduce them, set on the left hand, then marke what summes be lesser than that common number, and whiche bÃ©e
greater and with a draught of your perme, euermore linke numbers togither, so that one bee lesser than the common number, and the other greater than hee, for two greater or two smaller can not well be linked togither, and the reason is this, that one greater one smaller may bee so mixed, that they wil make the meane or common number very wel, but lesser can neuer make so many as the common number, being taken orderly: no more can two summes greater than the meane, neuer make the meane in due order as it shal apeare better to you hereafter.
And as it is of necessity to lynke euery smaller (once at the leaste) with one greater, and euerye greater with one smaller: so it is at libertie to linke them oftner than once, and so may there bÃ©e to one question many solutions.
When you haue so linked them, then marke how muche eche of the lesser numbers is smaller than the meane or commo~ number, and that differe~ce set against the greter numbers which be linked with those smaller eche with his match still on the right hande, likewise the excesse of the greater numbers aboue the meane, you shall set before the lesser numbers which bÃ©e combined with them.
bring all these differences into one summe, which shal bÃ©e the first number in the Golden rule: and the seconde number shal be the whole masse that you wil haue of al those particulers: the thirde summe shal be ech difference by it selfe and then by them shall bÃ©e founde the fourth number, declaring the iust portion of euery particular in that mixture.
one of a gallon, an other of the thirde of and the fourth if pens the galon, of al these wines would haue a mixture made to the summe of fiftie galons, and so that the price of eche galon may be pens.
Now demande howe much must bÃ©e taken of euery sort of wine? Scholer.
If it shall please you to worke the first example, that may marke the applying of it to the rule, then trust shall be able not only to doe the like, but also to sÃ©e reason in the order of the worke.
Marke then this forme and the placing of euery kinde of number in it. math
Here (you sÃ©e) haue sette downe the seuerall prices which be and haue linked together with and with
The common price haue set on the lefte side: And the difference betwÃ©ene it, and euery particular price, haue set on the right hand not against the summe, whose differe~ce it is, but against the summe that it is linked withall: so the difference of aboue is which haue set not against but against that is linked with and the difference betweene and (that is haue set against
So likewise ye difference betwene and is but that haue set against and ye difference of aboue (which is haue set against
Then adde all those difference, and they make which sette for the first number in the Golden rule: the seconde number make which is the
summe of gallons that woulde haue, and the thirde summe is euerie particular difference.
Nowe if you worke by the Golden rule, you shall finde the number of Gallons that shall be taken of eache sorte of wine: For the better distinction whereof, haue sette these letters abcd both agaynste the numbers for which the workes do serue, and ouer the workes also, whiche seuerallye serue for eache of them.
And nowe if you liste to examine the truthe of these workes, adde those foure summes togither,
and they wyl make fiftie, that is the math totall whiche would haue, as by this example you may easily perceiue.
And for to proue how ye prices do agrÃ©e, doe this.
Multiplie this totall summe by the common price and it will make then kÃ©epe that summe by it selfe, and afterward Multiplie euerie seuerall summe of Gallons, by the price belonging to the same Gallons, and if that summe doe agrÃ©e with this, whiche you haue kepte firste,
As here, is the number of gallons of price, multiplie then by and it maketh whiche you shall set downe: math then multiplie by which is the price for ye number of Gallons, and it will make so again multiplied by doth make
And these added togither doe make as in the example annexed you may sÃ©e: wherefore sÃ©eing it doth agrÃ©e with the former sum of multiplyed by may iustlie affirme this worke to bÃ©e good and wel done.
And now to proue how you can do the like, propounde the same question, only willing you to vse some other forme of combining or linking the summes.
That shall proue with your fauoure, and therefore combine with and with and then the forme wyll be as foloweth:
math whereby amounteth the same summe in totall of the differences, as did before: and yet nowe the differences be altered, as the combination is chaunged, whereof vnderstande the reason by your former worke.
And therfore here appeareth no straunge thing, but that nowe muste haue gallons, of sixe pence and gallons of and gallons and of and so consequently math gallons and of so ye multiplying by it maketh and the~ multiplied by maketh likewise multiplyed by yÃ©elded and multiplied by maketh whiche foure summes added in one, will yÃ©elde in the totall whiche agrÃ©eth wyth the Multiplication of (being the total summe

hadde minded to haue combined them in more varietie, but am content to sÃ©e your owne worke firste, and then more varieties in combination maye followe anone.
Then to continue as beganne, sÃ©eke the difference betwÃ©ene and (which is and that set against then againste set whiche is the excesse of aboue so gather the difference betwÃ©ene and whiche is and that set against bicause it is combined with and likewise the difference of aboue (which is set against

Then for tryall hereof, multiplie euerie parcell by his seuerall price, as whiche is the summe of Almondes, multiplie by whiche is their price.
Also the summe of Ginger multiplie by which is the price of it.
And so each other in his kind, as this table annexed doeth represent: and then adding them altogither, finde the total to be which also will amounte by the multiplication of the grosse masse of by the common price wherefore it appeareth wel wrought.
Nowe will make the Alligation to proue your cunning somewhat better: but bycause you shall not thinke your selfe pressed so much, will also note the differences, as in this example you may sÃ©e.

And because of ease for you, in an other columne haue set the differences reduced into one number, for

And as for the proofe, trie it at more leysure, because yt time now is short, and you sufficientlie instructed in that proofe.
And there resteth diuerse things behinde yet, of whiche woulde gladlie giue you some taste before our departure.
But if it may please you to lette me sÃ©e al the variations of this question, before you go from it, for me thinketh could varie it two or three wayes more yet.
am content to sÃ©e you make two or thrÃ©e variations, but would be loth to stay to sÃ©e al the variations, for it may be varied aboue wayes although manye of them would not wel serue to this purpose.
of this rule may be varied aboue wayes, but woulde haue you forget suche fantasies, till a time of more leysure.
And now go forward with some variation of this question.
For the first variation, linke the first number with and and combine with and then ioine wyth and as in this forme. math And so doeth there appeare the portion of weight for euery kind of drugge in this mixture.
Nay stay there, you shal not nÃ©ed to make triall in one example so often, or if you liste to do it by your selfe, am content.
But nowe sette foorth (for declaration that you conceiue the rule) two or thrÃ©e examples of seueral combinations, and then will wÃ©e
and then will we passe to some other example and so ende this rule.
And these be the varieties in whiche as the math combinations are seuerall, so doth it plainely appeare, that the differences by whyche the proportion of eache seuerall kinde is taken, are also seuerall.
And yet sÃ©e in the thrÃ©e first of these fiue varieties, and in one other, before, the totall summe of the differences to
be one, that is to say whereby perceiue that the varietie of their mixture doth depend of the varietie of their differences seuerall, and not of the varietie of their totall summe.
And sÃ©eing you conceiue it so well, will make an ende of thys rule, onely exhibiting to you one question or two of the mixture of metalles, that by it you may deuise other like, and exercise your self therein also, bicause the vse of it serueth often in businesse of charge, not so much for Goldsmithes, as for coynage in mintes.
If a Mintemaister haue golde of karectes, and some of karectes, some of Againe, some of some of and some of karectes, and would mixe them so, that he might haue ounces of karects, howe much shal he take of euery sorte? Scholer.
You haue wrought the question well, but howe chaunced you made no doubt of that newe name, Karecte? Scholer.
Because thoughte it out of time to demaund suche questions now, sÃ©eing you make so much haste to ende: and againe in this case the proportion of the numbers is sufficient for my purpose in this worke, trusting, that an other time you will instructe me as wel of this, as of sundry other things, which haue heard you talke~ of, so haue a great desire to knowe them.
Your aunsweare is reasonable: and your request and trust with Gods helpe intende to satisfie.
And to goe forwarde with this matter, let me sÃ©e your examination of this last worke.
all the particular summes as math they appeare in the worke, and they make as here by their Addition it doth appeare.
And so it seemeth, that the summes are well gathered, but for the farther triall of them, multiplye first

And by yÃ©eldeth likewise by bringeth forth and last of al multiplyed by yÃ©eldeth whiche summes all ioined togither make that doeth agree with the like summe before: wherefore may well saye, that the worke is good.
And nowe if it please you would sette forth some varieties of this question, to proue my witte.
math And more yet coulde make, but not like is the number that you spake of in the variation of the other question.
That will teache you at more leisure, sÃ©eing it is a thing rather of pleasure, than of any necessitie.
But nowe for youre exercise in this rule, one other question will propose.

To finde math out that sette the numbers thus in order.

This is well done of you, therefore nowe make thrÃ©e or foure variaties, and so an ende of this rule.
And by these it appeareth, that you can find out more, with which wil not nowe meddle, saue onely for to shewe you an easie help in drawing the lines of Combination, wil set forth two varieties here.
math And this shall suffise now for the rule of Alligation or mixture, for by these examples may you easily coniecture suche other as doe appertaine to it, as wel for the due working, as for variety of drawing the lines of combination.
Sir, albeit it pleased you ere while, to put me from my musing at the manifolde varieties, that may fall in these combinations, and termed them fa~tasies, yet my fantasie giueth me, that the consideration of this shoulde in many other examples and cases of importance be very nÃ©edefull, and the knowledge of it most profitable.
Therefore ye may wel thinke, that at another time conuenient will request you to aide me hÃ©erein.
Truth it is, that this consideration may fall in practise as wel Politicke, as Philosophicall, and sundrie wayes in them
be applyed, therefore when time shall fall for the discussing of this consideration, you shal not want my helping hande.
NOwe wil briefly also teach you somwhat of the rule of Falshod, whiche beareth hys name,
not for that it teacheth any fraude or Falshoode, but for that by false numbers taken at all aduentures, it teacheth howe to finde those true numbers that you sÃ©eke for.
So might any other rule be called the rule of Falshoode, for they worke by wrong numbers, and by them finde out the right numbers, so doth the rule of Alligation, the rule of Felowship, and the Golden rule partely.
Felowship, the rule of Alligation, although the numbers that you worke by, be not the true numbers that you sÃ©eke for, yet are they numbers in iuste proportion, and are founde by orderly worke: whereas in this rule, the numbers are not take~ in any proportion, nor founde by orderly worke, but taken at all aduentures.
And therefore sometimes being with my friends, and talking of suche questions, haue caused them that proponed suche questions to call vnto them suche children or ideots, as happened to be in the place, and to take their answeare, declaring, that would make them solue those questions, that semed so doubtfull.
And indÃ©ede did answeare to the question and worke the triall thereof also, by those answeares which they happened at al aduentures to make: which numbers sÃ©eing they be taken as manifest false, therefore is this rule called the rule of false positions, and for briefnesse, the rule of Falshode, which rule for readinesse of remembrance, haue comprised in these few Verses following, in form of an obscure Riddle.
Gesse at this worke as happe doth leade, By chaunce to truth you may proceede.
And firste worke by the question, Although no truth therein be done.
Such falsehoode is so good a grounde, That truth by it wil soone bee founde.
From many bate to many mo, From to fewe take to fewe also.
In crosse waies multiply contrarie kinde, All truth by falsehoode for to finde.
The sense of these Verses, and the summe of this rule, is this: When any question is proponed appertaining to this rule, firste imagine any number that you liste, whyche you shall name the firste position, and put it in stÃ©ede of the true number, and then worke with it as the question importeth: and if you haue missed, then is the laste number of that worke, eyther too greate or too little: that shal you note as hereafter shall be taught you, and you shall call it the firste errour.
Then beginne againe, and take an other number whiche shall be called the Seconde
position, and worke by the question: if you haue missed again, note the excesse or default as it is, and call that the second errour.
Then multiply crosse waies the first position by the second errour, and againe the seconde position by the firste errour, and note their totalls seuerally by the names of Totalles.
Then marke whether the two errours were bothe like, that is to say, both too much, or bothe too little: or whether they be vnlike, that is, the one too much, and the other too little, for if they be like, then shall you subtract the one totall from the other (I meane the lesser from the greater) and the Remainer shall be your diuidend, so muste you abate the lesser error out of the greater, and the residue shal be the diuisour.
Now diuide the diuidend by that diuisour, and the quotient will shew you the true number that you sÃ©eke for: But and if the errours be vnlike then must you adde both those totalles (whych you noted) togyther and take that whole number for the diuidend, so shall you adde both the errours togither, and that whole number shall be the diuisour, and the quotient of that Diuision shall giue you the true number that the question sÃ©eketh for: and thys is the whole rule.
This rule seemeth so vnlike any other, that without some example shal not easily vnderstande it Maister.
Therefore take this example: Mason was bou~d to build a wall in days, and it was couenaunted so with him, that euery daye that he wrought, he shoulde haue for his wages penny, euery daye that he wrought not, he shoulde be amerced so that when the wall was made, and the reckning taken of the dayes that he wrought, and of the other that he wrought not, the Mason had clearely but for his worke.
Nowe doe demaund, how many dayes did he worke of those and how many did hÃ©e not worke? Scholer.
praye you expresse the order of the worke, that may partely by imitation, and partly by comparing it with the rule, bÃ©e able againe to do the like.
This order shall you kÃ©epe in the worke of this rule: firste take some number (as you list) at aduenture, as for example: saye he played dayes, and wrought dayes.
Nowe caste you the wages of euerye daye, and sÃ©e whether it will agrÃ©e with the summe of
The dayes that he wrought after pence the daye, yÃ©eldeth
Then the dayes that hÃ©e wrought not, at pence eche daye, doth amount to pence, whiche if abate out of pence, there resteth but you say he had not so much.
He hadde but pence, and by this supposition he shoulde haue hadde therfore is this summe too much by whiche summe muste set downe after this sort, as you sÃ©e here, where firste math haue made a crosse (commonlye called Sainct Andrewes crosse) and at the ouer corner on the left hand haue sette the firste position and at the other corner vnder it, haue set which is the first erroure, with this figure whyche betokeneth too muche, as this line, plaine without a crosse line, betokeneth too little.
On the right hande of the crosse haue lefte two like rowmes for the second position and his errour.
Therfore to prosecute the worke, suppose he played dayes, and wrought
you named the dayes of hys working, sÃ©eyng they be not set in the figure: and doubted howe you knewe them, or else whether that you did suppose them at all aduentures, as you didde the dayes that hee played: but now gather, that seeing dayes is the whole time limited, then the dayes that hÃ©e played being supposed the rest of muste nÃ©edes be the dayes that he wrought, and therefore followed of necessitie and foloweth also of necessitie: but yet scarce perceyue why you set not in the figure as well as
so that in the seconde position take the numbers of the same nature that is here bothe of working dayes, or bothe of ydle: but nowe examine you this seconde position.
If he played dayes, then abating times the summe will be
And for dayes that he wrought, euery day yÃ©elding the totall is so that abating out of there resteth and as you say it shoulde be but therefore it is too much by that must be sette on the right hand of the figure at the neather parte,
and ouer it on the same math side which is the seconde position, thus.
And as gather by your words, it were al one if did set in steade of and in steade of
that of what nature so euer the two positions be, of the same nature is the quotient.
which both being numbers of the playing dayes, the quotiente shall declare the true numbers of playing dayes, where as if the positions had bene and whyche are supposed to be the working dayes, then woulde the quotient declare the true number of the working dayes, not of playing dayes as it will doe nowe.
And therefore to continue the worke of this question, and to find the true number of playing dayes, muste multiplie crosse wayes the firste position by that is the seconde erroure, and the totall will be then multiplie by and it yÃ©eldeth
Now bicause the errours are like, that is to saye, both too much, muste subtracte out of and so
Againe must subtract the lesser errour out of that is the greater errour, and there wil remaine which shall be the diuisor, then diuiding by the quotient wil be
Wherefore saye nowe constantlie, that is the true number of dayes that the Mason played: and then it followeth, that he wrought dayes, and so is the question answered.
Nowe for the order of triall of this worke there nÃ©edeth none other proofe but only thys, to worke with this number according to the question, and if it agrÃ©e, then appeareth the number to be it that you would haue.
As here nowe sÃ©eing he wrought daies, and muste haue for euerie day pence, the whole sum commeth to
Then again sÃ©eing he played dayes, and muste abate pence for eueriedaye, the whole summe of the abatement will be therefore subtracte out of and there wil remaine which maketh the cleare wages of the Mason for his worke, according to the question.
Nowe trust vnderstand the worke and the rule so well (and the better by
thys proofe) that can be able to do the like.
And for a proofe take the same question all saue the laste number, where will suppose that he hadde for his wages clÃ©ere.
And now to gesse at the number of ye days that hÃ©e wrought, suppose first that he wrought: dayes, then say I, if he wrought dayes his wages must be then did he play other dayes, for whych must be abated and then he leeseth
And so am at a staye, for it is not like vnto your former worke.
You shoulde haue required of me some question, and not haue taken a question of your owne fantasying, vntill you were more expert in this arte:
for so might you as well happen on an impossible question as on a possible: but now to go forwarde, consider that this number is too little by sÃ©eing he should gaine by your supposition and in this positio~ he lÃ©eseth those both make whiche you shall set downe for the first error with this betokening to little, as here in this forme following doeth appeare.
And nowe for the rest go forwarde math youre selfe once againe, Scholer.
As my errour hath vttered my follie, so it hath procured me better vnderstanding.
Nowe therefore considering this position not to solue the question, take an other, supposing that he wroughte dayes, then for his wages he must be allowed and for the dayes whyche hÃ©e wrought not, he muste abate and so remaineth cleare but it should be onely therfore is it to much by whiche sette downe in the figure with the former position, and his erroure and the figure appeareth thus.
Nowe must multiplie math in crosse wayes by and it will be
Wherefore if shall subtract the one out of ye other, there will remaine nothing to be the Diuidend.
In this you forget your selfe again: for in as much as the signes in the errors be vnlike,
therefore must you worke by Addition, adding togither those two totals to make the diuidend, and also adding the two errours to make the diuisor.
And bycause you shall no more forgette this part of the rule, take this briefe remembrance: Vnlike require Addition, And like desire Subtraction.
You meane, that if the errours haue like signes, then muste the diuidend and the diuisor be made by Subtraction, as is taught before: And if those signes be vnlike (as in this laste example they be) then muste by Addition gather the Diuidend and the diuisor.
Therefore must adde to and it will be whiche shall be the diuidend.
Then againe adde to and it will be whiche muste be the diuisor: wherefore diuiding by the quotient will be whereby knowe that the Mason wrought dayes: and then it followeth that he played dayes.
M. Examine your worke whether it bÃ©e agrÃ©eable to the question or no.
be and for dayes whiche the Mason wrought not, there muste be abated and then remaineth cleare to the Mason pence, as the question importeth, wherefore it is euident, that is the true number of the dayes that he wrought.
Althoughe you sÃ©eme nowe to vnderstande this worke, yet to acquainte youre minde the better with the newe trade of this rule, thinke it good to propone to you fiue or sixe examples more, before make an end of it.
Sir thanke you, that you do so consider my commoditie and profit in knowlege, for vndoubtedlie it is practise exercise that maketh men prompt expert in euerie kinde of knowledge.
You say well so that they follow some certaine preceptes to gouerne and rule their practise by, else maye practise procure custome of error, and a repugnance to exactnesse of knowledge, namelie as long as the error is not plainelie knowen to the vulgare sorte.
There is a seruant that hath boughte of the veluet and damaske for his maister yeardes, the veluet at a yeard, and the Damaske at
his maister demandeth of him howe muche he hath boughte of ech sort: ca~ not tel (saith he) exactlie, but this knowe, that paide for damask more than paide for veluet, nowe must you gesse how manie yeardes there is of each sort.
Scho Although the gesse sÃ©emeth difficulte, yet wil proue what can do: for remember your saying, that it forceth not how fonde or false the gesse be, so it be somewhat to the question, and not an answere of a contrarie matter.
Therefore first imagine that he boughte yeardes of Damaske, for which he should paye after the former price shillings: then muste he nÃ©edes haue of veluet other yeardes (to make vp the yeardes) and that woulde coste
So that the total of the price of the damaske is lesse than the summe paide for veluet and should be more by
Then begin again, and suppose he boughte of Damaske yeardes that cost then had he but yeardes of Veluet, which coste and nowe the price of Damaske is greater than the price of the Veluet by
shillings, and shoulde be but therefore is the second erroure too muche, whiche sette in forme of a figure as here doeth appeare.
And in as muche as the signes of the errours be vnlike, knowe muste worke by Addition, therefore adde those two totals togither, and they make whiche is the diuidend: then adde also the two errors togither.
Â½, whiche is the true summe of yeards of Damaske that he boughte: and in Veluet yeardes Â½, and that appeared by examination thus: yeardes of Damaske at the yeard maketh then in Veluet he hadde but yeards and Â½. that cost at ye yeard.
Nowe Subtracte out of and there wil remain which is the number of shillings that the Damaske did coste more than the Veluet.
Now shal you haue a questio~ of an other kinde.
There are thrÃ©e men that do owe money to me, and haue forgotten what the total sum is, and what the particulars be.
Scho Why? then is it impossible to know the debt.
Peace ye are to hastie: there is more helpe in it than you yet sÃ©e: haue thrÃ©e seuerall notes, whereby it appeareth that did conferre their debts togither, and founde the debt of the first and the seconde to amount to lb the debt of the first man and the third did make lb and the second man his debte with the third, did rise to lb
Now can you tell what euerie ma~ did owe, and what was the whole total? Scholer.
Naye in good faith: but as perceiue that it must be founde by coniecture, so wil gesse at it, supposing that the firste man did owe lb and the second ma~ and the third.
Nay stay there for you are to far gone alreadie,
you maye not suppose a seueral sum for euerie ma~, for it is ynough to suppose one summe for the firste man, and let the other rise as the question importeth.
you set the first man his debt to be lb the seconde man can not owe lb for the declaration is that their debtes added togither, did make lb. so must the seconde man hys debte be but lb
Nowe this seconde debte with the thirde muste make therfore subtract out of and there wil remaine as the third man his debt.
Then saith the declaration, that the first and third mens debts do make but by this suppositio~ they make that is too much: whiche muste set for the error.
suppose the first mans debt to be lb then must the second mans debt (by your declaration) be but lb. sÃ©eing both they make but lb
Also the seconde man his debt wyth the third, doe make lb and the second man oweth but therefore the thirde man must de lb
Now the third mans debt with the first, shoulde make by the declaration lb they do make lb that is lb too muche: and that is the seconde errour, which sette downe with the first, and math their positio~ in this forme and then do multiply in crosse wayes by
And because the signes of the errors be like, must worke by subtraction: therfore subtract out of and there resteth whiche is the diuidend: then doe subtract out of by the same reason, and so is the diuisor which is found times in therefore say that the first man did owe lb and then the second man muste owe lb for those doe make lb and the third man his debt is for so much remaineth if bate out of or if take out of
For the third exa~ple take this easie question for ye variety in worke.
Two me~ hauing seueral sums which know not, do thus talk togither: ye firste saith to the If you giue me of your money, the~ shal haue times so much money as you: the answereth: It wer more reason, that our sums wer made equal, and so will it be, if you giue me of youre mony.
Consider euermore in your imaginations that you take a likelye summe, as in this question take suche a sum that hauing added vnto it, may be diuided into partes euen.
Why? remember you said before, it forced not howe fondely so euer gessed.
As for the possibilitie of the solution it is truth, but for easinesse in worke, the aptest numbers are most conuenient.
thoughte no lesse, and therefore toke as an apte number to be parted into: but perceiue shoulde haue considered the aptnesse of that partition after the addition of vnto it, and then had bene more mÃ©eter.
That is trueth, and then shoulde the seconde man his sum be for although he haue nowe but the third part of that is yet you must remember that he lent the first man and so had he
Then to goe forwarde: if the seconde man had of the firste ma~, then should he haue and the first man but so hath hÃ©e double to the first man: yet he said in the question they should haue equall: wherfore it appeareth that he hath to much.
Therefore note that error with his supposition, and gesse againe that he hath whereunto adde shillings borrowed of the seconde man and then hath he shillings, so the seconde
man hath remayning but foure, wherevnto if adde the that he lent to the firste man, so had he but at the beginning.
The~ take shillings from the first man, and giue to the seconde, then hath the first man but and the seconde hath whiche are not equall, but there are to manye, math wherfore set down bothe the positions with their errors as here you sÃ©e, and multiplie a crosse, so commeth there and and bycause the signes be like.
take out of and so resteth to be the diuidend, the~ likewise take out of and there resteth by which diuide and the quotient wyll be which is the summe that the firste man had.
And so appeareth that two being added thereto, the summe will be so hath the second man nowe but and before he had then take thrÃ©e from the first, and put to hys seuen so haue eache of them and that is equal, as the question would.
think you had this yeare two thousand lambes: so had saide the other: but what with paying
the tith of them, and then thrÃ©e seueral losses they are muche abated: for at one time lost halfe as many as haue now left: and at an other time the thirde time of so many: and the third time so many.
Sch. Bicause here is mention made of certaine parts, must take a number that may haue all those parts: that is to say, and whiche wil be howbeit hath the same partes.
Therefore firste take to be the number that doth remaine, so hath he loste and that is and in the whole but it shoulde be
Maister YÃ©e are deceiued yet stil: you haue forgotten the part, whiche must be that is so there remaineth but and now go on againe.
Then to finde the error, take out of and there remayneth to fewe, whiche set for the firste errour.
Then for the second position take whose halfe is the third part the quarter where by riseth which is too little by therfore set downe both the positions math with their errors thus.
And bicause the signes are like, doe subtract the one from the other, and so remaineth the diuidend, then do subtracte out of and there resteth by whiche diuide and the quotiente is wherof the halfe is and the thyrde part is the quarter is which math all being added togither, will make
And if you adde thereto the tenth which was abated before, then wil the whole sum be
And nowe doeth there come a question to my memorie which was demaunded of me, but was not able to answere to it, and now me thinketh could solue it M. Propone your question.
There is supposed a Lawe made that (for further tillage) euerie man that doeth kÃ©epe shÃ©epe,
shall for euerie sheepe eare and sowe one acre of grounde: and for his allowance in shÃ©epe pasture, ther is appointes for euerie foure shÃ©epe one acre of pasture Nowe is there a riche sheepemaister hathe acres of grounde, and woulde gladlie kÃ©epe as manye shÃ©epe as he might by
First suppose he maye keepe shÃ©epe, and for them he shall haue in pasture after the rate of shÃ©epe to an acre, acres, and in arable grounde acres, that is in al: but this error is to litle by
Therfore gesse againe, that he may kÃ©epe shÃ©epe, that is in pasture acres: and in tillage acres, which maketh that is too little by
math These both errours wyth their positions sette downe as you sÃ©e, and multiplie in crosse by it maketh
Then multiplie by and it doeth amounte to whiche summe doe subtract out of the firste and there remaineth as the diuidende.
Also doe subtracte the lesser error out of the greater, and so remaineth by which diuide the said diuidend, and the quotient wil be so that sÃ©e, that by this rate he yt hathe acres of grounde, may kÃ©epe shÃ©epe:
and thereby coniecture, that many menne may kÃ©epe so many shÃ©epe, for many men (as the common talke) haue so manye acres of ground.
That talke is not likely, for so much ground is in co~passe aboue miles, leaue this talke and returne to your questions, leaste your pointing be scarce well taken.
IndÃ©ede doe remember, that the Egiptians did grudge so muche againste sheepeheardes till at length they smarted for it, and yet they were but smal shÃ©epemaisters to some men that be now, and the sheepe are waxen so fierce nowe so mightie, that none can withstand them but the Lion.
but to the worke of your question: both this laste question, and the nexte before might be wrought without the seconde position, by the rule of proportion, as this.
When in this question ye found in the firste errour, that for shÃ©epe, there muste bee acres, then might you reduce it to the Golden rule, thus
And so by one position with the helpe of the Golden rule may you answeare that question.
Likewise for the question of Lambes, when you math had founde that came of you mighte haue set the figure thus as yÃ©e see haue said: If do leaue but what shall leaue? and it woulde appeare to be
Sir, thanke you for this ayde, for it doeth muche shorten the worke of thys rule.
Yet againe will shewe you an other way, to answeare to this laste question without this rule of False position, and that by the rule of Felowshippe, for it appeareth in the proponing of the question, that shÃ©epe must haue in pasture acres and Â½, and for them must there be eared but one acre: so it followeth, that for two acres eared, there must be fiue set to pasture.
And if you putte them both into one summe, they wil make
Therfore looke what proportion being this totall, doth beare to and to such proportion shall any totall in this question beare to the pasture ground, and the eared ground.
Therfore to proue it, demaund this by the former supposition: If a man haue acres, how much shall he leaue in pasture, and howe much shal he turne to tillage? You say that as is to so shall be to the acres of pasture: and as is to so is to the acres of tillage, whereof for both haue sette examples here following, math whereby appeereth that of pasture there shall be acres, and of tillage which both summes added togyther, doe make
Now take an other example: man hath three siluer cuppes with one couer, the couer wayeth ounces the seconde cup weyeth euen halfe the waight of the first and the third.
Now if the couer be put to the first cup, they wey iuste as muche as all the thrÃ©e cups doe wey: and if the couer be ioined with the seconde cuppe, they wey as muche as the second twice, and the third: and if the couer be put to the thirde cup, they wil make twice as much as the first and the second cup.
Now trie you what was the iust waight of euery cup.
doe set the waight of the firste cup to be ounces: then in as much as these two (that is to say, the couer and the first cup) do wey the waight of the thrÃ©e cups, sÃ©e that the three cuppes must wey ounces, for so much is and
Also because the firste and the third do wey double so much as the seco~d, therefore is it the third parte of that waight, that is and then woulde it followe, that the third cup also should wey ounces, but then the question saith, that the couer being ioined to the second cup, they wey as muche as the second twice, and the third once, that should be and so it doth: then being ioined with the third cup, they should wey twice as much as the first and the second, that should be and they wey but so is that errour too little.
Then beginne againe, and saye, that the firste cup doth wey ounces, whiche ioine with the couer, and they make ounces: then sÃ©eing the second is of that waight, it muste nÃ©edes wey ounces, and the third muste wey ounces, seeing the first and the third must wey ounces.
Now putte the couer to the seconde cuppe, and they wey ounces, which should be euen so: then ioine the couer with the thirde Cuppe, and so
should it wey twice the firste, and the second, that is ounces, and they doe wey but that is too little: those math errours with their positions set downe, and multiply in crosse ways by whereof commeth
Also by and that yÃ©eldeth and in as much as the signes be like, abate the lesser out of the greater, and there doth remaine
Then doe also abate the lesser errour from the greater, and so remaineth by which diuide and the quotient is which take for the true waight of the first cuppe: which being ioined with the couer muste wey as much as the thrÃ©e cups, so do they wey but ounces.
Then sÃ©eing the seco~d cup is the third part of that weight, for the other two cuppes (you say) muste wey double his weight, the weight of the second cuppe is ounces, and so the waight of the the thirde must be ounces.
Nowe put the couer to the seconde cuppe, and it will make ounces: that muste be the waight of the seconde twice, and the thirde once, that is twice and once and so is it.
Againe, putte the couer to the third cuppe of ounces,
and they must wey twice as much as the firste and the second, that is and so is all agrÃ©eable.
There is a Cesterne with foure cockes, containing barrels of water: and if the greatest cocke be opened the water wil auoid cleane in sixe houres: at the seconde cocke it wil aske eight houres: at the thirde cocke it will auoide in no lesse than nine houres: and at the smallest it wil require twelue houres.
Nowe demaunde, in what spaes will it auoide, all the cockes beeing set open? Scholer.
Then muste there auoide by the first cocke of the water, that is barrels, and by the second cocke Â¼, that is and by the third cocke that is barrelles, and by the smallest cocke that is barrelles, all which summes put togither do make as by their addition it doth appÃ©ere, but it should be therefore the errour is too fewe.
Then begin math againe by youre fauour, bycause think vnderstand the worke, and putte thrÃ©e houres for the due time: so shall there runne out at the greatest cocke Â½, that is barrels, and at the seconde hole that is and at the thirde cocke that is and at the smallest hole Â¼, that is barrels, which al togither do make and should be but so is it too muche by therefore do set the math errors in order of the figure with their positions, and worke by multiplication, in crosse, saying: times is and times maketh and because the signes are vnlike, must adde those two totalles togither, which make also adde the two errours, and they make by whiche diuide and the quotient riseth whereby sÃ©e that all the cockes beyng set open, the water wil auoide in houres, and of an houre.
This exercise maketh you to grow expert in the rule.
Therefore wil inure you somewhat more wt a questio~ or two.
There were two men that had bene parteners, and had in accompt betwene them duckets: whereof the one shoulde haue for his parte and the other but in the parting of them they fel at variannce, so that eche of them catched as many as he coulde: yet afterwarde being reconciled, they agrÃ©ed that he which had gotten most parte of them, shoulde lay downe of them againe, and hÃ©e that had gotten least, shoulde laye downe of those which he had taken, and then parting them vnto two equall partes, eache man to haue halfe thereof, and so had they their iuste portions, as they ought: nowe demaunde of you what eache of them had gotten by the scambling?

You nÃ©ede not to take but one of them which you list, the greater or the smaller, for all commeth to one purpose: and so may you compare it that you take to anye of the other summes, remembring that you make comparison to the same in the seconde worke: as for example of the firste parte, If you compare with the lesser summe due, that is so is it too muche: and if you compare it with the greater summe, then is it too little.
Againe, if you compare to the greater summe, the errour will be as it was in the other: but it wil haue a contrarie signe: and if you compare it with the lesser summe it will be too much: so that the errour both wayes is eyther or as for the signes it little forceth, for in them is nothing considered here, but likenesse and vnlikenesse, which in this case, doth neyther further nor hinder.
If it be so, then am out of my greatest doubt Then ioine that (which founde as the halfe of the latter partition) vnto which is left with the one man, and so hath he whiche (I may say) is too many
for the least should be but that error doe note, and then make a newe position, supposing the one man to haue and the other to haue wherefore of the there must be laide downe and so remaineth with him
Also of the there muste bÃ©e laid downe that is and so resteth with that man.
Nowe of the and make one summe as whiche muste diuide into equall partes. and so eche man shall haue Â½, wherevnto if adde their former portions reserued, then the one shall haue and the other hath Â½.
Wherfore take the lesser summe nowe agayne, as did before, that is Â½, and finde that he hath too many by Â½, for he shoulde haue but so haue for my two positions two errors, which set down, math as here may be seene, eche errour vnder his position, and then by the rule doe multiplye in crosse wayes by and there riseth whiche note then againe multiplye by and thereof amounteth
Now because the signes are both like, that is bothe too many, must work be Subtraction, and so abating
out of there wil reste for the diuidend then for the diuisor subtract out of and there remaineth Â½, by whiche diuide and the quotient will be which is the iust portion of him that had the least summe.
And if doe subtracte it out of being the totall summe, then wil there remaine as the portion that the other did get.
For the proofe of this worke, you may choose whether you will examine those numbers according to the forme of the question, or else worke by other two positions for to finde the second number: and if those positions bring the same numbers that didde amount by the first two positions, then dothe eche worke confirme other.
By your patience, will proue both wayes, not only to see their agrÃ©ement, but also to accustome my mind to those workes: for perceiue it is exercise that must bÃ©e the chiefe engrauer of these rules in my memorie.
Firste will by two other positions trie to finde the portion of him which
Although you may doe it with any positions, yet to sÃ©e the agrÃ©ement of your work the better, take the same positions that you did before, comparing them nowe to the greater, as you did before vnto the lesser.
Then suppose, that he that had moste, had so had the other
Nowe if take of that wil be and there will reste to that man but
And from the second which had if take that is there wil remaine to him then ioyning with it will make the halfe whereof being
If adde to eche of those two mens portions remaining with them, the one shal haue and the other of which two take the greater (that is and sÃ©e it to be too fewe, for it shoulde bÃ©e that errour note vnder his position.
Then for the seconde position take (as did before) for the one, and so resteth for the other: then take of and it wil be and there resteth to him
Also of the take that is and there remayneth to him
Now put that to and it yÃ©eldeth whiche being parted in equall valewes, maketh Â½. to be added to
eche mans remainder, and so the one hathe Â½, and the other Â½: wherefore take the greatest summe, and it is too little, that doe note also, and sette both these errours vnder their positions, as in this example folowing doth appeare.
Again, multiply by it maketh whiche doe subtracte out of because the signes be like, there resteth for the diuidend: then subtracting out of Â½, there will remaine Â½, which must take for the Diuisor.
And so diuiding by Â½, the quotient wil be whereby haue found an agrÃ©eable summe to that whiche found by the former positions, for hym that had moste, whiche if doe subtracte out of that is the totall, there wil rest which was the portion of him that hadde the least parte.
So by diuers positions you sÃ©e, that one doeth confirme the worke of the other.
Nowe examine those two numbers by the forme of the question, and so shall you
If that he whiche gate most, had then muste he laye downe of hys summe, that is and so shall remaine with him, but onely The other which had leaste, that is muste put downe of his sum Â½. that is and so doth there remaine with him yet
Then doe adde togither and and it wil make whiche muste part into two equall partes, and that will be to bee giuen to eche of them: so putting vnto there doth amount iuste, whyche is the true portion of him that shoulde haue the lesser summe: and adding to the totall will be
And so is the worke by this proofe also tried to be good.
And this marke by the way, that in their scambling, hÃ©e gate moste (as it chanceth often) that ought to haue had least by iust partition.
Let your study be to learne truth and iuste arte of Proportion, and to distribute and parte according therevnto, as often as occasio~ shal be ministred.
And here would make an ende of this rule, saue that remember
one pleasant question whiche can not ouerpasse, which wil declare somwhat largely, because you shal as well vnderstand some reason in the pleasaunt inuention, as apte procÃ©eding in the wittie working thereof.
hadde caused to bÃ©e made a Crowne of Golde of a wonderfull waight, to be offered for hys good successe in warres: in making whereof, the Goldsmith fraudulently tooke out a certaine portion of Golde, and putte in siluer for it, so that there was nothing abated of the full weight, although there was much of the valewe diminished.
Which thing at length being vttered, (as no euill can alwayes lye hidde) the King was sore moued, and beyng desirous to trie the truth without breaking of the Crowne, proponed the doubt to Archimides, vnto whose wit nothing sÃ©emed vnpossible, whiche althoughe presentlye hee coulde not aunsweare vnto, yet hÃ©e had good hope to deuise some pollicie for that inuention.
And so musing thereon, as he chanced to enter into a baine full of water to washe him, he obserued that as his body entred into the baine, the water did runne ouer the tub:
whereby his ready wit of suche small effectes coniecturing greater workes, conceyued by and by a reason of solution to the Kings question, therefore reioicing excÃ©edingly more than if he had gotten the Crowne it selfe, forgate that he was naked, and so ranne home, crying as he ran, [undefined span alphabet], haue founde, haue founde.
And there vppon caused twoo massie pÃ©eces, one of golde, and an other of siluer to be prepared of the same weight that the saide Crowne was of: and considering that golde is heauier of nature than siluer, and therfore golde of like waight with siluer, must nÃ©edes occupie lesse roume, by reason it is more compact sound in substance, he was assured, that putting the masse of golde into a vessel brimme full of water, there would not so much water run ouer, as when he shoulde putte in the siluer masse of the like weight.
Wherefore he tried both, noted not onelye the quantities of the water at eche time, but also the difference or excesse of the one aboue the other, wherby he learned what proportio~ in quantitie is betwÃ©ene gold and siluer of equall waight.
And then putting the crown it self into the vessell of water brimme full (as before) marked how much water did run out
then, comparing it with the water that ra~ out when the gold was put in, noted howe much it did excÃ©ede that: likewise comparing it to the water that ra~ out of the siluer, marked how much it was lesse than that: by those proportions found out the iust qua~titie of gold yt was taken out of the crown, how much siluer was put in stÃ©ede of it.
But sÃ©eing Vitruuius whiche writeth this historie, doth not declare the particular worke of this trial, it shal be no inconuenience to suppose an example for declarations sake, wherin although the true and iust proportions be not expressed, yet the forme of triall shall be truely set forth And for an example, suppose the weighte of the Crowne to be lb and so of each of the other two Masses.
And when the masse of Golde was put into the water, imagine that there ran out pou~d of water: and when the masse of siluer was put in, suppose there ran out
pound Againe when the crowne was put in, there ra~ out pound Now to know what quantitie of siluer was in the Crowne, worke by the rule of false position, and imagine that there was pound of siluer: then must there be pounde of GoldeÂ· Then say thus
by the rule of Proportion: If pound of gold doe expell lb of water, what shal lb. expell? and it wil be pound Â½.
Againe for the siluer: If lb of siluer expell lb of water, what shall lb of siluer put out? it will be
Nowe adde those two weightes of water togither, and they will make lb and it shoulde be by the supposition lb so is it too muche by SchÂ·
Nowe doe vnderstande the worke as thinke, therfore pray you let me work the rest of the question.
And bycause this first supposition did erre, note that positio~, and his errour, and take a newe position, estÃ©eming the siluer to be but one pound, so muste there be in Golde pounde, Then say I: If lb of Gold yÃ©eld lb of water, what shall lb yÃ©elde? and it will be lb. Â¾.
Againe if lb of siluer expel lb. of water what shall lb expell? and it wil be
Nowe muste adde those two sums togither, and they make lb and they make lb so is it too little by Therfore set ye positio~s with their errours in order, as here math foloweth.
And the~ multiplie in crossewaies by and it maketh likewise multiplied by
And because the signes be vnlike, must adde those two summe, whiche make and that is the diuidend.
Again must adde to and it wil be that is the diuisour.
Now shall diuide by and the quotient wil be that is, Â½, whereby knowe that there was put lb and of siluer into the Crowne, and so muche Golde taken out for it.
If there were pounde of Siluer then was there of Golde pounde
Nowe say by the rule of proportion: math if eighte pound of Golde expell two pounde of water, what shal pound expel? math It wil be one pounde
Againe, if lb of Syluer expell lb of water, what shal expel? It wil be
Now must ad togither lb Â½. and and they wil make lb that is lb Â¼, according to the supposition of the question, whereby perceiue the worke to be wel done.
And as can not but muche reioyce of thys excellent
inuentio~, so my desire is kindled vehemently to be perfectlye instructed in euerie part therof, and namelie in this point, whether the portion betwÃ©ene water and golde be such, that for lb of gold into a vessel full of water, there shall run out lb of water: for as much siluer, whether lb of water would auoide? Ma.
perceiue your meaning, and coniecture your imagination to be thus: that if you knewe the exacte proportion betwÃ©ene Gold and Siluer and Water both in theyr waight and quantities, then coulde you easilie finde out the mixtures of them, whiche thing haue reserued for an other worke that intreateth such matters speciallie.
And at this time you muste consider, that you learne Arithmetike, which intreateth of the maner to solue doubtful questions touching number, without regarde what matter is signifyed by that number, else were it necessarie in Arithmetike to teach all arts, sÃ©eing in it may be moued questions of al arts.
But seeing you are so desirous to know this thing, wil tell it you in suche a sorte, that you shall practise your arte in finding it, and propounde it in forme of a question.
beareth greater proportion to water than siluer doth, and their two proportio~s be in proportion togither as
But to help you somewhat in this riddle, you shall note that the proportion of quicke siluer vnto water, is the iust middle number proportionall in Progression Geometricall, betweene the proportions of Gold and siluer vnto water.
Now if you wil know the iust numbers of these proportions then must you finde out numbers in Progression geometrical, wherof the middlemost must be and the first must be vnto the last, as to
And thus will leaue you to finde those numbers when you be at leasure.
Yet sir thanke you heartilie for this muche, for nowe sÃ©e the possibilitie to finde them out.
Howbeit, bycause this question sÃ©emeth straunge, if it might please you to instructe me somewhat in the order of working for it, should the more easilie finde the true working.
You desire too much ease if you wil studie for nothing: therefore to occasion you to studie ye better, will leaue this doubt wholy to your own search.
But as touching the generaltie of the rule, Archimedes nÃ©eded not
to take two masses of golde and siluer equall in waight with the crowne, for the proportion might as wel be fou~d in any other waight yea althoughe the masse of golde were of one waight and the masse of siluer of another.
If the crowne were of pounde waighte, as did suppose, and haue not so muche other fine golde, but onely lb and trying that by water, finding that it doth expell but of an ounce of water, yet then by it may inferre, that pound of gold would expell ounces of water And likewise of the siluer: wherof if had but pound, and finde that it doth expel thrÃ©e ounces of water, then might affirme that pound woulde expell ounces, that is lb waight.
And so is it, as good as if the masses were al of one weight.
And thus for this time wil make an end of this other part of Arithmetike.
Although can not sufficientlie thanke you for this, yet your promise made me to loke for the art of extraction of rootes, wherof hitherto haue learned nothing.
wil not breake my promise, but intend (God willing) to performe it within these thrÃ©e or foure monethes, if perceyue this my paines to be well taken in the mean
And you shall not repent the tarrying for it: for it shal be increased by the tarrying.
And in the meane time, you shall take thys Addition, not for the second part of Arithmetike which promised, but for an augmentation of the firste parte, vnto which woulde haue annexed the extraction of Rootes square and cubike, namely for examples of the Statute of Assise of wood, but that in the seconde parte muste write of diuers other rootes, and thought it beste to reserue those rules also with their examples vnto the same seconde parte.
Sir, althoughe can not recompence your goodnesse, yet shall alwayes do mine endeuour to occasion you not to repent your benefite on me thus employed.
The thirde parte or Addition to this Booke entreateth of briefe rules, called rules of Practize of Rare, Pleasant and commodious effect, abridged into a brieffer Method than hitherto hath bene published: VVith diuers other necessarie Rules, Tables, and Questions not only profitable for Merchants, but also for Gentlemen, and all other occupiers whatsoeuer, as by the Contents of this Booke may appeare.
The firste Chapter of this Addition entreateth of briefe Rules, called Rules of Practize, with diuerse necessarie questions profitable, not onlie for Merchaunts, but also for all other occupiers whatsoeuer.
THe working of Multiplicatio~ in Practize, is no other thing, than a certaine manner of multiplying of one kind by another: whervpon is brougt foorth the product of the proponed number whych is accomplished by the meanes of Diuision in taking the halfe, the third, the fourth, the fifte, or such other parts of the summe whiche is to be multiplyed.
And for the better vnderstanding of suche conuersions: you shall vnderstand that in the manner and vse of these Rules of Practize, you oughte first to knowe the euen or aliquot parts of a shilling, whiche in this Table following doth appeare.
Wherin as you sÃ©e according to the order of these rules of Practise at ye yeard of any thing, you must take the of your number whiche is to be multiplied, and the product, that commeth thereof shal be shillings, if any vnitie do remaine it is
For take the of the number that is to be multiplied and the product also produceth shillings if anye vnities doe remaine, ech one shal be worth in valew pence.
The like is to be vnderstoode of the other &c. Example I.
Here you may sÃ©e in the first example ye yeards at the yeard, are worth in taking the of
And in the seconde example the yeardes at the yeard: are worth shillings in taking ye of
Likewise in the third example yeards at thrÃ©e pence the yearde bringeth forth in taking the of
Also in ye fourth example at pence the yearde, maketh shillings
at the yeard, amounteth to and in taking the of And so is to be done of all other questions the like, when the number of the pence is anye of the euen or aliquot parts of
Item to bring the productes of these shillings and all other the like in poundes is verie easie in diuiding of it into your minde by for it is to be vnderstoode that as often as is found in that product: So many pounds doth it containe, whiche with facilitie to performe, alwaies strike of the figure towarde your right hande, with a right downe dashe of your penne for the that appertayto And then beginne at the lefte hand, in taking the of the rest.
And if at the laste any vnitie do remaine, the same shall be ioyned with the figure that is cut of, which shall represent the odde shillings contained in that worke.
As for example in your third question at the yearde whiche amounteth to
the producte whereof maketh math lb as here you maye sÃ©e is easily performed in the mergent.
Item also for the working of pennie the yearde, it is something harshe and harde to take the part of some products: Therefore to ease that hard worke you shall first bryng your deliuered summe into groats, by taking the part of the product.
And if any vnites remaine of that part, as somtimes there may they are pence: and must be signifyed wyth a line from the groates with theyr title of pence: And because that groates maketh a pounde or twentie shillings, strike of the firste figure towarde your righte hande for the that apperteyneth to (as you did euen nowe for the that belongeth to then in taking the of that product, if there do remaine any vnities the same shal you ioyne with the figure that you cut of, estÃ©eming the~ as groates: whiche kÃ©epe in your mind.
And by taking the part of them, you shall turne into shillings: And so haue you done as for example by a question or hereafter proponed shal more plainly by the worke appeare.
Here in taking the part of in comming to the last work the part of being taken, the remainer is whiche ioined with the that was cutte off, maketh groates: which conuerted into shillings by taking the part: maketh as appeareth Many other wayes there are, but none more apter for a yong learner to vnderstande than this: wherfore this one way wel impressed in memorie is better tha~ waies doubtfully vnderstoode.
Nowe followeth also to be vnderstood yt if the number of pence be not an aliquot part of
And after the aforesaid maner, you shall make of them or products as nÃ©ede shal require: And adde them togither into one sum: And here for thy furtherance appeareth a note of the order of their partes, as they are to be taken.
Here in the firste note of this table at you shall first take for the of the number that is to be multiplied: And likewise for the of the same number, adding togither both the products.
But if you wil worke by and you must for firste take the of the number that is to be multiplied: And for take the of the whole summe or rather, which is more better for you maye take the of the producte whiche did come of ye Bicause ye is ye of The total sums of these two nu~bers shall be the solution to the question.
And in like maner is to be done of all others: As by these examples following shal appeare.
At pence the yearde What will yeards amount to math Otherwise.
Here in this first exa~ple where it is dema~maunded (at the yeard) what will cost: First for take the of And thereof commeth Then for take the of the same product whiche amounteth to these two summes added togither do make And so much are the yards worth at the yard.
Item also for the same again: First for take the of and thereof commeth then for penny take the of the same product, that is to say of and it yÃ©eldeth me whiche both added togither make as before.
Item, for there is take then and the of the whole summe: which is to be multiplyed,
and adde them togither, that is to say, first, for there is taken the of whiche coms to as appeareth by the worke: and for there is taken the of the whole sum which amounteth to
Both which products added togither maketh And so much coms elles to at the Ell.
Item, for the first there is taken for the of the whole summe: and an other for the other which added togither as in the example doth euidently appeare, amou~teth to
Againe, for the second work of lb there is taken first the of the whole summe for whiche coms to then for the you haue to take of the whole summe, or if you will the part of the product that came of either which maketh
These two sommes being added togither doe make as in the third example appeareth.
Item, for there is taken for the of the whole summe: and the of the whole summe for or otherwise for the you may take the of ye product that came of bicause is the of which added togither as plainly appÃ©ereth in the fourth example,
Item, for first there is take~ for the of the whole summe, which amounteth to
Then for there is fou~d bothe whiche added togither maketh as appeareth in the fift example: it may also be wrought, as appeareth by the second note in the table by twice taken, and the of the product of or els by the of the whole summe, &c.
Item, for there is first taken the for then the of the whole summe for lastly, the of the last producte for All which summes added togither maketh in in pounds
when you will multiply (by shillings) any number that is vnder you shal haue in the product pounds, if you know the euen or aliquot partes of which are here in this little table set downe to sight.
So that for which is the of a pou~d you may take the of the number whiche is to be multiplyed: and you shal haue in your product pounds: if a vnitie do remaine, it shal be worth
Likewise for you must take the of the number whiche is to be multiplyed: And if there doe remaine any Vnities, they shall be fourth partes of a pound, euery Vnitie being in valewe
For take the of the number which is to be multiplied: And if there doe remaine anye Vnities, they shall be fifte partes of a pound, eche vnitie being worth
For you must take the of the number to be multiplied: wherefore to take the of any number: you must cut off the laste figure of the same number (whiche is nearest your right hand) from all the other figures with a small right downe line or dash with a pen, and so haue you done: for all the other figures which do remaine toward your lefte hand from the same figure that you doe separate shal be the saide of a pound: And that figure so separated towards your right hand shall be so manye pÃ©eces of the pÃ©ece: the whiche figure you muste double to make
therof the true number of as by the example shall appeare.
Finally, for nÃ©edeth smal worke, for it is so many shillings as be proponed in the summe, whiche to bring into poundes hathe bene already taught in the firste Rule.
Nextly, nowe followeth in order to bÃ©e vnderstoode, that if the number of shillings be not some euen, or aliquot parte of you must then conuerte the same number of shillings into the aliquot parts of And therof make two or thrÃ©e products, as nÃ©ede shall require: which done, adde them togither, and bring them into poundes.
And here for thy furtherance haue set down a note of the order of their parts, as they are to be taken.
For according to the tenor that you sÃ©e is expressed in the Table, you muste firste take for the of the number that is to be multiplied: Then for you muste take the of the product which didde come of the same parte, and adde those two sums added
Item, for according to the note set forth in the table, first for take the of the number that is to be multiplied: Then for the of the product that came of and adde them togither.
Or else, as appeareth also in the table, for you may take the and the parte of the product that came of and adde them togither.
Item, for firste take for the of the producte, that is to be multiplied, then for take the of the number that is to be multiplied, and adde them togither, &c.
Item, for according to reason, and the intent of the Table, for the firste take the of the product, and the same number againe for the other and adde them togither.
Item, for firste for take the then for take the and adde them togither.
Otherwise as you sÃ©e by the intente of the table, work twice for as was taught eue~ now for and then take the of the last product
Ite~, for first dispatch for which you must take the of the product: then lastly for take the parte of the summe produced of the of the product and adde them to+gither.
Item, for where will end wyth the firste part of my Table: First take the for And then for take the of the sum that came of and adde them togither: or else, if you please for you may take the of the whole giuen number.
To write more of the maner of taking the true parts, thinke superfluous.
Also the Table is some aide to helpe the vnperfect: wherevpon by by will set downe thrÃ©e or foure of these notes in examples: and the rest wil leaue to thine own industrie practise to labour vpon.
This is the order most commonly vsed in Practise when the number of the is not an aliquot part of a pound.
But louing Reader) after haue touched the eue~ or aliquot parts of a lb that falleth out in and will deliuer new Rules that shal drowne this common order quite and cleane: wherein shal be
comprehended in one line, or working bothe euen and odde part of vnder without regard whether it be an aliquot or not an aliquot parte: which Rules, when they come in place, committe to thy friendly iudgement in working: Nowe followeth the examples vpon the notes before saide.
At ye pÃ©ece what pÃ©eces math Otherwise by Multiplication. math
At yt pÃ©ece what pÃ©eces math Otherwise by Multiplication. math
These such like questions of Compound numbers, which haue here in this fourth rule for orders sake set down, count but as superfluous.
For, in the seconde parte of my new promised Rules shall appeare, that the giuen price of any odde nu~ber of Shillings, either vnder or aboue shall bee wrought at two at the moste howe difficult so euer the question be.
Item, there resteth yet a kind of Practize, howe to bring pence into poundes at the first working: wherevpon you must vnderstand, that pence maketh one pound, or cutte off the laste figure or and there remaineth but (of whiche is the parte thereof: is the parte, the parte: and is the parte thereof.
Wherevpon if it were demaunded what yeardes or poundes of any thing commeth to: at the yeard, in pricking or cutting off the firste figure towardes your right hande: for the that appertaineth to There is remaining of the saide summe whereout take the parte: and it co~meth to lb and there resteth one: which putte to the that pricke or cutte off, and it maketh pÃ©eces of pence, whiche
whereof the part maketh and ther remaineth which is pence, whereby it followeth, that the yeardes at pence the yeard, maketh lb as by the example shall appeare.
Item for pence, take the parte of the number from the prickt figure: And if any vnities do remaine, they are so many sixepences, whereof taking the they are shillings, if there do remaine yet one, it is in valewe pence.
Item for pence, take the parte of the number from the prickte figure: If any vnities remaine, they are so many groates, whiche to conuert into shillings, take the part: And if any thing yet remaine, they are thirds of shillings, echcone in valewe being worth pence.
Item, for pence, take the parte from the prickt figure, if any vnities remayne, they are so many pÃ©eces of pence wherof in taking the part, maketh shillings: If anye thing yet remaine, they are fourth partes of shillings, echone being in valewe pence.
Item, for pence, as appeareth also by the table, take the parte of the number from
the prickt figure: If any thing remaine, they are so many peeces of pence: whiche by taking the parte, you shall turne into shillings: and if any vnities remaine, they are so many sixte parte of shillings, or pÃ©eces of pence, whether you will.
But if your number of pence be not an aliquot or euen part of then must you bring them into the aliquot partes of and make thereof diuers products, which must be added togither, as by the questions hereafter following shall appeare.
Item, for first take for then for and adde them togither according to the instruction of the second Rule: Or else firste take for then for
Item for first take for then for and adde them togither.
Item, for first take for then for and adde them togither.
Item, for firste take for then for and adde them togither.
Item for firste take for then for and adde them togither: as by these examples folowing doth appeare.
If one yearde cost what math If one cost pence what math
But if you haue any shillings, pence to be multiplied togither: Then are you to take for the shillings according to the enstruction of the third Rule: And for the pe~ce according to the first Rule before mentioned: vnlesse
you can spie the aduauntage therof: and therby helpe your selfe: as appeareth in this seconde example, where first worke for which is to be rebated out of the giuen number, and haue lb my desire.
At the yearde What yeardes math The like againe is done by rebating as by these examples appeareth:
And now wil touch a little the euen parts of a pound that falleth out in pence and shillings, wherof for those partes you shall take such like part of the giuen number that is to be multiplied, as the price of that giuen nu~ber beareth in proportion to a pound whiche also for thy better aide is here set down.
Item first for take the parte of the giuen number if any thing do remaine, they are twelue parts of a pounde, eache one being in value
Item for take the part of the nu~ber that is to be multiplied.
And if any thing do remaine they are eight parts of a pounde each one being in value
Item for as appeareth by the table, you must take the part of the giuen nu~ber.
And if anye thing do remaine they are parts of a lb each one being in value
Item for pence take the part of the number that is to be multiplied: And if anye vnities do remaine, they are thirds of a pound euerie one being worth pence.
Other infinite numbers there are, that may be reduced by abbreuiation into the proportionate parts of a pounde: as pence maketh whiche is easilie reduced into groates by multiplying by therto adde which maketh groates: Then set the groates of a pounde vnder cutting of the Ciphers, as is here math performed in the margent.
And then haue you broughte pence into the knowen partes of a lb which maketh
But yet gentle Reader, for thy further enstruction, haue herevnto annexed in a table, howe pence and shillings beareth proportion to a lb which co~mitte to thy friendlie beneuolence, it will be some aide vnto the vngrounded practitioner: but counte him the best workeman that can presentlie reduce his giuen price vnto the knowen and proportionate parts of a lb.
Nowe by custome you are able to worke by all sortes of summmes, being deliuered in shillings pence, as pennie: pence pence, and so of all other: wishing you to haue some considerations of your questions, when they are set downe, for there are many subtill abbreuiations, and great adua~tages to be gotten, and easilie to be perceiued
And by this meane when you haue taken one product, you maye oftentimes vppon the same take an other more briefelie then vpon the sum which is to be multiplied &c.
Nowe gentle Reader that you haue sÃ©ene the vertue of the euen or aliquot partes of a lb in shillings alone, And also in the aliquot parts of shillings and pence: according to my promise hereafter followeth a briefer and easier method for any euen number of shillings either vnder or aboue then euer yet hath bene published: Notwithstanding Maister Humfrey Baker, whose trauel is worthie co~mendation, And whom for knowledge sake reuerence hath in some part touched thys first parte: though not in this method: The worke of the Rule is both pleasante, readie and briefe.
As by the varietie of the examples deliuered therevpon shall appeare.
And first wil set forth a question: Thereby the better to expresse or teach you the order therof: which is this.
To the vnderstanding of this exa~ple, after you haue set down your giuen nu~ber in form of the rule of with a line drawen vnder it: you shal prese~tly set a prick vnder your first figure towards your right ha~d, drawing fro~ the pricke as heretofore hath bene practised, a little short line, thereto sette downe the shillings anone, which done, multiplie the first figure by
the value of your price, (whyche here you sÃ©e standeth in sight aboue the line.)
The lb kÃ©ep to carrie to the next place, the set downe at the end of the prescribed line towards your right hande: Thus haue you done nowe with aboue the line, and also with in the firste place (for the pricke vnder the
Then seco~darily for a general rule take but the of the giuen price whiche here is which
is the number that shal now continue the reste of ye multiplication and end the worke, whervpon multiply into standing in the seconde place it maketh and with the lb kept in minde set downe kÃ©epe in minde working according to the rule of multiplication, deliuering the tens in mind in their due place, which done, the product from the pricke
to your left hand representeth the pounds and the other at the ende of the line the shillings: as appeareth by the examples.
If one cost what math If one cost what math
If one cost what math Let these suffise gentle reader for an entreance into euen numbers: And now wyll shew the like rule for any od or vneuen parts of a pound.
To help you to the vnderstanding of these other questions yt hereafter followeth: where in my first example the giuen nu~ber is
it maketh The shilling set down the lb kÃ©epe: Nowe am to take the of which because it is an odde number cannot.
Therefore shal kÃ©epe and continue my multiplication by stil: And worke by the of the rest of the giuen figures or nu~bers: To wit And first the of whiche is multiplied into maketh therto ioine ye lb in minde, it maketh set down kepe one.
Then againe multiply by the of it maketh and with in minde it maketh
Then lastly take the of which is saying times is whiche set downe and so is the question aunswered as appeareth by the practise, and the examples following.
If one piece cost what math But nowe note gentle Reader, when the giuen price falleth vppon anye odde number.
&c: Then it is to be presupposed, that the giuen summe to be multiplied muste be a summe made of euen numbers, as &c. else can not that question be wrought at one line or working.
Prouiding alwayes that it maye beare an odde figure in the firste place towardes your righte hand: as appeareth in these Examples which last were wrought, and such like &c. which may beare an odde number for the price, and be done at one line or working very wel.
But if the giuen price be an odde number, and the summe to be multiplyed odde numbers also: The~ can it not be done at one working, but requireth the aide of workings: for odde with odde will not agrÃ©e, which notwithstanding to bring to passe.
Take this for a general rule: First work for the euen number, contained in that question, or giuen price, according as you haue learned, And the~ afterwards for the one odde shilling,
take the of the summe giuen to be multiplied, omitting the first prickt place, As was taught for ye working of one shilling in my first rule of practise, And adde those two togither.
And thus haue abbridged into these two Rules how to bring any number of whatsoeuer they be into pounds, wt a brieffer method, then euer yet hath bene published, whiche commende vnto thy friendlye censure and iudgements in the vse of practise thereof.
At the pÃ©ece what math These thrÃ©e last questions may sÃ©eme some thing harde, yet are they easie ynough, if you marke them well, if should explaine them, then are they too easie: therfore leaue them to whet the minds of the desirous.
Item, when any one of the summes whiche is to be multiplied, is composed of manye Denominations: and the giuen number but of one figure alone: Then shall you multiplye all the denominations of the other sum, by the same one figure, beginning first with that summe which is least in valew towards your right hande, and bring the producte of those into and the producte of the into lb as by this example doth appeare. math
But if in any of the summes that are to be multiplied ther be a broken number: First worke for the whole according to the instructions that you haue learned: and then take suche part of the giuen price: as that broken number beareth in proportion to the price, as in the example: after you haue wrought, for and for then are you to take the of for the yeard: and adde that to the summe: So adding all productes togither which maketh lb the iuste price of Els: and thus muste you do of all other.
At the pÃ©ece What math If one pÃ©ece coste math What math The Proofe.
Item, touching the manner howe to vnderstande the order of this proofe, and others the like: first seeke howe many times is contained in maketh resteth lb whiche conuerted into shillings, and ioined with the other maketh wherein is fou~d thrÃ©e times: resteth which turned into pence, putting thereto the in the firste place, it maketh wherein is founde times, resteth which containeth but a time, put that to the And then the solution is lb as appeareth by the practise thereof.
Item, the like is to be done of any thing that is bought or solde after score to the hundreth, or the Quintall: As for example.
math haue wrought this at le~gth for ye aide of ye yo~g learner, bicause he should vndersta~d how al ye Multiplication is set downe. math But to works it more neatly, it is by a little vnderstanding ended thus.
Item to the vnderstanding of this and suche like questions, the right downe line is all the guide, which is pulled down close by as you sÃ©e in the example, where lb is reduced all into maketh
with the hanging or right downe line, is the iust number of shillings: that aunsweareth to the question: Nextly, is multiplied by to reduce them to pence, putting to the it yÃ©eldeth for the multiplication of the first figure two: the one beyond the line towards the left hande: is penny towardes the reste of the price: then also multiplied by yÃ©eldeth but the behinde the line towards the left hande, is also more, towards the price, which and adde togither vnder the line: it maketh So is there found nowe as appeareth by the Titles of and
Finally, come nowe on this side the line, towards the right hand: and vnder find first and then whiche added togither maketh vnder whiche you muste putte the and it which abbreuiated commeth to So the iuste price of one pounde after score to the hundreth, maketh
Also the like maye be done of our vsuall waightes here in England (whiche is lb for euery hu~dreth waight) in case you know the Aliquot parts of a hundreth waight, whiche are these, lb lb lb and lb For lb is the of lb lb is the of lb lb is the and lb is the
Therfore for lb take the of the summe of mony that lb waight is worth.
For lb take the of the summe of money that lb waight is worth.
For lb take the of the summe that lb is worth.
And for lb the of the summe of money that C. is worth.
As for example: at lb the hundreth poundes waight, that is to saye, the lb what shall thrÃ©e quarterus and lb coste? math The second Chapiter entreateth of the Reduction of diuers measures to others valewe by Rules of Practise.
NOW will shewe a fewe examples of Practise in reducing of measures: as Elles Yeardes, Braces, pawnes of Ieanes &c. Muche more woulde haue touched but that feare the booke wil rise to too great a volume.
In elles of Antwerpe, howe many yeardes of London? math Item, in these and such like questions of Flemmish measure to be brought into yards Englishe: firste take the of the giuen number, as appeareth in the first exa~ple towards your lefte hand: Then take the of that product: or the of the giuen number: and adde those products togither, they shal be yeards Englishe, as by the example you maye perceiue.
The second example towards your right hand is yet briefer than the first, whose work is this: take the of the deliuered number, and that product, subtray out of the gyuen number: and the rest sheweth your desire: of these two wayes vse whiche you thinke best.
In yeards of London, how many Elles of Antwerpe math Item for the vnderstanding of this work: first take the part of the yeards of London, which found, adde that part, and the togither, as appeareth by the practise: and the product sheweth the Elles of Antwerpe.

Item you shall vnderstand, that for as much as Braces of Millane make Elles
of Antwerp, wherevppon, according to the Rules of Practise, you maye reduce the one into the other by the like Reasons aforesaide in taking the parte, and then subtraye the same to make Elles of Antwerp: And againe by the contrary in taking the part, with adding the giuen number, to turne the Elles to Braces, as for example.
Thus appeareth, that braces by practise, make Elles Flemmishe: whiche Elles Flemmish reduced into English yeardes by the Rules aforesaide, make yeardes.
So againe vpon the same firste Question of Braces: woulde knowe howe manye yeardes English they make.
After the rate that Braces are worth yeardes. math Item, to the vnderstanding of this worke and suche like, firste take the of the giuen Braces: And after take the of that halfe: or the of the giuen number, and adde them togither: And the product are also yeards Englishe.

NOw that haue somwhat intreated of the Rules of Practise, will giue a fewe instructio~s after my sim+ple order, for the working of the Rule of thrÃ©e in broken numbers, wherein shall nÃ©ede to saye the lesse, because hope the studious Learner, that hath trauelled any thing in the Grounde of Artes, is not vnfurnished of knowledge capable to vnderstande me.
But before deliuer any instructions for broken numbers, will propone a question, whiche shall bÃ©e wrought sundrie wayes, thereby to shew as it were degrÃ©es of comparison: how far the Rule of thrÃ©e, in broken, for more spÃ©ede
of worke, differeth from whole, which rather set downe for a view, that the studious herein may be more desirous to attaine broken: leauing any more so discourse in Dialogue forme: but only to giue instructions, where nÃ©ede is: and in the rest to putte forth the questions with their aunsweares.
If one yeard cost What are worth at that rate math Here the product of the summe are pence according to the nature of the midle nu~ber. math
Here the producte of the summe is according to the nature of the middle number.
math Here the producte is poundes according to the title of the second number.
Now that you haue sÃ©ene the former vertues of the rule of thrÃ©e, whose products hath firste broughte forth nexte and lastlye, poundes: will deliuer notes in order folowing: And with them a dosen questions:
that shall shewe the worke of the Rule of thrÃ©e in broken numbers or Fractions.
The firste foure shall bÃ©e sundrie Questions of a Fraction comming in the second place.
The second foure shall be of Fractions comming in the seconde or thirde place.
If one yeard me what are worth at that price.
In setting downe the Question to performe the worke turne into the part of
TO the ready working of this question, all such other like, my first note is this: which take for a generall rule, that when any one Fraction shall come either in the second or third place: that the Denominator of that Fraction or Fractions, must alwayes be brought vnto the number or Numerator of the first place: and thereby multiplyed the one into the other.
And this benefit is alwayes gotten by the vertue of bringing the Denominator of the second numbers fraction vnto the first place.
For the fraction in the midle number is now released: and the producte that commeth of the Multiplication, is of the nature and lyke Denomination of the whole number in the second place which here are shillings.
Wherevppon now to worke the question bring the Denominator of the Fraction in the second place, vnto my firste number with a line set vnder thus: and the vnder it thusÂ· saying, once is my Diuisor: That done, reduce saying, times is and the ouer make my second number in the Rule of by whych do multiply my last number as appeareth by ye worke thereof: And it yÃ©eldeth my diuidend.
Then diuiding by my diuisor, it yÃ©eldeth in Quotient whiche, as appeareth by the worke maketh poundes.
This question was also wrought like the first and bringeth forth lb the price of yeardes.
If pounde of anye thing cost lb What comes lb to.
Item will worke vpon my first question now againe: but altered into the proportion it beareth to a lb for that is of a pound.
As soone as haue carried the denominator of my middle number vnto my firste place, as afore hath bene taught: pul down one, the numerator of with a line vnder thus: And that one of custome pul downe in sight being the figure yt shal multiply my last number byÂ· According to the tenor of the
Rule of And because one can neither multiplie nor yet diuide (thoughe here it is sette downe in forme of multiplication,) the producte of the multiplication, according vnto the declaration of my first note, is conuerted into the title of my seconde number whiche here are poundes: nowe followeth the diuision performed by my diuisor to make an end of the question.
Notes vpon my second Rule for two Fractions co~ming in the second and third place.
If one ell cost what halfe a quarter or of an ell? Answer.
Firste bring into the parts of a lb which is and then wil the question stand thus.
Item for the performance of this worke do as before was taught in the first Rule, firste bring the denominator of the second fraction vnto your first number setting a line vnder thus: Saying once is that done bring the denominator of the third fraction setting it vnder and multiplye them togither, saying times makes which is your diuisor: (Now haue you done with the denominator
And the like line also vnder setting or pulling downe vnder them their own numerators, that is vnder and also vnder as appeareth in the example, which Numetors for a general rule are euermore to be pul+led down, of custome in sight, to multiplie the one by the other according to the tenor of the Rule of thrÃ©e.
Then multiplie the one by the other saying once is which signifyeth lb being of the Nature and like denomination of the middle number, which lb is to be reduced into shillings, otherwise it can not be diuided by my firste number Then diuiding by the quotient bringeth foorth So muche is of an ell worthe
Otherwise although pound coulde not be diuided by yet it might haue bene abbreued to of a pounde: whiche is worth pence, as before.
If one pound of any waighte coste shillings pence: what are of the pound worth after that rate: Answere.
Reduce the shillings pence into the partes of a pounde: which is and then will the question stand thus.
Item for the vnderstanding of this, if you marke wel the last example, this and the rest lyeth open, and nÃ©edeth small instruction.
So nowe againe bring the Denominator of the seconde and third fraction vnto the first figure, multiplying the one into the other which maketh also as before your Diuisor.
Then making a line vnder thus, and a line vnder thus, And pulling downe theyr Numerators vnder each figure, that is, vnder and vnder whiche as said before for a generall Rule pull downe of custome in sight: to be the two numbers that of dutie ought to be multiplied togither, whiche done bring being ye lesser figure vnder multiplying them togither, it maketh whiche are of the nature of the middle number.
That is to wit pounds: which cannot aptlye bÃ©e diuided among Therfore are reduced into as is plainly to be sÃ©ene in the example.
Then parted among yÃ©eldeth for his quotient your desire: and ye iust price of of an ell.
Otherwise, thoughe it could not be diuided by might by mediation or diuision in broken numbers haue bin diuided or abbreuiated to whiche in effect being reduced to his knowen partes maketh as before.
But my good wil meaning is to aide yong beginners.
haue reduced the lb into which is the easier way.
First put into the parts of a and then the question standeth thus.
Ite~ to the readie vnderstanding of this all such like, according as before hath bene declared: Bring the denominators of the second third fractions vnto the first place, multiplying them the one into the other, al which maketh
Lastly, reduce your third number all into fourths, and they make whiche is to be multiplied by according to the tenor of the Rule of thrÃ©e: whiche done, maketh And diuided by your Diuisor: yÃ©eldeth in Quotient whyche maketh in poundes lb Â½: And so muche are the and yeardes worth at that price.
The same question wrought again but is now conuerted into the parts of a lb and standeth thus: math
Item, after haue brought here my second and third fraction vnto my first place, found to be my deuisor: hauing thus furnished my firste place with all thinges vnto him belonging (whiche is meant of bringing and multiplying the Denominators of the second and third Fractions into him) then goe in hand to sÃ©e what is to doe in my second place, where presently of custome pull downe my Numerator vnder bÃ©eing
the figure in sight that shal multiply my third number.
Then lastlye reduce all into fourthes, as afore was practised, whych maketh the whyche am to multiplie by one my seconde number: they are nothing encreased, but by the Methamorph of my worke, they are nowe pounde: being of the nature of the middle number, as haue often shewed you, whiche diuided by my Diuisour, yÃ©eldeth pounde and whiche of a lb reduced into knowen numbers, make shillings as before.
Item firste for the finding out of your diuisor: you shal take this for a most certaine and generall rule.
That you must multiply the numerator of the first number in the question by the denominator of the second: And also al that againe by the denominator of the third: and the total therof shal be your diuisor.
Secondarily for a generall rule to find out your diuidend, multiplie the denominator of the first number by the numerator of the seconde, and the whole thereof by the denominator of the third.
Nowe for an example propone this question thereby to make my meaning the more plaine, and to shew you as haue done in the rest the manner and order of the worke.
If of any waight or measure cost of a lb or what are of the like waight or measure worth after that rate.
math Item for the more plainer vnderstanding hereof, and all other the like, in broken numbers: First you shal pul downe the Numerator of the firste number or fraction, with a line vnder thus: that done according as you haue learned before, bring the denominator of the second fraction, and set it vnder multiplying the one into the other whiche maketh
Then lastly bring the denominator of the third fractio~: and set it vnder multiplying that by which amounteth to (or else for more briefe multiply by saying times makes which sette vnder and multiplie the one into the other, maketh as before) And this is the first nu~ber in the rule of thrÃ©e.
That shal alwaies for a most general rule be your diuisor.
Secondly to worke for your diuidend you shal as hath bin sufficie~ttie declared afore, pul down the numerator of your second fractio~.
That done as you knowe, you are to pull downe the numerator of the third fraction and set it vnder
with a line vnder thus multiplying the one into the other according to the tenor of ye rule of which maketh the~ according to my note, forget not to bring the Denominator of the first fraction which is vnder And multiplie them togither, which maketh which is your diuide~d.
Which are of the nature or denominatio~ of the middle number, as haue ofte taught you before And therefore are lb whiche aptly cannot be diuided by Therfore you shal reduce that lb into as you sÃ©e is performed in the example, which amounteth to whiche diuided by your diuisor it yÃ©eldeth of a which in lesser termes is which in money maketh And so much wil the aforesaid cost, as by the work following shal appeare.
Otherwise though coulde not be diuided by yet by diuision in broke~ numbers it might haue bene abbreuiated to of a lb which redused into knowen parts will make as before.
Now my second example shal be the proofe of this question.
If yeards cost of a lb or what shal cost? Answer.
Worke as was taughte you before, and you shal haue your desire.
math Here as appeareth by the worke, the multiplications being ended is to be diuided by which to some perchance may sÃ©eme harde, yet notwithstanding is the work good: Therefore abbreuiate by as you sÃ©e here is practised: and the end of your abbreuiation shal come to your desire.
To worke this question the shortest way: reduce into the partes of a lb which is
Then as you did afore after, you haue sette downe the question, the numerator of ye firste Fraction is pulled down vnder
and the denominators of ye other fractio~s multiplyed into him which maketh your diuisor.
Then the Numerator of the second fraction is pulled down vnder of custome now in sight readie to multiply my third number by: which is performed as soone as the laste number is reduced into halfes.
Then lastly multiply that product by the denominator of my firste fraction: if yÃ©eldeth which diuide by And my quotient is lb of a lb remayning which is worth And so much wil elles cost as by the worke following doth appeare. math The fourth Example.
If Elles coste lb what commeth elles to? Item to the workmanship of this question: firste reduce your firste number to one direct Numerator: in saying, times is and is Then bring the Multiplication of the Denominators of the seconde and thirde Fractions, which maketh and multiplie that by your first Numerator, it maketh which is your diuisor.
Then the reduction of the second number, which is multiplied by the product of ye laste numbers reduction, make whiche yet resteth to bÃ©e multiplied by
the denominator of the fraction in the firste place yÃ©eldeth whiche diuided by your diuisor yÃ©eldeth lb as appeareth by the worke therof.
Thus hauing now touched the questions wherof first pretended, which with diligence and oft practise trust are sufficient to aide the desirous, vnto the working of any broken numbers, therefore will propone a question or two more, and so ende this treatise of the Rule of thrÃ©e in broken numbers.
If of an ell cost what one ell. math Proofe.
If one Ell cost what math If one pÃ©ece of Kersy cost lb and one yeard thereof sold for how many yeards long was the whole pÃ©ece. math
Grocer hathe bought a bagge of Almonds wayghing lb tare lb at the C: The question is what they amou~t to in money.
math math The fourth Chapiter treateth of Loste and Gaine, in the trade of Merchandise.
IF one yard cost and the same is sold againe for the Question is, what is gained in lb laying out on such commoditie.
Answere, the Rule of thrÃ©e direct, applieth twoo manner of wayes to doe the same: the one is to say: If giue Â½, what giueth Multiply and diuide, and looke what your quotient bringeth forth aboue your laying out, is the neat gaines, and the solution to your Question: If you follow the worke, your Quotient wil bring forth lb
Item, to worke it the other way, which take the nearest, sÃ©eke the difference betwixt the iust price, and the whiche is Then say by the Rule of thrÃ©e: If gaine what shall lb gaine: Multiply and diuide, and you shall finde lb and so much is gained in lb laying out.
If a yeard of cloth be deliuered for wherevpon was gained after the rate of lb in lb laying out: The Question is what the yard cost at the first hand? Answer.
Put your gains to lb al maketh lb then say, if lb giue but lb what giueth worke, and you shall finde the true solution to your question.
Yet an other Branch or proofe vpon the same first Question.
is, what price the same is to be solde againe for, to gaine lb in lb laying out.
Answere, say by the Rule of thrÃ©e, if lb giue lb what giueth multiply and diuide, and you shal finde your true solution.
If one Ell cost and solde againe for Question: what is gained in lb laying out, in such commodities.
Answere, SÃ©eke the difference betwixte the iust price the which is and then apply the Rule of thrÃ©e, as before is taught: saying, if giue what giueth lb multiplie and diuide, and you shal find lb And so much is gained in lb laying out.
Merchant hath bought Holland cloth at the Ell, whiche proueth not to his expectation: wherevppon he is content to lose lb in lb laying out: The question is what price ought to be made of the Ell abating this losse.
Answere, doe as before in gaines hathe bin taught: putting lb to your lb all togither maketh Then say by the Rule of three: If giue but lb what shall come of worke and you shall finde the iust price that the Ell ought to be sold for after the rate of this losse.
Thus you sÃ©e as in companye the Rule is appliable as wel to gaines and losse.
If yeards cost lb howe shall sel the same againe to gaine of the principall: or to make of whyche is all one.
Answere, by the Rule of thrÃ©e: if doe do giue what will giue? Multiply diuide, and you shall finde lb Then say againe, if yeards do giue pou~ds, as well principall as gaine: what will one yeard be worth at that price? Multiplie and diuide, and you shal finde lb
If one Ell of Cloth cost me And afterwardes sell, Elles therof for lb would know whether winne or lose: and how much vpon the lb of money.
SÃ©e firste, at the Ell, what elles commes to, and you shall finde lb and solde the same for lb So that did gaine vpon the yeardes Then if you would know how much is gained in the lb say by the rule of thrÃ©e: If lb did gaine what will lb gaine: Multiply and diuide and you shall finde lb And so much is gained in the lb of money.
If yeards cost me lb And sel the yeard againe for the question is, whether do win or lose, and howe much in or vpon the pound of money.
Looke what the yeardes come to at the yeard, and you shall find lb But they cost lb So there is loste vpon the whole lb Then to know how much is lost in the pound: Saye by the rule of if lb do lose lb what will lb lose: Multiplie and diuide, and you shall finde and so much is lost in the lb of money.
If sel the C. waight of any co~moditie, for lb wherevpon do lose after lb in the lb demaund howe muche shall
lose or gaine in the lb if in case had solde the same for lb
Say if lb yeeld how much wil giue? Multiplie and diuide, you shall finde Then say againe, if giue me what wil come to? Multiplie diuide, and you shal find lb which is more tha~ lb by lb And so muche is gained in the lb.
Merchant hath solde Currans for the sum of lb he hath gained therein after lb in the lb The question is, to know how much he gained in all? Answere, Say by the Rule of thrÃ©e: If lb do gaine lb what will lb gain: Multiplie diuide, and you shall find lb And so much hath he gained in al.
If one yeard be worth for howe much shall yeards be solde to gaine after lb in the lb. Answere.
First adde lb to the~ say, if lb do giue for principal and gaine, what will principall yÃ©elde? Multiplie and diuide, and you shall finde Then saye againe by the Rule of thrÃ©e: If yearde doe giue (whyche is as well the principall as the
gaine) what shall yeardes giue? Multiplie and diuide, and you shal find lb And for the same price shall the yeards be solde, for to gaine after the rate of lb vpon the lb.
Merchant hathe solde Clothes for lb and he hath gained in the whole, the sum of lb The question is to know howe muche hÃ©e hath gained in the lb. Answere, to knowe this, firste rebate the gaines from the price, and there will remaine lb Then saye by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct, if lb giue me lb what will lb giue? Multiplie and diuide, and you shall finde lb the effect desired: the proofe is apparant in the question before.
Yet an other Branch or Proofe of the first Question.
lb wherevpon was gained after ye rate of lb vpon the lb the question is, what the yeard did coste at the first hande.
Answere, first say by the Rule of thrÃ©e, if with principall and gaine yÃ©elde lb Â¾, what shal yÃ©elde? Multiplie and diuide, and you shall finde Then saye againe by the Rule of thrÃ©e: If principall and gaine giue but what shall of principall and gaine yÃ©elde: work, and you shall finde And so muche did the yeard cost at the firste penny.

Gentle Reader other necessarie questions appertaining to Losse and Gaine, you shall haue in the seauenth Chapiter of this Treatise.
The fifth Chapiter entreateth of Losse and Gaine vppon Time, wrought by the double Rule of three: or by the Rule of three composed, whiche is contained in foure speciall selected braunches or questions of diuers formes, eche one of them springing from the firste question, and eache one of them also beeing a proofe to other, &c.
IF one yeard cost me readie mony: and after sell the same againe for to be paide for it at the ende of moneths: the question is, what gaine vpon the lb in moneths? Answere.
First saye, if gaine what shal lb gaine: Multiplie, and diuide, and you shal finde lb Then saye againe
by the Rule of thrÃ©e: if moneths gaine lb what shall moneths gaine: Worke, and you shall finde lb and so muche shall gaine in moneths after that rate.
Ite~ you may also work it at one working by ye first part of the Rule of composed: saying, if in moneths do gaine of a which is what wil lb gaine in moneths: whiche for thy further encouragement, the worke of this one Example wil here putte downe, to verifie that affyrmed when deliuered in the firste parte of this Ground of Artes, that this Rule, and so all others more reioiceth in Broken than in Whole.
If a yeard be deliuered for wherevpon was gained after the rate of lb in the for moneths: The question is nowe, what the yeard coste at the first hande.
Answere. firste saye, if moneths gaine lb what shal moneths gaine: and you shall finde lb Then say againe the seco~d time, if lb giue but what shall giue? worke, and you shall finde which is the iust price that the yeard coste at the firste hand.
If one yeard of cloth cost me ready mony, for what terme shal sel the same again for So that might gaine after the rate of lb vpo~ the lb in moneths.
First say, if gaine what shall lb gaine: Multiply and diuide, and you shall finde lb.
Then saye againe for the second worke, if lb become of moneths, what shal come of lb Work, and you shall finde moneths: the iuste terme of time that the cloth ought to bÃ©e deliuered at
If one yeard coste me readye mony for what price shal sel the same againe to be paid at the end of moneths: So that may gaine after the rate of lb in the lb for moneths? Answere.
Firste saye, if gaine lb what shal moneths gaine? Multiplie, and diuide, and you shal finde lb then saye for the second worke: if lb gaine lb what shall gaine? worke, and you shall find whiche muste be added to and then it maketh and for that price muste the yeard be solde to gaine after the rate of in the for moneths, you may also worke it by the first part of the rule of three composed, saying if lb in monethes doe gaine me lb what shall gaine in moneths: work and you shall find of a lb which in lesser termes is and is in known mony worth as before.
Many other of these questions might heere haue deliuered, but for feare the booke woulde rise to too thicke a volume, and so to make the price so much
the dearer, whereby it mighte not bee so partable to my Countrymen as wish it.
But these foure, haue of purpose framed in this order, hauing relation one to an other: Assuring you, that what questions soeuer maye bee proponed within the compasse of this rule, you shall finde by one of these foure to make a solution: And moreouer, diuers other are yet to be deliuered: where the Creditour giueth diuers dayes of payment, which can neuer bee well wrought, nor yet vnderstoode, vnlesse you can firste finde by Arte, the iust time that al those payments, how different soeuer they be, ought to be paide at once: wherevppon first thinke good here to giue some instructions into such a Rule, for it is the onelie aide for the finishing of such questions as hereafter shall follow.
The sixth Chapiter entreateth of Rules of Payment, which is a right necessary Rule, one of the chiefest handmaids that attendeth vpon buying and selling, &c. Example.
Merchant doth owe a summe of money, whereof the is to be paid at moneths, the at moneths, and the rest at a yeare, If he woulde paye at one payment, the question is, what time ought to be gyuen hym.
Answere haue omitted the quantitie of the summe, for you shal vnderstande, the Rule is appliable, and yÃ©eldeth a true solution to what sum soeuer shal be proponed.
But now for orders sake in teaching, doe imagine the summe to be lb wherevppon the maner of this worke is to multiplie the proportionate parte of the mony by the time, as in company: Then being the firste payment, and the of whiche multiplied in broken numbers by his time of payment, maketh whiche in whole numbers,
as appeareth by the example math in the marge~t, maketh monethes: next whiche is the multiplyed by his tearme yÃ©eldeth monthes, then ye rest which is lb must nÃ©edes be abbreuiated into the proportion it beareth to
which is which multiplied by his time monthes produceth maketh monthes.
All whiche added togither as appeareth in the margente. maketh monthes: whiche is the iust time that all those payments ought to be paide at once.
Mercha~t hath lb to pay, the therof readie money the at two monethes, the at foure monthes, and the rest at a yeare.
The question is, if he woulde paye all at one payment, what time ought to be giuen him.
AnswerÂ· The readie money math is neuer multiplyed: then multiplyed by monthes as you did before, maketh then by produceth monthes, as appeareth here in the margent: But nowe for the rest of the money you can not multiplye it vntill you haue sought what proportion it beareth to lb.
Therefore you must subtract the readie money: the and the out of the principall: The rest wil be lb which you must looke what parte it beareth to the principal, which you shal finde to be The same you must also multiply by his time monthes.
And it yÃ©eldeth month: So all make monthes as appeareth in the margent.
Merchant is to paye lb in termes, That is to wit, lb. at wÃ©ekes And lb at monthes, lastly lb. at monthes.
The question is in what time, they ought to be paide at once.
And the part: which multiplied by their times before, and you shal haue wÃ©ekes: more wÃ©ekes, and lastly weekes, which togither maketh wÃ©ekes, or monthes youre
Merchaunt is to paye lb in termes, whereof lb is paid present, more lb at dayes: And the rest at monthes, accompting dayes to a month.
The question is, what time oughte these payments to be payde at once.
The seuenth Chapter entreateth of buying and selling in the trade of Marchandise, wherin is taken part readie money, and diuerse dayes of payments giuen for the rest: what is won or lost in the lb forbearance for monthes more or lesse according to the quantitie of money, or proportion of time &c.
Merchant hath bought Sattins whiche coste the yearde readie money: And
he selleth the same again to another ma~ for the yearde: But he giueth two dayes for the payment: That is to say thrÃ©e monthes for the one half, and fiue monthes for the other half: The questio~ is to know how much the seller doth gain vpon lb in monthes after that rate.
SÃ©eke first by the Rules of payment, at what time those two paymentes ought to be paide at once, and you shall finde monthes, at whiche time the seconde Merchant oughte to haue paide the whole entire payment: And therefore say by the first parte of the rule of thrÃ©e co~posed: If in monthes doe gaine two shillings, what wil pounde gaine in twelue monthes multiplye and diuide and math you shall finde lb as appeareth in the example, and so much doth the firste Merchaunte gaine vppon lb in monthes.
Merchaunt hath sold clothes at lb the pÃ©ece, to be paide the one at monthes:
the at monthes, the at monthes: And ye sellers minde is to take no more but after lb in the for monthes.
The question is now what the first Merchaunt gaineth in the sale of these clothes after that rate.
First looke what the clothes come to at that price: and you shall finde lb.
Then secondly, according to your direction in the Rules of paymente, sÃ©eke at what time all the payments are to be performed at once.
Then thirdly say by the firste part of the Rule of composed: If lb in monthes gaine lb what wil lb gaine in monthes: work and you shal finde lb and of a lb whiche is the neate gaines that the firste Merchaunt hath after the rate aforesaid:
Merchant hath bought Holland at the ell readie money: And he selleth the same againe, for the ell, to be paide part in readie mony, more parts at thrÃ©e monthes, and the reste at foure monthes.
how muche the first Merchant doth vppon the lb in monthes after same rate.
According to the direction you in the rule of payment, the ready money is not to be multiplyed: Then for the other paymentes, to finde the true proportion at what time they to be paide at once, you shall finde for at monthes, of a mo~th: And the rest of the which is multiplyed by his tearme monthes, yÃ©eldeth monthes: both added togither make and monthes: iust time, that both the payments ought to be performed at once.
And therefore saye by the first part of the Rule of thrÃ©e composed, if in monthes do gaine of a lb what shal lb gaine in monthes after that rate, worke and you shall finde poundes.
Merchant hath bought clothes at lb the pÃ©ece for readie money: Afterwarde he selleth of them for lb the pÃ©ece, for thrÃ©e monthes tearme.
selleth for lb the pÃ©ece for foure monethes terme: The question is nowe, what hee gaineth vpon lb in monethes? Answere.
Firste finde the value of the Cloths, which amount to lb Secondarily, seeke what the ten pÃ©eces come to, at lb and what the pÃ©eces come to at lb the one comes to and the other to both which togither make which is lb more than they coste: Thirdly, as haue taught you in the Rule of payment, proportionate the first .ij. prices, vnto the proportion they beare vnto the producte of their two prices and you shall finde for the firste, and for the latter.
Then fourthly, multiply those partes, by their times: and you shall haue and both which togither maketh whole moneths, and of a moneth, which is the iuste time that both those payments are to be paid at once.
The~ say by the first part of the Rule of co~posed: If lb in months do gain lb what shal gaine in months?
And so muche doth he gaine vpon a lb in monthes.
Mercha~t hath bought Synamon which cost him the lb readie mony: The question is now at what price he ought to sell the waight: To wit lb to be paide the at monthes, and the residue at the end of monthes, so that he may gaine after the rate of lb vppon a lb for monthes.
SÃ©eke firste by the Rules of payment what tearme both the payments ought to be paid at once, where the multiplied by his terme monthes maketh monthes: Likewise the next paime~t which is multiplyed by his tearme monthes maketh monthes: both which added togither maketh monthes: which is the time, that both the payments ought to be paide at once.
The~ say by the Rule of if monthes doe giue me lb what wil monthes giue? Multiplie and diuide and you shal finde lb.
The~ saye againe by the rule of If one pound cost me what wil pound cost: multiplye and
Then say once againe if lb do giue what wil lb giue? multiplie and diuide you shall finde lb And for that price ought to sell lb of Synamon to be paid at two seueral payments aforesaid: To gain therby after the rate of lb vpon the lb in monthes.

Item whether doeth he lose more that giueth lb vpon the or he that rebateth lb vpon the Answer.
First note that he yt giueth lb vpo~ giueth for And he which rebateth lb vpon the giueth the for Therefore say by the Rule of thrÃ©e, if be deliuered for for how much shall the be deliuered? multiplye and diuide and you shal finde and he which rebateth in ye maketh but of so yt he looseth in ye And ye other which giueth vpon the looseth but vpon the Thus you may sÃ©e that he which rebateth in the looseth more by in the lb. than the other whiche gaue vpon the for tare and cloffe.
If lb of any thing coste me The question is howe shall sel the lb to gaine after the rate of lb vpon the pound.
Answer Saie by ye rule of if lb giue lb. what shall giue? multiply diuide, and you shal finde lb Then saye againe if lb be worth lb what is one pound worth? multiplye and diuide, and you shal finde And so muche is the pounde worthe in gayning pounde vpon the pounde.
Item a Grocer hath bought waighte of a commoditie for lb The question is now to know how many pou~ds ther of he shal sel for to gaine shillings in the C. waight.

And so many pound ought he to sel to gaine shillings in his C. waight.
If one pounde waight cost and sel the same againe for what is gained in pound? Aunswer.
You may saye if giue what will lb giue? But then when you haue sound you must subtract the product out of lb the rest is your neate gaine: Or else to produce the neate gaine in your worke at the firste: Then subtract the iust price out of the ouer price, as taught before in the firste beginning of losse and gain: And your conclusion shal be al one, multiply diuide by which of the two wayes you thinke good, and you shal find that he gaineth lb in the pound.
Item if the pound waight which cost be sold again for demaund what is lost in the lb of mony? Answer.

The ninth Chapter treateth of lengthes and breadthes of Arras, and other clothes with other questions incident vnto length and breadth.
IF a pÃ©ece of Arras be els and long: els and broad: how many els square doth the same pÃ©ece containe? Answer.
Multiply the length by the bredth that is to say by And therof wil come elles: so manye elles square doeth the same pÃ©ece containe.
Item more a pÃ©ece of Arras doeth containe elles square, And ye same being in length elles demaunde how manye elles in bredth the same pÃ©ece doth co~taine? Answer Diuide elles by and therof commeth So many elles doth ye same containe in bredth Item more a Merchant hath elles of Arras, at elles broade which he wyll chaunge with another man for a pÃ©ece of Arras, that is el square.
The question is howe manye elles of that squarenesse ought the first Merchant is to haue.
Multiplie the first Merchantes pÃ©ece his length by his breadth, and you shall find it containeth elles, which elles you shall diuide by and you shall finde elles: and so many elles of that squarenesse, ought the latter Merchant to giue the first.
Item, a student hath bought yards of broade Cloth, at quarters broade, to make a Gowne: and should line the same throughout with Lambe, at a foote square eche skin: the question is now how many skinnes he ought to haue? Answeare.
SÃ©eke firste the number of yards square that his cloth containeth, which to doe, multiplie his length, by hys breadth, and you shal find yeards square: then say by the rule of thrÃ©e: if yeard square giue foote, what shal worke, and you shall finde skinnes.

Item, bought a pÃ©ece of Hollande Cloth containing elles Flemmishe: The question is, how many Elles Englishe it makes? Answere.
You muste note, that Elles Flemmish do make but Elles Englishe: Therfore say by the Rule of thrÃ©e: if elles Fle~mish make but elles english, how many Elles Englishe will Elles Fle~mish make? Multiplie and diuide, and you shall finde and so many Elles English doth Elles Flemmish containe.
Item more, haue bought Elles Flemmish, of Arras worke at two Elles broade, Flemmish, and woulde line the same with Ell broad Canuas of English
measure: The question is, howe Elles English will serue my turne? Answere.
For as much, as elles English are worth elles Flemmish: therfore put elles English into his square: in multiplying by himselfe, whiche maketh Likewise multiplie the English ell which is quarters euery way into himself squarely, and you shal finde Then multiplie whiche is the length of the pÃ©ece, by whiche is the breadth, and thereof commeth then say by the rule of as before: if elles square of Flemmishe measure be worth elles square of Englishe measure, what are of Flemmish measure? multiply and diuide, and you shal find elles English.
The same is also wrought by the backer Rule of in sÃ©eking the squares contained in the Flemmish ell of elles broade (which are and also in sÃ©eking the squares conteined in the English ell (which are then say by the Rule of backward: if quarters require elles, what shal quarters giue? Multiply, diuide by ye Rule of Reuerse, you shal finde as before elles Englishe.

ITem, lent my friend lb at Interest for moneths to receiue after the rate of lb in the for monethes: The question is, what the Interest commeth it? Answere.
Say by the firste parte of the Rule of numbers forwarde: if lb in monethes gaine lb what shall gaine in moneths? Multiplie the firste by the seconde for your Diuisor: and the other three the one into the other for your diuide~d: and you shall finde lb
Item a friend of mine receiued of mÃ©e lb for the Interest and Vse of lb for monethes terme: the question is now, what he tooke in the lb for moneths after that rate.
Say by the first part, or rule of numbers forward: if lb in moneths did pay lb what doth lb in moneths, take after that rate? worke, and you shall finde lb and so much he tooke vpon the lb for monethes.
third question and Proofe also wrought by the backer rule of Numbers.
Item, lente my friende lb to receyue for the Interest thereof: after
the rate of lb in the lb for monethes: The question is now, how long time my friend ought to haue the vse therof, that it may be returned with lb gaines.
Say by the Backer Rule of numbers: if lb in monethes doe gaine lb how long time shall lb be a gaining of lb Multiplie the firste and the second into the laste for your diuidend: and the thirde and fourth multiplie togither for for your diuisor: And then diuide and you shal finde moneths: the iuste time that my friend ought to vse it, to retourne it with lb gaine.
fourth deriued question out of this branch which is a Proofe of this last, and also of the other two going before.
ITem, how much money ought a Merchant to deliuer after lb in the for moneths that in moneths may gaine lb

But moste briefly it is aunswered by the Backer Rule of numbers, where argue thus, saying: if lb be monethes a gaining of lb then but for moneths terme, onely to take lb muste nÃ©edes be a good rounde summe: to worke it, sette your number thus, multiplying the firste into the second: and also by the product of the fift for your diuidend: and the third and fourth togither with the Denominator of your Fraction, for your Diuisor: then diuide, and you shal find as before lb The true solution to your question.
The tvvelfth Chapter treateth of the making of Factors which is taken in twoo sortes.
THe first is when the estimation of the Factor, is taken vppon the sending of the Merchant: as if the estimation of his person be it is vnderstoode, that he shall haue of the gaine, and the Merchaunte the other Â¼.
The other sorte is when the estimation of his making is out of the sending of the Merchaunt: as if the order and agrÃ©ement betwÃ©en them were such, that the Merchant shall putte in lb and the Factor for hys making shall haue Â¼: neuerthelesse he shall haue but of gaine or profit: for the of is (for the estimation of his making) which with the lb make lb wherof the lb is
into the handes of hys Factor: vnder suche condition, that the saide Factor shall haue Â¼: And after certayne time, they finde in profite lb demaunde howe muche the Merchant shall haue hereof, and howe muche oughte the Factor to haue? Answere.
When the estimation of the Factor is out of the sending of the Merchaunt, it maketh math for the Merchant math for the Factor But if that his estimation be at the sending of the Merchaunt, then it maketh but math for the Merchant math for the Factor.
For the Merchaunt is then to haue and the Factor Â¼.
Merchant doth putte into the handes of his Factor lb the Factor lb to haue the of the profite: demaunde nowe, for howe much his person is estÃ©emed: when the same is counted vpon the sending of the Merchant.
According to the tenor and order before prescribed in the firste Rule: That is, if his estimate be Â¼, he shall haue the of the gaine.
Therefore saye by the Rule of direct: If taken putte in lb what is ye estimate, or putting in of taking? Multiplie, and diuide, and you shal find lb and so much is the person of the Factor estimated.
To finde the estimation of the person of the Factor, you shall consider, that sÃ©eyng it was agrÃ©ede betwÃ©ene them, that the Factor shoulde take the then the Merchaunt shall haue the residue, which are wherefore the gaine of the Merchant, vnto that of the Factor is in such proportion as vnto Then if you will know the estimation of the person of the Factor: Say, if giue what
will giue? multiply and diuide, and you shal find lb And so much is the person of the Factor estÃ©emed to be worth.
Other conditions then these aforesaid, may also be betwÃ©ene Merchauntes and Factors without respect, either of sending or not sending of the Merchaunt: where most commo~ly the estimation of the bodie of the Factor is in suche proportion to the stocke whiche the Merchaunt layeth in, as the gaine of the saide Factor is vnto the gaine of the Merchaunte.
As thus: if a Merchant do deliuer into ye ha~ds of his Factor lb he to haue half the profit: The person of the said Factor shal be estÃ©emed to bÃ©e worth lb And if the Factor do take but of the gaine: he shoulde haue but so much of the gaine as the Merchant taketh: which muste haue wherefore the person of the Factor is estÃ©emed but the of that which the Merchaunte layeth in.
And if the Factor did take the of the gain, then the Merchant shal take the residue whiche are wherefore the gaine of the Merchaunt vnto the Factor is then in suche proportion as vnto wherevpon if you wyll
then know the estimation of the person of the Factor.
Say if giue what shal giue? work and you shal find pounds: And so much is the person of the Factor estÃ©emed to be worth.
And if the Merchaunte shoulde deliuer vnto his Factor pounde and the Factor woulde lay in and his person to the ende he might haue the of the gaine demaunde howe muche shall his person be estÃ©emed? Answer.
Merchaunt hath deliuered vnto his Factor lb to gouerne in the trade of merchandise, vpon condition that he shall haue the of the gain, if any thing be gained: and also to beare the of the losse if any thing be lost: Now demaunde howe much his person was estÃ©emed at? Answer.
SÃ©eing that the Factor taketh the of the gaine, his person ought to be estÃ©emed
as muche as of the stocke, whiche the Merchant layeth in.
That is to saye the of pound which is The reason is, because of the gaine that the Factor taketh: is the of the of the gain that the Merchant taketh, and so the Factor his person is esteemed to be worth pound.
Now bicause he layeth in pound, and his person: it is agrÃ©ed betwÃ©ene them, that he shal take the of the gaine.
For as muche as the Factor taketh of the gaine, he taketh of that which the Merchant taketh: for are the of
And therefore the Factors laying in, ought to bÃ©e pounde, which is of pounde that the Merchant laid in: Then Subtract whiche the Factour did laye in from pounde whiche shoulde haue bene his whole stocke: And there remaineth pound: For the estimation of his person.
More, a Merchaunt hathe deliuered vnto hys Factour lb vpon condition that the Factor shal haue the gaines of lb as though he laide in so muche readie money: demaunde what portion of the gain the said Factor shal take? Answer SÃ©e what parte the lb (which the Factor layde in) is of whiche is the whole stocke of theyr company: And you shal find And such part of the gaine shall the Factor take.
But in case, that in making theyr couenauntes, it were so agrÃ©ede betwÃ©ene them: that the Factour shoulde haue the gaine of lb of the whole stocke whiche the Merchaunt layeth in: That is to saye of the lb then shoulde the Factor take of the gaine: for is of pounde.
The thirtenth Chapter entreateth of Rules of Barter, and exchanging of Merchandise, which is distinct into Rules, with diuerse other necessarie Questions incident therevnto.
TWo Merchauntes willing to chaunge theyr Merchaundise, the one with the other: The one hath broade clothes at lb the pÃ©ece: The other hath Mace, at the pounde.
The question is howe manye pounde of Mace, he oughte to giue him for his clothes, to saue himself harmelesse and be no loser.
SÃ©eke first by the Rule of thrÃ©e, what ye clothes cost at lb the pÃ©ece.
And you shall finde lb Then to finde the quantitie of Mace: Say againe by the rule of thrÃ©e, if buy one pound what shall lb buy me? Worke and you shal finde: lb of Mace.
And so many pounde oughte he to giue for his clothes.
Two barter, the one hath lb of Mace at the pound, to barter or change for broade clothes at lb the pÃ©ece, The question is howe many broade clothes he ought to giue for all his mace.
First saye if cost what you shal finde then say againe if lb giue cloth, what shall giue? worke and you shall finde clothes: youre desire.
Two chaunge merchaundise for merchandise the one hath Pepper at the pound: to sel for readie money: But in barter he will haue no lesse then the pound.
The question is nowe at what price he ought to deliliuer the ell in barter to saue him selfe harmelesse.
Saye by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct: if readie money giue in barter what shal giue in barter? you shal finde and at that price oughte the seconde Merchaunte to sell hys Hollande in barter.
Two barter the one hath Holland at in the ell to sell for readie money: And in barter he will haue the other hath Pepper at the lb to sel for readie money.
The question is now howe he ought to sel it in barter.
Say by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct if redie mony giue in barter, what ought to take in barter? multiplie and diuide and you shal finde shillings your desire.
Two barter, the one hath cloth of Arras at shillings the ell readie money: but in barter hÃ©e will haue shillings.
And the other hath white wines, which he deliuered in barter for lb for a Tunne.
The question is now what his wines cost the Tunne in readie money.
Say by the rule of thrÃ©e direct, if in barter giue but readie money: what did lb in barter cost? Work and you shal finde lb and so much cost his wines for a Tunne readie money.
The one hath wines white: at lb the Tunne to sell for readie mony: But in barter he deliuered it for lb.
The other to make his matche good and saue himselfe harmelesse: deliuereth Arras at the ell: The question is nowe what an ell of his Arras coste in readye money.
Saye by the Rule of thrÃ©e directe if lb in barter giue but in redie money: what shal yÃ©elde in barter?
Two barter, the one hath Carsies at lb the pÃ©ece, readie money: But in barter he wil haue lb.
And yet he wil haue the part of his ouerprice in readie money: And the other hath Ginger at groats the puund to sel for readie money.
The question is how he ought to deliuer the Ginger by the lb in barter to saue himselfe harmelesse and make the barter equal.
Answer Item, for the working of thys question and suche other the like, you muste vnderstande, if the partie ouerselling his wares require to haue also some portion in readye money: as math &c.
Then shall you rebate the same demaunded part whatsoeuer it be from the ouer price And also from the iuste price.
And those two numbers that shal remaine after the subtraction is made, shall be the two first numbers in the Rule of thrÃ©e.
shall be the thirde number, whiche by the operation of the Rule of thrÃ©e directe shall yeelde you a true solution: howe and at what price, you shal ouersel that your merchandise to saue your selfe harmelesse, and make the barter equal.
Take the (of eightÃ©ene) which is the ouerprice of his cloth: which of eightÃ©en: is sixe, whiche as appeareth here in the margent you must subtract math from there resteth
And also abate it from which is the iuste price of the cloth: and there remaineth which and are the two firste numbers in the Rule of thrÃ©e.
Then say by the Rule of thrÃ©e directe: if giue what shall giue? Multiply and diuide, and you shal finde And for so much shal the second Mercha~t sel his Ginger, or his commoditie in barter, to ballaunce the same equal.
Two barter, the one hath Fine Carsies at lb the pÃ©ece readie money: But in barter he will haue lb.
And yet he will haue the part of his ouerprice in readie mony: And the other hath Ginger, whiche he hauing cunning ynough to make the barter equal, deliuered for the pounde.
The question is nowe what his Ginger cost him in readie mony.
After you haue made the subtraction, abating the part of both fro~ and as before was taught you, then wil there remain and for your two first numbers in the Rule of thrÃ©e.
Then say, if twelue giue but eighte: what shall come of the ouerprice of the pounde of Ginger? Multiplye and diuide, and you shall finde your desire.
Two Merchaunts barter Merchandise for merchaundise, the one hath Denshire whits at lb the pÃ©ece readie money: but in barter he doth them awaye for lb
And yet he wil haue the parte of his ouerprice in readie money.
And the other hath Cottens at lb the peece readie money.
The question is now at what price he oughte to sel or exchange his Cottens in barter to saue him selfe harmelesse, and make the barter equal.
First sÃ©eke parte of lb whiche is lb which rebated from there resteth as appeareth by the example aboue saide which of also rebated from there resteth the two firste numbers in the Rule of thrÃ©e.
And the lb which is the neate price of the pÃ©ece of Cotten is the thirde number.
Then saye by the Rule of thrÃ©e derect: as was taught before: if
giue what shall lb giue? multiple and deuide and you shall finde lb the iuste price that he ought to deliuer his Cottens in barter.
Two Merchauntes wil chaunge Merchaundise for Merchandise, the one hath Carsies at the pÃ©ece to sell for ready monie: And in barter hÃ©e will sell them for and he will gayne after lb vpon the lb And yet he will haue the of his ouerprice in ready monie: The other hath Flaxe, at the pound readie monie: The question is nowe howe he shall sell the pound of his Flaxe in barter.
SÃ©e firste at lb vppon the lb what the commeth to, in saying by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct, if lb giue lb what multiplie and deuide and you shall finde lb of whiche the that he demaundeth in ready monie, is, lb the same abated from and also from
there will remayne shillings pence: and shillings pence, for the two first numbers in the Rule of thrÃ©e: And pence the price of the lb of flax for the thirde number.
And for so much shal he sel the pound of flaxe in barter.
Two are willing to exchaunge merchaundise: the one hathe Norwiche Grograines at shillings the pÃ©ece redie money: And in barter he will haue shillings, and he will haue the parte of his ouer price in readie money: The other hath Norwich Stockings at shillings the Doosen to sell for readie money: But in as much as the first Merchaunts Grograins are no better, he woulde deliuer them so to ballance the barter, that he may gaine after lb in the lb The question is now how he shall sell his hose the doosen in barter.
Say, if giue what shall giue, which is the iuste price of the dozen of stockings? multiplie, and diuide, and you shall finde Then take the of whiche is And subtracte it from and also from And there will remaine and for the two firste numbers in the Rule of thrÃ©e: and which is the iust price (with his gaine in the dozen of stockings) for the thirde number: Then multiplie and diuide, and you shall finde and for so muche he is to sell his dozen of stockings in barter.
Two Merchantes will chaunge theyr merchandise one with the other: the one hath Elles of Cambricke at the Ell to sell for readie money: but in barter he requireth And yet notwithstanding hÃ©e loseth by it after lb vppon the lb wherevppon he requireth the of his ouer price in readye money: And the other Merchant hauing skill ynoughe to make the
barter equal deliuereth English Saffron at the lb The question is now what his Saffron coste the pounde in readie money.
You muste firste sÃ©eke what is lost vpon ye lb which to do you may say if you please, if lb loose what shal loose? worke and you shall finde shillings (or eight pence) whiche muste be rebated from So resteth shillings still: or you may say if lb giue me but lb what shal giue? Worke this waye either and you shall finde also as before, directly in your quotient your desire.
Then are you next to cast vp what the elles of Ca~brick commeth to at the ell and you shall finde pounde: the whereof the Cambricke Merchaunt wil haue in readie money (which is pound) nextly you muste caste what the Cambrick co~meth to after his losse in the lb whiche as you founde is but an ell: and you shal find lb now must you subtract (his readie money which is lb out of lb also of lb.
And there wil remaine lb lb for your two first numbers in the Rule of thrÃ©e, and the ouerprice of your Saffron for the third nu~ber.
Then multiply and diuide, and you shal find and so muche didde hys Saffron coste in readie money.
Two Merchants barter, the one hath Clothes, to put away for readie mony at lb the Cloth: and in barter putteth them awaye for lb taking Hollande Cloth at the Flemmish Ell, whych was worth no more but The question is nowe, what Holland payeth for the Cloth: and what he winneth or looseth by the bargaine? Aunsweare.
Clothes at lb the Cloth, commeth to lb and put away at the pÃ©ece, maketh lb Then to finde what Holland payeth for the Cloth: Say by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct, if buy Ell: what lb worke, and you shall finde Elles: Nowe to finde the estate of his gaine or losse, you must sÃ©eke what his Elles commeth to at the Ell: worke by the Rule of Proportion direct, and you shal finde lb which is not so muche as his Clothes were worth in readie mony, by lb and so much lost the first Merchant
Venetian hath in London pÃ©eces of Silke, to put away for ready mony at lb the pÃ©ece.
But in Barter he delyuereth the~ for lb the pÃ©ece, taking woolles of a Felmonger at lb the C. waight which was worth no more but lb the C. in ready money: The question is now, what woolles payeth for the Silkes, and whiche of them winneth or looseth by the barter.
pÃ©eces of Silkes at lb is lb and at lb is lb Then to find what woolles payeth for the Silke: Saye by the rule of thrÃ©e direct: If buy me C. waight, what lb worke, and finde C. waight of wooll: Nowe to finde the estate of their gaine or losse, caste vppe his wooll at lb the C. (for so muche they were worth readie mony) and you shal find lb which is lb more than the Silkes were to be solde for in readie money: wherevppon the Venetian gained lb by the Barter.
wooll at lb the C. to sel for ready but in barter he will haue lb and an other doeth barter wyth hym for Silkes which are worth pounds a pÃ©ece ready money: The question is now, how he ought to deliuer his Silkes the pÃ©ece in barter? and howe manye payeth for the woolles.
Say by the Rule of Proportion, or the rule of thrÃ©e direct: If lb for a C. waight readie money yÃ©elde me lb what will lb yÃ©elde, which is the iust price of a pÃ©ece of Silke in barter? To make the Trucke equall: worke, and find lb the price of a pÃ©ece of Silke in barter: then saye, if lb require pÃ©ece of Silke, how many pÃ©eces of Silke are bought wyth lb whiche is the valewe of the C. waight of wooll at lb worke by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct, and you shall finde pÃ©eces of Silke, and of a pÃ©ece: and so many pÃ©eces of Silke payeth for the woolles, and neither partie hath aduantage of other.
Two Merchants wil change mercha~dize ye one wt the other: The one of the~ hath bÃ©ere, at
the Barrell to sell for ready money: but in barter he will sell the barrell for and yet he wil gaine moreouer after lb vpon the lb and the other hath white Spanish wooll at the Roue to sell for ready mony: the questio~ is now, how he shal sell the Roue of wooll in barter? Answere.
Saye if whiche is the iuste price of the barrell of BÃ©ere be solde in barter for for how much shal (whiche is the iuste price of the Roue of wooll) bÃ©e solde in barter? worke by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct, and you shall finde Then for because the firste Merchant will gaine after lb vpon the lb he maketh of his lb lb And therefore say by the Rule of thrÃ©e, if the second Merchant of lb doe make but lb howe much shall he make of Multiply, and diuide, and you shall finde of a penny: And for so much shal he sel the Roue of wooll in barter.
Two Merchants wil change their co~modities the one with the other: The one of them hath white Paper at the resme to sell for ready mony: And in barter
he will doe it away for and yet he wil gaine moreouer, after the rate of lb vpon the lb and the other hath Mace at the pound waight, to sel in barter: Now demaund what the pou~d did coste in readie money? Answere.
Say, if whiche is the ouer price of the paper in barter be come of the iuste price, of howe muche shall come Â½, which is the surprice of the pound of Mace in barter? Multiplie, and diuide, and you shall find Then for because the first Merchant of Paper will gaine after the rate of vpon the Say, if do giue what shall giue? worke, and you shal finde and so muche didde the pounde of Mace coste in readie money.
The fourteenth Chapter entreateth of Exchaunging of money from one place to an other.
EXchaunge is no other thing then to take or receiue money in one Citie, to render or pay the valewe thereof in an other Citie,
or else to giue mony in one place, and receiue the value thereof in an other, at terme of certaine dayes, moneths, or fayres, according to the diuersitie of the place.
But this practise chiefly consisteth in the knowledge of the Mony or Coines in diuers places, of which for thy benefite, (after a few examples giuen to the Introduction to thys worke) wil set down by certaine notes of diuersitie of the common and vsuall Coines in most places of Christendome for trafique.
And first will beginne at Antwerpe, where they vse to make their Accomptes by Deniers de gros: that is to say by pence Fle~mish, whereof doe make Flemmish, and doe make lb de Gros.
Item, a Merchaunte deliuered at Antwerpe poundes Flemmishe, to receyue in London, sterling for euerie Flemmishe: The question is nowe, howe muche sterling money is to be receyued at London for the saide pounds Flemmish? Answere.
Saye by the Rule of thrÃ©e, if Flemmishe giue sterling, what poundes Flemmishe? worke, and you shall finde lb and so muche sterling shal receiue in London for the lb Flemmishe.
Otherwise also wrought by Rules of Practise in taking the of the Flemmish money deliuered: and abating the same from the principall, the rest is Englishe money sterling, as before.
Merchant at London deliuereth pound sterling for Antwerpe at Flemmishe the pounde sterling: The question is, how muche he muste receiue at Antwerpe.
Say by the Rule of thrÃ©e, if lb sterling giue Fle~mish, what
lb sterling? worke, and you shall finde lb So many pounds Fleshmish shall he receiue at Antwerp for the said lb sterling.
In Londo~ lb sterling is deliuered by exchange, for Antwerpe at Flemmishe the lb sterling: The question is, what rate the Flemmishe money ought to be retourned to gaine lb vppon the lb sterling at London? Answer.
First say by the rule of direct: if lb sterling giue Flemmishe, what lb sterling? Multiplie, and diuide, and you shall finde lb The whiche to returne to gaine lb sterling in London.
require the excha~ge Flemmish, what the exchange to make lb styrling? worke by the Rule, and finde Flemmish, the effect in the question required.
If take vppe money at Antwerpe after Flemmish, to pay for the same at London sterling: and when the day of payment is come, am forced to returne ye same mony againe in Londo~ to pay my Bill of Exchange: So that for whiche take vppe here at London, muste paye at Antwerpe, demaunde whether do winne or lose: and howe muche in or vpon the lb of money? Answer.
Say by the rule of thrÃ©e: If giue what will lb giue? Multiplie, and diuide, and you shall finde lb whiche being abated from lb there will remaine and so muche do lose vppon the lb of money.
If take vp at London sterling to pay at Antwerpe and when the daye of payment is come my Factor is constrained to take vp money againe at Antwerpe, wherewith to pay the foresaide summe: and there he doeth receiue Flemish, forthwith muste pay at London: the question is now, whether do winne or loose, and howe muche vpon the lb of money after that rate.
Say by the rule of Proportion: if giue what will lb giue? Multiplie, and diuide, and you shall find lb from the which abate lb and there will remaine lb and so much is there gained vpon the lb of money.
In Antwerpe is deliuered lb Flemish by exchaunge for London, at sterling for euerie Flemmishe: The question is, at what rate the same is to be returned to gaine lb vpo~ the lb Flemish in Antwerp.
First say by the rule of thrÃ©e: if Flemish giue what shall lb
giue? worke, and you shall finde lb Then say againe by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct, if lb sterling giue me lb Flemishe, what shall sterling giue? worke and you shall find Flemish.
And at the same rate ought the same to be returned at Antwerpe to gaine lb vppon the Flemish.
Merchaunt of Antwerpe deliuereth lb Flemish, to receiue at London lb sterling: the question is nowe, how the Exchange goeth after this rate.
Say by the Rule of direct, if giue what giueth Multiplie, and diuide, and you shall find and for so muche goeth the Exchaunge.
Item, the Exchange from London into France, is not like as it is in Flanders, but is deliuered by the French Crowne, whiche is worth soulx Turnois the pÃ©ece.
Wherevpon also you muste note, that in France they make their acco~pts by Franckes, Soulx
and Deniers Tournois, whereof Deniers maketh Soulx Tournois, and soulx maketh lb Tournois, whiche they call a Liure or Franc.
But the Merchauntes to make their accompts do vse French crowns, whiche is currant among them for soulx Tournois: But by exchange it is otherwise, for it is deliuered but for Soulx Tournois the Crowne, or as the taker vp of the money can agrÃ©e with the deliuerer.
And note that this {water} Caracter representeth the Crowne by exchaunge, and is euer soulx Tournois or French money.
Merchaunt deliuereth in London lb sterling after sterling the Crowne, to receiue at Paris soulx Tournois for euerie Crown, demaund howe muche Tournois or French mony payeth ye billes for the said lb sterling.
Saye by the Rule of thrÃ©e, if sterling giue me Tournois, what shall lb sterling giue? Reduce ye pounds into shillings: then multiplie and diuide, and you shal finde Liuers soulx, Deniers, and Tournois, and so much paieth ye bils at Paris for ye said lb sterling.
Merchant deliuereth in Roa~, or elsewhere in Fraunce, lb or Francks: the whiche Francke or lb is soulx or pound Tournois, to receiue in London sterling for euery {water} of soulxe Tournois: The question is howe much sterling mony ought to receiue at London for my pound Turnois? Answere.
Say, if lb giue me what wil giue me? worke, and you shall find sterling, which maketh lb and so much money is to be receiued at London for the saide Liuers Tournois, after for euery crown of soulxe.
In London is deliuered lb sterling by exchange for Paris, at the {water} of soulx the question is at what price, the saide Crowne is to bÃ©e returned to gaine lb vppon the lb sterling at London.
Firste say by the Rule of thrÃ©e direct, if sterling giue soulx Turnois, what shall lb sterling giue? worke, and
Then the which to returne and gaine lb vpon the lb in London: Saye by the Rule of three direct: if Francks soulx yeelde lb. what the {water} of soulx? worke, and finde the effect required in the question.
Merchant deliuered in London lb sterling, to receiue in Biskaie for euerie Duckate of Marueides, the question is, howe many Marueides ought to receiue at Biskate.
Say, if sterling giue Marueides, what shall lb sterling giue? Multiplie, and diuide, and you shall finde Marueides, and so many oughte to receiue at Biskie for my lb sterling.
Merchant deliuereth in Bayon, Marueides. to receiue in London sterling, for euery Duckate of Marueides the question is now howe muche sterling money payeth the Billes of Exchange for the saide Marueides.
Say, if Marueides make Duckate, what Marueides? Multiplie, and diuide, and finde Duckates
Then saye againe, if Duckate giue what giueth Duckates? worke, and finde lb and whiche is worth partes of a penny.
Otherwise it is wrought more briefer at one working, as in the laste question before, in considering, that containeth Duckate, or Marueides.
Therefore say by the rule of if Marueides giue what Marueides: worke, and you shal also finde in your quotients: lb and so many pound sterling is to be receiued for the
In London lb deliuered by Exchange for Vigo Marueids the Duckate, of sterling, maketh Marueides: the whiche io returne and gaine lb vpon the lb in London: Saye by the rule of thrÃ©e directe, if lb require Marueides, what worke, and finde Merueides, prises of euerie
Duckate in returne, which is the effecte in the question required.
NOtwithstanding for thy further aide and benefite hereafter followeth speciall and moste briefe Rules of Practise for English, French, and Flemmish money.
The fifteenth Chapter entreateth of the saide Rules of breuitie, and of valuation of English, Flemish, and French money, and how ech of them may easilie bee brought to others value.
How brieflie to reduce lb and Flemish, into lb and Englishe, Sterling.
IT is to be noted, that pound Flemish maketh but lb. sterling, Flemishe, maketh sterl. and flem. sterl.
Wherin is euide~t, that there is lost (if it may be so called) when it is reduced into English money.
Wherefore to know how much lb. flemish maketh English, you must subtract from it beginning with the pounds, &c. and that whiche resteth after this subtraction is the sum required: so that lb flem. maketh lb sterling.
Note that a lb sterling, maketh lb flem. that is lb ster. maketh flem. and ster. maketh Flem.
So that there is gained (if it may so be called) of the summe being thus reduced to Flem.
Then to knowe how much lb ster. maketh Flem. subtract from your ster. the of the whole summe. and adde it to the same summe, and it maketh lb whiche is the summe required.
Ye shal note, that the equalitie of Flemish and French mony is this, that is to say, the lb
Flemish, maketh lb French or Turnois Flemish maketh French, a great Flemish, maketh French.
Ye must multiplie the whole number twice by beginning at and so forwarde: and the product of your second multiplication, diuide by so that worke is finished.
Or multiplie the saide summe by and take out of it adding it to the producte of your multiplication by and that is your number required.
So that as well by the one, as by the other, lb Flemish, maketh lb French or Tournois.
briefe Reduction of lb and French, into lb and Flemish.
Multiply lb fr. by and diuide the product twice by that is the saide number by and the product againe by and the quotient of this seconde diuision is the thing required.
To reduce lb and Sterling, into lb and French or Tournois.
The lb ster. maketh lb french, that is to say, lb the maketh and the peny frenche.
Wherefore to know what lb ster. maketh french, ye must multiply your whole sum by that is by and the product of it by and diuide thys second product by and that is the sum required.
Otherwise multiply the sum ster. by and adde twice to the product and it shall produce the sum required.
To know how much lb fren. maketh in sterling money, multiplie the sum by and diuide the producte by and at twice, and the last quotient shal be the thing required that is to say, lb maketh lb sterling.
Note, that when any money is giuen by exchange at London for Roan at Â½: or rather for the crown of french, there is neyther gaine nor losse, for it is one mony for an other, accompting lb French for lb sterling So the Gyuer loseth the time of payment which is about dayes, hÃ©e that taketh it, hath gaine of the same.
They of Rean that putte sorth, or take money by exchange for London, ought to haue like consideration.
Item, when any man giueth at London or rather to haue at one of the Faires of Lions a crowne de Marc, he that so giueth his mony, loseth the time, and he that taketh it, gaineth the same: for is equall in value to French.
He that putteth or taketh money at Lions for London, ought to consider the same.
Item, when anye deliuer in Antwerpe to receiue at Lions a crown of Marcke, hÃ©e that putteth it foorth, looseth the tyme, and hÃ©e that taketh it, gaineth the same: For groates Flemish is equall in valewe to French.
Thus for this time make an ende of the practise of exchaunge and the enstructions therevnto belonging, and according to my promise gratify such as are desirous to know the common coynes vsed for traffique among Merchauntes in these Cities following: Here followeth a briefe declaration of their monies and ye recknings and accompts of them.
The sixteenth Chapter contayneth a declaration of the valuation and diuersitie of coines of most places of Christendome for traffique: And the manner of exchaunge in those places from one citie or towne to an other, whiche knowne is righte necessarie for Merchauntes, by meanes whereof they doe finde the gaine or losse vpon the exchaunge.
ITem for as much as the greatest diuersitie of money of exchaunge is at Lions Therefore will beginne duely of the money of that place.
At Lyons they vse Franckes, Soulxes and Deniers Tournois: a Francke maketh
Soulx, and one Soulx Deniers: But the Merchants to kÃ©epe their bookes of accompts doe vse French Crownes of the marke at Soulx the pÃ©ece, and doe diuide it into and
Item a Marke of golde {water} of the Marke, whiche serueth for exchaunge.
The ounce into pe~ce or Deniers, the Denier into graines: And so the sum or whole by imagination or gesse.
Also at Lyons there are fayres in a yere, at the which they do commonlye exchaunge, whiche are from thrÃ©e monthes to thrÃ©e monthes.
At Geanes they vse the Soulx: on Ducket maketh lb.
At Naples they vse Duckets, Tarie, and Graines: The Ducket maketh Taris, one tarie graines, but they take Duckets (whiche maketh thirtie taries) for the ounce.
Ducket maketh Carlins, a Carlin graines, so that Carlins make a Tarie, and graines make a Ducket.
At Rome they vse Duckets of the Chamber, one Ducket is worthe Guylis, and a Guili Soulx.
At Uenice they vse Duckets Curraunts at Soulx a peece or Deniers, one Denier maketh picolis.
At Falerine and Messine they write, after ounce, tary, graynes, and ounce is worth Duckets, or taris, and tary is twenty graines, and graine picolis, One Ducket is also worth Carlins,
At Milan they vse lb. of Duckettes imperials, and {water} of exchaunge is worthe lb.
At Lucques, Florence and Aucone they vse the {water} of gold: in gold the French Crowne is worth lb. but at Buloigne, lb. At Barselon they vse the soulx, the Ducket of exchaunge is worth soulx.
At Valence and Saragosse they vse the Liuer, Soulx and Denier, the Frenche crowne of exchange is worth soulx, and soulx is Deniers.
At the Fayres of Castill they vse the Meruaidies, the Ducket is worth Meruaidies.

At Noremburge, Franckford, and Auguste in Germanie they vse the Krentzers, whereof make a Floryn.
At Antwerpe they vse lb. and de Gros, and they exchaunge into the Denier de Gros.
At London they vse the lb sterling and sterling and they exchaunge in sterling.
Item at Lyons there is exchaunge in thrÃ©e sorts, at the cities and townes following.
Firste they deliuer at Lyons one Marke to haue or receiue at Naples almoste Duckets: at Venice, Duckets corrant, at Rome Duckets of the Chamber, Luques and Florence {water} of Gold, at Milan {water}.
And contrariwise at the saide Cities aforesaide they doe giue so muche of money to haue a marke at Lyons.
Secondlie they giue at Lisbone one {water} of Marke of soulx Turnois a pÃ©ece to haue at Gennes, almost Soulx.
At Palerme and Messine almoste Carlins: at Barselone soulx at Ualence or Saragosse soulx.
At the fayre at Castili Meruaides: at Rats: in Antwerpe Deniers de Gros: and at London sterling.
And contrariwise they do giue in the said Cities almoste as muche of their money to haue a Fre~ch Crown of the Marke at Lyons.
Thirdlye they doe giue at Lyons a {water} of the sunne to haue almost Krentzers at Franckforde, Auguste, Norenberge, or other Cities in Almaine.
Also at Lyons only they do pay the chaunge the in gold, and in mony, or else al in money in giuing for the hundreth.
Item at Naples they giue or deliuer almost Duckets to receiue at Rome, Duckets of the chamber at the old value.
Through Luques and Florence they deliuer Duckets Carlins to receiue there almost {water} of gold.
Through Palerme Messine one ducket of Tary to receiue there almost graines.
The whole sum to be paide within dayes after the sighte of the bil of exchaunge.
Also at Naples they deliuer one Ducket to receiue in Antwerpe almost or Deniers de Gros. within monthes: At London almost sterling, in months: At Barselone almost Soulx within monthes: At Ualence almost soulx wtin monthes: At Lisbone Raies, within monthes: and at the fayre at Castil, almost Merueydes at the same faire.
At Venice they deliuer Duckets curraunte to receiue in Almayne almoste
At Lucques and Florence almost {water} of gold in dayes.
Likewise at Uenice they deliuer a Ducket curraunt to receiue at Palerme and Messine, almoste Carlins, at Milan almoste
As touching the exchaunge, it is necessarie to vnderstande or knowe the Pair which the Italians call Pari which is no other thing than to make the money of the change of one Citie or towne to or with the money of an other, by meanes whereof they doe finde the gaines or losse vpon the exchange.
Item hauing receiued letters of credite of one of Antwerpe that the {water} of the sunne is there worth soulx.
The question is what the same is worth at London when the Pair or exchaunge goeth for Answer.
Saye if giue but what giueth worke and finde and so muche is the {water} of the sunne worth at London.
The seuenteenth Chapter conteineth also a declaration of the diuersitie of the waightes and measures of moste places of Christendome for traffique.
At the ende of whiche discourse are two tables, the one for waighte, and the other for measure, proportionate and reduced to an equalitie of our Englishe measure and waighte, by the aide whereof the ingenious may easilye by the Rule of three, conuerte the one into the other at their pleasure &c.
AT London and so all Englande throughe are vsed two kinds of waights and measures, As the Troy waighte and the Haberdepoize: from the Troy waighte is deriued the proportion and quantitie of all kinde of drye and liquid measures, as Peckes, Bushels quarters &c. wherwith is bought and sold all kind of graine and other commodities mette by the Bushell.
And in liquid, Ale, BÃ©ere, Wine, Oile, Butter, Honie, &c. vppon these
groundes and statutes, is Bread made and solde by the Troy waight.
And so is golde, siluer, pearle, pretious stones, and Iewelles.
The least quantitie of this Troy waight is a graine, of these graines make a penny waight, penny waights an ounce: and ounces a pound: lb or pintes of this waighte maketh a quarte.
And so ascending into bigger quantities, is produced the Measures, whereby are solde our other naturall sustenaunce, vz. Ale, or BÃ©ere, with also other necessarie commodities, as Butter, Honny, Herrings, Eeles, Sope, &c. Al which last before rehearsed, though their Measures (wherein they are contained) be framed and deriued from the Troy waight: yet are they in traffique, with diuers commodities, as Lead, Tinne, Flare, Waxe, with all other commodities both of this Realm, of other Forraine Countries whatsoeuer, bought solde by the Haberdepoise waight, after ounces to the pounde, and lb to the C. waight.
And vnto euerie C. is allowed lb weight at the common beame.
From hence is also deriued the wey of Suffolke ChÃ©ese whyche containeth Cloues, lb to a Cloue, and weygheth in all lb And
also the barrell of Suffolke Butter is or shold be of like waight with the wey of chÃ©ese: vz. lb
More of these lb make a stone: And stone co~taineth a sacke of english Wooll.
Forraine Woolles, to wit, French, Spanish, Estrich, is also solde by the pound or C. waighte, but most commonly by the Roue, lb to a Roue: other commodities of tale are bought and sold by the C. fiue score to the C. Except headed ware, to wit, cattel, nailes, Fish, whych are sold after sixe score to the C. Ther is also two other sorts of Measures, to wit, the Ell, and the Yeard.
By the Ell is vsually mette linnen Cloth, as Canuas, &c.
At Antwerpe are also sorts of waights, their golde siluer waight, their common waight gold siluer is weighed by ye Marke, the Marke is ounces, the ounce Esterlings, and the Esterling as our graines, The Goldsmithes diuide that into smaller, but not the Merchantes: the proofe of Golde is made by Caractes, whereof maketh a Mark of fine Gold: the Karact is graines: the proofe of the money is made by Deniers,
deniers is fine: that is a Marke of fine siluer, the Denier also is diuided into graines, and the graine into quarters.
Item, Markes in Antwerp, Troy waighte, maketh at Lions Markes, ounces, and graines p~ At Noremburg Markes, ounces, quints, Deniers: at Franckford Markes: at Ausburge, Markes, ounces, quint: At Venice Markes, ounce, deniers, graines: At London lb.
The Marke of Golde or Siluer at Antwerp Troy waight, which is ounces maketh ounces common waight with which all other merchandize is weighed: So that the Troy waight is greater than the common waight by in the C. By this waighte of Troy they also wey Muske, Amber, Perle, &c.
All Silkes are bought at Antwerpe, by the Bruges Ell, whiche is greater than the common measure, by which they retaile by in the C. Their common Ell is of our yeard, and of our Ell. Lions.
At Lions is vsed sortes of waightes, whereof the firste is the common Towne
waight, with whiche they wey all kinde of Spicerie, and diuers other merchaundize.
The seconde is called Geneua waight, which is in the greater than the common waight, with which they weigh Silkes, &c.
The third is French waight, called commo~ly the Marke waight, and lb therof, maketh lb Geneua and of their common waight, with which French waight is weyed al things that payeth custome or toll.
At Lions is also vsed two sortes of Elles or Aulnes: The one wherewith they measure grosse Clothes, as Canuas, and suche like.
The other is called the French El or Aulne, with which they measure all other kinde of merchandize, whereof common Towne Elles maketh ordinarie French Elles.
At Roan Muydes of Salte, being the measure of ye place, make an hu~dreth at Armuiden in Zeland, and the C. of Bronage, measure of Armuiden maketh at Roan, Muids, Mines maketh a Last of Corne, a last of Dates, lb waight there maketh at London and at Antwerpe: And Elles make at London
lb waight of Noremburg, maketh at London at Antwerpe Â½: And Els of Nore~burg make at London at Antwerp &c. Lisbone.
The C. waight at Lisbone maketh Roues, euerie Roue lb So that their C. waight is lb and their pound containeth ounces, and lb of their waight maketh at London
Their Silke, cloth of Gold and Wollen is measured with a measure which they call a Cubite, containing about of a Varre of Castile: Howbeit, their common Measure is called a Varre which maketh Palmes containeth of a Varre of Castile: our ell of London is equall with the Varre of Lisbone.
All kinde of Merchandise brought from Flaunders, Roane, or Brittaine, payeth at Lisbone, as a duetie or custome to the King, in the C. whiche they call the tenth in Merchandize, and the other tenth in money.
Note also, that all kinde of Merchandize comming to Lisbone by land, payeth lesse in custome than that that commeth by water.
The Roue of Ciuill is lb Roues make their C. waight which is lb The lb of Ciuill maketh at London lb Their other common Measure is a Varre, whereof maketh at London Els: and at Rome Canes, &c. Venice.

Their other co~mon measure are Braces, whereof make at London Elles, at Antwerpe Â½, &c. Florence.
At Florence the lb waight maketh at Aquila, for Saffron and lb of Florence make at Roan but lb the waight of Florence, and that of Luke is all one.
Their other measures are Braces, wherof maketh at Antwerp Burges measure Elles, Braces there make at London Elles, &c. Lucque.
The Lucque Sattens are co~monly solde at Lions by waight, and lb maketh at Lions lb So that lb maketh at Lions but pounde.
Their other measures are Braces, wherof of them make at London Elles, at Antwerpe Elles, &c. Aquila.
At Aquila their lb maketh at London Â¼, their lb of Saffron maketh at Geneua but And pounde of Geneua maketh pound at Aquila.
At Valentia be sorts of waights, a great and a small: The C. waight of great waight containeth Roues: The Roue lb So the C. great waight is lb and the C.
waight small containeth but lb and is also parted into Roues whiche is lb to a Roue: By the small is solde the Scarlet graine, with all other kinde of Spicerie, and by the great is solde Wooll with all such like grosse wares: The lb of Silke at Valentia maketh at Lions lb Geneua waight: The Charge of greate Merchaundize at Valentia, containeth lb and in smal wares lb The waight here, and at Barcellone is al one: Their lb waight maketh at London lb and at Antwerpe

Palmes The eightenth Chapter treateth of Sportes and pastimes, done by Number.
IF you would know the number that any man doth thinke, or imagine in hys minde, as though you coulde diuine.
Bid him triple it, or putte twice so muche more to it, as it is: which done, aske him whether it bÃ©e euen or odde: if he say odde, bid him take to it, to make it euen: and for that kÃ©ep in your minde: now after he hath taken to it, to make it euen, bidde him giue away halfe, and kÃ©epe the other halfe for himselfe, which when he hath done, bid him triple that halfe: and againe after he hath tripled it, aske hym whether it be euen or odde: if he saye odde: then bid him take to make it euen againe: and for that last kÃ©epe in your mind, now after he hath made his number euen, bidde him caste away the one halfe, and kepe the other still: From which halfe that he kepeth, cause him sutlely to put away or giue you out of his nu~ber, for eche that he giueth you kÃ©epe in your minde, and therevnto ioine the which bade you kÃ©epe, and you
Imagine he thought the triple whereof to and because it is odde, he is to take to make it euen: which first giuen is for you to kÃ©epe in minde: Then the halfe of his being caste away, he reserueth still which after you haue bidde him triple, it maketh then in giuing of him againe to make it euen: vpon that laste reserue in your mind: then his halfe of maketh From whence he can giue you but once: Therefore that yÃ©elding to you and the that you kÃ©epe make your desire.
An other kinde of Diuination to tell youre frend, how many pence, or single peeces, reckoning them one with an other, hee hath in his purse, or should thinke in his minde.
Which to doe firste bid him double the pÃ©eces he hath in his purse, or the number he thinketh: if he participate hys number or
secreacie vnto some one friend that setteth by him that can but multiplie, ad neuer so little: if their number be greate, then shal they worke as you bidde them so much the surer.
Nowe after he hath doubled his number, bid him adde therevnto more, which done, bidde him multiply that his number by also, whiche done, bidde him tell you the iuste summe of his laste Multiplication, whiche summe the giuer thinking it nothing auaileable, because it is so greate aboue his pretended imagination: yet thereby shal you presently wyth the helpe of Subtraction tell his proposed number.
Imagine he thought double and math it maketh wherevnto if you adde it maketh whiche multiplied by as here is practi+sed in ye marge~t, it yÃ©eldeth which is the sum deliuered you in the work: then for a general rule, you shal euermore cut off the last figure towards your right ha~d, wt a dash of your pen, as here is performed, as a figure
nothing auaileable vnto your worke: and then rebate from your firste figure, after is cutte off: and the reste shall euermore be your desire, as by this example doth appeare.
If in any company, you are disposed to make them merry by manner of Diuining, in deliuering a Ring vnto any one of them, which after you haue deliuered it vnto them, that you will absent your selfe from them: and they to deuise after you are gone, which of them shall haue the kÃ©eping thereof: And that you at your returne wil tell them what person hath it, vpon what ha~d, vpo~ what finger, what iointe.
Which to do, cause ye persons to sit down al on a rowe, to kÃ©epe likewise an order of their fingers: nowe, after you are gone out from them to some other place, say vnto one of the lookers on, that hÃ©e double the nu~ber of him that hath the Ring, and vnto the double bidde him adde And then cause him to multiplie that Addition by And vnto the product bidde him adde the number of the finger, of the person that hath the Ring.
And lastly, to ende the work beyond that number towards his right ha~d, let him set downe a figure, signifying vppon which of the ioints he hath the Ring, as if it
bÃ©e vppon the seconde ioint, let him put down Then demaund of him what number hÃ©e kÃ©epeth.
And you shall haue thrÃ©e figures remaining at the least: the first towards your left hande shall signifie the number of the person which hath the Ring: the seconde or middle number shall declare the number of the finger, and the laste figure towardes your right hande, shall betoken the number of the ioint.
Imagine the seuenth person is determined to kÃ©epe the Ring vppon the fifth finger, and the third ioint: first double it maketh thereto adde it maketh whiche multiplied by yÃ©eldeth vnto which adde the number of the finger, and it maketh and beyond toward the right hand, set downe the number of the ioint, al maketh which is the number that is to be deliuered you, from which abating there resteth whiche prefigureth vnto you the seauenth person, the fifth finger, and the third ioint.
But note, that when you haue made your subtraction, if there doe remaine a in the place of tens, that is to say, in the seconde place, you must then abate from that figure which is in the place of Hundreds, that is to wit from the figure which is next your left hand, and that shall be worth tenths, signifying the tenth finger: as if there should remaine you must say, that the seuenth person vppon his tenth finger, and vppon his third ioint, hath the Ring.
And after the same manner, if a man doe caste Dice, you may knowe the points of euerie one of them.
For if you cause hym to double the pointes of one Dye, and to the double to adde and the same summe to multiplie by and vnto the product adde the pointes of one of the other Dice.
And behind the number towards the right hand to putte the figure which signifieth the pointes of the laste Die: and then to aske what number he kepeth, from which abate and there wil remaine figures, which doe note vnto you the pointes of euerie Die.
If thrÃ©e diuerse things are to be hidden of thrÃ©e diuerse persons, and you to diuine whiche of the thrÃ©e persons hathe the thrÃ©e diuerse things doe thus: imagine the thrÃ©e things to be represented by A.B.C The~ secondly kÃ©epe wel in your minde whiche of the persons you meane to be the first, seconde and third: Then take counters or stones, and your thrÃ©e things, And giue A. vnto the partie whome you imagine to be your firste man: and there withal giue him one of your counters in his hand: And B. vnto your seconde man: and ther withal counters: And vnto your thirde man, and there withall counters.
And leaue the reste whiche are stil among them, which done, seperate your self from them, afterwards bid them cha~ge the things among them as they shall thinke good, whiche done after they are agrÃ©ed, byd him that hathe suche a thing, as before you haue represented by for euery counter that he hath in his hand to take vp as manye moe, And for him that hathe for euerie one in hys hande to take vppe two: And for hym that hathe C. for euerye one in hys hande to take vp And the rest of them to leaue still vpon the boorde.
and the thrÃ©e persons being fullye printed in your minde, come to the table, and you shall euermore finde one of these sixe numbers or If therefore one remaine stil vpon the boorde, then haue they made no exchaunge, but kÃ©epe them still as they were deliuered vnto them: So that the firste man hath A. the second and the third C.
But if remaine, then the firste man hathe B. your second man and your thirde man C: the reste of the worke and the order therof are here apparant by the table following.
Another Diuination of a number vpon the casting of two Dice.
First let the caster cast both the Dice, and marke wel the number: then let him take vp one of them it maketh no matter which: and looke what number it hath in the bottom, and adde altogither: then cast the die againe, and kÃ©epe in his minde what altogither maketh: then let the Dice stande: bring wyth you and therevnto adde the rest of the pits that you sÃ©e vpo~ the vpper side of the Dice, and so many did the caster cast in all.

a fast sermon preacht on innocents day
epigraph matth


blessed are the

on this day a fast and feast do both justle together

and the question is which should take place in our affections
pray let solomon the wisest of kings and men be made doctor of the chaire to decide this controversie eccles


it is better to go to the house of

mourning then to goe to the house of feasting for it is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart
let us therefore dispense with all mirth for this time and apply our selves to lamentation


wee reade ezra

that when the foundation of the second temple was laid by zerubbabel the young men shouted for joy but many of the priests and levites and chiefe of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy
thus what if young men be so addicted to their toyes and christmas sports that they will not be weaned from them let not old men who are or should be wiser and therefore more sensible of the sinnes and sorrowes of the state let us who are priests whose very profession doth date us ancient be transported with their follies but mourne whilest they are in their mirth
the french proverb saith they that laugh on friday shall cry on sunday
and it may please god of his goodnesse so to bring it to passe that if we keep a sad christmas we may have a merry lent


this day is called innocents or childermas day a day which superstitious papists count unluckie and unfortunate and therefore thereupon they will begin no matter of moment as fearing ill successe should befall them
indeed could willingly have sent their follies in silence to hell lest by being a confuter become a remembrancer of their vanities but that this fond conceit must be rooted out of the minds of the ignorant people

why should not that day be most happy which in the judgement of charity charity which though not starke blind with bartimeus with leah is alwaies tender eyed sent so many saints by herods cruelty to heaven before they had committed any actuall sinne
well out of sacred opposition and pious crossing of popish vanities let us this day begin and this day give good handsell of true repentance
to the cloane all things are cleane
to the good all dayes are good we may say of this day as david of goliahs sword sam


there is none like that give it me
no day like this day for us to begin our sanctified sorrow and to hearken to gods word blessed are the


in this and the two next chapters christ having a mountain for his pulpit and the whole law for his text seeks to clear it from those false glosses corrupting the text which the priests and pharisees had fastened upon it and shewes that gods law was not to be narrowed and confined to the outward act alone but according to the will of the the surveyour that best knew the latitude thereof is to bee extended to the very thoughts of the heart and takes hold of mens wicked inclinations as breaches thereof and offences against it
we use to end our sermons with a blessing christ begins his with the beatitudes and of the eight my text is neither the last nor the least blessed are the


observe in the words the best worke and the best wages the best worke the best wages they are blessed
begin with the worke

which shall imploy my paines and your attention this day
now the goodnesse of peace will the better appeare if we consider the misery of warre
it is said gen


and it came to passe when abraham was come neere to enter into egypt that hee said unto sarai his wife behold now know that thou art a faire woman to looke upon
why now know thou art a beautifull woman did abraham live thus long in ignorance of his wives beauty did he now first begin to know her handsomnesse learned tremelius on the place starts and answers the objection now that is when abraham came into egypt as if he had said when see the tawny faces and swarthy complexions of the egptians thy face seemeth the fairer and thy beauty the brighter in mine eyes
must confesse ever prized peace for a pearle but we never did or could set the true estimate and value upon it till this interruption and suspension of it
now we know being taught by deare experience that peace is a beautifull blessing and therefore we will consider warre first in the wickednesse then in the wofulnesse thereof


first warre makes a nation more wicked
surely swearing and sabbath breaking do not advance the keeping of the first table
and as for the second table how hard is it in these distracted times to be practised yea it is difficult to say the lords prayer the creed or ten commandements the lords prayer for that petition and forgive us our trespasses as wee forgive them that trespasse against us
the creed for that article

the communion of saints which doth tye and obliege us to the performance of all christian offices charitable duties to those who by the same christ seekes salvation and professe the same true christian catholike faith with us the ten commandements for that precept thou shalt not kill and though men in speculation and schoole distinctions may say that all these may be easily performed in the time of war yet our corrupt nature which is starke nought in time of peace is likely to be far worse in warre and if these times continue am afraid wee shall neither say the lords prayer nor beleeve the creed nor practise the commandements
and as hard it will be preparedly and profitably to receive the sacraments when wee shall drinke christs bloud as on to day and go about to shed our brothers bloud as on to morrow


secondly let us consider the wofulnesse of war and that both in its selfe and in its attendance see a map of war drawne by a holy hand psal

the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriage their priests fell by the sword and their widowes made no lamentations
the fire consumed the young men
wee behold with contentment ripe fruit to drop downe to the ground but who will not pity greene apples when they are cudgelled downe from the tree
and the maidens were not given in marriage
so that the fairest flowers of virginity were faine to wither on the stalke whereon they did grow for want of hands to gather them
the priests were flaine with the sword sed quid cum marte prophetis well then there they were though they were none of the best of the

priests being lewd hophnee and phyneus and there they were killed for ought know if these times hold gods best samuels must goe the same way
and their widowes made no lamentation
you will say the more unnaturall women they no they made no lamentation either because their griefe was above lamenting such as onely could be managed with silence and amazement or else because they were so taken up with deploring the publike calamity they could spare no time for private persons to bemoane their particular losses


but warre is not so terrible in it self as in its attendants first the plague which brings up the reare of war the plague say which formerly used to be an extraordinary embassador in this citie of london to denounce gods anger against it but is of late grown a constant legier and for these many late yeares hath never been clearly removed from us surely some great unrepented sin lyes on this city that this constant punishment doth visit us which will be more terrible when it shall be extended over the whole realme


secondly famine a waiter in ordinary on warre
truly it may seeme a riddle and yet it is most true that warre makes both lesse meat and fewer mouthes first because in time of war none dare attend husbandry wherewith solomon saith the king himself is maintained
secondly because souldiers spoile more out of prodigality then they spend out of necessity when our saviour multiplied loaves and fishes there were those appointed who tooke up the twelve baskets of fragments but alas no such care is taken in souldiers

festivals
hitherto indeed wee have had plenty enough and as yet in this city are not sensible of any want
but you know next pharaohs full eares came pharaohs blasted ears next pharaohs fat kine came pharaohs lean kine pray god poor people sor this years store be not next year starved


thirdly wilde beasts see gods foure cardinall punishments reckoned up ezech


for thus saith the lord god for much more when send my foure sore judgements upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noysome beast and the pestilence to cut from it man and beast
some perchance wil say that there is more danger of wilde beasts in our iland which is invironed with water
truely there need no other wilde beasts then our selves who are lions beares boares wolves and tygers one to another
and though as yet wee were never plagued with wilde beasts yet wee know not how soone god may hisse for them over and for our new and strange sins cause new and strange punishments
now conceive a city as bigge as your thoughts can imagine and fancy the sword marching in at the and the plague comming in at the and famine entring in at the and wilde beasts passing in at the and all meeting together in the and then tell me how quickly will your voluminous citie be abridged to a poor pittance


but hitherto wee have only spoken of the miseries of war in generall but the worst is still behind for we are afflicted with civill war many warres have done wofully but this surmounteth them all
in civill war nothing can bee expected

but a ruine and desolaion
what said mordecai to hesther hesther

think not with thy selfe that thou shalt escape in the kings house more then all the jewes
so let none in what house soever in the kings house or houfe of lords or house of commons or strongest castles or walled towns or fenced cities flatter themselves with a fond conceit of their safety for if civill warres continue long they must expect as well as others to bee devoured yea none can promise great persons so much happinesse as to bee last undone for for ought any knowes it may come their turnes to be the first as being the fairest markes to invite envy and malice against them
meane time poore ireland which as the man in the vision cryed to saint paul come over into macedonia and helpe us which hath so long so often so earnestly intreated implored importuned our assistants must be lost of course
the protestants there which have long swom against the tide till their armes are weary must at last of necessity even give themselves over to bee drowned that harpe which when it was well tuned made so good musicke must now and hereafter for ever bee hung upon the willowes a sad and sorrowfull tree and our distraction will hasten their finall destruction
we reade deut

that in a great famine the eye of the mother shall be evill towards her son and towards her daughter shee shall grudge every morsell of meat which goes besides her owne mouth preferring nature before naturall affection
if these times doe continue london will grudge her daughter and england mother generally of ireland as a colony

deduced from it will grieve to part with the least meat money and munition to it

but all these mischiefes are nothing in respect of the last namely the scandal and dishonour which hereby will redound to the protestant religion whereof a true christian ought to be more tender and sensible then of any worldly losse whatsoever tell it not in gath nor publish it in ascalon lest the daughters of the philistims rejoyce lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph
what musick doth our discord make to the romish adversaries
we reade genes


and there was a strife between the of abrahams cattel and the of lots cattell and the cananite and the perizite dwelled then in the land
and abraham said unto lot let there be no strife pray thee betweene my wherein observe that the canaanites and perizites being there in the land is mentioned as a motive with abraham to make him make the speedier accommodation with lot lest the true religion and service of god should suffer in the censure of pagans by their discords being uncle and nephew ingaged in a brawle by their servants dissention
how many canaanites and perezites behold our bloudy differences and clap their hands to see us wring ours yea insult and rejoyce to see us sheath our swords in one anothers bowels wee used formerly to taske the papists of cruelty to protestants but hereafter as abner said to asahel sam


how then shall hold up my face to joab thy brother so how shall we looke in the face from this day forwards of our romish adversaries
tell them no more of their cruelty to

the protestants at hedlebergh of their cruelty to protestants of magdenberge of their cruelty to the protestants at rochel for if these wars continue wee are likely not onely to equall but to outdoe these cruelties one to another so that discharging this accusation of bloudinesse against them it will rebound and recoile in our own faces
put all these together that warre makes a land more wicked makes a land more wofull is bad in it selfe is worse in its traine destroyes christian people and disgraces christian profession and then will all have just cause to say as it is in my text blessed are the


if any object that peace also hath her mischiefes which attend thereupon for it brings plenty and plenty brings pride and pride brings plagues upon it peace makes men pampered and with jessurun to kick against god
war indeed brings cleannesse of teeth whilest peace brings fulnesse of bread which is as bad and worse making men presumptuously to rebell against god
the answer is easie woes may come from peace but they must come from warre miseries arise from the very use of warre which come but from the abuse of peace being essentiall to warre but accidentall to peace inherent alwaies in the one adherent too often to the other in a word in war calamities proceed from the thing it selfe in peace from men abusing it


object
but peace without truth is rather poyson then a cordiall let us not be like the thirsty traveller who so long longs for water that at last he drinkes mud and water together not only

without distinction or distaste but even with delight let us not with sampson so dote on the dalilah of peace as to get her love to betray truth wherein our strength lyes
some perchance would propound peace unto us but on such servile conditions as naash the ammonite offered a truce to the men of sam


on this condition will make a covenant with you that may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproacb upon all israel
and so if we will give in truth to boot and put out our owne eyes into the bargaine forfeit the true faith and knowledge of god with the purity of his service then perchance a peace may be proffered us but as peter said to simon magus act


thy mony perish with thee so let such a hellish peace perish with those that seek to promote it


in the answering of this objection give me leave as peter said act


men and brethren let me freely speake unto you of the patriarch david so let me boldly and fully speak in answer to the objection if leave be denied mee know whence my commission is derived am an embassadour for the god of heaven if speake what is false must answer for it if truth it will answer for me
and what have to say will divide into foure propositions


prop
cursed be hee that seekes to divide peace from truth
must confesse was never bred upon mount ebal neither did ever my tongue take delight in cursing
the rather because we may observe deut

that the most eminent tribes

from wch the princely priestly men descended levi iudah ephraim benjamin took their station in mount gerasin to shew that magistrates ministers are principally to inure their mouths to blessing
and yet for those that feek to sever peace from truth cannot refrain my self but must say cursed be they in the city and cursed be they in the field cursed be they in their basket and in their store cursed be they in the fruit of their body and in the fruit of their land in the increase of their kine and in the stock of their sheep cursed shall they be when they come in and cursed shall they be when they go out


pro

before this warre began wee had in england truth in all essentiall to salvation
wee had all necessary and important truths truly compiled in our
articles
we had the word of god truly preacht could wish it had been more frequently and generally the sacraments duly administred which two put together doth constitute a true church
paul cor

being to prove the resurrection of the dead presseth the corinthians with this among other arguments then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished
putting them a most uncharitable absurdity that in case the dead arise not againe they must be bound to confess that all the saints formerly deceased were perished
and surely such as deny that england before this warre began had all essentiall truth to salvation must of necessity split themselves on the same uncharitable rocke and passe a sentence of condemnation on all those which dyed in our church before these two yeares last past


pro
many errors in doctrine and innovation in discipline did creepe fast into our church
arminian positions tenents reason to gods grace invaded the truth of the word in many places
one ceremony begat another there being no bounds in wherewith one may sooner be wearied then satisfied
the inventors of new ceremonies endeavouring to supply in number what their conceits wanted in solidity and god knowes before this time where they had been if they had not been stopt


pro
the best and onely way to purge these errors out is in a faire and peaceable way for the sword cannot discerne betwixt error and falshood it may have two edges but hath never an eye
let there on gods blessing be a synode of truely grave pious and learned divines and let them both fairely dispute and fully decide whats true whats false what ceremonies are to be retained what to be rejected and let civill authortie stampe their command upon it to be generally received under what penaltie their descretion shall think fitting
but as long as warre lasts no hope of any such agreement this must be a worke for peace to performe
so then under the notion of peace hitherto we have and hereafter doe intend such a peace as when it comes we hope will restore truth unto us in all the accidentall and ornamentall parts thereof and adde it to that truth in essentialls to salvation which we enjoyed before this warre began and in this

sence will boldly pronounce blessed be the peacemakers

come we now to consider what be the hindrances of peace these hindrances are either generall or particular
the generall hindrance is this the many nationall sinnes of our kingdome being not repented of say of our kingdome not of one army alone
thinke not that the kings army is like sodome not ten righteous men in it no not if righteous lot himselfe be put into the number and the other army like syon consisting all of saints
no there be drunkards on both sides and swearers on both sides and whoremungers on both sides pious on both sides and prophane on both sides like jeremies figges those that are good are very good and those that are bad are very bad in both parties
never knew nor heard of an army all of saints save the holy army of martyrs and those you know were dead first for the last breath they sent forth proclaimed them to be martyrs
but it is not the sinnes of the armies alone but the sinnes of the whole kingdome which breake off our hopes of peace our nation is generally sinfull
the city complaines of the ambition and prodigality of the courtiers the courtiers complaine of the pride and covetousnesse of citizens the laity complaine of the lazinesse and of the clergy the clergie complaine of the hard dealing and sacriledge of the laity the rich complaine of the murmuring and ingratitude of the poor the poor complaine of

the oppression and extortion of the rich thus every one is more ready to throw durt in anothers face then to wash his owne cleane
and in all these though malice may set the varnish sure truth doth lay the

of particular hindrances in the first place we may ranke the romish recusants is not the hand of joab with thee in all this was davids question
sam


but is not the hand may we all say of jesvites in these distractions
many times from my youth up have they fought against me may england now say yea many times from my youth up have they vexed me but have not prevailed against me
at last the popish party perceived that the strength of england consisted in the unity thereof
sampson is halfe conquered when it is knowne where his strength doth lye and that it was impossible to conquer english protestants but by english protestants
is this your spite and malice you romish adversaries because you could not overcome us with spanish armadoes nor blowe us up with gunpowder treasons nor undoe us with irish rebellions to set our selves against our selves first to divide us then to destroy us
well god knowes what may come to passe
it may be when we have drunke the top of this bitter cup the dregs may be for your share and we may all be made friends for your utter ruine and destruction

next the papists the schismatickes are the hendrances of our peace
these know their kingdome

cannot be established but by warre as assured that the wisdome of the state is such as will blast their designes when matters are setled
have heard when a childe of a lawlesse church sure these if they might have their will would have a lawlesse church and a gospellesse too and yet they as falsly as fondly conceive that the state gives approbation and connivance to them
we read psalm


where gods spirit reckons up many sinnes which the wicked had committed that god saith these things hast thou done and kept silence thou thoughest that was altogether such a one as thy selfe but will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes
in which place of scripture three things are considerable
first god is said to keep silence when he doth not presently and visibly punish offenders psal

lord keep not silence and so psal

keep not thou silence god
god for reasons best known to himselfe and for some known to us namely to make wicked men swel and break with a timpany of good successe for the time does not outwardly expresse the dislike of their bad courses in inflictine a suddain and sensible puuishment upon them
secondly observe the false logick bad inference of wicked men· who who conceive that god is altogether such an one as themselves yea make accessary and confederate with them because silent therefore consenting qui tacet satis laudat
thirdly see time wil come when in time best known to himselfe he will publikely

reprove them and shew not onely his free dissent but full displeasure
thus schismatickes improve themselves upon the clemency long suffering of our state
because they are taken up with matters of higher concernment and are not at leasure to stoope to their punishment as imployed in businesse of more present and pressing importance separatists and sectaries conceive that they favour what they doe not punish
but time will come when to the glory of god and their own honour though slowly surely they will visit their offences and as the psalmist saith set their sinnes in order before them who have beene the partiall cause of the disorder and confusion of this kingdome

thirdly those are enemies to peace whose beeing meerely consisteth by warre and discention
indeed the truly noble english spirits desire a forraigne foe for a marke for their bullets but many there be rather turbulent then valiant who as demetrius by this craft they get their gaine desire a perpetuity of warre for their possession
we read in plutarch of one demades who by profession was a maker of coffins and he was banished out of rhe city of athens for wishing that hee might have good trading that wise sare truly interpreting the language of his wish as desiring some epidemicall disease his private profit being inconsistant with the publike flourashing of the
so those people who are undone and cannot live but by undoing of others

certainly wish no good to our church and kingdome but must needs be state barrettors to keep the sore alwayes raw betwixt prince and people

let us now come to see the meanes wherby private persons may and must endeavour the obtaining of peace the first is prayer pray for the peace of jerusalem let every one in that prayer which he useth in his family or private devotions build a roome more and inlarge it to pray for peace in our israell

secondly let us petition for peace not only to the god in heaven but to the gods on earth first to his majestie but alas there is a great gulfe between us him fixed so that they which would passe from hence to him cannot neither can they passe to us that would come from thence
the sins of our realm are amounted to such a height that we deserve this and worse punishment
next let us petition to the high and honourable court of parliament next under god and the king the hope and help of our happinesse let none say it is presumption to petition them as undertaking to tell them of what they are ignorant or to put them in remembrance of what they may forget for herein we apply our selfe to them in immitation of our accesse to god and surely their greatnesse cannot and their goodnesse will not be displeased in our compliance and conformity to such an architype
true it is that god matthew

our father knoweth what things we have need of before we

aske him and yet it is his will and pleasure to be sought too by our prayer
and so no doubt that high and honourable court though that they know fulwell that peace is that we stand in need of yet they take delight in our duty yea expect our service herin to petition for peace that so our begging of peace may in effect be a modest mannerly expression of an harty thanks for their long and constant endeavours herein
wherefore what tertullus said flatteringly to felex we may say truly and feelingly to them seeing that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by their providence

we accept alwaies and in all places with all thankfulnes
notwithstanding pray you that you of your clemency would heare us a few words
and let us in all humility not directing but beseeching them without a tumultuous thought most peacable and pathetically begge of them and sue unto them to continue their care in advancing a seasonable and happy accomodation that so the blessing pronounced in my text may lie both upon them and theirs blessed are the peacemakers

thirdly we must be content soundly to pay for peace we read exod

and he made the lever of brasse and the foot of it of brasse of the of the women assembling which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
it seemeth that the backsids of their were made of brasse which commonly with us are made of wood and they consigned them over for gods service and good reason too

for formerly they had given their eraerings for the making of a calfe justly therefore now they did pennance for their pride as counting it honour enough that that wherein they looked their owne faces should make the foot of gods leaver
but what should not people give to buy a true peace and a peace with truth how many yeeres purchase is it worth let us not thinke much to give all our superfluities but to give fome of our necessaries for the advancing and obtaining of it

fourthly ler us banish out of our mouthes all words and phrases of contempt and reproach could instance in the word but that it is beneath the majesty of a pulpit which the malice of men hath minted and fastned on opposite parties let us have no other christian name then the name of christians or other surname then christian protestants neither answering to nor calling others by any term of disgrace

fifthly let us with a speedy serious and generall repentance remove the crying sinnes of our kingdome which as long as they last wil bane all peace amongst us
say speedy least the physick come too late for the disease serious least the tent be too short for the wound generall least the plaster be too narrow for the sore
suppose that the sea should breake forth in this land as such a thing may come to passe the lord is king saith david let the earth rejoyce yea let the multitude of of the isle he glad thereatr psal

and good reason hath the iles to be glad as more particularly

concerned for if the water were not countermanded by gods prerogative royall it would speedily recover its naturall place above the earth
but suppose the sea should break into the land it is not the endeavours of a private man can stop it what if he goes downe with a faggot on his backe and a matrock on his shoulder and a spade in his hand his desire is more commendable then his discretion it being more likely the sea would swallow him then he stop the mouth thereof
no the whole country must come in children must bring earth in their hats women in their aprons men with handbarrowes wheelbarrowes carts carres waines waggons all must worke least all be destroyed
rather instance in this expression of the irruption of the sea because finde gods anger so compared in holy writ chron


david said god hath broken in upon mine enemies like the breaking forth of waters
so when a generall deluge and inundation of gods anger seaseth upon a whole kingdome it cannot be stopt by the private endeavours of some few but it must be an universall work by a generall repentance all must raise bankes to bound it
till this be done am afraid we shall have no peace and to speak plainly am afraid we are not yet ripe for gods mercy as gideon judg

had too many men for god to give victory to so we are too proud hitherto for god to give peace too many of us are humiliati but few of us are humiles
many by these warres brought loe but few made loely so that we are

proud in our poverty and as the unjust steward said to beg am ashamed so we are too stout thogh halfe starved on the bended knees of our soules with true repentance to crave pardon of god for our sinnes which till it be done we may discourse of peace and superficially desire it but never truely care for it or can comfortably receive it

and indeed wee may take forcible motives from our owne miseries to endeavour peace by all possible meanes for look upon the complexion of the warre and doth it not look of a most strange and different hue from other warres
the wars of germany which give me leave to say if we had pittied by the proxie of a true simpathy we had never so soon suffered them in our owne person were far lighter affliction then ours
in germany people when hunted with warre took covert in their fenced citties
but here in england we have no guard against wars blow but lye open to plundering and destruction
germany was a great continent bearing six hundred miles square so that whilst one part thereof was mowed downe with warre the other enjoying peace might grow up in the meane time
but little england great onely in her miseries severed by the sea from other countries and by devisions parted from het selfe is a morsell which civill warre will quickly devoure
thirdy in germany commanly they lay in garrison in winter and fought in sommer we read sam

and it came to passe at

the time when kings goe forth to battell
this all comments generally expound of the spring time but alas if we in our woes were antipodes to all others our miseries begin when others end in the winter time
pray saith out saviour that your flight be not in the winter nor on the winter fights woful fights sabboth wars sorrowful warres and yet such are these in our kingdome
lastly in germany papists did fight against protestants where as our intestine wars are against those that professe the same religion

it hath been a great curse of god upon us to make a constant misunderstanding betwixt our king and his parliament whilest both professe to levell at the same end
cannot compare their case better than to the example of ruben and judah gen
there ruben desired and endeavoured to preserve the life of his brother joseph and judah desired and endeavour to preserve the life of his brother joseph and yet these two imbracing different meanes did not onely crosse and thwart but even ruine and destroy the desires of each other for ruben moved and obtained that joseph might not be killed vers
and ruben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wildernesse and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father againe
judah also desired the same but being not privie to rubens intents and to avoid the cruelty of the rest of his brethren propounded and effected that joseph

might be sold to the medianitish merchants meetly so to preserve his life and thereby he did unravell all the web of rubins designes and frustrated his endeavours
thus when god will have a people punished for their sinnes hee will not onely suffer but cause mistakes without mending and misprisions without rectifying to happen betwixt brethren who meane and really intend the same thing so that they speake the same matter in effect and yet be barbarians one to another as either not or not right understanding what they say each to other
thus the maintaining of the protestant religion in the purity thereof the vindicating of the lawfull prerogative of the king the ascertaining of the just rights and priviledges of the parliament the defending of the dues and properties of the subject are pleaded and pretended on both sides as the ultimate ends they aime at
well as our saviour said to the blinde man mat

according to your faith be it unto you so according to the sincerity and integrity of their hearts whom god knowes means most seriously be it unto them we wish them good victory in the name of the lord and yet even herein a friendly peace were as much better then victory it selfe as the end is better then the means for blessed are the

objections
but may some say though we doe never so much desire peace we shall not obtaine that blessing which is pronounced in my text for the peacemakers are to be blessed
and

it is to be feared that our breaches are too wide to be cured and gods justice must have reparation upon us

by are to be understood not only the effectours of peace but even the affectours of peace shal be blessed
rom

if it he possible as much as in you lyeth live peaceably with all men
god out of his goodnesse measures mens reward not by their successe but desires cor

for if there be first a willing minde it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not

and yet am not out of heart but that there is hope of peace and that as yet our sinnes are not sweld so high but that there is mercy with god for our nation
first my hope is founded on the multitude of good people in this land which assault and batter heaven with the importunity of their prayers
we read of ptolomeus philodelphus king of egipt that he caused the bible to be translated by seventy interpreters which seventy were severally disposed of in seventy severall cels unknown each to other and yet they did so well agree in their several translations that there was no considerable difference betwixt them in rendering the text an argument that they were acted with one and the same spirit
surely it comforts me when call to minde what shall say seventy nay seven times seventy yea seaventy hundred yea seventy thousand which are peaceable in

israel which on the bended knees of their souls daily pray to god for peace
these though they know not the faces no not the names one of another nay have neither seen nor shall see one another till they meet together in happinesse in heaven yet they unite their votes and centre their suffrages in the same thing that god would restore peace unto us who no doubt in his due time will heare their prayers

the second thing that comforts mee is when looke on gods proceedings hitherto in our kingdome his judgements seeme to be judgements rather of expostulation then of exterpation we read exod

that god being angry with moses for not circumcising his sonnes it came to passe by the way in the iane that the lord met him and sought to kill him
sought to kill him strange did god seeke to kill him and not kill him speake lord speake to the fire and it shall with flashes consume him to the ayre and with pestilent vapours it shall choake him to the water and with deluges it shall him to the earth and with yawning chops it shall devoure him
well the meaning is this god sought to kill him that is in some outward visible manner whereof moses was apprehensive god manifested his displeasure against him that so moses might both have notice and leisure to divert his anger with removing the cause thereof

he that saith to us seeke and yee shall finde doth himselfe seeke and not finde and good reason too for he sought with an intent not to finde
thus may say that for these last foure yeeres god hath still sought to destroy the kingdome of england manifesting an unwillingnesse to doe it if in any reasonable time we would compound with him by serious repentance
thus the loving father shakes the rod over his wanton childe not with an intent to beat him but to make him begge pardon and such hitherto hath beene gods dealing with our nation that he even courts and woes us to repentance as loath to punish us if wee would understand the signes of his anger before it breake out upon us

but if all faile yet those that are in their desires doe enter a caveat in the court of heaven that if warres doe ensue yet for their part they have laboured against it
if a man slaine were found in the field and it not knowne who slew him god provided deut

that the elders of the next city should wash their hands in the blood of an heifer and say our hands have not shed this blood neither have our eyes seen it be mercifull lord unto thy people israel whom thou hast redeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israels charge and the blood shalbe forgiven them
so this one day will be a comfort to the consciences of godly minded men

that they may appeale to the god of heaven how they have prayed heartily for peace have petitioned humbly for peace have been contented to pay deerly for peace and to their powers have endevoured to refraine themselves from sinnes the breakers of peace and therefore they trust that christian english protestant blood which shall be shed which hath beene and hereafter may be shed in these wofull warres shall never be visited on their score or laid to their charge

but if all faile and if we must be involved in a finall desolation then let us goe to the assurance office of our soules and have peace of conscience with god in our saviour
it was wont to be said a mans house is his castle but if this castle of late hath proved unable to secure any let them make their conscience their castle if beaten from all our parapets and outworkes let us retire to this strength for our defence it may seem be it spoken with all reverence a blunt expression of the holy spirit luk

be not afraid of them that kill the body and that have no more that they can doe yea but one may say they may kil me with torment and with torture make me drop out my life by degrees why the totall some of their malice is but to kill the body and then they have no more that they can do
but they may forbid my body christian buriall herein they do not do but suffer for the living wil be more troubled then the dead if thy corps be not committed to earth

so that this in effect is just nothing
then let drums beat and trumpets sound and banners be displaid let swords clash and pikes push and bullets flye and cannons roare warre doe thy worst death doe tby worst devill doe thy worst their souls shalbe happy that sleep in the lord for they rest from their labours
however if it be possible and if so great mercy be stored up in god for us we would rather have peace in this world and on the promoters therof let the blessing in the light and rest blessed are the peacemakers

and now as began with the mention of the fast so to conclude with the same let us keep this day of humiliation holy to the lord
some perchance may make this but a and fast for some private and sinester ends but every one that will may make it a true fast to himself therin to be grieved for the misery of gods saints
god complaines amos the sixt of the gluttonie of the israelites wherein wee finde the compleat character of an epicure making wantons of his five sences entertaining their eyes with bedsteads of ivory verse
curious to behold for the thereof pleasing their feeling they stretch themselves on couches courting their eares they chant to the violl ver
contenting their taste and making that sence a pander both to gluttony and drunkennesse they eate the fat of lambes and drinke wine in boules verse
delighting their smell and annoynt themselves with the chiefe oyntments and then concludes

all with this sharpe close but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph
wherein the prophet alludes to the story of joseph gene


who was put into a pit without water except such as flowed from his eyes where he must either dye for want of meat or dye for being meat to wilde beasts and yet in the meane time his brethren though they saw the anguish of his soul gene


made visible and transparent through the windowes of his weeping eyes bended knees begging tongue folded hands did most barbarously sit down to eate dare boldly say they said no grace with a good heart either before meate or after

just such is the cruelty of many of us who professe christianity to our brethren in the countrey because as yet the city of london is as the land of goshen being light when all the rest is darkned with miseries they lay not to heart the afflictons of joseph which our do suffer
where is the man that sounds a retreat to his soul when he feeles it marching to fast in myrth who abates a dish of his table out of principles of conscience though perchance many doe out of reasons of thrift and am affraid all shortly must doe out of necessitie
well if we be not the more penitent it may come to passe that that sad dance which hath beene led all over the kingdome will come to us to this city at last and god grant we pay not the musique for all the rest

remember uriah who kept a campe in

the court and would not enjoy those pleasures the marriage bed reached unto him
thinke of mephibosheth lame but loyall who went not out with david in his person but attended him with his affections and during the kings absence dressed not his feet enough to gangrene them as not caring for his owne feet whilest his soveraignes head was in danger
seriously consider nehemiah who sympathized with the calamities of jerusalem which sadded his countenance even in the presence of the king
two things onely can make a courtier sad sicknesse which cannot be dissembled and his princes displeasure
nehemiah had neither of these he was in perfect health and he stood rectus in curia right in his soveraignes esteeme as appeares nehemiah

by the kings favourable and familiar questioning him why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sicke so then it was nothing else but the impression of the suffering of gods saints which clouded the brightnesse of his countenance with sadnesse
and god grant we having the same cause we may have the same compassion with him
amen

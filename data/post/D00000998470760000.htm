COMPILED BY THE GENtlemen of the Inner Temple, and by them presented before her MAIESTIE.
Newly reniued and polished according to the decorum of these daies.
By R. W. [Figure: LONDON, Printed by Thomas Scarlet, and are to be so by R. Robinson.
To the right VVorshipfull and vertuous Ladies, the L. Anne Graie, the Ladie Marie Peter, long health of bodie, with quiet of minde, in the fauor of God and men for eer.
IT is most certaine (right vertuous and wershipfull) that of all humane learning, Poetrie (how contemptible so euer it is in these daies, is the most ancient) and in Poetrie, there is no argument of more antiquitie and elegancie than is the matter of Loue; for it seemes to be as old as the world, to beare date from the first time that man woman was: therfore in this, as in the finest mettall, the freshest wits haue in all ages shown their best workmanship.
So amongst others these Gentlemen, which with what sweetnesse of voice and liuelinesse of action they then expressed it, they which were of her Maiesties right Honorable maidens can testifie.
Which being a discourse of two louers, perhappes it may seeme a thing neither fit to be offered vnto your Ladyships, nor worthie me to busie my selfe withall: yet can tell you Madames, it differeth so farre from the ordinarie amorous discourses of our daies, as the manners of our time do from the modestic and innocencie of that age.
And now for that wearie winter is come vpon vs, which bringeth with him drouping daies and tedious nights, if it be true, that the motions of our mindes follow the temperature of the aire wherein we liue, then thinke, the perusing of some mournfull matter, tending to the view of a notable example, will refresh your wits in a gloomie day, ease wearines of the louring night.
Which if it please yo ye also for a solemne reuell against this Festiuall time, for Gismunds bloudie shadow, with a little cost, may be intreated in her person to speake to ye.
Hauing therfore a desire to be knowen to your deuised this waie with my selfe to procure the same, persuading my selfe, there is nothing more welcome to your wisedomes, then the knowledge of wise, graue, worthie matters, tending to the god instructions of youths, of whom you are mothers.
In this respect therefore, shall humblie desire ye to bestow a fauour able countenance vpon this little labor, which when ye haue graced it withall, must will acknowledge my selfe greatly indebted vnto your Ladyships in this behalfe: neither shall amongst the rest, that admire your rare vertues, (which are not a fewe in Essex) cease to commend this vndeserued gentlenes.
Thus desiring the king of heauen to increase his graces in ye both, granting that your ends may be as honorable, as your liues are vertuous, leaue with a vaine babble of many needlesse wordes to trouble you longer.
To his frend R. W. Mar R: VV. looke not now for the tear of an intreator, wil beg no longer, and for your promises, wil refuse them as bad paiment: neither can be satisfied with any thing, but a peremptorie performance of an old intention of yours, the publishing meane of those wast papers (as it pleaseth you to cal the~, but as esteem them, a most erquisite inuention) of Gismunds Tragedie.
Thinke not to shift me off with longer delayes, nor alledge more excuses to get further respite, least arrest you with my Act est, and commence such a ute of vnkindenesse against you, as when the case shalbe scand before the Judges of courtesie, the court wil crie out of your immoder at modestie.
And thus much tel you before, you shal not be able to wage against me in the charges growing vpon this action, especially, if the worshipful company of the Inner temple gentlemen patronize my cause, as vndoubtedly they wil, yea, rather plead partially for me ten let my cause miscary, because themselues are parties.
The tragedi was by them most pithely framed, and no lesse curiously acted in view of her Maiesty, by whom it was then as princely accepted, as of the whole honorable audience notably applanded: y, and of al men generally desired, as a work, either in statlines of shew, depth of conceit, or true ornaments of poticall arte, inferior to none of the best in that kinde: no, were the Roman Seneca the censurer.
The braue yuths that then (to their high praises) so feelingly performed the same in action, did shortly after lay vp the vnregarded, or perhaps let it run abroade (as many parentes doe their children once past dandling) not respecting so much what hard fortune might befall it being out of their ngers, as how their beroical wits might againe be quickly conceiued with new inuentions of like worthines, wherof they haue been euer since wonderfull fertill.
But this orphan of theirs (for he wandreth as it were fatherlesse) hath notwithstanding, by the rare bewtiful perfections appearing in him, hether neuer wanted great fauourers, and louing preseruers.
Among whom cannot sufficiently commend your more then charitable zeale, and scholerly compassion towards him, that haue not only rescued and defended him from the deuouring iawes of obliuion, but vouchsafed also to apparrel him in a new sute at your own charges, wherin he may again more boldly come abroad, and by your permission returne to his olde parents, clothed perhaps not in richer or more costly furniture then it went from them, but in handsomnes fashion more auswerable to these times, wherein fashions are so often altered.
Let one word suffice for your encouragement herein: namely, that your commendable pains in disrobing him of his antike curiotie, and adorning him with the approoued guise of our stateliest Englishe termes (not diminishing, but more augmenting his artificiall colours of absolute poesie, deriued from his first parents) cannot but bee grateful to most mens appetites, who vpon our experie~ce we know highly to esteem such lofty measures of sententiously composed Tragedies.
How much you shal make me, and the rest of your priuate frends beholding vnto you, list not to discourse: and therfore grounding vpod these alledged reasons, that the suppressing of this Tragedie, so worthy for yt presse, were no other thing then wilfully to defraud your selfe of an vniuersall thank, your frends of their expectations, and sweete G. of a famous eternitie.
will cease to doubt of any other pretence to cloake your bashfulnesse, hoping to read it in print (which lately lay neglected amongst your papers) at our next appointed meeting.
TO THE WORSHIP FVLL AND learned the Gentlemen Students of the Inner Temple, with the rest of his singular good friends, the Gentlemen of the middle Temple, and to all other readers, R. W. wisheth increase of all health, worship learning, with the immortall glorie of the graces adorning the same.
YE may perceiue (right Worshipful) in perusing the former Epistle sent to mee, how sore am befet with the importunities of my friends, to publish this Pamphlet: Truly am and haue bin (if there be in me anie soundnes of iudgement) of this opinion, that whatsoeuer is committed to the presse is commended to eternitie, and it shall stand a liuely witnes with our conscience, to our comfort or confusion, in the reckning of that great daie.
Aduisedly therefore was that Prouerbe vsed of our elder Philosophers, Manum a Tabula: thy hand from the paper, and thy papers from the print or light of the world: for a lewd word escaped is irreuocable, but a bad or base discourse published in print is intollerable.
Hereupon haue indured some conflicts between reason and iudgement, whether it were conuenient for the common wealth, with the indecorum of my calling (as some thinke it) that the memorie of Tancreds Tragedie should be againe by my meanes, reuiued, which the oftner read ouer, and the more considered theron, the sooner was won to consent therunto: calling to mind that neither the thrice reuerend lerned father M. Beza, was ashamed in his yonger yeres, to send abroad in his owne name, his Tragedy of Abraham, nor that rare Scot (the scholer of ourage) Buchanan, his most pathetical Ieptha.
Indeed must willingly confesse this Wor simple, and not worth comparison to any of theirs: for the writers of them were graue men; of this, young heads: In them is shewn the perfection of their studies; in this, the imperfection of their wits.
Neuertheles herein they al agree, commending vertue, detesting vice, and liuely deciphering their ouerthrow that suppresse not their vnruely affections.
These things noted herin, how simple so euer the verse be, hope the matter wil be acceptable to the wise.
Wherefore am now bold to present Gismund to your sights, and vnto yours only, for therfore haue coniured her, by the loue that hath bin these
yeres betwixt vs, that she waxe not so proude of her fresh painting, to stragle in her plumes abroad, but to contein her selfe within the walles of your house; so am sure she shalbe safe fro~ the Tragedian Tyrants of our time, who are not ashamed to affirme that ther can no amarous poeme sauour of any sharpnes of wit, vnlesse it be seasoned with scurrilous words.
But leauing them to their lewdnes, hope you, all discreet readers, wil thankfully receiue my pains, the fruites of my first haruest: the rather, perceiuing that my purpose in this Tragedie, tendeth onely to the exaltation of vertue, suppression of vice, with pleasure to profit and help al men, but to offend, or hurt no man.
As for such as ha neither the grace, nor the good gift to doe well themselues, nor the common honestie, to speak wel of others, must (as may) heare and bear their baitings with patience.
FLowers of prime, pearles couched all in gold, Light of our daies that glads the fainting hearts Of them that shall your shining geamls behold, Salue of each sore, recure of inward smarts, In whom Vertue and Beautie striueth so, As neither yeelds, behold here for your gaine Gismonds vnluckie loue, her fault, her wo And death, at last her cruell Father slaine Through his mishap, and though you do not see, Yt reade and rew their wofull Tragedie.
So Ioue, as your high vertues done deserue, Grant you such pheeres, as may your vertues serue With like vertues, and blisfull Venus send Vnto your happie loues an happie end.
GIsmond, that whilome liu'de her fathers ioy And died his death, now dead, doth as she may By vs praie you to pittie her annoy.
And to requite the same, doth humbly pray, Heauens to forefend your loues from like decay.
The faithfull Earle doth also make request, Wishing those worthie knights whom ye imbrace, The constant truth that lodged in his breast.
His hartie loue, not his vnhappie case, Befall to such astriumph in your grace.
The King praies pardon of his cruell hest, And for amends, desires it may suffice, That by his bloud he warneth all the rest Of fond fathers, that they in kinder wise, Intreat the Iewels where their comfort lies.
We, as their messengers, beseech ye al On their behalfes, to pittie all their smarts, And for our selues, (although the worth be small) We praie ye, to accept our humble hearts Auoud to serue with praier and with praise, Your Honors, all vnworthie other waies.
TAncred the Prince of Salerne, ouerloues His onely daughter (wonder of that age) Gismund, who loues the Countie Palurin, Guishard, who quites her likings with his loue: Letter in a cane, describes the meanes Of their two meetings, in a secret caue.
Vnconstant fortune leadeth forth the king To this vnhappie sight, wherewith in rage, The gentle Earle he doometh to his death, And greets his daughter with her louers hart.
Gismunda fils the goblet with her teares, And drinkes a poison which she had distild, Whereof she dies, whose deadly countenance So grieues her Father, that he slew himselfe.
An other of the same more at large in prose.
TANCRED king of Naples and Prince of Salerne, gaue his only daughter Gismund (whom he most dearely loued) in mariage to a foraine Prince, after whose death she returned home to her Father, who hauing felt great griefe of hir absence whilst her husband liued, immesurably esteeming her, determined neuer to suffer any second mariage to bereaue him of hir She on the other side waxing wearie of that her fathers purpose, bent hir mind to the secret loue of the County Palurin: to whom (he being likewise inflamed with loue of her) by a Letter subtilly inclosed in a clouen cane, she gaue to vnderstand a conuenient waie for their desired meetings, through an old ruinous vaut, whose mouth opened directly vnder her chamber floore.
Into this vaut when she was one day descended (for the conuaiance of hir louer) hir father in the meane season (whose only ioy was in his daughter) came to hir chamber, and not finding her there, supposing her to haue bin walked abroad for hir disport, he threw him downe on hir bed, and couered his head with a curtain, minding to abide and rest there till hir returne.
She nothing suspecting this hir fathers vnseasonable comming, brought vp hir louer out of the cane into hir chamber, where hir father espied their secret loue: and hee (not espied of them) was vpon this sight striken with meruailous griefe; but either for that the sodaine despight had amazed him, taken from him all vse of speech, or for that he resolued himself to a more co~uenie~t reuenge, he then spake nothing, but noted their returne into the vant, and secretly departed.
Afterward bewailing his mishap, be commanded the Earle to be attached, imprisoned, strangled, vnbowelled, and his heart in a cup of golde to be presented to his daughter: she thankefully receiueth the present, filling the cuppe (wherein the heart was) with her teares, with a vonimcus potion (by her distilled for that purpose) shee dranke to her Earle.
Which her father hearing of, came too late to comfort his dying daughter, who for her last request besought him, that her louer and her selfe, might in one tombe be together buried, for a perpetuall memorie of their faithfull loues, which request he graunted, adding to the buriall, himselfe slaine with his owne hands, to his owne reproch, and the terror of all other hard hearted fathers.
Cupid commeth out of the heauens in a cradle of flowers, drawing forth vpon the stage in a blew twiste of silke, from his left hand Vaine hope, Brittle ioy.
And with a carnation twist of silke from his right hand, Faire resemblance, Late Repentance.
There rest my chariot on the mountaine tops, that in shape appeare vnto your sight naked boy, not cloathde but with my wings, Am that great God of Loue, who with his might Ruleth the wast wide world, and liuing things.
This left hand beares vaine hope, short ioyfull state, With faire Resemblance, louers to allure, This right hand holds Repentance all too late, Warre, fire, bloud, and paines without recure.
On sweete Ambrosia, is not my foode, Nectar is not my drinke, as to the rest "Of all the Gods: drinke the louers bloud, "And feed vpon the heart within his breast.
Well hath my power in heauen and earth bin tride, And deepest hell, my pearcing force hath knowen.
The marble seas, my wonders haue descride, Which elder age throghout the world hath blowen.
To me, the king of Gods and men doth yeeld, As witnes can the Greekish maide, whom Made like a cow go lowing through the field, Least iealous Iuno should the scape espie: The doubled night, the Sunnes restrained course, His secret stealths, the slander to eschew, In shape transformd, we list not to discourse.
The warlike Mars hath not subdude our might, We feard him not, his furie nor disdaine, That can the Gods record: before whose sight He laie fast wrapt in Vulcans subtill chaine.
He that on earth yet hath not felt our power, Let him behold the fall and cruell spoile Of thee faire Troy, of Asia the flower, So foule defast, and leueld with the soile.
Who forst Leander with his naked brest So many nights to cut the frothie waues, But Heroes loue, that lay inclosde in Sest? The stoutest hearts to me shall yeeld them slaues.
Who could haue matcht the huge Alcides strength, Great Macedon, what force might haue subdude? Wise Scipio who ouercame at length, But we, that are with greater force endude? Who could haue conquered the golden fleece But Iason, aided by Medeas art? Who durst haue stolne faire Helen out of Greece But I, with loue that boldned Paris heart? What bond of nature, what restraint auailes Against our power? vouch to witnes truth.
The Myrhe tree that with shamefast teares bewailes Her fathers loue, still weepeth yet for ruth.
But now, this world not seeing in these daies, Such present proofes of our power, Disdaines our name, and seeketh sundrie waies, To scorne and scoffe, and shame vs euerie houre, brat, a bastard, and an idle boy, rod, a staffe, a whip to beate him out, And to be sicke of loue, a childish toy, These are mine honors now the world about, My name disgrast, to raise againe therefore, And in this age, mine ancient renowme By mightie acts, intending to restore, Downe to the earth, in wrath now am come.
And in this place, such wonders shall ye heare, As these your stubborne, and disdainfull hearts, In melting teares, and humble yeelding feare, Shall soone relent by sight of others smarts.
This princely pallace, will enter in, And there inflame, the faire Gismunda, so Inraging all her secret vaines within, Through firie loue, that she shall feele much wo.
Vaine hope, take out my pale dead heauie shaft, Thou faire Resemblance, formost forth shalt go, With Brittle joy: my selfe will not be least, But after me, comes death, and deadly paine.
Thus shall ye march, till we returne againe, Meane while, sit still, and here shall you shew Such wonders, that at last with one accord, Ye shall relent, and saie that now ye know, Loue rules the world, Loue is a mightie Lord, Exit.
Gismnda in Purple commeth out of her Chamber, attended by foure maides that are the Chorus.
"OVaine, vnsteadfast state of mortall things, "Who trusts this world, leans to a brittle stay, "Such fickle fruit, his flattering bloome forth brings "Ere it be ripe, it falleth to decay, The ioy and blisse that late did possesse, In weale at will, with one loued best, Is turned now into so deepe distresse, As teacheth me to know the worlds vnrest.
For neither wit nor princely stomackes serue Against his force that slaies without respect, The noble and the wretch: ne doth reserue, So much as one, for worthines elect.
Ah me deare Lord, what well of teares may serue To feed the streames of my foredulled eies, To weepe thy death, as thy death doth deserue, And waile thy want in full sufficing wise.
Ye lampes of heauen, and all ye heauenly powers, Wherein did he procure your high disdaine, He neuer sought with vast huge mounting towers To reach aloft, and your raigne, Or what offence of mine was it vnwares, That thus your furie should on me be throwen, To plague a woman with such endles cares, feare that enuie hath the heauens this showen.
The Sunne his glorious vertues did disdaine, Mars at his manhood mightily repind, Yea all the Gods no longer could sustaine, Each one to be excelled in his kind.
For he my Lord surpast them euerie one, Such was his honor all the world throughout, But now my loue, oh whither art thou gone? know thy ghost doth houer here about, Expecting me (thy heart) to follow thee: And (deare loue) would faine dissolue this rife, But staie a while, may perhaps foresee Some meanes to be disburdend of this life, And to discharge the dutie of a wife, Which is, not onely in this life to loue, But after death her fancie not remoue.
Meane while accept of these our daily rites, Which with my maidens shall do to thee, Which is, in songs to cheere our dying spirits With hymnes of praises of thy memorie.
The Song ended, Tancred the King commeth out of his pallace with his guard.
Faire daughter, haue sought thee out with giefe, To ease the sorrowes of thy vexed heart.
How long wilt thou torment thy father thus? Who daily dies to see thy needles teares, uch bootlesse plaints that know nor meane nor end but increase the flouds of thy lament, And since the world knowes wel ther was no want In thee, of ought that did to him belong Yet all thou seest could not his life prolong.
Why the~ doest thou prouoke the heauens to wrath? His doome of death was dated by his starres, "And who is he that may withstand his fate? By these complaintes small good to him thou doest, Much griefe to me, most hurtvnto thy selfe, And vnto Nature greatest wrong of all.
Tell me not of the date of natures daies, Then in the Aprill of her springing age: No, no, it was my cruell destinie, That spited at the pleasance of my life.
My daughter knowes the proofe of natures course "For as the heauens do guide the lamp of life "So can they search no further forth the flame, "Then whilst with oyle they do maintain the same.
Gis. Curst be the starres, and vanish may they curst, Or fall from heauen, that in the dire aspect, Abridgde the health and welfare of my loue.
Gismund my ioy, set all these griefes apart, "The more thou art with hard mishap beset, "The more thy patience should procure thine ease.
What hope of hap may cheere my haples chance What sighs, what teares may counteruail my cares? What should do, but still his death bewaile, That was the solace of my life and soule? Now, now want the wonted guide and stay Of my desires, and of my wreaklesse thoughts, My Lord, my loue, my life, my liking gone, In whome was all the fulnes of my ioy, To whom gaue the first fruites of my loue, Who with the comfort of his onely sight, All cares and sorrowes could from me remue.
But father, now my ioyes forepast to tel, Doe but reuiue the horrors of my hell.
As she that seemes in darkenes to behold The gladsome pleasures of the chearefull light.
What then auailes thee fruitlesse thus to rue His absence whom the heauens cannot returne: Impartiall death thy husband did subdue, Yet hath he spar'd thy kingly fathers life: Who during life, to thee a double stay, As father, and as husband will remaine, With doubled loue to ease thy widowes want.
Ofhim whose want is cause ofthy complaint, Forbeare thou al these needlesse teares, That nippe the blossoms of thy beauties pride.
"Let reason worke that time doth easilie srame "In meanest wittes: to beare the greatest illes.
So plenteous are the springs Of sorrowes that increase my passions, As neither reason can recure my smart, Nor can your care, nor fatherly comfort Appease the stormie combats of my thoughts, Such is the sweet remembrance of his life.
Then geue me leaue, of pittie pittie me, And as can shall allay these greefes.
These solitarie walkes thou dost frequent, Yeeld fresh occasions to thy secrete mones: We wil therefore thou keep vs companie, Leauing thy maidens with their harmonie.
Tan. and Gis. with the Gard, depart into the pallace, the four maydens stay behind, as Chorus to the Tragdie.
The diuers haps which alwayes worke our care, Our ioyes so farre, our woes so neere at hand, Haue long ere this, and dayly doe declare The fickle foot on which our state doeth stand.
"Who plants his pleasures here to gather roote, "And hopes his happy life wil still endure, "Let him behold how death with stealing foote "Steps in, when he shall thinke his ioyes most sur.
If prowes could preserue, or worthy deedes, He had yet liu'd whose twelue labours displayes His enddlesse fame, and yet his honor spreades.
And that gret king that with so small a power Bereft the might ie Persian his crowne: Doeth witnesse well our life is but a flower, Though it be deckt with honor and renowme.
Chor. "What growes to day in fauor of the heauen, "Nurst with the sun, and with the showers sweete, "Pluekt with the hand it withereth ere euen.
The valiant Greekes that vnto Troya gaue The tenne yeeres siege, left but their names behind.
And he that did so long and onelie saue His fathers walles, found there at last his end.
Proud Rome herselfe, that whilome laid her yoke On the wide world, and vanquisht all with warre, Yet could she not remoue the fatall stroke Of death, from them that stretcht her power so farre.
Chor. Looke what the cruell sisters once decreed The thunderer himselfe cannot remoue: They are the Ladies of our destinie, To worke beneath, what is conspirde aboue, But happie he that ends this mortall life, By speedie death, who is not forst to see, The many cares, nor feele the sundrie griefes Which we sustaine, in wo and miserie.
Heere Fortune rules, who when she list to play, Whirleth her wheele, and brings the high full low, To morow takes, what she hath giuen to daie, To shew she can aduance, and ouer throw.
Not Euripus vnquiet floud so oft Ebs in a daie, and floweth too and fro, As Fortunes change, pluckes downe that was alot, And mingleth ioy, with enterchange of w. Chor. Who liues below, and feeleth not the strokes, Which often times on highest towers do fall, Nor blustering winds, wherwith the strongest okes Are rent and torne, his life is surste of all: For he may scoe Fortune, that hath no power On him, that is well pleasd with his estate: He seeketh not her sweets, nor feares her sower, But liues contented in his quiet rate, And marking how these worldly things do wade, Reioyceth to himselfe, and laughs to see The folly of men, that in their wits haue made, Fortune a goddesse, placed in the skie.
DEare Aunt, my sole companion in distresse, And true copartner of my thoughtfull cares: When with my selfe, way my present state, Comparing it with my forepassed daies, New heapes of cares, afresh beginnet' assay My pensiue heart: as when the glittering raies, Of bright Phoebus, are sodainely With duskie clouds, that dim his golden light, Namely, when I, laid in my widowes bed, Amid the silence, of the quiet night, With curious thought, the fleeting course obserue, Of gladsome youth: how soone his flower decaies.
How time once past, may neuer haue recourse, No more then may the running streames reuert, To climbe the hilles, when they bin rowled down The hollow vales, there is no curious art, Norworldlie power, no not the gods can hold The sway of flying time, nor him returne When he is past: all things vnto his might Must bend, and yeeld, vnto the Iron teeth Of eating time: this in the shedy night, When record, how soone my youth withdrawes It selfe away, how swift my pleasaunt spring Runnes out his race, this this (Aunt) is the cause.
When aduise me sadlie on this thing, That makes my heart, in pensiue dumps dismaid.
And suffer youth, fruitles to fade away: Whereto liue I? or whereto was borne? Wherefore hath nature deckt me with her grace? Why haue tasted the delights of loue? And felt the sweets of Hymeneus bed? But to say sooth (deare Aunt) it is not Sole and alone, can thus content to spend My chearefull yeares: my father will not still Prolong my mournings, which haue grieued him, And pleased me too long.
Then this craue, To be resolued of his princelie minde.
For, stoode it with the pleasure of his will To marrie me, my fortune is not such, So hard, that so long should still persist Makelesse alone in wofull widowhood, And shall tell mine Aunt? come hether then, Geue me that hand, by thine owne right hand, charge thy heart my councels to conceale.
Late haue seene, and seeing, tooke delight, And with delight, will not say, loue, Prince, an Earle, a Countie in the Court.
But loue and duetie force me to refraine, And driue away these fond affections, Submitting them vnto my fathers hest.
But this (good Aunt) this is my chiefest paine, Because stand at such vncertaine stay.
For if my kinglie father would decree His finall doome, that must leade my life Such as doe, would content me then To frame my fancies to his princely heast, And as might, endure the greefe thereof.
But now his silence doubleth all my doubts, Whilest my suspitious thoughts twixt hope feare, Distract me into sundrie passions.
Therefore (good Aunt) this labour must be yours, To vnderstand my fathers will herein: For wel know your wisdome knowes the meanes, So shall you both allay my stormie thoughts, And bring to quiet my vnquiet mind.
Luc. Sufficeth this (good Neece) that you haue said, For perceiue what sundrie passions Striue in your brest, which oftentimes ere this Your countenance confused did bewray, The ground whereof since perceiue to grow On iust respect of this your sole estate, And skilfull care of fleeting youths decay, Your wise foresight such sorrowing to eschew much commend, and promise as may To breake this matter, and impart your mind, Vnto your father, and to worke it so, As both your honor shal not be impeacht, Nor he vnsatisfied of your desire.
Be you no farther greeued, but returne Into your chamber.
shall take this charge, And you shall shortlie truely vnderstand What haue wrought, and what the king affirmes.
Gis. departeth into her chamber, Luc. abiding on the stage.
My Neece shall not impute the cause to be In my default, her will should want effect: But in the king is all my doubt, least he My suite for her new mariage should reiect.
Yet shall proue him: and heard it said, He meanes this euening in the parke to hunt, Here will wait attending his approach.
Tancred commeth out of his Pallace with Guiszard the Countie Palurine, Iulio the Lord Chamber laine, Renuchio captaine of his allready to
Tancred VNcouple all our hounds: Lords to the chase: Faire sister Lucre, what's the newes with you? Luc. Si as alwaies haue imployd my power, And faithfull seruice, such as lay in me, In my best wise, to honour you and yours: So now, my bounden dutie moueth me, Your maiestie most humblie to intreat, With patient eares, to vnderstand the state, Of my poreneece, your daughter.
Tanc. what of her? Is she notwell? Inioyes she not her health? Say sister, ease me of this iealous feare? Lucr.
She liues my Lord, hath her outward helth, But all the danger of her sicknes lies In the disquiet of her princelie mind: Tan.
Since whenthe Princes hath intoumb'd her Lord Her late disseased husband of renowne: Brother, see, and verie well perceiue, She hath not clos'de together in his graue, All sparkes of nature, kindnes, nor of loue: But as she liues, so liuing may she feele, Such passions as our tender hearts oppresse, Subiect vnto th impressions of desire: Forwell wot, my neece was neuer wrought, Of steele, nor carued from the stonie rocke, Such stearne hardnes, we ought not to expect, In her, whose princelie heart, and springing yeares, Yet flowring in the chiefest heat of youth, Is lead offorce, to feed on such conceits, As easilie befalles that age, which asketh ruth Of them, whome nature bindeth by foresight Of their graue yeares, and carefull loue to reach, The things that are aboue their feeble force: And for that cause, dread Lord although.
If you esteeme, or ought respect my life, Her honor, and the welfare of our house, Forbeare, and wade no further in this speech.
Your words, are wounds, verie well perceiue, The purpose of this smooth oration: This suspected, when you first began, This faire discourse with vs: Is this the end Of all our hopes, that we haue promised Vnto ourselfe, by this her widdowhood? Would our deare daughter, would our onely ioy, Would she fsake vs? would she leaue vs now? Before she hath closde vp, our dying eies, And with her teares, bewaild our funerall? No other solace, doth her father craue, But whilst the fates, maintaine his dying life, Her healthfull presence, gladsome to his soule, Which rather then he willing would His heart desires, the bitter tast of death: Her late marriage, hath taught vs to our griefe, That in the fruits, of her perpetuall sight Consists the onely comfort and reliefe, Of our vnweldy age: for what delight What ioy? what comfort? haue we in this world, Now growen in yeares, and with cares, Subiect vnto the sodain stroke of death, Already falling like the mellowed fruite, And dropping by degrees into our graue.
But what reuiues vs? what maintaines oursoule Within the prison of our withered brest? But our Gismunda and her chearefull sight.
daughter, daughter, what desert of mine, Wherein haue beene so vnkind to thee? Thou shouldst desire to make my naked house Yet once againe stand desolate by thee? let such fansies vanish with their thoughts, Tell her am her father, whose estate, Wealth, honor, life, and all that we possesse, Whollie relies vpon her presence here.
Tell her must account her all my ioy, Worke as she will: But yet the were vniust, To haste his death that liueth by her fight Lucr.
Thou knowest our minde, resolue her, depart, Returne the chase, we haue beene chac'd nough.
He cannot heare, anger hath stopt his eares, And his iudgement hath decaide.
And knows his mind, makes return to me To end at once all this perplexitie.
Oh how my trembling heart In doubtfull thoughts panteth within my brest.
For in her message doth relie my smart, Or the sweet quiet of my troubled minde.
Luc. Neece, on the point you lately willed me To treat of with the king in your behalfe, brake euen now with him so farre, till he In sodain rage of griefe, ere scarce had My tale out tolde, praid me to stint my suite, As that from which his minde abhorred most.
And well see his fansie to refute, Is but displeasure gainde, and labor lost.
So firmely fixed stands his kingly will, That til his body shalbe laid in graue, He will not part from the desired sight Of your presence, which silder he should haue, If he had once allied you againe, In marriage to any prince or peere.
resolution that resolues my bloud Into the drops of Lethes flood, Luc.
Therefore my counsel is, you shall not sturre, Nor further wade in such a case as this: But since his will, is grounded on your loue, And that it lies in you, to saue or spill, His old age: you ought t'eschew, The thing that greeues so much his crazed heart, And in the state you stand, content your selfe: And let this thought, appease your troubled mind, That in your hands, relies your fathers death, Or blisfull life, and since without your sight, He cannot liue, nor can his thoughts indure, Your hope of marriage, you must then relent, And these fond affections: Least it be said, you wrought your fathers end.
Gis. Deare Aunt, haue with patient eares indurde, The hearing of my fathers hard behest: And since see, that neither my selfe, Nor your request, can so preuaile with him, Nor anie sage aduice perswade his mind To grant me my desire, In willing wise, must submit me vnto his command, And frame my heart to serue his maiestie.
And (as may) to driue awaie the thoughts That diuersly distract my passions, Which as can, Ile labour to subdue, But sore feare, shall but toile in vaine, Wherein (good Ant) must desire your paine.
What lies in me by comfort or aduice, shall discharge with all humilitie.
Who markes our former times and present yeres, What we are now, and lookes what we haue bin, He cannot but lament with bitter teares, The great decay and change of all women.
For as the world wore on and waxed olde, So vertue quaild, and vice began to grow.
So that, that age, that whilome was of golde, Is worse than brasse, more vile than yron now, The times were such, that if we ought beleeue Of elder daies) women examples were, Of rare vertues: Lucre disdaind to liue Longer then chast: and boldly without feare Tooke sharpe reuenge on her inforced heart, With her owne hands: for that it not withstood The wanton will, but yeelded to the force Of proud Tarquin, who bought hir fame with blood.
Queene Artemissa thought an hepe of stones, Although they were the wonder of that age) worthlesse graue, wherein to rest the bones Of her deare Lord, but with bold courage, She dranke his heart, and made her louely breast His tombe, and failed not of wifely faith, Of promist loue, and of her bound behest, Vntill she ended had her daies by death.
Vlysses wife (such was her stedfastnesse) Abode his slow returne whole twentie yeeres: And spent her youthfull daies in pensiuenes, Bathing her widdowes bed with brinish teares.
Chor. The stout daughter of Cato Bratus wife, Portia When she had heard his death, did not desire Longer to liue: and lacking vse of knife, (A most strange thing) ended her life by fire, And at whot burning coales: worthy dame! vertues worthy of eternall praise! The floud of Lethe cannot wash out thy fame, To others great reproach, shame, and dispraise.
Chor. Rare are those vertues now in womens mind, Where shall we seeke such iewels passing strange? Scarse can you now among a thousand finde One woman stedfast: all delight in change.
Marke but this princesse that lamented here, Of late so sore her noble husbands death, And thought to liue alone without a pheare, Behold how soone she changed hath that breath.
thinke those Ladies that haue liu'd to fore, mirror and a glasse to women kinde, By those their vertues they did set such store, That vnto vs they none bequeath'd behinde.
Els in so many yeeres we might haue seene As vertuous as eer they haue beene.
Chor. Yet let not vs maydens condemne our kinde, Because our vertues are not all so rare: For we may freshly yet record in minde, There liues a virgin, one without compare: Who of all graces hath her heauenly share.
In whose renowme, and for whose happie daies, Let vs record this Paean of her praise.
SO, now they feel what lordly loue can that proudly practise to deface his nam Invaine they wrastle with so fierce a foe, of little sparkes arise a blazing flame.
"By small occasions loue can kindle heate, "and wast the Oken brest to cinder dust: Gismund haue entised to forget her widdowes weedes, and burne in raging lust: Twas nforst her father to denie her second marriage to any peere: Twas allur'd her once againe to trie the sower sweetes that Louers buy too deere.
The Countie Palurin, a man right wise, a man of exquisite perfections: haue like wounded with her pearsing eyes, and burnt her heart with his reflections.
These two shall ioy in tasting of my sweete, to make them proue more feelingly the greefe That bitter brings: for when their ioyes shall fleete, their dole shalbe increast without releefe.
Thus loue shall make worldlings to know his might, thus loue shall force great princes to obey.
Thus loue shall daunt each proud rebelling spirite, thus loue shall wreake his wrath on their decay.
Their ghostes shall doe black hell to vnderstand, how great and wonderfull a God is Loue: And this shall learne the Ladies of this lande, with patient mindes his mighty power to proue.
From whence did descend now will mount, to Ioue, and all the Gods in their delights: In throne of triumph there will recount, how by sharpe reunge on mortall wights, Haue taught the earth, and learned hellish spirites to yeeld with feare their stubburn hearts to loue: Least their disdain, his plagues and vengeance proue Cupid remunteth into the heauens.
Luc. PItie, that moueth euery gentle heart, To rue their griefs, that be distrest in pain, Inforceth me, to waile my neeces smart, Whose tender brest, no long time may sustaine, The restlesse toyle, that her vnquiet mind, Hath causd her feeble bodie to indure, But why it is, (alacke) must not find, Nor know the man, by whome might procure Her remedie, as of dutie ought, As to the law of kindship, doth belong, With carefull heart, the secret meanes sought, Though small effect, is of my trauell sprong: Full often as durst, haue assaid, With humble words, the princes to require, To name the man, which she hath so denaid, That it abasht me, further to desire, Or aske from whence, those cloudie thoughts proceed, Whose stonie force: that smokie sighs forth send.
Is liuelie witnes, how that carefnll dread, And hot desire, within her doe contend.
Yet she denies, what she confest of yore, And then conioynd me, to conceale the same: She loued once, (she saith) but neuer more, Nor euer will, her fancie thereto frame: Though daily, obserued in my brest, What sharpe conflicts, disquiet her so sore, That heauy sleep cannot procure her rest, But fearefull dreames present her euermore Most hideous sights her quiet to molest.
That starting oft therwith she doth awake, to muse vpon those fancies which torment Her thoughtfull heart with horror, that doth make Her cold chil sweat break foorth incontinent From her weake lims: and while the quiet night Geues others rest, she turning to and fro Doth wish for day.
But when the day brings light, She keepes her bed, there to record her woe.
As soon as when she riseth flowing teares Stream down her chekes, immixt with dedly grones Whereby her inward sorow so appeares, That as salt teares the cruell cause bemones.
In case she be constrained to abide In preace of company, she scarcely may Her trembling voice restraine it be not spied From careful plaints her sorrowes to bewray.
By which restraint the force doth so increase, When time and place geue liberty to plaine.
That as small streames from running neuer cease, Til they returne into the seas againe: So her laments we feare wil not amend, Before they bring her Princely life to end.
To others talke when as she should attend, Her heaped cares her sences so oppresse, That what they speak, or wherto their words tende She knowes not, as her answeres do expresse.
Her chiefe delight is stil to be alone, Her pensiue thoughts within themselues dbate, But whereupon this restlesse life is growen, Since know not nor how the same t'abate.

If they bewaile their cruell destenie, Which spend their loue wher they no loue can find Wel may plaine, since Fortune haleth me To this torment of far more greeuous kind.

For by that sight which should recure my paine, My sorowes are redoubled all in vaine.

Heauens haue yeseen, or hath the age ofman Recorded such a myracle as this?

IF it please your highnes hither haue we broght This captiue Earl as you commanded vs. Who~ (as we wer fortold) euen there we found Where by your maiesty we were inioin'd To watch for him.
What more your highnes willes, This heart and hand shal execute your hest.
Ah Palurin, Haue we deserued in such traiterous sort Thou shouldst abuse our kingly courtesies, Which we too long in fauor haue bestowed Vpon thy hart with vs. What grief thou therewithal hast throwen on vs What shame vpon a house, what dire distresse, Our soul endures, cannot be vttered.
And durst thou villen dare to vndermine Our daughters chamber, durst thy shameles face Be bolde to kisse her: th'rest we wil conceale.
Sufficeth that thou knowest too wel know All thy proceedings in thy priuat shames.
Herin what hast thou wonne? thine own content, With the displeasure of thy Lord and king.
The thought whereof if thou hadst had in mind The least remorce of loue and loyaltie Might haue restraind thee from so foule a fact.
But Palurin, what may deem of thee, Whom neither feare of gods, nor loue of him (Whose Princely fauor hath been thine vpreare) Could quench the fewel of thy lewd desires.
Wherfore content thee that we are resolu'd (And therfore laid to snare thee with this bayt) That thy iust death, with thine effused blood, Shal coole the heate and choler of our mood.
My Lord the ing, neither do mislike Your sentence, nor do your smoking sighes Reacht from the entrals of your boiling heart, Disturbe the quiet of my calmed thoughts: For this feele, and by experience proue, Such is the force and endlesse might of loue, As neuer shal the dread of carren death That hath enuide our ioyes, inuade my brest, For if it may be found a fault in me (That euermore haue lou'd your Maiestie) Likewise to honor and to loue your child, If loue vnto you both may be a fault, vnto her my loue exceedes compare, Then this hath been my fault, for which ioy That in the greatest lust of all my life, shall submitte for her sake to endure The pangues of death.
Oh mighty Lord of loue Strengthen thy vassall, boldlie to receaue Large wounds into this body for her sake.
Then vse my life or death, my Lord and king, For your reliefe to ease your grieued soule: For whether liue, or els that must die, To end your paines am content to beare: Knowing by death shall bewray the trueth Of that sound heart which liuing was her owne, And dide aliue for her that liued mine, Tan.
Thine Palurin, what, liues my daughter thine? Traitor thou wrongst me, for she liueth mine.
Rather wish ten thousand sundrie deaths, Then to liue and see my daughter thine.
Thine, that is dearer then my life to me? Thine, whom hope to see an Empresse? Thine, whom cannot pardon from my sight? Thine, vnto whom we haue bequeath'd our crown? Iulio, we wil that thou informe from vs Renuchio the Capten of our Gard, That we commaund this traitor be conueyd Into the dungeon vnderneath our Tower, There let him rest vntil he be resolu'd What further we intend, which to vnderstand, We will Renuchio repaire to vs. Iul.
that might your Maiestie entreate With clemencie to beutifie your seate, Toward this Prince distrest by his desires, Too many, all too strong to captiuate Tan.
"This is the soundest safetie for a king "To cut them off that vex or hinder him.
"This haue found the safetie of a king, "To spare the Subiects that do honor him.
Thou knowest our mind, our heart cannot be easd, But with the slaughter of this Palurin.
thou great God, who from thy hiest throne Hast stooped down, and felt the force of loue, Bend gentle eares vnto the wofull mone, Of me poore wretch, to graunt that require: Help to perswade the same great God, that he So farre remit his might, and slack his fire From my deare Ladies kindled heart, that she May heare my death without her hurt, Herface, wherein there is as cleere a light As in the rising moone: let not her cheekes As red as is the rose.
Be paled with the newes hereof and so yeeld my selfe, my sillie soul, and all, To him, for her, for whom my death shall shew liu'd, and as liu'd, dide her thrall.
Graunt this thou Thunderer: this shal suffice, My breath to vanish in the liquid skies.
Who doth not know the fruits of Paris loue, Nor vnderstand the end of Helens oy, He may behold the fatall ouerthrow OfPriams house, and of the towne of Troy.

So many a Duke, so many a Prince of fame Bereft his life, and left there in the plaine.
Medeas armed hand, Elizas sword, Wretched Leander drenched in the floud.
Phillis so long that waited for her Lord All these too dearly bought their loues with bloud.
But he in vertue that his Lady serues Newils but what vnto her Honor longs, Heneuer from the rule of reason swarues, He feeleth not the pangs, ne raging throngs Of blind Cupid: he liues not in despaire As done his seruants: neither spends his daies In ioy, and care, vaine hope, and throbbing feare.
But seekes alway what may his soueraine please In honor: he that thus serues, reapes the fruite Of his sweet seruice: and no ielous dread Nor base suspect of ought to let his sute (Which causeth oft the louers hart to bleed) Doth fret his mind, or burneth in his brest: He wayleth not by day, nor wakes by night, When euery other liuing thing doth rest.
Remember thou in vertue serue therfore Thy chast Lady: beware thou do not loue As whilom Venus did the faire Adonne, But as Diana lou'd the Amazons sonne.
Through whose request the gods to him alone Restorde new life: the twine that was vndone Was by the sisters twisted vp againe.
The loue of vertue in thy Ladies lookes, The loue of vertue in her learned talke, This loue yeelds matter for eternall bookes.
This loue intiseth him abroad to walke, There to inuent and write new rondelaies Of learned conceit, her fancies to allure To vaine delights, such humors he allaies, And sings of vertue and her garments pure.
Desire not of thy Soueraigne the thing Whereof shame may ensue by any meane: Nor wish thou ought that may dishonor bring.
So whilom did the learned Tuscan serue His faire Lady: and glory was their end.
Such are the praises Louers done deserue, Whose seruice doth to vertue and honor tend.
OH cruel fate, oh miserable chaunce Oh dire aspect of hateful destinies, Oh wo may not be told: suffic'd it not That should see and with these eyes behold So foule, so bloody, and so basea deede: But more to aggrauate the heauie cares Of my perplexed mind, must onelie Must alone be made the messenger, That must deliuer to her Princelie eares Such dismall newes? as when shal disclose know it cannot but abridge her daies.
As when the thunderer and three forked fire Rent through the cloudes by Ioues almighty power Breakes vp the bosom of our mother earth, And burnes her heart before the heat be felt.
In this distresse whom should most bewaile, My woe, that must be made the messenger Of these vnworthie and vnwelcome newes? Or shall mone thy death, noble Earle? Or shal still lament the heauie hap That yet, Queene, attends thy funeral.
What mones be these? Renuchio is this Salerne see? Doth here king Tancred hold the awful cronw? Is this the place where ciuill people be? Or do the sauage Scythians here abound? Cho.
What mean these questio~s? whether tend thes words? Resolue vs maidens, release our fears.
What euer newes thou bring'st, discouer them, Deteine vs not in this suspicious dread, ''The thought whereof is greater then the woe.
whither may cast my lookes? to heauen? Blackpitchy clouds from thence rain down ruenge The earth shal behold? stainde with the gore Of his heart bloud that dide most innocent.
Which way so ere turn mine eyes, me thinks His butchered corps stands staring in my face.
We humbly pray thee to forbear these words So ful of terror to our mayden hearts: ''The dread of things vnknown breedes the suspect ''Of greater dread, vntil the worst be knowen.
Tel therfore what hath chaunst, and whereunto This bloudy cup thou holdest in thy hand.
Since so is your request that shal doe, Although my mind so sorrowful a thing Repines to tell, and though my voice eschewes To say what haue seene: yet since your will So fixed stands to heare for what rue, Your great desires shall herein fulfill.
First by Salerne Citie, amids the plaine, There stands a hil, whose bottom huge and round, Throwen out in breadth, a large space doth contain And gathering vp in height small from the grounde Stil lesse and lesse it mounts: there sometime was goodly towre vpreard, that flowrde in fame While fate and fortune seru'd, but time doth passe, And with his sway suppresseth all the same: For now the walles be euened with the plaine.
And all the rest so fowly lies defast: As but the only shade doth there remaine Of that which there was built in time forepast: And yet that shewes what worthy work tofore Hath there been reard: one parcel of that towre Yet stands, which eating time could not deuoure: str ong turret compact of stone and rock: Hugie without, but horrible within: To passe to which by force of handy stroke crooked straite is made, that enters in And leades into this vgly loathsome place.
Within the which carued into the ground deep dungeon there runnes of narrow space Dreadful and darke, where neue light is found: Into this hollow caue, by cruel hest Of king Tancred, were diuers seruants sent To worke the horror of his furious brest, Earst nourisht in his rage, and now sterne bent, To haue the same performde: woful man Amongst the rest, was one to do the thing That to our charge so straitly did belong, In sort as was commanded by the king.
Within which dreadful prison when we came, The noble Countie Palurin that there Lay chain'd in giues, fast fettered in his bolts, Out of the darke dungeon we did vpreare And hal'd him thence into a brighter place, That gaue vs light to worke our tyrannie.
But when once beheld his manly face, And saw his cheare, no more appauld with feare, Of present death, then he whom neuer dread Did once amate: my heart abhorred then To geue consent vnto so foul a deede, That wretched death should reaue so worthy a man On false fortune cride with lowd complaint, That in such sort ouerwhelmes nobilitie.
But he whom neuer griefe ne feare could taint, With smiling cheare himselfe oft willeth me, To leaue to plaine his case, or sorrow make, For him, for he was far more glad apaide Death to imbrace thus for his Ladies sake, Then life, or all the ioyes of life he said.
For losse of life (quoth he) greeues me no more, Then ioss of that which least, My Ladies griefe, least she should rue therefore, Is all the cause of griefe within my brest.
He praid therfore that we would make report To her of those his last words he would say: That though he neuer could in any sort Her gentlenes requite, nor neuer lay Within his power to serue her as he would, Yet she possest his heart with hand and might, To doe her all the honor that he could.
This was to him of all the ioyes that might Reuiue his heart, the chiefest ioy of al, That, to declare the faithfull heart which he Did beare to her, fortune so wel did fall, That in her loue he should both liue and die.
After these words he staid, and spake no more, But ioyfully beholding vs eachone, His words and cheare amazed vs so sore That stil we stoode: when forthwith thereupon But why slack you (quoth he) to do the thing For which you come? make speed and stay no more Performe your masters will: now tel the king He hath his life for which he long'd so sore: And with those words himselfe with his own hand Fastned the bands about his neck.
The rest Wondring at his stout heart, astonied stand To see him offer thus himselfe to death.
What stony brest, or what hard heart of flint Would not relent to see this dreery sight? So goodly a man, whom death nor fortunes dint Could once disarme, murdred with such despite.
And in such sort bereft amidst the flowers Of his fresh yeares, that ruthfull was to seene: "For violent is death, when he deuoures "Yong men, or virgins, while their yeares be green.
Lo now our seruants seeing him take the bands And on his neck himselfe to make them fast: Without delay set to their cruel hands, And sought to worke their fierce intent with hast, They stretch the bloudy bands, and when the breth Began to faile his brest, they slackt againe.
Thrise did they pull, and thrise they losed him, So did their hands repine against their hearts: And oft times losed to his greater paine.
"But date of death that fixed is so fast, "Beyond his course there may no wight extend, For strangled is this noble Earle at last, Bereft of life, vnworthy such an end.
What deem you this to be Al the sayd newes that haue to vnfould? Is here (think you) end of the crueltie That haue seen? Chor.
Could any heauier woe Be wrought to him, then to destroy him so? Ren.
What, think you this outrage did end so well? The horror of the fact, the greatest The massaker, the terror is to tell.
Cho. Alack what could be more? they threw percase The dead body to be deuourd and torne Of the wild beasts.
Would God it had been cast a sauage praie To beasts and birds: but lo, that dreadfull thing Which euen the tyger would not work, but to Suffice his hunger: that hath the tyrant king Withouten ruth commaunded vs to doe, Onely to please his wrathfull heart withal.
Happy had been his chance, too happy alas, If birdes, or beasts had eaten vp his corps, Yea heart and all: within this cup bring, And am constrained now vnto the face Of his deare Ladie to present the same.
What kind of crueltie is this you name? Declare foohwith, and wherunto doth tend This farther plaint.
After his breath was gone, Forced perforce thus from his panting brest Straight they dispoiled him, and not alone Contented with his death, on the dead corps Which rauenous beasts forbeare to lacerate, Euen vpon this our villens fresh begunne To shew new crueltie: foorthwith they pearce His naked bellie, and vnript it so, That out the bowels gusht: who can rehearse Their tyrannie, wherwith my heart yet bleedes.
Within their hands trembling not fully dead, His veines smok'd, his bowels all to Ruthlesse were rent, and throwen about the place: All clottered lay the bloud in lumps of gore, Sprent on his corps, and on his paled face, His trembling heart, yet leaping, out they tore, And cruelly vpon a rapier They fixt the same, and in this hateful wise Vnto the king this heart they do present: sight longd for to feede his irefull eies.
The king perceiuing each thing to be wrought As he had wilde, to behold Vpon the bloudie sword the pearced heart, He calles then for this massie cup of gold, Into the which the wofull heart he cast, And reaching me the same, now go, quoth Vnto my daughter, and with speedy hast Present her this, and say to her from me, Thy father here in this cup thee sent That thing to ioy and comfort thee withal, Which thou louedst best, euen as thou wert content To comfort him with his chiefe ioy of all.
hateful fact! passing crueltie! murder wrought with too much hard despite hainous deede, which no posteritie Wil once beleeue! Ren.
Thus was Earle Palurin Strangled vnto the death, yea after death His heart and bloud disboweled from his brest: But what auaileth it is but breath Forewasted all in vaine: why do rest Here in this place? why goe not and doe The hateful message to my charge committed? Oh were it not that am forc'd thereto, By a kings will, here would stay my feet, Ne one whit farder wade in this intent: But must yeeld me to my Princes hest, Yet doth this somewhat comfort mine vnrest, am resolu'd her griefe not to behold, But get me gone my message being told.
Where is the Princesse chamber? Cho. Lo where she comes Gismund commeth out of her chamber, to whom Renuchio deliuereth his cup, saying.
THy father, Queen, here in this cup hath sent The thing to ioy and comsort thee withall Which thoulouedst best, euen as thou wast content To comfort him with his chiefe ioy of all.
thanke my father, and thee gentle squire, For this thy trauell take thou for thy paines This bracelet, and commend me to the king.
So now is come the long expected houre, The fatall hower haue so looked for, Now hath my father satisfied his thirst With giltlesse bloud which he so coueted What brings this cup? (ay me) thought no lesse, It is mine Earles, my Counties pearced heart, Deare heart, too dearely hast thou bought my Extreamely rated at too high a price.
Ah my sweet heart, sweet wast thou in thy life, But in thy death thou prouest passing sweet.
fitter hearce then this of beaten gold, Could not be lotted to so good an heart: My father therefore well prouided thus To close and wrap thee vp in massie gold, And there withall to send thee vnto me, To whom of duety thou doest best belong.
My father hath in all his life bewraid princely care and tender loue to me: But this surpasseth, in his later dayes To send me this, mine owne deare heart to me.
Wert thou not mine, dear hart, whil'st that my loue Daunced and plaid vpon thy golden strings? Art thou not mine (deere heart) now that my loue Is fled to heauen, and got him golden wings? Thou art mine owne, and stil mine own shalt be Therfore my father sendeth thee to me.
Ah pleasant harborough of my hearts thought! Ah sweete delight, the quickner of my soule Seuen times accursed be the hand that wrought Thee this despight, to mangle thee so foule: Yet in this wound see mine owne true loue, And in this wound thy magnanimitie, And in this wound see thy constancie.
Goe gentle heart, go rest thee in thy tombe, Receaue this token at thy last farewell: She kisseth it.
Thine owne true heart anon will follow thee, Which panting hasteth for thy companie.
Thus hast thou run (poore heart) thy mortall race, And rid thy life from fickle fortunes snares, Thus hast thou lost this world, and worldly cares, And of thy foe, to honour thee withall, Receau'd a golden graue, to thy desert, Nothing doth want to thy iust funerall, But my salt teares to wash thy bloudy wound.
Which to the end thou mightst receaue, behold My father sends thee in this cup of gold, And thou shalt haue them, though was resolu'd To shed no teares, but with a chearefull face Once did think to wet thy funerall Only with bloud, and with no weeping eye.
This done, foorthwith my soule shal fly to thee, For therfore did my father send thee me.
Ah my pure heart, with sweeter companie, Or more content, how safer may proue To passe to places all vnknowen with thee.
Why die not therfore? why doe stay? Why doe not this wofull life forgoe, And with these hands enforce this breath away? What meanes this gorgeous glittering head attir How ill these billamnts of gold Thy mournfull widdowhood? away with them, So let thy tresses flaring in the winde She vndressesh her haire.
Vntrimmed hang about thy bared necke: Now hellish furies set my heart on fire, Bolden my courage, strengthen ye my hands Against their kind, to do a kindly deed: But shall then vnwreaken downe descen d? Shall not worke some iust reuenge on him That thus hath slain my loue? shall not these hands Fire his gates, and make the flame to climb Vp to the pinnacles, with burning brands, And on his cynders wreake my cruell teene.
Be still (fond girle) content thee first to die, This venomd water shall abridge thy life, she taketh a violl of poysn out of her pocket.
This for the same intent prouided I, Which can both ease and end this raging strife.
Thy father by thy death shall haue more woe, Then fire or flames within his gates can bring: Content thee then in patience hence to go, Thy death his bloud shall wreake vpon the king.
Now not alone (a griefe to die alone) "The onely myrror of extreame anoy, But not alone, thou diest my loue, for Will be copartner thy destinie.
Be merrie then my soule, canst thou refuse To die with him, that death for thee did choose? Chor.
What damned furie hath possest our Queen Why sit we still beholding her distresse? Madame forbeare, suppresse this headstrong rage.
worthy Qu, rashns doth ouerthrowe The author of his resolution.

That neither car'd for me Nor greeued at the murther of my loue, My mind is setled, you with these vain words, Withhold me but too long from my desire.
Lo here, this harty draught The last that in this world meane to tast, Dreadlesse of death (mine Earle) drink to thee.
So now worke on, now doth my soul begin To hate this light, wherin there is no loue, No loue of parents to their children, No loue of Princes to their Subiects true, No loue of Ladies to their dearest loues.
Now passe to the pleasant land of loue, Where heauenly loue immortall flourisheth: The Gods abhorre the company of men, Hel is on earth, yea hel it selfe is heauen Compar'd with earth.
cal to wit hn, Heauen, said I? no, but hel record call, And thou sterne Goddesse of reuenging wrongs Witnesse with me die for his pure loue That liued mine.

What hast thou done? oh let me see thine eyes, Oh let me dresse vp those vntrimmed locks, Looke vp, sweet child, look vp mine only ioy, Tis thy father that beseecheth thee: Reare vp thy body, straine thy dying voice To speake to him, sweet Gismund speake to me.
Tis thy father, ah behold my teares Like pearled deaw that trickle down my cheekes, To wash my siluer haires.
Oh father king Forbeare your teares, your plaint wil not auaile.
Oh my sweetheart, hast thou receau'd thy life From me, and wilt thou to requite the same, Yeeld me my death? yea death and greater greefe To see thee die for him that did defame Thine honor thus, my kingdome, and thy name.
Gis. Yea therfore father gaue ye life to me, That should die, and now my date is done.
As for your kingdome, and mine own renowne, Which you affirme dishonoured to be That fault imput it where it is, for he That slew mine arle, and sent his heart to me, His hands haue brought this shame and griefe on vs But father, yet if anie sparke remaine Of your deare loue, if euer yet could So much deserue, or at your hands desire, Grant that may obtaine this last request, Tans.
Sae louely child, saie on, what ere it be, Thy father grants it willingly to thee.
My life craue not, for it is not now In you to giue, nor in my selfe to saue, Nor craue mercie for mine Earle and me, Who hath bin slaine with too much crueltie.
With patience must awhile abide Within this life, which now will not be long.
But this is my request, Father praie, That since it pleased so your maiestie, should inioy my loue aliue no more, Yet neretheles let vs not parted be, Whom cruell death could neuer separate: But as we liude and dide together here, So let our bodies be together tombde, Let him with me, and with him be laid Within one shrine, where euer you appoint, This if you grant me, as trust you will, Although liue not to requite this grace, Th'immortall Gods due recompence shall giue To you for this, and so vaine world farewel, My speech is painefull, and mine failes.
My daughter dies, see how the bitter pangs Of tyrannous death, torments her princely heart, She lookes on me, at me she shakes her head, For me she grones, by me my daughter dies, I, I, the author of this Tragedie.
On me, on me, yee downe your Now my daughter, with Oh faire in life, thrice fairer in death, Deare to thy father in thy life thou wert, But in thy death, dearest vnto his heart, kisse thy paled cheekes, and close thine eies, This duetie once promist to my selfe, Thou shouldst performe to me, but ah false hope Now ruthful wretched king what resteth thee? Wilt thou now liue wasted with miserie? Wilt thou now liue that with these eies didst see Thy daughter dead? wilt thou now liue to see Her funerals, that of thy life was stay? Wilt thou now liue that wast her liues decay? Shal not this hand reach to this heart the stroke Mine armes are not so weake, nor are my limmes So feebled with mine age, nor is my heart So daunted with the dread of cowardice, But can wreake due vengeance on that head That wrought the means these louers now be dead Iulio come neare, and lay thine own right hand Vpon my thigh, now take thine oath of me.

Now stand aside, stir not a foote, least thou Make vp the fourth to fill this Tragedie.

With violent hands he that his life doth end, His damned soul to endles night doth wend.
Now resteth it that discharge mine oath, To see th'unhappy louers and the king, Layd in one tombe: would be very loath: You should wayt here to see this mournful thing.
For am sure, and do ye all to wit, Through griefe wherin the Lords of Salerne be, These funerals are not prepared yet: Nor do they think on that solemnitie.
As for the fury, ye must vnderstand, Now she hath seen the'ffect of her desire, She is departed, and hath left our land, Graunting this end vnto her hellish ire.
Now humbly pray we that our English dames May neuer lead their loues into mistrust: But that their honors may auoid the shames That follow such as liue in wanton lust.
We know they beare them on their vertues bold With blisfull chastitie so wel content, That when their liues, and loues abroad are told, All men admire their vertuous gouernment.

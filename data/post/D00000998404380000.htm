This boke techyng al people to gouerne them in helthe is translated out of the Latyne tonge in to englishe by Thomas Paynell.
Whiche boke is as profitable as nedefull to be had and redde as any can be to obserue corporall helthe.
To the ryght excellent and honorable lorde Iohu~ Erle of Oxforde and hygh chamberlayne of Englande Thomas Paynell gretynge.
REdynge of olde authors and stories my most honorable lorde fynde that me~ in tyme past were of lo~ger lyfe and of more propsperous helthe than they are nowe adayes.
Whiche thynge as hit greued me so in maner hit enforced me to seke the cause of this sodeyne and stra~ge alteracion.
The Sibyls of Cumane liued .iii C. wynters: Nestor .iii.C. wynters: Arganton kynge of Tartesses .iii.C. yeres: and Galen that famous doctor .C. and .xl. yeres: but nowe adays (alas) if a man may aproche to .xl. or .lx yeres me~ repute hym happy and fortunate.
But yet howe many come therto? To serche gyue ye very true reason herof passeth my small capacite: without may say hit be bicause we fulfyll nat the commandementes of almyghty god: whiche to well wyllyng {per}sones are very lyght and of no burden.
For our lorde sayth: My yocke is swete and my burden lyght to be borne.
Sayth nat the prophet Dauid: that who so feareth god and walketh in his wayes and preceptis shal se his childers children? And Salomon sayth: my childre~ forget nat my preceptes lawes: for they shall kepe you {pro}lo~ge your days yeres.
And wyll (saith our lorde god by Dauid) lengthen his dayes.
Than may nat this be a reasonable cause of this our so shorte and wretched lyfe? Trewely suppose hit be by our myslyuynge and fylthy synne? whiche beynge so abominable and so horrible is at somtyme the very cause of corporall infirmite and of short lyfe.
Sayd nat our lorde the phisician of all phisicians to the sicke man: Nowe haue heled the depart thou from hens: and loke thou syn no more lest a worse harme happe~ vpo~ the? Or whether shall say yt hit chanceth by our mys diete? and to moche surfettynge? Truely the prouerbe sayth that there dye many mo by surfet than by the sworde.
Accordyng wherto ye wyse ma~ sayth: Surfet sleeth many a one: and temperance prolongeth the life.
Surfet and diuersites of meates and drynkes lettyng and corruptyng the digestio~ febleth man and very oft causeth this shortnes of lyfe.
What other thyng but mys diete caused Pto+lomeus Philadelphus to be so miserably peynfully vexed with the goute: and so (as hit is written) that nothyng coude relesse his peyne sauyng dethe? What caused Antipater that noble man Mecenas to be contynually vexed with the feuer but yll dite? What other thynge infected Aristarcus with the dropsy but yl diete? Yll diete (as me thynketh) is chiefcause of all dangerous and intollerable diseases: and of the shortenes of mans life.
Than hit must nedes folowe that a te~perate and a moderate diete prolongeth mans lyfe: and saueth hym from all suche peynfull diseases.
And therfore Asclepiades that noble phisicia~ professed There are .v. necessarie thynges to conserue and prolonge mans prosperite and helthe: that is abstinence from meate abstinence from wyne rubbyng of the body exercise and digestio~.
howe holsome is hit than to vse good diete to lyue temperatly to eschewe excesse of meatis and drinkes? Yea howe greatly are we Englishe men bounde to the maisters of the vnyuersite of Salerne (Salerne is in the realme of Naples) whiche vouchesafed in our behalfe to compile thus necessari and thus holsome a boke? But what auayleth hit to haue golde or abundance of riches if one can nat vse hit? What helpeth costely medicines if one receyue them nat? So what profiteth vs a boke be hit neuer so expedient and frutefull if we vnderstande hit nat? Wherfore consydryng the frute yt myght come of this boke if hit were translated in to the englishe tonge (for why euery ma~ vnderstandeth nat the latine) thought hit very expedient at some tymes for the welthe of vnlerned {per}sones to busy my selfe ther in: For lerned {per}sones and suche as haue great experie~ce nede no instructions to diete them selfe nor to conserue theyr helthe.
Yet if suche other wyse and discrete parsones as is your lordeshippe by chance rede this boke: they may {per}auenture fynde that shall please them: and that besides theyr owne diete and custome of lyuynge shall be for theyr corporall welfare and good helthe.
wyll nat nor it becometh me nat to exhorte your lordshyp with let of other your great busynesses to rede this my powre tra~slacion: but if per chaunce at your leisure ye rede hit humbly desyre and praye your good lordeshyppe to rede hit with forgyuenes and to accept the same as hit is worthy.

THis littell boke was compiled at the instance for the vse of the moste noble and victorious kynge of Englande and of Fra~ce by the doctours and phisitians of the vniuersite of Salerne to conserue and kepe mans body in good helthe and prosperite.
The auctor in the begynnynge of this boke teacheth .viij. generall doctrines whiche here after be specified and also declared.
The firste doctrine is to eschewe auoide (if we desyre corporall helthe) greatte charges thought and care.
For thoughte drieth vp mans boby hurtynge and leauynge the spiritis in desolation and comfortles: whiche so lefte and full of of heuines drieth vp the bones.
In this doctrine be co~prehended melancolynes and heuines whiche greatly hurte the body: for by their operation the body waxeth lene and colde the hatte shrynkethe vp the wytte and vnderstandynge cometh dulle the reason troubled the memorie vtterly marred.
Yet neuerthelesse it is very expedient for fatte and corsye folke to be some tyme pensyue and heuy that there by they may moderate the ranke heate of their spiritis and make their bodies leaner and more sklender.
For anger in lyke maner drieth vp the body and excessiuely chaffeth inflameth the membres.
And to greatte heate (as writethe Auicen in the firste dist. and fyrste chap. of the .iij. doctrine) drieth vp mans body.
Secondly anger hurtethe by the heate and infla~mation of mans harte and lettethe also the operations of reason.
Some there be that naturally or by sickenes or chance of poyson are colde: for suche folke to be angrye is verye necessary for their bodily helthe that their naturall hete by suche meanes may be stered vp gotten and kepte.
The thirde doctrine is to eate and drynke sobrely: for eatynge drynky~ge excessiuely causeth vs to be vnlusty drousy slouthfull hurtynge infeblynge the stomake.
Many other inconuenientises (as saith Auicen in the chap. of wyne and water) groweth and chanceth throughe excesse of meates and drynkes as here after shall be declared.
For to moche meate take~ at nyght causeth and ingendreth gnawynge and payne in the bealye vnquietnes let of naturall rest and other grefes whiche we fele and se by experie~ce: the whiche here after shalbe more playnlye declaredde.
For therby the meate disce~deth to the bottum of the stomake where (as Auicen sayth) restethe the vertue of digestion.
For the mouthe of the stomake desireth foode and maketh digestio~.
The .vj. doctrine is to eschewe slepe inco~tinent after meate whiche causeth helthe and auoideth diuers infirmities as hit is after shewed in these verses: Febris pigrities &c.
The .vij. doctrine is to make water as ofte as nedethe: For who that kepeth or holdethe his water longer than nature requirethe shall auoide it with great peyne: and so hit may chance that dethe shall folowe as Auicen saith in his .xix. dist. li.iij. and chaptre of the difficulte of makynge of water.
Also to kepe the dregges and superfluite of mans foode longer tha~ nature requireth ingendreth many inco~uenientises in the body.
For the liuer and veynes called meseraikes drie vp (for the moste parte) the humors of the forsayd superfluite and so made hard can nat be auoided: and thus causethe opilations in the guttis and ventosites and (so it may chance) impostumes: as after shall be shewed.
The .viij. doctrine is that one doynge his easement and auoydyng ordeurs and filth of the body shuld nat moche inforce and constrayne his fundement: for so doinge the emerardes fistule shal greue hym and the fundeme~t many tymes is mysordred and thrust out of his propre naturall place.
Finally thauctor saythe that who so wyll obserue the forsayde doctrines shall lyue longe in good helthe and prosperite.
Si tibi defitiunt medici medici tibi fiant Hec tria. mens leta requies moderata dieta.
Here thauctor gyuethe .iij. generall remedies to conserue in helth al creatures and specially noble men.
The firste is to lyue ioyfullye: for ioye and myrthe causeth man to be yonge and lustye.
By moderate ioy and myrthe youth is conserued naturall vertue co~forted the witte sharped therby man is more prompt quicke and of abilite to do all good and honest operation.
Nor it is nat sayde without a cause that our ioy and myrthe muste be moderate.
For whan it is without measure it ingendreth dethe bothe bodilye and goostlye.
This moderate ioy is mooste conuenient for them that haue moche care and trouble.
Whiche ioy may be+gotte by the vse of delicate meates and drynkes by auoidynge of suche thynges as ingendre melancoly.
And also (as Auicen sayth in his .xj. boke chap. of faylynge of mans harte) by dwellynge and accompanyng amonge our frendes.
The .ij. remedy is tra~quillite of mynde of vndersta~dyng and of thoughte.
For noble men throughe theyr great busynes and charges are moche more greued troubled tha~ other meane persones.
Great care of mynde and vnderstandyng distroyeth the natural rest of man most expedient for noble me~ whiche moste co~monly are naturally drye and colerike: for whom rest is ryght profitable and conuenient.
The .iij. remedy is moderate diete that is to eate and drynke moderately.
And after shall be declared what inconueniences growe through excesse of meates and drynkes.
Hac illac modicum pergat. modicum sua membra Extendat. crinem pectat. dentes fricet. ista Confortant cetebrum confortant cetera membra.
Here are declared .vj. doctrines whiche conforte mans brayne the other membres of the bodye.
The fyrst is whan we ryse in the mornynge yarly to wasshe our eies with clere colde water.
The eies wolde be wasshed to cle~se away the ordure and fylthynes that hange in the bries of them.
And Auicen saythe in the .xiij. dist. of his .iij. boke and chap. of conseruacion of the eies that the souera~st thyng to mundifie and clense and to make sharpe of syght the eies is to open them and so to put plunge them in clere water.
And agayne he sayth in the .iij. dist. and chaptre of feble syghte that to bathe and plunge the eies in clere water therin to open them co~forteth and concerueth the sight and specially of yonge folke.
The reason why the eies muste be clensed with colde water is bycause euerye thynge muste be conserued by that that is lyke hit.
For Galen in his .iij. boke de reg. saythe that hotte bodies haue nede of hotte medicins colde bodies colde medicins: Considerynge than that mans eies be colde of nature: hit standethe with reaso~ they shulde be washed with colde water nat with hotte.
The .ij. doctrine is to washe our handes whan we be vp in the mornynge for they be intrumentes ordeyned to kepe to mundifie the membres by the whiche the su{per}fluites of the brayne be expulsed and auoided as by the nostrils the eies the eares and other naturall conditis.
And therfore the ha~des specially oughte to be washed with colde water for the washynge of the handes with hotte water engendreth wormes in the bealy: and specially to washe them in hotte water incontinent after meate as Auicen saythe in the .xvj. dist. of his .iij. boke the .v. treatice the chap. of wormes.
For the wasshynge of handes in hotte water incontinent after meate draweth the inwarde and naturall heate of man to the exterior partis and so the digestion is vn{per}fet: the whiche vn{per}fet digestion is the principall cause that wormes be engendred.
The thirde doctrine is to rome a lytell hither and thyther whan we are rysen from reste that so the superfluites of the stomake guttes lyuer (as the grosse matter of the vrine) may ye spediler be thruste vnder.
The .iiij. doctrine is competently after reste to extende and stretche out our handes fete and other lymmes that the lyfely spiritis may come to the exterior partis of the bodye and so cause the spiritis of the brayne to be more quicke and subtile.
The .v. doctrine is to combe our heed in the mornynge to open the pores of the heed to auoide suche vapours as yet by slepe were nat consumed: and also to quicke~ the spiritis of the brayne.
Farther more to combe the heed is very holsome and specially for aged me~.
And Auicen saith in the .iij. dist. of his .iiij. boke and chap. of feble sight that to co~be the heed is holsome specially for olde men.
For ofte combyng draweth vp the vapours to the superior partis and so seperateth them from the eies.
The .vj. doctrine is to washe and purge the tethe.
For the filthynes of the tethe causethe the brethe to stynke.
And of the filthynes of the tethe growethe certeyne vapours that greatly anoye the brayne.
Farther more the filthynes of ye tethe myngled with thy meate causethe the meate to putrifie in the stomake.
Auicen in his .vij. dist. of the .iij. boke and chap. of co~seruacion of the tethe teacheth how we may kepe the tethe from ache stynche.
That is to washe the mouthe with wyne twyse a moneth: but to make the brethe swete it muste be boyled with the roote of spurge.
Who so euer vsethe the forsayde decoction medicine shall neuer haue the tothe ache.
In the laste verse are certeine generall rules: The first is that after we haue washed and bathed our selfe we muste kepe vs warme: For than the cunditis of the bodye that is the pores bene open: wherby colde wyll perce in to the bodye and ingendre in vs diuers diseases.
The .ij. is that after we haue dyned or taken our repast we muste for a whyle stande vp ryghte that so the meate may discende to the bottum of the stomake and tha~ walke a litel softely: for hasty mouynge driueth naturall hete from the interior partes to the outwarde and causeth il digestion.
The .iij. is that one of colde complexion shulde nat warme hym selfe to sodaynly but lytell and lytell. for sodayne change hurteth nature: as Galen sayth in the of this canon: Secundum multum et repente &c.
All stronge thynges and of extreme nature corrupt the body.
Febris pigrities capitis dolor at{que} catarrus Hec tibi proueniunt ex somno meridiano.
Here are declared .iiij. inco~uenientices enge~dred by after none slepe.
Fyrst the after none slepe causeth and inge~dreth feuers by reason of opilatio~s.
For the naturall hete and spirite of man by daye draweth to the outwarde partes of the body: and therfore digestion by day is but feble: But whan naturall heate and spiritis of ma~ drawe to the inwarde partis of the bodye: than throughe theyr motion naturall heate is stered vp: and therfore the nyght is the very season of perfite digestion: and the vndigested rawe humours are ye cause of opilations whiche opilations enge~dre feuers as Auicen saythe in the .j. dist. li.iiij. and chap. of putrifaction.
Secondly after none slepe causethe man to be slouthfull in his operations busines by the reason afore sayde for grosse humours and vndigested cause mans spiritis slowelye to moue the bodye: For as a subtile quicke spirite causeth lyghtnes of body so a lumpishe spirite causeth a sluggishe boby.
Thyrdly the after none slepe enge~dreth heed ache: For the grosse and vndigested meate that remayneth in the stomake lyfte vp to the brayne grosse vapours whiche trouble hit.
And of very co~sequens if vapours of gros mattier be stered vp caused they must also be gros.
For Galen saythe in the glose of this aphorisme: qui crescunt &c. that hit muste nedes folowe that all thynges be lyke those thynges of whom they be engendred.
Reumes be humours that rounne from one membre to an other and as they rounne in diuers partis of the bodye so they haue diuers names.
For whan the reume cometh to the lightes they be called catarri: and whan they discende to the chekes they be called branchus: and whan they come to the nose they are called corizam: as appereth by these verses: Si fluit ad pectus dicatur reuma catarrus Ad fauces branchus ad nares dico corizam.
But besides the reaso~s of the diseases before rehersed there be many other reasons and more effectuell.
The cause of the first inco~uenie~ce that is of feuers whiche some tyme are called putrified feuers and some tyme feuers effimeres.
feuer effimere is enge~dred of vapours and smudge fumes kept and reteined after the after noone slepe the whiche absteynynge from slepe is wont to co~sume.
The forsaide smudge fumes mixyng them selfe with mans spiritis engendre an vnordinate and a stra~ge feuer called effimere.
The putrified feuer is ingengdred of the humidites in man vndigested and augme~ted by the after noone slepe.
The .ij. inconuenience that is to be slowe in operation and motions chanceth by reason that by the after noone slepe the humidites and fumes in ma~ are reteined about ye muskyls veynes iointis and causeth the forsayde membres to be astonyed and a slepe: and therfore the bodye after dyner is slowe and heuy in operations.
The thyrde inconuenience (that is the heed age) cometh as is before declared in the .ij. inco~uenie~ce: that is to say by the humidites vapours reteined in the body throughe slepe and rest: whiche by suche meanes are troubled and moued towarde the brayne and so cause the heed age.
The .iiij. inconuenience is (that is the catarr~) signyfyenge al maner of reumes chanceth to man and vexeth hym through vapours and fumes whiche are wonte to be dissolued co~sumed by watche by slepe they drawe to the inwarde partis of ma~ and fume vpwarde towarde the brayne: whiche fumes ingrossed by colde retourne to the lowe partis caterrisans of mans bodye.
Auicen in the .xiii. dist. li.j. in the .ij. doctrine and .ix. chap. allegeth many other inconueniencis diseases engendred of the after noone slepe.
Whiche greue vs by reason that the humidites that are wonte to be dried vp and co~sumed by the heate of the sonne and by watche remayne styll in the body.
The seconde is the color and corruption of the face through the wattrishe humidites lyke vnto mans vrine myngled with the bludde whiche are wonte to be wasted by watche yt nowe with the bludde they ascende towarde the brayne the face and cause it to swelle and to waxe pale.
The thirde inco~uenience is that after noone slepe ingendreth the splene and that by the kepynge in of the grosse melancoly humours by the day rest.
For as watche with the heate of the day (whiche do open) gyueth mouynge and way to melancoly humours by the strayte cundites of the body: so the daye slepe letteth and distroyeth the passages and {pro}pre wayes of them: specially it destroyeth the cundites yt come from the splene to the mouth of the stomake made to prouoke mans appetite by whiche cundite all melancoly superfluites are wonte co~monly to be clarified.
The .iiij. is that after noone slepe mollifieth the veynes by cause the humedites whiche are wonte to be desolued by the day watche can nat be resolued: whiche so remaynynge in mans body drie vp the veynes.
The .v. inco~uenience is that ma~ by reason of rest or slepe losethe his appetite for lacke of humors resolution: whiche resolution is chiefe and principall cause of ye appetite.
An other reason is the replenisshynge of the stomake by fumes and humidites mollifieth and fyllethe the mouthe therof.
The .vi. inco~uenience that after noone slepe doth engendre is impostumes by meanes of humidites encreased by ye day slepe whiche drawe to one membre or other and so cause it to swelle.
Auicen sayth that besides all these aforsayde there be .ij. other speciall causes that proue the after noone slepe to be hurtfull.
The fyrst is that the day rest is soone corrupted bycause the heate of the daye draweth the corporall heate to the exterior partis of man: but the nyght rest dothe clene contrarie for it draweth the corporall heate of man towarde the inwarde partis.
Of the whiche two motions there is engendred a violent mocion that distourbethe nature.
And therfore they that wyll slepe rest them by day: are counsayled to slepe in darke places and in the shadowe.
The .ij. cause is that the day reste maketh a man vnlusty drousy and as halfe a ferde and that by the changynge of nature from his olde custome that is from digestio~ of his meate: yet nat withstandynge that the after noone rest is generally dispreysed the nyght reste greatly co~mended and preysed yet the slepe that is taken in the mornyng from .iij. houres before the sonne rysynge tyll .iij. of the clocke after ye sonne is rysen is nat to be dispreysed: As Hippocrates saith in his .ij. boke of pronostic.
Slepe co~uenient and naturall taken by nyght or by day is allowable and contrarie is hurtfull: but the mornynge slepe of all the day is lest worthy dispreise.
And all be hit the day slepe and at after noone are forbyden by olde fathers and doctours yet for all that nowe adayes slepe taken in the day tyme is nat greatly to be blamed specially as Bartrutius saythe if these .v. condicions therin be diligently obserued.
The fyrst is if hit be customably vsed: The .ij. that it be nat taken immediatly after dyner.
The .iij. that one slepe nat with a lowe heed.
The .v. nat to be waked sodeynly ferfully but with good moderatio~.
Here are declared .iiij. inconueniences that come by to longe holdynge of wynde in mans bodye.
The ventosites of the body ronne ofte amonge the iointes veynes fyllynge them with wynde.
Qf the whiche fyllynge co~methe retraction and wrynkelynge to gether of the veynes.
And Auicen saythe in his .ij. dist. the crampe is a disease that lyethe in the veynes: by the whiche the membres of man moue extende them selfe.
This crampe is diuers: one is caused by replenyshynge: wherby the membre is made shorte and great and wrynkelynge to gether as lether or a harpe strynge throughe the matter replenyshynge the me~bres.
There is a nother kynde of the crampe moche lyke a taboret: whiche inforceth the membre after his lengthe largenes to crompull to gether like parchement cast in the fire.
The seconde inco~uenience is called the dropsye a materiall disease enge~dred of mattier ryght colde entrynge and inflatynge the membres or places of mans body in whiche is the regiment that is the digestion of meates and humours as the stomake the lyuer and the voide places about the bealye.
For dropsye neuer engendreth but whan the lyuer is corrupt by reaso~ of the bludde.
Iposarca asclides tympanites: of the tympany this .ij. inco~uenie~ce is vnderstande.
tympany (as sayth maister Bartruce) is inge~dred of ill co~plextion by coldenes of the stomake lyuer nat sufferyng mans drynke or meate to be co~uerted in to good humours but tourneth them in to ventosites whiche if they be auoyded by belchynge by sweate or other wyse they wyll stoppe the wayes of voida~ce.
Also these ventosities gether to gyther betwene the places of the bealye called mirac and siphax and there ingendreth the dropsy.
The .iij. inconuenience is called the colike a perillous a paynefull disease it ingendreth in a gutte named colon.
Like as the disease called ilica is ingendred in one of the guttes called ylion.
And these .ij. diseases are ingendred by ventosites closed in the guttes.
The .iiij. inconuenience and disease is the heed ache called vertigo: whiche maketh a man to wene that the worlde turneth: the ventosites of the brayne causeth this infirmite: whiche drawe~ to the brayne myxte with the lyuely spiritis causeth the heed age called vertigo.
Auicen in his .xvj. dist. reherseth these inconuenie~ces with other: and he sayth that ventosites kepte longe cause and ingendre the colicke by reason they assende and gether to gether feblysshynge the guttes.
And some tyme ingendreth the dropsye: and some tyme darkenes of syght and some tyme the megryme and some tyme the fallynge yuel and some tyme it runneth in to the ioyntes and causeth the crampe.
Ex magna cena stomacho fit maxima pena Vt sit nocte senis sit tibi cena breuis.
For to moche meate lettethe mans naturall reste and causeth anguyshe gnawyng in the bealy causeth the face to breake out: maketh one to haue a heuye heed in the mornynge and an vnsauerye mouthe.
Whether a man shulde eate more at dyner or at soupper? For a diffinicion here of it is to be noted: that after the quantite of the bodye more or lesse meate is conuenient at soupper or at dyner.
For other the bodyes be holle and sounde orelles sycke.
If they be sycke eyther incline to materiall sickenes or to vnmateriall: If ye sickenes be nat caused through some humour: one may eate the more at soupper: bicause in suche sickenesses nature only endeuereth to digeste the meate.
If the sickenes be materiall one maye eate the more at diner as it is declared in the .iiij. treatise in the .v. chap. of the curation of fallynge sickenes on this wyse: He that can nat be sufficed with one repast in a day bicause he is other wyse accustomed he must deuide his meate in thre partis and eate .ij. partis at dyner and the other parte after temperate exercise at soupper.
The reaso~ here of is this: For in suche sesonne ye feble nature hath helpe by the naturall heate of the sonne to digest and the superfluites there by are more resolued wherfore the refection shulde be larger at diner tha~ at soupper.
And more ouer bycause the heate of the day whiche causeth digestion ioyneth with the naturall heate of mans body: and so by day are .ij. sondrye heates to helpe the digestion: but it is nat so in the nyghte.
Lyke wyse nature endeuereth by night to digest the su{per}fluites.
Therfore it shulde nat be hyndred to digest with to moche meate.
And though it be so that the naturall heate of ma~ be in many thynges fortified in the nyght: as by retraction of the spiritis and reductio~ of slepe: yet that selfe heate can nat digest .ij. diuers thynges as the meate the su{per}fluites.
Than it foloweth that suche folke shulde eate lesse at souper.
If the bodyes of suche seme hole or elles be verye hole stronge without any sensibilite of superfluites auoydynge all through theyr vigour as myghty bygge men: suche may eate more at soupper.
For the nature of these bodies labour only by nyghte to digest the meate receyued: and nat to rype the superfluites: for in a maner they haue none.
Also they labour onely to fortifie theyr bodies whiche waxethe more stronger by nyghte than by daye: bicause the bludde and corporall spiritis be ingendred by nyght in a more quantite and better deuided throughe out the bodye.
If the bodies be nat greatly disposed as is rehersed: but are disposed to be lyghtly sicke: Than whether they trauayle and labour sore co~tinually with theyr armes and handes or nat: hit is best they eate more at dyner than at soupper.
For meate is nat onely taken to norishe restore ye body: but also to make moyste to ouer sprynkylle and water the membres that through great labour and trauaile they waxe nat drie: and lyke wyse to withsta~de the dissolution of naturall heate.
For we se by experience that they eate twyse or thryse in a daye with good appetite and good digestion.
If the bodies be nat apte nor disposed to labour co~tinually as ye bodies afore rehersed: hit may chance .ij. wayes: For either they labour very sore but nat continually: or they labour febly: wherby su{per}fluites encreace.
They that trauayle moche: as in rydy~ge or goynge aboute theyr worldlye busynes shulde eate more at soupper than at dyner: bycause the vnaccustomed great trauaile wolde nat suffre the meate taken at dyner to digest but corrupte hit.
Yea and farther through superfluous mocion the naturall heate is disolued spredde in euery me~bre of the body: whiche in the nyghte draweth to the inwarde partis of the body and is the principall cause of good digestion.
And therfore a good and a large soupper is more expedient for them than a large dyner.
Also the same {per}sons were nat brought vp before this sesonne in suche great trauayle: and therfore theyr bodyes are full of humidites: whiche lyttell meate at dyner maye resyste ye resolutions caused by great motions trauaile.
But in case they trauaile lyttell and easelye by the way to eate more at dyner tha~ at soupper is best: as hit is declared in sicke bodies for they most co~monly are feble bothe of co~plection of digestion and the heate and lyght of the sonne co~forte theyr naturall heate and spiritis.
Also the reason herof is this the corporall cu~dites and passages by day are open: wherfore the su{per}fluites of the body are sooner expulsed by daye than by nyghte.
Farther they ought to eate but lyttell meate by nyght: for tha~ nature is greatly occupied to digest rawe humours: the whiche slepe must digest and brynge to good poynt.
And though the digestion to digest and great repletions of meates and the superfluous humours be holpe by the night.
Yet neuer ye lesse the streingthynge therof is nat sufficie~t to digest great repletions of meates and also superfluous humours.
And weteth well ye custome in eaty~ge moche or lyttell at dyner or soupper oughte to be regarded and kepte.
For custome is good and necessary for helthe of ye body and to cure sickenes: as appereth .li.ij. of sharpe diseases.
For sodeyne change of custome is very hurtfull and specially for olde folkes.
For nature can nat beare nor yet suffre sodeyne mutation.
And thus it is well proued that we ought to eate more at dyner than at soupper: and that bicause sickenesses are most co~monly materialles yet for all that if a man coude be contented with one repast in a day it were better to take it at soupper than at dyner: so that he be nat diseased in the eies or the brayne: for than it were better to take it at dyner than at soupper.
For the repletion of the soupper hurtethe sore the brayne and the eies.
And witteth well that nat onely the repletion of the soupper hurteth the stomacke but also al maner of other repletions.
For they ingendre opylations feuers putrifactions the lepre and vndigested humours.
And Auicen (in the .xiij. dist. of his .iij. boke and chap. of thinges that hurte the stomake) sayth that al maner of repletions hurt the stomake: nor ye great eater by repletion augmenteth nat his bodye for he digesteth nat his meate: but he that eateth moderately hath alwayes some appetite increaseth his body: for he digesteth well his meate.
Therfore we ought to take good hede we hurte nat our stomake by ouer moche repletion: nor yt we make nat our selfe poursye and the pulse to beate more vehemently.
In lyke maner repletion that inge~dreth lothynge of meate ought principally to be eschewed but specially whan it cometh of ill meates.
For if hit come by ill meates hit ingendreth payne in the ioyntes in the raynes in the liuer and the goute: and generally al other fleumatike diseases.
And if it come by clene meates: it inge~dreth sharpe feuers and hotte impostumes.
It foloweth than that this repletion muste be eschewed aboue al other.
Secondly we muste take hede we ouer fylle nat our stomakes: and vtterly distroye our appetite: but we muste kepe some appetite: and specially they that haue a stro~ge and a good appetite.
Some there be that haue a feble appetite these ought to eate more than their appetite requireth.
Tu nun{quam} comedas stomachum nisi noueris ante Purgatum vacuum{que} quem sumpseris ante Ex desiderio poteris cognoscere certo Hec tria sunt signa subtilis in ore dieta.
Here are certeine co~mandementes whiche man desyrynge helth muste of necessite obserue kepe more duely than eate or drynke.
The fyrste is he shulde eate no maner of meates without his stomake be net and purged of all yll humours by vomet or other co~uenient wayes.
For if a man receyue meate with corrupte humours in to his stomake: they wyll myngle them selfe to gether and cause the meate newely eaten to corrupt.
The seconde is to eate no more tyll the fyrst meate eaten be digested and auoyded out of the stomake.
For there is nothynge more hurtfull to mans bodye than to caste meate vpon meate nat digested but only begunne to be digested.
For the meate last taken shall let the digestio~ of that yt was first eaten: and the digestion of the meate firste taken shalbe first finyshed: whiche departeth to the lyuer by ye veines called miseraikes and therewith cariethe the meate laste taken nat yet well digested.
Wherof rawe humours and vndigested be multiplied in mans bodye.
Farther in the texte are put .ij. tokens to knowe whan the stomake is voide of the meate before taken.
And for a knowlege hereof witteth well yt there is ij. maner of hungers very hunger and feyned hunger.
Very hunger is discriued by Galen in ye co~ment of the canon of the aphorisme Indigentia non oportet &c. Very hunger (saythe he) is whan a man nedeth meate: But fayned hunger is an appetite to haue meate thoughe the bodye hath no nede therof.
And as verye hunger cometh by contraction and corrugation of the veynes procedy~ge from the mouthe of the stomake by sugillation of the membres nedynge meate: so in lyke wyse feyned hunger is wonte to be caused of them that co~strayne that they shulde {pro}uoke the mouthe of the stomake the membres hauyng no nede of foode as by colde thynges harde or sharpe.
And of this signe .ij. precept precedent Auicen .iij.j. doct .ij. cap. de eo quod &c. saythe: No man ought to eate but after he hath a luste: Nor he shulde nat tarye longe therin whan lust pricketh onles it be a feyned luste as the luste of kronkers or suche whose stomake aborrethe meate: For to endure hunger longe fylleth ye stomake with putrified humours.
And after in the same chap. he saythe: That who so euer loue their helth shulde neuer eate tyll they haue a sure luste: nor tylle theyr stomake and vppermoste entrayles be voided of the fyrste foode.
For the dangerust thinge that may chance mans body is to receiue meate vpon dndigested meate.
The .ij. that signifieth true luste or very hunger is sklendre diete precede~t: that is small sustina~ce before taken: for wha~ hunger foloweth there vpo~ it is verye true hunger.
Farther more knowe ye that to eate moche and of sondry meates mixed to gether at one repaste or refection is worste of all: as fleshe and fishe chekyns and porke: and after to {pro}longe the tyme in eatyng: For the first meate begynnethe nowe to digest whan the other are brought to the table: and so the partis of ye meate are vnlyke in digestion: So that the fyrste taken are digested or the last taken come to the myddes of theyr digestynge: And this causethe that some partis corrupt other some.
And this thyng Auice~ iij.j. doct. cap. ij. de eo &c. warneth sayeng: There is nothynge more dangerous than to myngle diuers sustinances to gether: and after to prolonge the tyme in eatynge.
For whan the laste meate is receyued the fyrste is welnere digested.
Therfore the said meates in diuers of theyr partis (as touchy~g digestion) be nat lyke.
But yet witteth well that prolongynge of tyme in eatynge moderately (as an houre space) to chawe and swolowe our meate well is allowable helpeth moche to the conseruation of helthe.
For good chawynge and swalowynge downe is as halfe a digestion: And ill chawyng of the meate doth either let digestio~ orels doth greatly hyndre it.
But prolongynge of tyme in eatynge with talkynge and tellynge of tales .ij. or .iij. houres is ryght hurtfull: therof are ingendred the diseases before rehersed.
Here are declared .x. maner of meates or foodes that ingendre melancolye and are vnholsome for sicke folkes.
Of whiche the fyrst is eatynge of peches: Wherof Galen .ij. alimentor~ cap. ix. sayth the ieuce of peches and their materiall substance is soone corrupted and vtterly yll. Wherfore they ought nat as some say to be eate~ aft other meate.
But this oughte to be mynded whiche is a commune thynge that all that is moyst slyppery lightly gothe vnder shulde be eaten fyrste: and so shulde peches: whiche swyftely go to the bottum of the stomake and make way for the meates that come after.
But whan they be eaten last they corrupte them selfe and the other meates.
And thus it appereth that this sayenge ought to be vndersta~de of peches eaten after other meate.
For whan they be eaten before meate they be good for ye stomake mollifie the bealye and prouoke the appetite: as Auicen in the .ij. Canon chap. of peches saythe: Ripe peches be good for the stomake gyueth an appetite to meate.
And farther he saithe: They ouhgte nat to be eaten after other meate: for they corrupt after but they must be eaten before.
Like wyse Serapion in ye chaptre of peches by auctorite of Dioscorides saithe: Rype peches are good for the stomake and they mollifie the bealy: But whan they be nat rype they make a man costiue: and whan they be drie they bynde sorer.
And decoction made of drie peches and dronken doth let the flowynge of humidites to ye stomake bealy.
And the pouder of peches cast vpo~ ye place where one bledeth stancheth the bludde.
And al though peches haue these medicinable vertues aforsaid: yet bicause they inge~dre putrified humours they be hurtfull to sicke folkes and specially wha~ they be nat taken dewly.
Peches be colde in the fyrste degree and moyst in the seconde.
The cause is for peres (and generally al maner of newe and rawe frute) fylle ye bludde with water boylynge vp in the body: And so prepareth the bludde to putrifie and by consequens hurtfull for sicke folkes.
Peres as Auicen in .ij. canon~ and chap. of them sayth engendre the colicke.
And therfore hogges fedde with peres are made fatter tha~ wt any other frute.
And bicause peres inge~dre ventosites and so cause the colicke: therfore they be vsed to be eate~ with suche frute that breake or auoide ventosites: or elles to withsta~de the ill operation of these frutes drynke after them a draughte of olde wyne of good sauour.
And the sweter sauour that peres haue the more doulce the better they be.
And also sodde peres be better tha~ rawe: and they may be sodde with anys sede fenell sede suger.
The thirde is eatynge of apples: whiche as Auicen saythe (.ij. can~.
cap. j.) to eate often and moche cause ache of the senowes.
And also apples haue an yll {pro}prete in enge~dryng ventosites in the seconde digestion wherfore they be vnholsome for sicke folkes.
And also for lyke cause as hit is before sayde of peres.
And these sayenges of peres and apples oughte speciallye to be vnderstande whan they be rawe and nat whan they be sodde or roste.
And nat only these frutes shulde be eschewed of them that be sycke but also all other frutes that fyll the bludde with boylynge water: as newe frute whose ieuce boylethe in mans bodye as hit were must or newe wyne.
And ieuce of frute boyle without in a vessell and that is through the hete of the sonne that remayneth in them whan they ryped.
These newe frutes through boylynge of their ieuce cause the bludde to putrifie.
All though wha~ they be eaten they comfort a mans bodye with theyr moysture.
And for this cause Auicen forbyddeth them specially eatynge of frute yt haue the ague in his .iiij. dist. and chap. of the vniuersall cure sayenge: All frutes hurte them that haue the ague throughe theyr boylynge and corruptyng in the stomake.
The .iiij. is eatynge of mylke: the cause why eatynge of mylke is nat good is bicause it is lyghtly corrupted and turneth vnto fume or sharpenes in the stomake as in theyr stomake specially that are diseased with putrified feuers: therfore they that haue a putrified feuer are forbyden eatynge of mylke.
And to them also hit is hurtfull yt haue the heed ache to them yt haue the swyns pockes to many other.
Wherof Hippocrates speakethe in the Aphorisme: Lac dare caput &c. to gyue them mylke that haue the heed ache is verye hurtefull.
Yet nat withstandynge in some diseases mylke is agreable for them that haue the tysike the feuer etike and for some other: as Hipp. saith in ye afore allegate aphorisme.
And also folowynge some thinge shall be saide wha~ we come to Lac ethicis &c.
And all though mylke in the forsayd diseses is bla+med yet in them that be holle it is allowable and that if it be well digested in the stomacke lyuer.
For tha~ it washeth the e~trayles with it wattrishenes and hit mundifieth with hit buttrines: and striueth agaynst venomous humours: and with hit chese moysteth the membres and alleuiateth the grefes of the brest: and hit doth mitigate the shotynge or prickynge of the longes guttes raynes entrayles and of the bladder: and it is good agaynst prickynge humours in the entrayles.
Farther more mylke is good for te~perate bodies whose stomake is clene from colerike and flumatike humours.
For to suche folke mylke well digested is great nourysshynge hit ingendrethe good bludde it nourisheth the body and conuenientlye moysteth and makethe faire ye exterior partis: as Isaac saith in the vniuersall dietis.
And there also he sayth by auctorite of Ruffus: that they that wyll drynke mylke must drynke it fastynge: and it must be dronke hotte from the cowe: and to eate nothynge tyll that be digested: and nat to labour nor stere aboute moche than.
Yet seldome or at no tyme one shulde forbeare walkynge but than one muste walke an easye pace tyll he parceiue hit be discended to the bottum of ye stomake.
But mylke is vnholsome for these bodies that be diste~pered.
For in hotte bodies it is soone turned in to colerike fumosite.
In suche as be colde hit tournethe to sharpenes and putrifaction.
Also mylke is vnholsome for an vnclene stomake: for therin it corrupteth.
Touchynge the choyce of mylke hit is to be noted that meane mylke is to be chosen for nourishement and nat thynne mylke as mylke of a camell or of an asse: nor the most fatte and grosse is nat to be chosen as mylke of kyne shepe: wherfore goottis mylke shulde be chosen.
For hit is nat so wattrishe as camels mylke: the whiche is nat apte to nourishe by reason of humidite and hit maketh a man to laske: Nor it is nat so fatte nor so grosse nor so full of curdes and butter as kowe mylke and shepis mylke is: whiche by reason of theyr fatnes stoppe the heynes and engendre ve~ tosites: and is more harder of digestion tha~ is necessary in gouernance of helth.
Therfore mylke of a gootte nat to nere kyddynge tyme nor to farre from it and that goth in a good pasture whan pastures be at the best shulde be chosen.
The .v. is eatynge of chese: and it may be vnderstande of all sortes of chese but specially of olde chese.
The reason is bycause newe chese is colde moyst and of grosse substance and harde of digestion: engendreth opilations and the stone: and helpeth or co~serueth mans helth (by way of nourisshement) very littell or nothynge: And olde chese is hotte drie by reason of the salte therin hit causeth digestion: but yet of it selfe it is harde of digestion of small nourisheme~t and hurteth the stomake drieth ouer sore agreeth wors tha~ newe chese.
But chese betwene bothe neyther newe nor olde nat to tough nor to brittill to harde nor to softe to swete nor to sower nat to salte nor to full of eies of good tallege of good sauour whan it is cutte whiche tarieth nat lo~ge in the stomake made co~ueniently of good mylke sufficiently oyly.
Suche chese is good and shulde be chosen afore all other: wherof after meate we shulde eate a lyttell quantite: for moche in qua~tite in way of nourisheme~t is vniuersally ill and hurteth the stomake wyll nat digeste and engendreth opilations the stone in the raynes grosse humours in the body ventosites.
Therfore that chese is onely good that co~meth out of any gardes handes.
The .vj. is salte meate: dryed with salte or smooke and of what kynde of best so euer hit be hit engendreth grosse bludde and melancoly: and so per co~sequens it is vnholsome for sicke folkes: nor holsome for them that be hole: as Auicen .ij.j. doct. ij. cap. xv. about the ende sayth: that salte flesshe nourissheth but littell and that it is grosse enge~dreth yl bludde.
The .vij. is hartis fleshe whiche lyke wyse enge~dreth melancolye bludde as witnesseth Rasis Alma~ .iij. cap. de animalibus siluestribus et domesticis.
The .viij. is hare fleshe whiche lyke wyse engendreth melancoly bludde as Rasis sayth in ye place afore allegate: This fleshe enge~dreth more mela~colye than any other.
And of this Isaac in dictis vniuersalibus sayth: that hare fleshe shulde nat be eaten as meate but onelye vsed in medicines.
And witteth well that hare fleshe hartis fleshe whan they be olde oughte vtterly to be eschewed: yet neuer the les they may be eaten they be best before caluynge tyme that theyr drines may be tempered with the age: And yet they ought to be eschewed excepte they be fatte.
For Isaac in dictis vniuers. saythe: Gootis fleshe and oxe fleshe be worst hardest and of digestion: and whan they be digested they engendre grosse bludde and melancoly.
And Auicen in his .ij. canon of goottis fleshe saythe: Goottis fleshe is nat very good and {per}chance the humour is very yll.
And lyke wyse ye shal vnderstande of goottis fleshe and cowes fleshe: whiche are worse than the forsaide fleshes gootis and oxe fleshe.
For of them Auicen in the .ij. Canon the chap. of fleshe sayth: Cowe fleshe hartis fleshe wylde goottis fleshe and great foules enge~dreth the feuers quartans.
And yet farther he saythe of cowe fleshe: that cowe fleshe nourissheth moche and engendreth grosse melancoly and melancoly disseases.
And of goottis fleshe he saythe that hit is absolutely yll.
And for as moche as hit is touched in ye texte what fleshes shulde be eschewed specially of .iiij. footed bestes: me semeth hit were conuenient to shewe what fleshe of .iiij. footed bestis are to be chose~.
And in the choyce of fleshes the phisitians agree nat.
For Galen and certeyne other say that porke is best.
Some other as Auicen Rasis and Auerroys say that kyddis fleshe is beste.
Yet nat withstandynge Auerroys in the .v. coll. blamethe Auicen by cause he sayde porke was beste: yet he sayde it nat as though he helde therwith but after the christen opinion.
The .ij. is a man may knowe the best fleshe of .iiij. footed bestis ye goodnes therof many maner of wayes.
Fyrst by great nourisshynge whiche thinge betokeneth harde digestion by the lykenes of mans fleshe: and this wise porke is better tha~ any other fleshe fyrste for the lykenes vnto mans fleshe: as witnesseth Galen .iij. alimentor~ where he sayth: That porke is like mans fleshe may be knowen by that that many haue eaten ma~s fleshe in stede of porke and coude nat perceiue neither by the sauour nor the taste but that hit had bene porke.
And Auicen .ij. canon~. cap. de sanguine saythe: Mans bludde and hogges bludde be like in euery thynge: so that there haue bene that haue solde mans fleshe in stede of porke whiche thyng was nat spied tyll a mans fynger was fonde amo~ge ye fleshe.
Auerrois writeth ye same in the .v. coll. cap. de carne.
For Gal. saithe .iij. alimentor~ that porke aboue other fleshe nourishe mooste: wherof those that be called athlete haue beste experience.
And after in the same boke he saythe: One can eate no fleshe ye nourisheth more tha~ porke.
Thirdly porke enge~dreth a stedfaste and a stronge nourishement resistynge resolution.
This is Galens opinion in the places afore rehersed where he preferrethe porke aboue all other fleshe: and in his .viij. boke de ingenio he saythe Porke of all fleshe is moste laudable: so that it be wylde brought vp on montaynes: and next porke kyd.
And lyke wise in .v. tera. he saith: Of al fleshe of .iiij. footed bestis porke is most laudable whiche is temperate in heate and moysture: and engendreth better bludde tha~ any other fleshe: so that hit be of yonge swyne that is of a yere or .ij. olde whether hit be wylde or tame: nor yonge suckers are nat so good: for theyr fleshe is mooste moyste.
And of a more lykelyhod wylde porke broughte vp in the woddes is better than tame brought vp at home: for tame porke is more clammy tha~ it ought to be.
And of wylde hogges fleshe or boore Auicen .ij. Canon~ cap. de carne sayth: Christen men and their folowers say that the best wylde fleshe that is is of a wylde swyne.
For besides that that it is more light than ye tame swynes fleshe it is of more strengthe and moche more nourishynge and more soner digesteth: and in wynter there can be no better fleshe.
So tha~ it foloweth that hogges fleshe is ryghte good holsome for their bodies that be yonge hole stronge occupied in labour and nat disposed to opilatio~s: for them that desyre to be fatte.
For suche haue nede of moche nourishement: and harde of digestion.
And therfore Rasis .iij. Alma~soris cap. de virtute carniu~ saith: Grosse fleshe is conuenable for them ye labour moche: but clene fleshe is beste for them that do contrarie wyse.
Auicen wyll the same .iii.i. ca. de regimine eius quod comeditur. sayenge: They that labour moche maye better a way with grosse meates than other.
The choyce of good fleshe standeth in .iij. thynges: in temperance of co~plection in lightnes of digestion and ingendry~ge of good bludde: that is to say the better fleshe is of temperate complection easy of digestion and temperate in engendrynge bludde betwene hotte and colde sklendernesse and grossenes.
And for this cause kydde fleshe is better more laudable than any other fleshe after the mynde of Rasis Auicen and Auerrois.
For Rasis .iii. Alma~soris ca. de animalibus siluestribus et domesticis. saythe: Kydde fleshe is temperate without any yll mixion: the whiche though it ingendre temperate bludde yet hit is nat conuenient for laborers: but yet for all that no nother fleshe shulde be preferred before it.
Hit is nat so weke that man strength is minished therby: nor the nourishynge therof is so moche grosse ye replecion shulde come of it or grosse bludde be engendred.
The bludde also that is engendred therof is betwene subtile grosse hotte and colde.
Nor this fleshe is nat mete for greatte labourers but for attemperate yonge folkes vsynge meane exercise.
For this fleshe engendreth bludde that by myghty exercise or labour is sone resolued but nat with meane trauaile.
And (touchynge the inte~tion) as kydde fleshe is better tha~ any other housolde fleshe so gottis flesshe is better tha~ any other bredde in the woddes.
And next to kydde flesshe many phisitians as Rasis and Auerrois put mutto~.
And Auerrois saith .v. coll. cap. de carne That mooste part of phisitions are of this opinio~ saue Galen whiche laudeth nat mutton.
And perauenture Galen vndersta~deth here the betternes of nouryshement of that that is to nourishe moche and to gyue nourissheme~t more harde of resolution whiche more agreeth vnto veale than mutton syns mutton is of more humidite.
Thirdly the goodnes and choyce of fleshe maye be taken by reason of theyr smalle cla~mynes and by theyr good sauour: and herein veale is better than any other fleshe.
And this is shewed of Auerrois .v. coll. ca. de carne sayenge: And veale is good fleshe bicause hit is nat cla~my colde nor drie as befe is and veale hath a swetter sauour than any other fleshe: and in these poyntis it is better than kydde fleshe: for in kyd fleshe one may perceiue a clammynes before it is sodde: and in that ye veale inge~dreth better humours it is better tha~ kyd.
And thus it appereth playnely what is the cause of controuersite amonge phisitians touchynge the choyce of flesshes.
Farther witteth well that the fleshe of drye co~plection is better nere caluynge tyme tha~ farre from it: And therfore kyddis and caulues be better tha~ goottis and oxen: bicause their drines is abated with the humidite of theyr yongnes.
But fleshe of beastis of moyst complection is better and more holsome in age than in youthe.
For theyr ouermoche humidite is dried moche awaye as they encreace in age: And therfore wethers of a yere olde are lesse cla~my and more holsomer than suckynge la~mes: and lyke wyse porkes of a yere or .ij. olde are better tha~ yonge pygges.
And therfore Auicen saith well .iii.i. cap. de reg. eius quod comeditur
It behoueth yt the meate that conserueth helth shulde be suche as the fleshe of kydde or a suckyng caulfe is or la~mes of a yere olde.
By these reasons it apperethe than that the fleshe of goottis male and female of olde mutton of befe of olde porke and specially of brawne of pygges and of suckynge lammes is nat verye holsome for the conseruation of mans helthe: but the fleshe of yonge caulues of yerelynge wethers and porke of a yere or .ij. olde is conuenient inoughe to eate to preserue mans helth.
And it is to be well noted that fleshe enclyned to drynes muste be sodde: and inclynynge to humidite muste be rosted to attempre theyr humidite: And therfore the fleshe of conys haaris hartes calues and kyddis shulde be sodde: and porke and la~me rosted: for sethynge attemprethe the drynes.
And herby appereth that in moyste seasons and for moyst complections fleshe disposed to drynes shulde be rosted: and in drie seaso~s and for complections drie and olde moyst meates be more conuenient.
The fyrst are newe layde egges whiche be of that sorte that in littell qua~tite nourishe moche as saythe Auicen .ii. canon~. cap. de ouis. and lyke wyse he saythe in .iiij.j. cap. j. Thynges (sayth he) of smalle quantite and great nourishement are egges and cockes stones.
And the selfe same he repetethe in manye other places.
Touchynge the choyce of egges witteth well that the egges of hennes pertriches and fesances yonge and fatte are very good in regiment of helth and simply better tha~ any other egges: For the prest daughter sayde that lo~ge egges and smalle were the best of all as in these verses: Filia presbiteri iubet pro lege teneri.
Farther poched egges are better than egges rosted hard or rere and they be of great nourishement and of good and lyght digestion and enge~dre bludde speciallye proportionable to the harte: Wherfore they be excedynge good for suche as be recouered from sickenes for aged folke and for weake {per}sons and specially the yolke.
For Auicen in the treatise de viribus cordis saith: that the yolke of egges of foules whose fleshe is good to be eate~ as of hennes pertriches and fesantis thoughe they be nat medicinable for the harte yet they co~forte ryghte moche.
And he addethe folowynge: That they be lyghtly turned in to bludde: after they be turned they haue small superfluite: And therfore they comforte mooste specially the harte.
And farther he saythe that they be excellent good to restore the spiritis bludde of the harte: Rere rosted egges are lyghtly digested and they ease ye longes and the breste and mollifie the bealy te~perately but they nourishe nat so moche as poched egges.
Harde egges sodde are harde of digestio~ and they nourishe the body grossely descendynge slowly to the stomake slowly they entre therin: Farther witteth well that egges by the dressinge of them are made better and worse: For eyther they be rosted sodde or fried or sodde with some brothe.
Rosted egges be more grosse than sodde and more harde of digestion: for the herthe or fire driethe vp theyr substanciall humidite.
And they be rosted .ij. wayes: For either in the shelles they be raked in the hotte imbers orels they be broken in the shelles.
They that be broken be worse than the other: but they that in the shelles be raked in the hotte imbers are done .ij. maner of wayes either they be all raked in the imbers orels sette vpon imbers coles with parte vncouered.
They that be al couered be worse: for by reason that the heate of the fire goth about them the fumosites are kepte styll in they that be sette vpon the ymbers parte vncouered auoyde out the fumosites and be mundified.
They be better sodde~ in water tha~ rosted: for the humidite of the water striueth with the heate of the fire drienge their humidite.
And so they be dressed .ij. wayes: For eyther they be sodde in the shelles orels broken in the water.
Whan they be poched the heate of the water temperately perceth in and maketh more pure theyr grossenes: and takethe awaye the yll smell and sauour.
Wherfore poched they be most holsome and worst fried: For fried they ingendre most yll humours and hurte the stomake causethe fumosite and corruption and maketh one to lothe his meate.
But sodde in some good brothe are betwene bothe rosted and poched.
Also wytteth well that there is a diuersite in an egge touchynge his co~ponde partis.
For the yolke is temperately hotte: The white is colde and clammye and hardlye digesteth and the bludde also therof engendred is nat good.
And as the forsayde egges that is to say of hennes pertriches and of fesantis be more co~uenable in ye regime~t of helth: so egges of duckes gees shouelardis suche like foules are vnholsome in the regiment of helthe and shulde be eschewed.
Where vpon ye shall vnderstande yt wynes differ in colours.
For some wynes be whyte some claret some citrine and some blacke.
White wyne is febler tha~ any other colder and lesse nourishyng but they leest hurte the heed and they make one to pysse better than other.
That they be weaker than other wynes appereth: for after Galen. su{per} .i. canone .iii. {per}ticule regiminis acutorum
Weake wyne is hit that leest heteth or enflameth lesse greueth the brayne than other.
That white wynes be colder than other apperethe by Galen in the co~ment of the canon .iii. partic. reg. acutoru~. where he saythe of white wyne thus: It is impossible that white wyne shulde greatly enflame any man.
And after he saith: White wyne enflameth or heteth leest of all wynes.
Whiche thynge is trewe if one wyll make co~parison betwene white wyne and redde of one countre growynge and none other wyse.
For the redde wynes of Fra~ce are nat so hotte nor yet so stronge as the whyte wynes of some other cou~tre.
And therfore the co~parison muste be made betwene the wynes of one maner and countre: and that they nourishe lesse than other wynes appereth by Galen in the co~ment of this aphorisme .ii. particule aphoris
It is easyer to fyll one with drinke than with meate: where he saythe: Watterysshe sklender white wyne is vniuersally neighbour to water: and as touchynge nourishement is like water wherby it prouoketh one to pisse and nourisheth one to pysse.
And this is the cause that stronge wynes be nat co~uenient for feble brayned folkes as it is saide: But it agreeth well with them that haue a stronge brayne: For a stronge brayne resisteth vapours wha~ they smyte vp there vnto as Auicen saythe .iij.j. and chap. afore allegate.
And here noteth well that the witte of a man hauyng a stronge brayne is clarified and sharped if he drynke good wyne than if he dranke none as Auicen saythe .iij.j. and chap. afore allegate.
And the reason is bycause of good wyne more than of any other drynke are engendred and multiplyed subtile spiritis clene pure.
And this is the reaso~ why that these diuins imagynynge studyenge highe and subtyle matters loue to drynge good wynes.
And after the opinion of Auicen in the forsayde chap. these wynes are good for men of colde and flumatike complection.
For suche wynes redresse and amende the coldenesse of complection: and they open the opilations stoppynges that are wonte to be engendred in suche persons and they digest fleme helpinge nature to conuert and tourne them in to bludde: they lyghtlye digeste and entre quickely they encreace greatly quicke~ the spiritis.
But wyne citrine is nat so burnynge as redde claret as Galen in the co~ment of the canon afore allegate saythe.
Redde wynes be hotter than white therfore they greue the heed more as Galen saythe in the canon Potus autem duicis
Also claret wyne nourisheth lesse than redde and more than whyte.
And in some places they calle claret wyne white: and that is ye cause that some say that white wyne doth quickely enflame mans bodye.
The blacke wynes be nat so feruent hotte as the redde be.
But for as moche as they disce~de more slowly in to the bealy and prouoke more slowly mans vrine they greue the heed more tha~ white wyne as Galen saythe in the canon Potus autem dulcis
And these wynes nourishe lesse than white or citrine and lesse than redde wyne.
The thyrde is suppynges made of good brothe of flesshe but specially of chekyns: for suche brothes are verye frendly to mans nature: and are lightly co~uerted in to good bludde and ingendrethe good bludde specially whan hit is made with fyne flower.
For flower principally of wheate is greatly nouryshynge and causeth great nourisheme~t as saithe .iij. Alman.
And these .iij. forsayde thynges Auicen putteth .ii.i. doct. ii. su~ma. i. ca. xv. in ye ende where he saithe: Example of clene and good nouryshynge meates and humours be the yolkes of egges wyne and brothes made of flesshe: and there vpon he concludeth that these .iij. forsayde thynges are comfortable and of great restoratiue for mans body.
Dulcia vina cibus gustu iocundior oua Sorbilia mature ficus vue{que} recentes.
Here are touched .xij. maner of thynges whiche greatlye nouryshe and make fatte mans bodye.
The fyrst is breadde made of wheate: whiche as Auicen saythe .ii. can~ cap. de pane fatteth swyftely specially whan it is made of newe wheate.
Rasis iij. Alm~ sayth: wheate is neighbour to te~pera~ce all though it incline a littell to heate: the heuiest and soundest nourisheth best: and of all graynes hit is most holsome for all folkes: And the bludde engendred therof is more temperate than of any other grayne.
Touchynge the choyce of wheate ye shal vndersta~de that the election is to be consydered .ii. maner of wayes: Fyrst on the bihalfe of his substance: an other way on the bihalfe of his preparation.
The choyce on ye byhalfe of his substa~ce Auic. putteth .ij. can.
chap. of corne sayenge: That is the better that is neither harde nor softe great fatte and newe nat to olde betwene redde and whyte.
Touchynge the choyce concernynge the preparation witteth well that all thinges made of wheaten flower desce~de from the stomake slowelye engendre grosse humours cause opilations aboute the lyuer augment the splene and engendre the stone and digested nouryshe moche.
Wheate sodde is heuy meate and indigestable but whan it is digested it nourisheth strongely strengthe a man moche.
But wheate made in bread well leuened and bake~ in an ouen hatte with moderate fire is marueilous holsome.
The .ij. thynge is mylke: and after the mynde of some doctours it is vndersta~de by butter mylke called and co~monlye called balbuca.
there is nothynge nourisheth more than this mylke wha~ hit is newe sopped vp with newe hotte breadde.
Hit maye also be vnderstande by goottis mylke: whiche nourysheth moche: wherof we haue largely spoke~ before.
The .iij. thynge is grene chese whiche as Auicen saythe .ii. can.
And al though grene chese nourysheth and fattethe yet hit is nat holsome in the regiment of helthe: for therof come the inconueniences before declared Persica poma &c.
The .iiij. thynge is stones: and specially stones of fatte cockes: whiche as Auice~ .ii. can.
ca. de testiculo sayth: be very good and great nourishers: And he saith that in a small qua~tite they nourishe moche.
This also may be vnderstande of hogges stones verye fatte that hath nat boorred a lowe.
For as porke of all .iiij. legged bestis (touchyng his nouryshynge) is best in lyke maner the stones in regarde of other beastis stones are the beste.
And here is to be well noted that the stones of aged bestis whose sede is fermented be nothynge nouryshynge.
But the stones of yonge bestis nat yet able to do theyr kynde whose sede of generation is nat yet rype: be of metely good nourishement if they be well digested.
The .v. thynge is porke in chosynge wherof and of theffecte of the same is largely declared before there Persica poma &c.
The .vj. thinge is eatynge of braynes: And wyttethe well that brayne is yll for the stomake and causeth lothsomnes and takethe a waye a mans appetite and enge~dreth grosse humours: yet neuer the lesse hit nourisheth the body if hit be well digested: But in no wyse hit shulde be eaten after other meates.
And if hit be dressed with penyriall or nepte to attempre the cla~mynes colde therof or with thynges that by theyr vertue gyue hete: hit is good and holsome.
And take hede eate no brayne outcepte hit be fyrst hatte vpon the coles.
And witteth wel that it is nat good for them that be sicke other while of colde diseases: but for them that be hotte of co~plection hit is holsome as Rasis .iij. Alm. sayth in the chap. de virtutibus membrorum animalium.
And brefely hit is forbydden in the regiment of helthe.
But yet some tyme hit dothe well in medicine: as the brayne of a lyttell gootte is good agaynst venome and against venomous byttynges: And a haaris brayne agaynst tremblynge: And some say the brayne of chekyns and capons is good for the memorie and comforte the wytte.
Yet touchynge the choyce of braynes hit is to be knowe~ that the best braynes be of foules that flee and proprely aboute montaynes.
And of .iiij. foted bestis the best is of a ra~me and nexte of a caulfe as Auicen saythe .ii. can.
The .vij. is marie whiche well digested nourysheth moche: as Auicen saith in the forsayd canon and chap. of marie.
And hit is lyghtly tourned in to bludde: yet neuer the lesse it distroyeth the appetite and makethe one to lothe his meate: And therfore Auicen teachethe vs to eate them with peper.
And touchynge the choyce Auicen saythe the mary of veale of a hart of a bulle of gootis and of shepe is moste holsome.
And some say the marye of yonge fatte bulles is very holsome and good.
The .viij. is swete wynes: wherof we shall entreate after there Sunt nutratiua.
The .ix. is delicious meates for suche most specially nouryshe as Hippocrates sayth.
And Galen sayth that all souorie meate wherin one deliteth wha~ he eateth hit the stomake receyueth and reteyneth and digesteth that with a farre greatter delectation tha~ other: But if the meate be lothsome the stomake wyll nat abyde hit: wherof vomite abhorrynge of meate inflation and belchynge are enge~dred.
And that is ye cause we se some more helthye with cours meate tha~ with good bicause the course is more delicious vnto them.
The .x. is rere egges: whiche in small quantite nourishe moche wherof we haue spoken before at oua recentia &c.
The .xj. is ripe fygges: whiche through their swetnes nourysshe and fatte moche.
And touchynge fygges thoughe they nouryshe nat as stronglye as fleshe and grayne: yet there is no frute so stronge a nourysher: as Auicen sayth .ii. can.
And there he saythe that fygges nouryshe more than any other frutis.
And he saith in regimine eius quod comeditur that frutis of moste nourishement and most lyke and nere vnto fleshe in nourishynge be fygges very rype resyns and dates.
As concernynge the choyce of them witteth well that after Auicen in the place aboue allegate de ficubus.
The white is best for hit is lighter: nexte the ruddy or citrine Rasis in the place before allegate hit nourishethe well and comforteth the stomake and lyuer and auoydethe opilations.
And hit is sayde that the lyuer is fatted with them and specially if they be clensed from ye graynes or kyrnels.
And thus the forsaid text may be vndersta~de of a freshe gethred grape or a resyn: or of a drie grape called passula
Si bona cupis vina. hec tunc probantur in illis Fortia formosa fragrantia frigida frisca.
Here in this texte be declared .v. maner of proues of good wyne.
The fyrst is ye smell for wyne of good odour and flauour multiplieth mans spiritis: and as Constantine .v. theorice saith it nourishethe well and engendrethe good bludde: But stynkynge wyne is vnholsome for mans nature engendrynge grosse and melancolye spiritis.
And after the mynde of the sayde Constantine hit engendreth yll bludde and heed ache of the yll fume ascendynge to ye heed.
Galen .iii. reg. acut. co~mento. i. speakynge of the diuersite of wynes of the odour saith: that wyne that hath good smell enge~dreth good bludde but it fylleth ones heed full of fumes vapours bicause of the subtilte heate therof: But yll smellynge wyne after the quantite of yll bludde engendred therby hurteth the heed verye lyttell bycause hit is colde and grosse.
The .ij. is sauour: for lyke as good sauorye meate norysheth better and is better receiued of the stomake as is aforsayde in lyke wyse so doth wyne.
But ye shall vndersta~de ye wynes differ in sauour: for some be swete more nourishynge tha~ other engendrynge grosse bludde and moystynge the bealye yet they be harde of digestion and engendre thyrst.
There is a nother sorte of wynes called pontica or styptica whiche co~forte the stomake and easeth the bealy but hit hurthe the breast and purtenance as the longes and the pype therof: holsome for the entrayles harde of digestion.
There be other wynes yt be sharpe or sower: that {pro}uoke ones vrine they engendre nat but they dissolue grosse humours.
There be other bytter wynes lesse hotte: as saythe Constantine .v. theorice.
The .iij. is clerenes or brightnes whiche sheweth the purenes of the wyne and so consequentlye of the spiritis therof engendred.
In colour wynes vary and differ greatlye in theyr nouryshynge.
For the ruddier wynes of the same parell are more noryshyng than white.
And therfore they be more holsome for leane folke than white: yet the white be more holsome for them yt be fatte.
And of this diuersite of wyne in colour we haue spoken before at oua recentia.
Farther in the texte are put .v. speciall thy~ges howe a ma~ shulde {pro}ue knowe good wyne.
Fyrst is by ye strengthe whiche is knowen by the operation.
For as Gal. saith stronge wyne is hit that vehementlye enflameth a mans body repleteth the heed.
This stronge wyne is special encreacer of the spiritis a great norysher.
But yet aduise them yt haue a weake brayne to be ware howe they drinke stro~ge wyne outcept hit be well alayed with water.
The .ij. is fairenes of the wyne: For the fairenes or goodlynes of the wyne causeth one to drinke it desirously whiche causeth hit better to digest better to norishe.
For fragrant and redolent wyne co~forteth moste and engendreth subtile spiritis as it is sayde.
The .iiij. is that wyne muste be colde touchynge the taste but hotte in effecte and operatio~.
For wyne made hotte by reason of the clerenes and fynes ouer cometh a mans brayne the soner febleth the senowes and hurteth the heed but if hit be taken moderately.
The .v. is that wyne muste be friske sprynkelynge and with the spumynge to make a littell noyse and the spume to be thynne and soone flashed and the spume to tarye in the myddes.
For if it haue nat these {pro}pretes it must be called hangynge that is feble wyne and specially if hit make no sowne hath great bubbuls spume that tarieth longe by the sydes of the cuppe.
Here is one doctrine of wyne declared: whiche is that grosse and swete wynes be more nourishynge than any other of the parell.
To this agreethe Constantine in the aboue allegate place: so doth Auicen .iii.i. cap. de reg. aque et vini. where he sayth: Grosse wyne that is doulce is beste for hym that wolde be fatte.
The reason is bicause the doulce wynes for theyr doulcetnes are vehemently drawen of the me~bres where with nature reioyceth.
i. cap. iii. that the operations of dulce wynes are digestion mellowy~g and encreasynge of nourishement and nature loueth hit and the vertue attractiue drawethe hit.
And all thoughe this texte may be verified by all doulcet wynes yet the moderate doulce wyne is to be chosen nat that that is excedynge doulce as muskadell: For suche corruptethe the bludde by reason that nature draweth hit violently from the stomake to the lyuer before it be wel digested before the su{per}fluite therof be ryped throughe the great dulcetnes therof hit fyllethe the bludde with vndigested aquosite that maketh ye bludde apte to boyle and putrifie.
And this also shulde be vnderstande by other meates excedynge swete.
And farther wytteth well that of the vse of swete wyne and other doulce nourishementes .iij. inconueniences are to be feared specially of them yt be inclined therto.
The fyrst is lothyng: for ye swete foodes through their heate moysture suppull fyll the mouthe of the stomake and there enge~dre a disposition co~trarie to the vacuation corrugacio~ of hit that causethe hunger.
The .ij. is swyfte infla~mation of these doulce foodes conuertynge in to coler.
Therfore hony aboue all other thinges soonest engendreth coler bicause of swete thynges it is moste swetest: and nexte honye is swete wyne as Galen saith.
And here vpon riseth thyrstynes nor hit is nat holsome for them that haue ye ague nor for colerike folkes.
The thyrde is opilation of the lyuer and splene: For these .ij. membres and specially the lyuer drawe dulce thy~ges with theyr dregges to them for the great delite they haue in them before they be digested.
Wherfore ther they lyghtly cause opilations through the helpe operation of the grosse substance wherin the sauorynes of swetenes is grounded as Auicen sayth .ii. can.
And this is the cause that swete wyne doth lesse stere one to pysse tha~ other wynes.
Agaynst these .iij. nocume~tis egre or sharpe sauory thynges are very holsome: for with theyr tartnes they prouoke the appetite: with theyr coldnes they que~che enfla~mation with theyr fynes of substance they open opilations.
Farther wytteth well that all though swete wynes and other doulce nourishementes stoppe or shutte the lyuer and splene: yet they vnstoppe the lo~ges.
And the reason why they stoppe nat the longes as well as the lyuer and splene Gal. declareth in the co~me~t of the can~ .iii. part. reg. acut.
Bicause doulce thinges in their passage resude nothy~ge there to but that that is fyne and pure: and the bludde engendred of doulce thynges cometh to the longis purified fyrst in the lyuer and fyned in the harte.
Also as Hippocrates sayth Doulce wynes do leest make one dronken.
Thus we may co~clude that if wyne be dronke for nourishement for restoratiue of the body and to make one fatte as it cha~ceth in them that be leane whether it be naturally or accidentally: than doulce wynes and grosse sufficiently colored are holsome.
For suche wynes are nouryshers restore of suche as be lowe broughte and fatters.
But if we entende nat to nourishe to restore or make fatte our bodies as they that be corsye and fatte: than though we may nat vse swete wynes but subtile yet they muste chose suche as be amiable and haue good sauour and flauour enclined to whitenes sufficie~tly stro~ge.
If one drynke wyne to quenche his thyrste than he muste take white wyne thynne and feble.
For suche wyne do moyste more and coulethe more: so co~sequently better quencheth thyrste: And the greatter the thirst is the holsomer suche wyne is.
But if so be wyne be dronke to refreshe ye spiritis and comforte the corporall vertue: than hit wolde be subtile swete of delectable sauour of meane colour of sufficient strengthe: and suche wyne ought to be taken with litell meate: and hit must be depured from either super{per}fluite and to be taken in small quantite.
But if we purpose to scoure the breast and longes to cause vs to laske: than doulce wynes of meane substa~ce and of good flauour shulde be chosen.
Si vinum rubeum nimium quando{que} bibatur Venter stirpatur vox limpida turpificatur.
This texte sheweth to vs .ij. hurtis that come by ouer moche drynkynge of redde wyne.
The fyrst is that ouer moche drynkynge of red wyne maketh one costyue.
For suche redde wyne heatethe more than other of the parell and is more nutratiue.
For in that that hit is hotter hit drieth more: in that ye hit is more nutratiue it is more desirously reteyned of nature.
But yet this texte may be vnderstande by ouer moche drinkynge of byndynge redde wyne whiche is some what eger sharpe costiue.
Yet concernynge this wytteth well that if the stomake or the guttis be feble in their naturall operation: than redde or blacke wyne called stypticke that is some what tarte ought to be vsed and dro~ken: as they do that by debilite of stomake can holde nothynge but be laxatiue.
But if we wyll comfort the vertue of digestion the clene wyne or meane in substance and colour of good odour and of conuenient sauour and of sufficient strength some what stipticke is most holsome.
The .ij. is horsenes of ye throte whiche horsenes some redde wynes through their drynes erthynes cause and enduce.
And this hurt cometh also by drinkynge of red wynes growynge in the parties of Brabant throughe theyr stipticalnes and erthynes: and speciallye whan the sayde wynes be nat fyned this grefe chancethe.
But yet they make nat a man costiue: For must that is verye redde is wonte to cause the flixe by reason of his erthye dregges myngled there with all: whiche byteth and gnaweth the guttis: of whiche gnawynge comethe the flixe.
And suche wyne shulde nat be dronke tyll hit be fyned.
For so longe as hit is gnawynge through the erthy dregges therof a mordicant fume is reysed to the brayne whiche gnawethe or bytethe the eies and maketh them redde: Suche inconueniences are engendred by newe vnfyned wynes of Brabant whether they be white or redde through theyr erthynes.
The cause why this fume is mordicatiue is by cause ye wyne that he cometh of is mordicatiue.
For Gal. saythe: What so euer is dissolued from a thynge muste nedes be lyke the thynge from whiche hit is dissolued.
The fyrste is garlyke: whiche is verye medicinable agaynst suche inco~ueniences as are wonte to engendre of water: and speciallye hit is holsome if one drynke yll corrupt water.
Wherof in the segregatis and chap. of garlyke saythe: That if one eate garlyke fyrst and drinke corrupt water after hit shall nat hurte hym.
The same operacion is also in oynions as Auicen saith .ij. can.
chap. of oynions and so oynions may be comprehended vnder garlyke.
And Auice~ in ye fore allegate place sayth: That an oynion is subtile percynge and scourynge with stipticite: and openeth strongly: and is hotte in the thirde degree: wherfore it heateth yll waters {pro}hibitynge that they with their coldnes hurte nat the stomake: and hit makethe pure grosse humours causynge them lyghtely to penytrate.
And vineger myxte with an oynion dothe greatly fortifie his vertue subtile and penitratiue and kepeth one from thyrstynes whiche oynions eaten are wonte to enduce.
And Auicen sayth in the aboue allegate place that one shulde eate garlyke after drinkyng of grosse and troblous waters: for hit fyneth them and maketh them lyghtly to discende: lettethe that they hurte nat the stomake and entrayles: and that they stoppe nat the veynes.
And garlykeis good eate~ before one take his iourney. and after that hit is one of the beste and most holsomest thy~ges that can be for them that come out of a colde aier or go in to hit: as Auicen saith .iii.i. cap. de regendo iter
And by this appereth that garlyke is specially good for them that iourney and wander ouer dyuers countres vse dyuers drynkes accordynge to these verses: Allea qui mane ieiuno sumpserit ore.
More ouer garlyke is good agaynst ye styngynge of venomous wormes bytynges of serpentis whan hit is dronken with wyne: whiche thynge Auicen in the .ij. can.
And also hit is good agaynst the bytynge of a madde dogge: And a playster made of garlyke fygge leaues co~myn is good layde to the place bytten with a venomous beest called mugall.
and chap. therof is eke holsome for bytynge of a madde dogge wha~ the place bytten is annoynted with the ieuse therof or a playster therof made with falte and rewe.
And an oynio~ eaten expelleth the hurte of venomous thynges.
And some saye they enge~dre in a mans stomake a moyst humour very holsome agay~st ye hurt of venomous thy~gis.
And here is to be noted that garlike oynions and also lykes are nat holsome for temperate bodyes nor hotte and speciallye rawe.
For they nourishe verye lyttell and they nourishe yll and engendre sharpe prickynge bludde: yet they make subtile grosse humours and breake or cutte the cla~mye.
And after they be sodde they lose the prickynge and yet than theyr vertue incisiue and subtilatiue remayneth.
Lykes be hotte and drie and their norishement is naughte they hurte the eies and engendre blacke melancoly bludde terrable dreames: they hourte the senowes with theyr prickynges: they hurte the tethe and gommes: and colerike melancoly folkes shulde nat vse to eate them and specially rawe.
Oynio~s be hotte they haue an erthy superfluous heate with a wattrishe moystnes subtile vndigested.
If they be eaten rawe they engendre yll humours and corruptable putrifactions in the stomake and they cause yl dreames and dredful and heed ache.
And if they be to moche vsed they marre the memorie and trouble the vnderstandynge and make one besyde hym selfe.
But in case they be sodde with the brothe of good fleshe eaten tha~ they cause good digestio~ and their hurtfulnes is diminished and they moderate the coldnes of meates where with they be sodde: but the beste is nat to vse them.
Garlyke is hotte declynynge some what to humidite but lesse than oynions hit is medicinable agaynst ve~tositees and the cough and maketh one to spytte well but hit hurteth the syghte and causeth heed ache: and hit is tryacle for vplandyshe men.
And thus the forsayde thynges are holsome for them onely that haue fleumatike grosse and cla~my humours but colerike folkes ought to absteyn from them.
cap. de nuce sayth: That it with fygges and rewe are medicinable agaynst all maner of venome and therof of oynions salte is made a playster to laye to the bytynge of a madde dogge.
And this specially is vnderstande of a drie nutte taken before meate in forme afore sayd.
And witteth well that drye nuttes are worse than newe and moyst.
For the drie are more oylye: by reason wherof they tourne to coler and cause heed ache they trouble the eies and engendre swymmynge in the heed and specially taken after meate: they cause the paulsye in the tonge and prouoke one to vomite and make blisters in ones mouthe: and they that haue a colerike stomake ought specially to eschewe drie nuttis: and the older they be the worse they be.
The newe nuttis haue lesse of yll oylynes and therfore they engendre nat the ache or swymmynge in the heed suche lyke diseases as the drie do: and by reason of their slippery humidite they make one haue the laske.
And if they be a littell warmed at the fyre and eaten after dyner they presse downe the meate.
And thus it appereth ye newe nuttis are more holsome for folkes in helth than drie.
And after he saythe: If one feare leste he drynke poyson or to be sto~ge of a venomous best let hym take of the sede with ye leaues therof dry~ke it with wyne and a nutte stamped and myngled to gether.
And Aristotell in his boke de animalibus saythe that whan the wesill wyll feyght with the edder or the toode she eateth rewe fyrst and sleeth the other: For the smelle of rewe is foo to poyson.
The eatynge of rewe in the mornynge with fygges swete almondes preserueth from venome.
Here is to be noted yt there be .ij. kyndes of rewe.
The one is gardeine rewe ye other is wylde rewe.
Hit is hotte drie in the .iiij. degree: wherfore it is hurtfull to take moche therof.
The gardeyne rewe is moyst hotte and drie in the .ij. and .iij. degree.
It perceth and resolueth ventosite and specially if it be drie.
For Serapion in the chap. of rewe saith that drie rewe of al medicins for ventosites is the best and most holsome: but moyst it engendreth ventosite.
Also rewe vehemently quickeneth the syght and specially the ieuse therof with the ieuse of fenell and honye made in an oyntement orels eaten as Auicen saythe in the .ij. canon and chap. of rewe.
But yet for as moche as the ieuce of rewe hath a proprete hurtfull to the eies it were beste to fanne wynde vpon your eies ther with: in no wyse to tuche your eies with ye materiall rewe.
cap. de piris saith: that they be holsome agaynst mortall diseases enge~dred by mushroms or toode stooles.
Orels this text may be vndersta~de by peres aromatike whiche by reason of their swete smell comforte the spiritis and so repel poyson.
The .v. is radishes: wherof Auicen in his seconde canon and chap. of them sayth: that they be holsome agaynst bytynge of a snake: and dro~ke with wyne it is good agaynst the bytynge of ye beest cornute: and the sede therof is good agaynst all venomes.
And the sede of radishe layde vpon a scorpion hit sleeth hym and the water therof hath in that behalfe ben proued and it is stronger than the sede: and if a scorpion bite one that hath eaten radishe hit shall nat hurte hym.
Or hit maye be saide hit is good agaynst venome bicause hit prouoketh one to vomite: and so by reaso~ of vomite the stomake is purged of yll humours.
And here is to be noted that radishe and radishe rootis are like of co~plectio~ whiche are vnholsom for colerike folke: for they engendre sharpe prickynge bludde: and radishe is vnholsome for the stomake for hit makethe one to belche and engendreth grosse humours.
And if the digestio~ be feble hit enge~dreth rawe humours: yet it is of a subtile and percyng nature.
But some men eate radyshe after other meatis to comfort digestion: wherat Galen maruayleth.
And counnynge phisitions say that if it be eaten after other meates it helpeth digestion: and vnlosethe the bealye.
But if radishe be eaten before other meates hit lygftethe vpwarde the meate and causethe one to vomite.
But it is good to eate a smal qua~tite with vineger and salt after other meate.
Yet neuer the lesse they hurt the eies and the heed.
Rasis .iij. Alm~. sayth that radishe lyenge lo~ge in the stomake voide fleume the leaues wherof digesteth meate and helpeth the appetite take~ in a smal qua~tite.
The .vj. is triacle whiche of euerye sorte is good agaynst venome: and therfore hit is good both for man and beaste agaynst venome as well colde as hotte.
And vnder the name of triacle the noble medicine Metridatis maye be co~prehended: whiche .ij. be lyke in operation.
For Auicen of triacle saythe: Ye shall vnderstande that the greattest rule in curynge of venome is to comforte naturall heate: and to labour to dryue hit out as triacle doth.
And of triacle and the medicine Metridate to gether Auicen saythe: There be certeyne medicines contrarie to venome: whiche will nat suffre venome to approche nere the harte as triacle and Metridate.
This texte declareth .iiij. thinges touchynge the choyce of holsome ayer.
Of whiche the fyrste is that one oughte to chose a clene ayer nat enfected with vapours: For vncleane aier altereth ye hart after the nature of the co~plection yt it is myngled with as Haly sayth.
The .ij. is one shulde chose lyght ayer: For darke aier makethe a man heuye and dulle spirited: for suche aier myngleth it selfe with the humours in mans body and so trubled runneth to the harte: wherby of it and of the humours grosse and troublous spiritis ben engendred whiche make one lumpyshe slowe.
Therfore there is nothinge maketh a ma~ more iocunde and lesse heuye than to walke in a clere aier or to ryse yerly.
The .iij. is that we ought to eschewe infected aier yt is where slaughter of people hath bene.
For co~monly in those places where as great slaughter of people hath bene and in places nere to foloweth great pestilence: for whan we drawe in the infecte aier hit enfecteth the spiritis in our bodye.
The .iiij. is we shulde eschewe gunges synkes gutters chanels stinkynge ditches and all other perticuler places infected with carreine placis where deed carkeses or deed folkes bones are caste and places where hempe and flacce is wattered.
For aier so enfected enfecteth the spiritis of our body and specially hurteth the brayne.
And therfore Auicen saythe that as longe as the aier is temperate and clere and no substance contrarye to mans nature myngled there with hit causeth and conserueth mans helthe.
And whan hit is changed it dothe contrarie to the operation therof: And for a more declaration of the forsaide thingis witteth well that aier in the regiment of helthe is necessarie .ij. wayes.
Secondly for the auoidyng out of fumishe su{per}fluites that trouble the spirite and naturall heate.
For lyke as we se by exterior thynges the fier without fannynge of the aier is schoked quenched: so lyke wyse we may imagin that the spiritis and naturall heate in man haue nede to norishe conserue and attempre them.
The atte~pera~ce of natural heate is caused by drawyng of the aier and his purgynge is caused by expulsynge of the aier.
The fyrste is done by motion of the attraction the seco~de by motion of expulsio~.
Therfore if we drawe in aier stynky~ge vnclene it corrupteth the natural heate and spirite.
Therfore the aier shulde be of good substance without vapours and mistis.
The aier shulde nat be troublous cloudy nor myxed with yll vapours.
For suche aier troubleth the humours and maketh a man heuy and sadde as is afore sayde.
The open aier wolde be chosen and nat betwene walles or houses: and truly to speake the shutte aier shulde de eschewed.
Yet neuer the lesse in tyme of pestylence whan the aier chancethe to be enfected the shutte aier is to be chosen.
Therfore at suche seasons hit is good for vs to abyde within our houses and to kepe our wyndowes fast shutte lest the putrified aier enter in: But elles the open aier is beste.
Farther in the regiment of helthe the aier shulde be eschewed whiche is myxed with vapours of lakes and depe pittis conteinynge stynkynge waters: and of certeyne herbes as cole wortes homlockes and suche lyke: and of trees as fygge trees walnutte trees.
Farther the aier is to be chosen wherin the wynde blowethe from highe or egall gronde.
And also we ought to take good heed that the aier excede nat in any of his fyrste qualitees that is in heate colde moystute and droughte whiche if hit chance hit muste be tempered by craft as moche as is possible.
These thynges Auicen teacheth .ii. primi. doct. ii. de diuersis
St tibi serotina noceat potatio vina Hora matutina rebibas et erit medicina.
This texte teacheth one doctrine whiche is if a ma~ be diseased by dry~kynge of wyne ouer nyght He muste on the morowe a freshe drynke wyne agayne.
For either drynkynge of wyne ouer nyght causeth dronke~nes thyrst in the mornynge or infla~mation of the body.
If hit infla~me the bodye than hit is ryghte vnholsome agayne in the mornynge to drinke wyne a freshe for that were to lay fyre to fire: But if one happe to be dronke there with parbrake a lyttell: than hit were holsome to drynke wyne agayne a freshe in the mornynge.
For the drynkynge of wyne agayne than dothe lyghtly cause one to vomite wherby the stomake is clensed: For by that clensynge the hurt of dro~kennes and parbrakynge gothe lyghtly awaye.
And therfore Hippocrates counsayleth to be dronken ones a moneth: that of the dronkennes may come vomite: whiche thynge preserueth vs from yll diseases of longe continuance.
If drynkynge of wyne ouer eue hurte one and that by reason he is nat accustomed to drynke wyne: than he maye drinke wyne in the mornynge to accustome hym: and so the drinkynge of wyne shal lesse hurt hym.
For as Hippocrates sayth of a customable thyng cometh lesse grefe.
But in case that thyrstynes in the mornynge foloweth on drynkynge of wyne ouer eue: than to drynke water in the mornynge shulde coole his thirst better.
For as moche as we haue spoken of hurte commynge by drynkynke of wyne: witteth well that a {per}sone hauynge a feble brayne and eke of what so euer other condicion he be he oughte moste circumspectly to beware of dronkennes.
Of whom the fyrste is corruption of the lyuers co~plection.
For wyne excessiuely taken comynge to the lyuer resolueth the heate therof: wherby the lyuer loseth his naturall generation of bludde: and in stede of blud engendreth wattrishenes causynge the dropsye or hit cuttethe the lyuer or the humours therof wherby lepre or wodnes is engendred.
The .ij. is corruption of the braynes complection throughe thycke and continuall assendynge of fumes of the wyne therto disposynge the hotte brayne to wodnes and frenesye: the colde to the fallynge yuel forgetfulnes and palsey.
For we se that these dronkerdes as well in youth as in age haue the palsey in ye heed other theyr me~bres.
The .iiij. is diseases of the senowes as the crampe palsey.
For su{per}fluous drynkynge of wyne oftymes tourneth to vineger in the stomake whiche hourtethe the senowes.
Also often tymes for faute of digestion hit tourneth in to vndigested wattrishenes whiche mollifieth the senowes.
And often tymes it enduceth grosse humours to the senowes wherby they be stretched out or drawen to gether.
The .v. is the palsey through humidites of the brayne encreased by the wyne: so yt they stoppe holly the wayes of the lyfely spiritis procedynge from the brayne to the other membres.
The .vj. is sodeyne dethe for whyle the dronkerde snortethe or slepethe his wynde pipes through abunda~ce of wyne or humidites therof engendred are closed wherby he is sodaynly strangled.
And though the immoderate drynkynge of wyne causeth ye forsaid inco~uenie~ses: Yet wyne moderatly taken is holsome diuers wayes.
And Auice~ in ye afore allegate chap. reherseth .v. bonties of wyne moderatly dronke.
The fyrste is that hit easely conueyeth ye meate that hit is myngled with to al the me~bres of the body through the heate subtillite and hyd conuenient proprete therof.
The .ij. is hit digestethe fleume and resolueth hit throughe the heate and subtilite of his substance makynge hit apte to auoyde out openynge the wayes and co~fortynge nature to driue hit out.
The .iij. is hit auoydeth redde colour by vrine and by other insensible vacuations as swette and suche lyke.
And this is to be vnderstande of claret wyne or whyte that is feble of his nature or alayde with water: or elles hit wolde encreace coler by tournynge it selfe in to coler and infla~mation of the lyuer.
The .iiij. is hit makethe melancoly whiche is grosse and moueth slowely easelye to slyde by hit propre pypes from the liuer to the splene and from the splene to the brymme of the stomake: and at last with the dregges to auoyde out of the body.
And hit declineth or represseth the hurte of mela~coly through contrariousnes of complection and maner of substance in the effectis therof.
For melancoly enge~dreth heuynes feintnes of harte couetousnes: But wyne engendreth ioye boldnes stoutnes of stomake and liberalite.
The .v. is hit resoluethe all causes of werynes outcepte it be myxt with some other heate.
For wyne reuiueth the resolute spiritis agayne abundantly and comfortethe naturall vertue and taketh awaye or diminishethe humidites lefte in the musculs senowes of the harte or in the ioyntes.
And if the body dryed by werynes nedeth moystynge wyne moystethe hit quickely so it be alaide with water.
Farther more besides these wyne hath many other good propretees.
For aboue all other thy~ges wyne is a swefte and a sodaine nourisher: hit comforteth the heate and naturall spirite and heteth all the bodye hit clereth the wytte appeseth anger putteth away heuynes and stereth to bodily lust.
And wyne maketh one manlye bothe in stomake and body.
And they that drynke no wyne are nothyng in regarde of theyr equals that drynke wyne neyther in stomake nor corage.
This texte declarethe one doctrine of wyne: and that is the better wyne is the better humours it enge~dreth.
The cause is for blacke wyne is more grosse and erthie than other: therfore the spiritis therof engendred be grosse: Like as hit is proued by Gal. sayenge before.
And farther ther are put .vij. doctrines touchynge election of wyne.
For suche wyne by reason that hit is subtile engendreth subtile and clere spiritis.
The .ij. is hit ought to be olde and nat newe.
For newe wyne or must doth soner ouer come ones brayne and make one haue the laske than other of the parell: hit enge~dreth the colike and other accidentis that shall be declared after whan we come to Impedit vrinam.
Nor ye shulde nat vnderstande that wyne ought to be to olde.
For suche wyne as Auice~ saith is as a medicine and nat as drynke.
For suche wyne dothe rather alter a temperate body to heate and drought tha~ nourishe it: hit is of small norisheme~t.
For whan hit is so very olde hit receyueth agayne hit fyrste naturall verdure and sharpenes and is than all firye: wherfore the aggregatour in the chap. de vite by authorite of Galen writethe that hit is hotte and drye in the .iij. degree.
For subtile wyne maketh the spiritis of ma~ subtile and grosse wynes grosse spiritis.
The .iiij. is wyne shulde be rype and nat vert or eger orels hit wyll depriue man of all his naturall vacuations and good helthe as Galen sayth in the co~me~t of the canon .iii. part. reg. acut.
And therfore hit is hurtefull for them that wante euacuation by vrine and all other their vpper me~bres.
Yet as Gal. in the same place saythe suche wyne stypticall is holsome for diseases that chance in the guttes.
Yet as Galen saythe there the stypticalnes of the wyne wolde be put awaye by moche mynglynge of water.
The .v. is that wyne shuld be alayde with water: For therby the fumosite of the wyne is put away: and so ouerco~meth the brayne lesse.
This is treuth if the wyne be subtile but if hit be grosse hit ouercometh the brayne the sooner: for therby it is subtiled made more fumyshe.
And of this wyne Auicen vnderstode whan he saide that wyne alaide with water doth soner ouer come the brayne than pure wyne.
The .vj. is wyne shulde be sprinkelynge wha~ one tastethe hit: and this is one of the condicions of good wyne before saide.
The .vij. is taken of the drynkers condicion and nat of the wyne: that is we must drynke wyne te~perately: For wyne temperatly taken sharpeth the wytte and enge~dreth all the holsome thynges before declared.
thynges here expressed we maye conclude that wyne moste to be chosen and best in the regiment of helth is meane wyne egall betwene olde and newe clere some what redde of good odour and flauour of egall sauour that is neither eger sharpe nor swete: whiche is nat grosse nor to moche subtile: and eke that hit be nat to stronge nor to weake: and that hit growe nat on stony hylly grounde nor on simble plaine earable grounde but on highe grounde lyenge open towarde the southe in a countrey nat to hotte nor to colde.
And these thy~ges are partly gathered out of Gal. iij.j. the place afore allegate.
Touchynge the regime~t of wyne co~cernyng the ages the rules that Auicen putteth in ye aboue allegate place are to be noted.
The first is to gyue children wyne to dry~ke is as one layde fire to fire of drie wodde.
For chyldren be tender and soone enflamed throughe thabunda~ce of theyr naturall heate their senowes and brayne be weake feble.
First by quicke infla~mation by strykynge of the brayne by lyghtly percynge of the senowes and abundant fumosite.
Therfore whan one gyuethe wyne to chyldren to drynke the flamynge heate of the wyne is added to ye flamynge heate of chyldre~ bodies whiche is of small resistence as drie styckes reedes or towe is agaynst the fire.
The .ij. rule is that one gyue an olde man as moche wyne to drynke as he can beare without hurt that is as moche as his naturall and due appetite desireth.
For lyke as olde bootis and buskyns that be drye and wrynkeled are made soupull and playne with oyle lyke wyse ben the bodies of olde folkes by drinkynge of chosen wyne as wyne of Beuuois.
Auncient folkes are colde and wyne heateth their spirite is heuy and they be fulle of melancolye: but wynes maketh them mery and represseth mela~colyes: and co~monly olde folkes slepe yll but wyne makethe them to slepe well.
They be prone to opilations but wyne openeth and letteth them.
And so lyke as wyne to children is moste contrarie so for olde folkes hit is most holsome.
The .iii. is that yo~ge folkes drynke wyne temperatly temperately is touchynge measurable quantite and conuenient alayenge with water.
And al though yo~ge folkes are as hotte as chyldren yet they haue theyr me~bres more sounde the senowes and brayne more stronge wherby they may the stronglyer resiste the hurte of wyne drynkynge.
There folowe many good thinges of drynkynge wyne sobrely that is to saye the voidynge of coler the quickenynge of the corporall myght and wytte and the abundance of subtile spiritis.
Non sit acetosa ceruisia sed bene clara De validis cocta granis satis ac veterata.
This texte declareth .v. thy~ges to chose good ale by.
Fyrste that hit be nat sower for that hurteth the stomake.
sower thynge as Auicen sayth in many places hurteth the senowes for ye stomake is a me~bre full of senowes and that is touchynge the brynke.
The .ij. is that ale muste be clere: for troubled ale is a stopper and hurtethe them ouer moche that haue the stone hit fattethe and enflatethe and maketh one shorte wynded and engendreth moche fleme.
The .iij. is ale shuld be made of good corne nat corrupte that is to saye of the best barly wheate or for the better ye corne is the better is the humour therof engendred.
The .iiij. is that ale oughte to be well sodde: for it is the better digested and more amiably receiued of nature: and the inco~uenie~tis therof growyng are the better borne.
For ale nat well sodde engendreth ve~tosites in the bealy gnawynge inflasio~ and colike.
The .v. is ale oughte to be stale well purged and nat ouer newe.
For newe ale engendreth the same hurte that ale doth that is nat wel sodde: and there with mooste easilye causeth the strayne coilion.
Here is taught one lesson touchynge ye vse of ale.
That we must drinke it moderatly so that the stomake be nat hurte therby nor dro~kennes caused.
For hit is worse to be dronke of ale than of wyne and lo~ger dureth: the fumes and vapours of ale that ascende to the heed are grosse wherfore they be nat so resoluable as they that be mo~ted vp by wyne.
Where vpon it is to be noted that in the begynnynge of dyner or soupper hit is holsomer to drynke ale before wyne: the cause is for at ye begynnyng of our repast or dyner the body is hungrye: so ye stomake before we began to eate meate was hungrye and so drewe superfluites from the me~bres.
Therfore if we begynne with wyne for that nature greatly desirethe hit for the great norisheme~t therof: the su{per}fluites to gether with ye wyne drawen of the stomake are drawen to the parties of the bodye: but nature so desirously draweth nat ale.
Lyke wyse ale washeth ye humours ha~gynge about the brymme of the stomake.
And for this cause phisitions counsaile that whan one is moste hungrye he shulde fyrste assay to vomite or he eate any meate that those su{per}fluites drawe~ to gether of the hungrye stomake may be voided out leste they be myngled with the meate.
Lyke wyse he that feareth to be thyrsty by superfluous drinkynge of water shulde drinke ale: For it que~cheth vnnaturall thyrste.
Here is determined what qua~tite of meate shuld be eaten after the diuersite of the .iiij. seasons of ye yere whiche are ver or springe tyme sommer autumne and wynter.
He saythe that in the tyme of ver we must eate littell meate.
The same wylleth Auicen sheweth the reason why bicause saithe he in wynter mans body is nat greatly gyuen to labour and exercise through prohibution of resolutio~ rawe humours are encreased and specially fleumatike: whiche after the {pro}portion of the season tha~ specially be engendred: whiche humours by reason of colde are enclosed in the bodye.
But wha~ ver or spryngetyme cometh it causeth these rawe humours gethered to gether to melte and sprede throughe all the body: wherfore nature is than greatelye occupied in digestynge of them.
Therfore in ver season if one eate moche meate hit letteth nature to digeste suche fleumatike humours and shulde be diuerted an other way: for by these humours and great qua~tite of meate nature shuld be ouer pressed.
And so suche humours shulde remayne in the body vndigested: and runnynge to some membre shulde cause some disease there.
And therfore we oughte to take good hede that we eate no greatte quantite of meate in ver.
For diminishion of meate in this season is a speciall preseruation from diseases reynynge in ver as Auicen saythe .ij.j. the place before allegate.
And this sayenge is of a trouthe from the myddes to the ende of ver and nat in the begynnyng: for the begynnynge of ver is lykened to wynter: wherfore than one maye norishe the body as well as in wynter.
And this also may be vnderstande whan vere fynde the body full of humours than meate is to be gyuen after the naturall heate and resolution that is caused of the body: for than the cause is auoided: for whiche meate shuld be diminished.
And the same willeth Hipp. j. aphorismoru~ where he saithe: Bealies in wynter and vere are mooste hotte and slepe most longe.
Therfore in those seasons for the naturall heate is moche: therfore hit nedeth larger norishement.
Secondly he saythe that to eate to moche meate in somer is hurtefull: bycause than the vertue of digestion is feble: For the spiritis and naturall heate whiche are the instumentes of corporall operation are than ryght feble sparcled and resolute throughe outwarde heate vehemently drawyng them to the exterior partis: and contrary wyse moche meate can nat be digested.
And here is to be noted that for the veheme~t resolution of humidites as well substa~ciall as mutrymentall of the bodye grosser and more meate in so~mer shulde be eaten if the night digestiue coulde digeste so moche meate: but bycause nature can nat digeste moche at ones we muste eate a lyttell and ofte: as Galen saythe in the co~me~t of this Canon Et quibus semel aut bis &c.
In so~mer we must eate many tymes and lyttell: many tymes bicause the body hath nede through ofte dissolution: a lyttell for defaute of digestion.
And al though littell meate shulde be eaten in the sommer yet one maye drynke moche: for than is greatter resolution and drought of the body: and the naturall heate of the bodye excedeth the moysture therof: and man is more thyrsty than than other tymes.
But yet than one oughte to drynke lesse wyne specially if hit be pure for suche wyne soone enflameth and causeth the naturall heate hatte by the ardent heate of so~mer to burne and therfore if we drynke wyne we muste myngle hit with moche water: and we muste forbeare olde stronge wyne.
Thyrdly he sayth that in Autu~ne we ought to beware of frutes specially of ye same season as grapis peches figgis and suche like: or at leaste to eate but littell of them for suche frutis engendre bludde apte to putrifie through the boyllyng that they make in the body humours: specially if they be receyued in to an vnclene stomake or a corrupt body whiche for the most part chanceth in autumne.
And so than yll and fylthy diseases are engendred as the pockes and other pestilent sickenesses.
Yet for a farther knowlege of the regiment of meate and drynke in Autumne wytteth well that in haruest hunger and thyrste shulde be eschewed to eate moche meate at one meale: as Rasis .iij. Alm~ sayth cap. de reg. corporis secundum tp~s.
The wyne also that is dronke in haruest shulde be alayde with moche water that hit may moyst the bodye and cole the heate: but nat so superfluously alayde with water than as in so~mer: nor to be than dronke so superfluouslye: for tha~ nature febled is nat able to welde and digeste it: and to moche alayenge with water wolde distroye naturall heate encreace ve~tosites: wherby ye colike may be enge~dred.
Fourthly he saithe yt in wynter we maye eate as moche as we wyll that is to say more tha~ in other seasons after the mynde of Auicen in .iij.j. the place afore allegate.
The reason is bycause the heate of our body in wynter is strongest both by reason hit is conieled to gether and fortified by position of his contrarie that is to say the coldnes of the aier enuironynge our bodies about.
And this is verified in bygge bodies fleshie and nat in bare and feble: for on suche bodies coldenes of wynter enclined doth nat co~forte with heate but feblethe them more: For in wynter as Hippocrates saith: bealies be hottest of nature and slepe moste longe.
Hit foloweth that the grosser norishementis and harder of digestion are holsomer in wynter than in other seasons by cause the heate is stronger.
But the wyne that we muste drynke than oughte to be ruddye as a rose and nat white and alayde with a lyttell water.
Here is to be noted that all though through the stre~gth of heate and vertue of digestion in wynter the grosse and stro~ge meatis are holsomer: yet bicause the seasons than are disposed to opilations and repletions throughe verye moche fleme hit were holsome than to vse meane meates betwene heuy and lyghte grosse subtile as kydde veale mutton pikes perche and creuesses.
And they that vse grosser meates as befe porke venson gottis fleshe suche lyke shulde eate but one meale a day: orels to vse meatis laxatiue as persly cressis mustert and suche lyke and to vse great labour.
Saluia cum ruta faciunt tibi pocula Adde rose florem minuit potenter amorem.
The fyrst is sage the leaues wherof put in to the drynke fordothe the hurte of hit with it proprete and also hit comforteth the senowes and brayne: whiche comforted resiste the better the yl fumes that of the yll drynke ascende there vnto.
The .ij. is rue whose leaues holle without any brusynge shulde be put in to the drynke for with hit heate proprete it fordoth the malice of the drynke.
And howe good rue is agaynst poyson hit hath bene declared before at Allea nux tuta &c.
And this text saythe to the .ij. forsayde herbes we may put the rose flower.
And this speciallye shulde be vnderstande of a red rose: for the swete smell stipticalnes therof amendeth the malice of the drynke.
Here is put a remedye to auoide parbrakynge or spuynge for suche as are nat accustomed to passe the see.
He that wyll passe the see muste a fewe dayes before he take shyppynge myngle the see water with his wyne.
This is a remedye for the ryche: but if hit be a poore man than he muste drynke see water that he maye easelyer eschewe spuynge.
The reason herof is bicause the see water is salte: and so with his saltnes and stipticite that foloweth saltnes it closeth the mouthe of the stomake and therby fordothe spuynge.
And here is to be noted that as Auicen saythe a trauayler on the see shulde nat moche go about to withsta~de or to forbeare parbrakynge or spuynge at the begynnynge but to vomite vntyll he thynke hym selfe well purged: for that preserueth from many diseases and nat only preserueth but also healeth or alleuiateth greuous great diseases as lepre dropsye palsey coldnes and swellynge of the stomake.
But in case that the trauailer on the see spue so moche that he therby is ryght greatlye febled he than restrayne hit by eatynge frute stypticall and sower as ben vnrype frute crabbes sower pome+garnades and suche lyke: wherwith the mouthe of the stomake is comforted humours expelled downe: and also the stomake therby comforted driuethe away humours flowynge there vnto by tossinge of ye water.
Orels we may take musterte sede dryed by the fier and drynke hit with wyne or wormewode may be eaten or dronken or a toste wette in redolent wyne is good to eate.
And generallye tarte meates be good for trauaylers on the see for they comforte the stomake and prohibite vapours fumes to asce~de to the heed as herbes sodde in vineger or in the ieuse of sower grapes.
This texte teacheth vs to make a co~mon sauce if we lacke a better.
And .v. thy~ges goth to the makynge of this sauce.
Wherwith we maye make sauce for a goose roste or sodde.
For co~monly a goose rosted or a pygge is stopped with sage to drawe vp the humidites and cla~mynes of them and also bicause the fleshe shulde smell some what therof: yet after it is rosted the sage shulde be cast away and nat eaten.
Like wise of sage vplandyshe folke make a sauce to eate with a goose: for they stampe sage and garlyke to gether that the sage maye abate some what of the garlykes sauour.
The .ij. is salte with wyne: this sauce is for ryche and noble men.
For whan they wante mustert or ver ieuse they put wyne in a saucer myngle hit with a lyttell salte.
Lyke wyse of breadde tosted with ale or wyne with peper they make a blacke sauce as it were pappe that is called peper and that they caste vpon theyr meate fleshe and fysshe.
The fourth is garlyke where of the vplandishe people make a sauce: for they myngle softe chese and mylke and stampe garlyke to gether and so eate hit with their meate whether it be roste or sodde salte or fresshe and with harde egges.
The .v. is perslye: the leaues wherof sta~ped with ver ieuse or white wine is made a grene sauce to eate with roste meate.
And here is to be noted that sauce or sauces vary after the seasons.
For in hotte seasons hit muste be made of colde thynges or of stuffe of lyttell heate and in colde seasons contrarye wyse.
Therfore sommer sauce shulde be ver ieuse or eysell or vineger the ieuse of le~mons or of pome garnades with rose water and suche lyke.
And other whyle in sauces made in so~mer one may put a lyttell pellitorie persly to attempre the coldenes of the forsayde thynges.
But the mattier of co~petent sauces in wynter are musterte carloke gynger peper cynomum gelofers garlyke sage myntes pelitorie perslye: wyne water of fleshe vineger nat to stronge but verye nere to the nature of wyne: And in meane seasons they shulde be mean neither to hotte nor to colde.
Secondlye sauces differ by reason of the meates for whiche they be made: for one meate wil haue one sauce an other meate a nother sauce: as lordis cokes knowe.
Sauce for mutton veale and kydde is grene sauce made in so~mer with vineger or ver ieuse with a fewe spices without garlyke with persly white gynger ver ieuse and tosted breadde with vineger.
In wynter the same sauces be made with many spices a littell qua~tite of garlyke and of the beste wyne and with a littell ver ieuse or with mustert.
Sauce for rosted befe is made with peper tosted breadde brothe of fleshe and grapes.
And the same sauce is good in wynter to eate with porke.
Also porke in sommer maye be eaten with vineger and perslye in the begynnynge of our repast.
But in case the forsayde meates be baked specially befe porke in wynter than serue in a white oynion and a small qua~tite of swete spice beaten in pouder.
But in so~mer without oynions and with ver ieuse orels with a fewe small oynions.
But if the pastis be made of more tender fleshe and lyght of digestion serue in ther with no oynions: but in so~mer almon mylke with ver ieuse and a lyttell blanche pouder: and at the last ye may put therto an egge broke~ with ver ieuce.
But in wynter in stede of ver ieuse take wyne and more spice.
With rosted rabbattis and chekyns sauce made with cynomume cru~mes of breadde and with ver ieuse in so~mer is holsome and in winter with wyne.
For rosted porke take of the dryppynge tempered with good wyne and oynions in winter: and in sommer take the grene sauce aboue named.
For rosted fesantes pigions and turtyls take none other sauce but salte.
For boylde capons and cockes take of the same brothe with a lyttell bla~che pouder.
And precisely if they be boyled with sage Isope persly this is good sauce in wynter: and in so~mer the brothe of the capon and a lyttell vergis myngled to gether is a holsome sauce.
For fatte capons he~nes baked serue in none other sauce but a smalle quantite of blanche pouder: and at the ende the aboue named grene sauce in so~mer and in wynter good wyne.
But fishe the grosser it is the harder of digestion the more superfluous and moyster of nature the more hit nedeth hotte sauces and sharpe: and the same rule is lyke wyse true in all maner of fleshe.
Si fore vis sanus ablue sepe manus Lotio post mensam tibi confert munera bina Mundificat palmas lumina reddat acuta.
Here are declared .ij. holsome thynges that come by wasshynge of our handes after meate.
The fyrst is the palme of our handes are mundified.
The .ij. is our syght is sharped there by and that is specially by accidens for the ha~des be ye instrume~tis to clense the eies: and hit is ryght holsome for them to be mundified: wherof we haue before spoken at Lumina mane manus
This texte toucheth .ij. thinges concernynge the choyce of breadde.
Hotte bread is hurtfull to mans nature: as Auicen saith .ii. ca. de pane.
Hotte bread is nat conuenient for mans nature: and bread that cometh hotte from the ouen is vnholsome.
And agayne after he saith: Hotte bread throughe hit heate causeth thyrstynes: and swymmeth by reason of his vapourous humidite: is of quicke digestion and of slowe discence.
And all thoughe hotte breadde in the regiment of helthe be vnholsome to eate yet ye smell therof is ryght holsome hit relyuethe one in a sownde: and hit is possible that some folkes maye lyue by the smelle of newe breadde.
The .ij. is we ought nat to eate breadde very stale or mouldy: for suche breadde is vnholsome for the nourishement of mans nature: for it driethe the body and engendrethe melancoly humours: wheron hit folowethe that bread shulde nat be to newe nor to stale but a day olde.
The fyrst hit muste be well leuende as Gal .i. alimentorum ca. ii. sayth: The beste breadde for digestion is hit that is verye well leuende and baked in an ouen hatte with moderate fire.
And agayne in the same chap. he saythe: Vnleuende bread is holsome for no body.
And after the mynde of Auicen Breadde made with littel leuen nourishethe moche but the norishement therof is a stopper outcepte they eate it that labour moche.
The .ij. is that bread ought to be light for therby is knowen that the cla~mynes is goone.
Yet neuer the lesse this bread after the mynde of Auicen in the chap. and place before sayd is a swefte entrer and of lesse and worse nourisheme~t as bread is made of moche branne.
The .iij. is that bread oughte to be well baked: for breadde yll baked is of yll digestion and engendrethe grefe in the stomake.
And Auicen in the forsaide canon and chap. saith: That the bread yll baked norisheth very moche but the norishement causeth opilations outcepte they labour moche that eate it.
And bread baken on a stone or in a panne is of the same fashion: for hit is neuer well baked with in.
The .iiij. is that bread oughte to be temperately salted.
For bread ouer swete is a stopper ouer salte a dryer.
But bread moderately salted norisheth beste so it haue the other conditions.
The .v. is that it shulde be made of the beste grayne that is to say of ye beste wheate.
More ouer the texte warnethe vs to beware of crustis eatynge: for they engendre adust coler or melancolye humours by reason they be burned and drie.
And therfore great estates whiche of nature be colerike cause the crustis aboue and benethe to be chypped awaye.
Wherfore the pithe or the cru~me shulde be chosen whiche is of more and swyfter norysheme~t than the cruste.
Yet nat withstandynge crustis are holsome for them that be holle and haue theyr stomake moyst and desire to be leane but they muste eate them after they haue dyned.
For they enforce the meate to discende and co~forte the mouthe of the stomake.
Farther in the .ij. and laste verses is mencioned that good bread ought to haue these .v. co~ditions that is ye hit be salted leuende well baked made of good corne that is that ye corne be pure reapt gethered shefte and housed in due season.
And these conditions Auicen reme~breth in the forsayde place sayenge: Hit behoueth that bread be pure salted leuende well baked and a day olde.
And here is to be noted that if one desire to norishe his bodye he muste haue his breadde made of pure flower the branne clene taken out: if one wyll be leaner leaue some branne therin.
For branne norishethe but lyttell and vnlosethe the bealye and flower dothe contrarye wise.
If porke be eate~ without wyne it is lesse holsome than mutton but porke eaten with wyne nourishethe beste and it is medicinable: for hit moysteth moche.
And is to be vnderstande specially of rosted pygges and braune well dyghte.
And here is to be noted that porke salted or dryed in the smoke suche as men of the cou~trey vse called bakon are in no maner wyse so holsome as mutton whether hit be eaten with wyne or no: but hit is vnderstande by rosted porke or pigge or braune as is before sayde.
This texte saythe that hogge tripes be better than of other beastis.
The reason is by cause we eate fewe entrayles outcepte they be full of blud and of verye fatte beastis as hogges be.
Nowe only hoggis bludde through the complexion and similitude of complexion with mans nature is bludde of whiche the bowels be fylled.
And lyke wyse hoggis be soner fatte than any other bestis.
Therfore we eate rather the tripes chitterly~ges of an hogge than of other bestis.
This texte openeth .v. inco~uenie~ces that growe by drynkynge of newe wyne or muste.
The firste is that muste letteth the vrine: and this may be vnderstande .ij. wayes.
Fyrste for grosse muste throughe his grosnes myxed with the dregges stoppethe the lyuer and the raynes so that the vrine can nat easely haue hit course.
Secondly hit lettethe the vrine of hit due course as some reinnyshe muste doth and certeyne other subtile wynes lyke wyse: For there is some reynnyshe must that whose lyes are mordica~t or bytynge: while hit runneth in to the bladder the erthye lyes byte and pricke the bladder: and co~strayne one to pisse contrarie to the due order and maner that he was wonte to do.
The .ij. is hit losethe the bealye by reason that hit scoureth the entrayles through the sharpnes of hit lyes hit pricketh the guttis to voide out the ordeurs: fyrste through mordicatenes of the lyes.
Thyrdlye by reason hit maketh ye guttis slyppry by way of vndigestiblenes and grefe of the stomake wherfore the stomake leuseth and openethe the wayes that were shutte.
The .iij. is that muste hurtethe the good co~plection of the lyuer: For hit stoppeth the lyuer through moche mynglynge of hit lyes: and causeth disease in the lyuer called dissenteria through swellynge wherby ye lyuer is febled.
And thus it enge~drethe an yll colour and yll diseases of the lyuer that is to say spices of ye dropsy.
The .iiij. is that muste hurtethe the splene and disposition therof throughe the same cause that hit dothe the lyuer: for hit stoppeth the splene: and so causethe it to be harde.
The .v. is that must enge~dreth the stone: and specially that is in the reines: whiche is ruddy and lyghtly frangyble by reason of opilation that hit causeth by hit grosse substance.
And this is certeyne if the muste be of very swete wynes whose lyes be nothynge bytynge or sharpe.
For muste that hath sharpe bytynge lyes preserueth a man from the stone: for hit makethe one to pysse often: as some reinyshe must that causethe sande or grauel to be sene in the vrine: ofte prouokynge one to make water: whiche ofte makynge of water wassheth away the small grauell that cleueth to a mans raynes and so auoydeth hit.
Here are declared .ij. hurtes that come by drynkynge of water.
The fyrste is that drynkynge of water hurteth ones stomake that eateth: by reason that water cooleth and leusethe the stomake: and specially hit distroyeth the appetite.
The .ij. is that drynkynge of water with meate lettethe digestio~ for it maketh ye meate receiued rawyshe.
After the mynde of Auicen sayenge: Nor after meate moche water shulde nat be dronken: For hit deuideth the stomake and the meate and causeth hit to swymme in the stomake.
And he saith: And whan nature dothe digeste meate and that sufficient qua~tite of water be myngled therwith than after that if we drynke more water hit letteth very moche the digestion that was begonne.
And agayne Auicen saythe: that drynkynge of water shulde be eschewed outcepte hit be to helpe the meate downe whan hit stycketh or discendeth slowelye.
But with meate water shulde neuer be take~ or vsed.
Auerrois in his co~ment sheweth the reason whan we receyue water vpon meate hit maketh the stomake colde or it be through hotte: and maketh the meate rawyshe: and eke causeth the meate to swym in the stomake: and hit is the cause: that the meate stycketh nat fast there as it shulde digest as hit co~ueniently shulde.
The operation of the stomake is to make a good myxion of thynges receyued there in and to digest them well.
That done there foloweth an ordinarie and a naturall seperation of pure vnpure thynges.
And as a greatte quantite of water put in a potte slakethe the sythynge of the meate therin: so lyke wyse hit chanceth in the stomake by drynkynge of moche water: But to drynke a lyttell quantite of colde water with our meate before it descende downe in to the stomake is nat forbydden but allowable specially if we be very thyrsty: for a littel qua~tite of colde wat take~ after ye forsayde maner easethe the stomake and quenchethe thyrste.
The coldnes of the water enforcethe the heate of man to desce~de to the very bottum of the stomake and so fortifieth the digestion therof.
But witteth well that though water be more co~uenient to quenche thyrste than wyne: yet wyne for a mans helthe is more holsome than water.
And though water vniuersally quenche thyrste better than wyne bycause hit is colde and moyst yet to make naturall and good co~mixion of meates and to co~ueie them to the extreme partis of mans body wyne is better tha~ water.
For wyne through his subtile substa~ce and operation myngleth it selfe better with the meate than water doth: and nature delyteth more in wyne than in water: therfore the me~bres drawe wyne more sooner vnto them mynglynge hit with the meate.
This mixynge in this maner is as a boylynge or sethyng of thynges to gether: whiche is greatly holpe by the heate of the wyne: but warer with hit coldnes letteth hit.
So than it appereth that wyne in mynglynge with meate and delatynge of the same is better than water.
For wyne by reason of hit subtilite of substance and vertuous heate is a marueylous percer.
And so by consequens wine delateth or spreadeth more tha~ water wherin is no vertuous heate nor substance of ayre nor fire: the water letteth ye passage therof.
Farther water is nat so holsome drynke as wyne: for water hyndrethe the norishement of the bodye: by reason hit nouryshethe verye lyttell or nothynge at all: So that the more wattrysshe that meate is the lesse hit norisheth.
Therfore hit is very holsome to drynke wyne with our meate: for hit doth nat hynder norishement but greatlye fordreth hit: for wyne is a speciall norisheme~t and restoratiue and norisheth sweftely as hit is afore sayd.
Farther ye shall vnderstande that to dry~ke water with meate is nat only hurtfull but also in many other cases whiche are declared of Auicen.
Fyrste hit is vnholsome for a ma~ to dry~ke fastyng: for hit perceth in to the bodye by all the principall membres therof: mortifienge hit naturall heate.
This is of trouthe if one that is truely fastynge drinke hit.
Yet for a dronken man it is some tyme holsome: nor it hurteth hym nat though he dry~ke hit fastynge: For a dronkerde fastynge is nat vtterlye fastynge his stomake is nat vacande but some what remayneth of the other dayes ingurgynge.
But in whose nitrosite water dronke in ye mornynge doth mitigate: and the stomake there with washed the vapours fumes repressed is disposed to receyue newe sustinance.
The .ij. hurt is to drynke water after great labour trauaile: and lyke wyse after the fleshely acte betwene ma~ and woman: For than the poris of the bodye be verye open: wherby the water entrethe in to the bottum of the membres mortifienge the natural heate.
The .iij. inco~uenience is after baynyng specially if one bayne hym fastynge: for than the cundites and wayes of the bodye be verye open: wherfore the water entrynge in hurteth as is afore sayde.
Of this drynkynge of water Auicen sayth: That of water dronke tastynge after baynynge and after carnall copulation corruptynge of co~plection dropsy is to be feared.
Fourthly it is hurtfull to drynke colde water to que~che feyned thyrst in the nyght as hit chanceth to surfetters and dro~kerdes: For by drinkynge of colde water the resolution and digestion of salte humours are prohibited whether it be of wyne or other sharpe thynges causynge thyrste: so sone after drynke thyrste commeth agayne as stronglye as before.
But in case the thyrste be so vehement vexynge vnquietynge ouer moche that neither coldenes of brethynge nor washynge of the mouthe with colde water can suffice than let the thyrstie dry~ke colde water out of a narowe mouthed vesselle or cuppe or syppynge that the water more slowlye maye come vnto the brymme of the stomake: for so hit shall beste quenche thyrste and lesse therof shalbe dronke and than it shall nat vtterly distroy digestion.
Fyftelye generallye hit is yll for holle folkes to drynke moche colde water for hit quencheth naturall heate greueth the breast marreth the appetite of the stomake and is verye hurtfull to all the senowye me~bres.
Yet neuer the lesse water temperatly colde some tyme per accidence stereth one to haue an appetite and maketh the stomake page duplicate] page duplicate] stronge helpynge hit openynge and clensynge the wayes therof.
And this Auicen affirmeth sayenge that meate that conserueth helth must be suche as the fleshe is.
For they are of lyke nature very apte to be conuerted in to bludde: and specially kydde yonge suckynge calues and yerelynge lammes.
And this veale Galen .iii. alimentorum preysethe highlye sayenge that veale of .vj. or .viij. wekes olde rosted is more holsome than mutton hit is soone digested and norisheth very moche.
Sunt bona gallina capo turtur sturna columba Quiscula vel merula phasianus ethigoneta.
This texte sheweth what wylde foule are moste holsome to eate to nouryshe mans nature.
The fyrste is an henne: the whiche is verye holsome to eate.
For Haly Auenzoart and Mesue say that the beste fleshe of pultry is an henne that neuer layed of a cocke yt neuer trad henne.
For they without superfluite are soone turned in to bludde: theyr proprete is to tempre mans complexion: and theyr broth is the beste medicine that can be for lepers.
And Galen sayth that fleshe of yonge pullettes augme~teth intellection hit clereth the voyce and encreaceth the sede of generation.
The .ij. is a capon whose fleshe consiliator in his .lxviij. question nombreth amonge the mooste holsome fleshes.
And these fleshes and lyke wyse the other afore sayde the stomake of hit proprete doth digest.
The .iij. is a turtyll whiche also nourisheth well and engendreth good blud.
The fleshe wherof Auicen highlye preysethe sayenge: There is no foules fleshe better tha~ a turtyls or a hennes nor subtiler.
But yet they are nat so nouryshynge as the pertriche.
The .iiij. after the opinio~ of some is a stare.
Some other call this foule Starna: whiche Rasis .iij. Alm~ preisethe aboue al other foules sayenge: sterlyngis fleshe is lyghtest of all other foules holsome for them that wyll kepe a sklender diete: and by this maye be vnderstande a greatter foule as a grey goose the fleshe wherof is ryght co~mendable specially yonge.
And on this wise Almans. vnderstandeth preferrynge this fleshe before other.
Orels by a stare may be vndersta~de certeine small {per}triches: wherof Moyses semeth to vnderstande sayenge to the Iewes: Lyke wyse stares are vnholsome for our kynge for they co~streyne and indurate the bealye.
For theyr fleshe bynde the bealy as witnessethe Rasis .iij. Alm~.
Whiche as Rasis sayth is excedynge hotte: the whiche enge~dreth blud ferue~tly hotte and lyghtly enge~dreth the ague.
And therfore pigions be better baked with sower grapis than rosted.
For by the sower grapes the heate engendred in the bludde is alayde.
And the best to eate be yonge pigions redye to flie for suche be of lyght digestion and of better humour.
For yo~ge pigions nat able to flee are superfluously hotte moyst: wherby they enge~dre grosse humours as Auicen sayth the .ij. canon chap. of pigions.
But olde pigions and theyr fleshe for theyr ouer great heate drought and difficulte of digestion are to be eschewed.
Some doctours saye that a quayle is of light substance and engendreth good bludde: and is very holsome for holle folkes.
But after the mynde of Isaac quayles are worse than any other wylde foule: nor they for nourishement nor digestion oughte to be preysed.
For throughe eatynge of their fleshe the crampe is to be feared.
And he saythe the reason is in the substance of theyr fleshe that they engendre the crampe.
And for this reason frenche me~ bake eate quayles with softe buttry chese.
Yet by the quayle maye be vndersta~de an other byrde a lyttell more than the forsayd {per}triche of the same colour with redde feete and bylle of a delicious sauour.
And on this wise Rasis .iij. Alm~ taketh a quayle wha~ he preferreth ye fleshe therof aboue the fleshe of a stare and all other foules.
The .vij. is an osell: whiche lyke wyse shulde be eaten yonge.
The .viij. is a phesande: whiche of all phisitians is no~bred for one of the best fleshes.
For the fleshe of that foule is mooste holsome for mans nature: and it is meate for princis great estates.
Consiliator sayth that the wylde fesante is beste both for helth and strength.
And also perauenture vniuersally seinge yt they are nere like vnto he~nes and welnere of the same shappe.
And they be drier of ayer and of fedynge and larger of exercise.
The .ix. is a wodcocke the fleshe of this byrde is specially holsome.
The .x. is a pertriche: whose fleshe as Auicen sayth is subtile a great fatter hit scoureth away the dropsye comforteth the stomake and augmenteth carnal lust.
And hit is sayde that customable eatynge of this fleshe comforteth the memorie.
The .xj. is a ruddocke called robyn red brest she eatethe grapis and fleethe sweftly as a stare doth but hit nourishethe better than a stare doth: and they hau~te moche aboute the vines they be dronke by eatynge of grapes and they be best in season to eate about al Halomas.
The .xij. is orex whiche as some say is a fesant henne and as some saye a more henne: whether hit be a phesant henne or a more henne the fleshe is of good norisheme~t.
The .xiij. is a byrde called tremulus: whiche byrde co~monly abydeth nere the see coste lesse in quantite than a henne in colour russet hit criethe loude and fleethe sweftelye and whan his plumeth vpon the erthe the tayle waggeth styll and therfore hit is called tremulus and vpon the heed therof groweth lo~ge fethers.
Hit is nat that byrde ye phesitions call a wagge tayle.
The .xiiij. last is amarellus: whiche also is a water foule lyke vnto a ducke but hit is lesse.
And to speake generally amo~ge foules to eate they be best preysed that be swyfter in flight.
And as the fleshe of the forsaide foules are of a co~me~dable norisheme~t and of easye digestion: so lyke wyse the fleshe of some foules is of a disco~mendable nourishement harde to digest and of vnegall co~plection as the fleshe of geese pecockes and malardes and vniuersally of al foules that haue longe neckes lo~ge bylles and lyue vpo~ water.
And the fleshe of sparowes whiche are excedinge hotte vnte~perate sterynge to bodily lust.
But touchynge election of foules fleshe ye shall vnderstande that theyr naturall norishynge must be co~sidered that is whether they be restoratiue lyght of digestion lyght of substance or of subtile operation: and so after theyr diuers propretes to preyse them.
Wherfore Galen beholdynge the easye alteration subtilte of pertriches fleshe preferreth them.
But Rasis with Isaac co~siderynge the subtilte and lightnes of the stare preysethe that beste.
Isaac also after the diuers inte~tions of wylde foules fleshe preyseth diuers.
Auicen commendethe turtyls fleshe aboue other: either hauynge respecte to the proprete wherby it strengtheth and comforteth ma~s vnderstandynge: orels yt in the countre of Araby where Auicen was borne turtyls are better than in other countreys.
Farther wittethe well that fleshe of foules is more holsome than of .iiij. legged beastis for them that forsake labour gyue them to studie and co~templation for hit is sooner digested: as Galen .iij. alimentoru~ saith: yet this fleshe of foules is soner digested than of beastis specially of {per}triches whiche engendreth cleane and pure bludde: disposed to augme~t to sharpe the operations of the brayne that is ma~s vnderstandynge cogitation and memorie.
Si pisces molles sunt magno corpore tolle Si pisces duri parui sunt plus valituri.
For either fysshe is harde or softe: if hit be softe the elder the better.
The reason is for softenes comethe of humidite: whiche in yonge fyshe is vndigested and in olde is more digested: and so whan suche fyshes be yo~ge they engendre fleme but whan they be olde they do nothyng so moche.
And so appereth that an olde yele is holsomer tha~ a yonge as some say.
But if suche fishe be harde than it is holsomer yonge that is soner digested as pikes perches be.
This is the opinion of Auicen .ii. ca. de piscibus sayenge: Of harde fyshes take the smallest: and of softe fyshes chose the greattest.
Here are rehersed .x. sortis of fishes very holsome for mans body.
The firste is a pike called the tyranne of fishes: For he nat only deuoureth fishes of other kynde but also of his owne.
On whom these verses were made: Lucius est piscis rex tyrannus aquarum.
The fishe of a pike is harde and swyfte in swymmy~ge.
The .ij. is a perche diriuied of this verbe parco parcis to forbeare or spare by a clene co~trary sence for a perche spareth no fyshe but wondethe other fyshes with his fynnes on his backe: nor a pike dare nat venture vpon a perche: but as Albertus sayth in his boke of beastis nature there is a natural amite betwene the perche the pike.
For the pike hurt of an other fishe is healed with great difficulte.
But whan he is hurte he gothe vnto the perche whiche seynge hym hurte touchethe and sokethe the wounde and so the pike is healed.
The .iij. is a see fyshe called a sole whiche is a speciall good fyshe.
The .v. is a tenche Whiche is a freshe water fyshe whose skynne is slyppery slymely some what blacke: the meate therof is harde.
Whan so euer we wyll dresse a pike a perche or a tenche we muste take the skyn away.
This fyshe is as greatte in quantite as halfe a mans myddel fynger the whiche is eaten with the heed and fynnes.
The .viij. is a carpe a freshe water fyshe whiche is moche slyme: but greatte estates haue them soddde in wyne so the slymynes is done away.
The .ix. is a rochette a see fishe and is a fishe of harde meate holsome.
Some other textis haue gouio yt is a goien whiche is very holsome fyshe.
The .x. is a troute whiche in eatyng is like samo~ and yet it is no samon it is longe and nat grosse: it is taken in great ryuers and wyll suffre it selfe to be rubbed and clawed beynge in the water so it is taken therof pastis be made with spicis and hit is a ryghte deynte fyshe.
Touchynge the choyce of fyshe ye shall fyrste vnderstande that fyshe compared with fleshe is lesse nourishynge lyghter of digestion and the nourishement therof is full of fleumatike superfluites colde moyst: and they be hardely digested and abyde longe in the stomake.
And by reason the stomake laboreth in digestynge of them and other whyle they be corrupted in the stomake they receyue a certeyne putrified qualite and engendre thyrstynes.
And surely the norisheme~t of laudable fleshe is better than of fyshe.
Secondly witteth well ye see fyshe is better in regiment of helthe than other of the same sorte take~ in freshe water.
For their norysheme~t is nat so superfluous and is more nere to the nature of fleshe.
But bycause see fyshe are harder than other of the sorte taken in freshe water: therfore they be of more difficulte in digestion of more and pure nourishement.
Yet nat withstandynge freshe water fyshe is holsomer for sycke folkes by reason of theyr feble digestion.
Thyrdelye note that fyshe as well of salte water as freshe shulde be chosen the whiche dressed are white nat cla~my but brittyll nat verye grosse but subtile nat of harde sauour but soute that doth nat soone putrifie of good colour nat bredde in lakes or pondis nor in fylthy placis nor in water wherin groweth yll wedes.
And they oughte nat to be to olde nor to yo~ge that be swyfte of mouynge of smal cla~myshenes.
And if it be see fyshe we must chose suche as is taken in ryuers a good waye from the see and hauynge the other forsayde conditions: And the more skaly that fishe is the better hit is: and hit is lyke wyse vnderstande by the fynnes.
For many fynnes and skales betoke~ the purenes of the fyshes substance.
Also amonge see fyshe ye beste be they that brede in the dippest water that ebbeth and floweth.
And therfore the fyshe that is taken in the northe see that is more surgynge and more tempestious more swyfte in ebbynge and flowynge are better than the fyshe taken in the deed or the southe see.
And ye shall lyke wyse vnderstande of freshe water fyshe: For fyshe bred in depe water is better tha~ other of the sorte bred in shalowe vnnotable waters.
And here by may be sufficie~tly knowen whiche fyshe shulde be chosen and whiche nat.
For beastiall fyshe as the see swyne dogge fyshe and dolphin are vnholsome in the regiment of helth.
For they be harde of digestion and of su{per}fluous humours.
Nor in the meate of the forsayde fysshes the aboue nombred conditions appere nat as whitenes subtilite and suche other.
And if those fyshes suche lyke cha~ce to be eaten they shulde nat be sodde as soone as they be taken but shulde be kepte a fewe dayes after: tyll tyme the meate of them mollifie and waxe tender without corruptynge of theyr substance.
And also the forsayde fyshes be better a lytell corned with salte than freshe or vtterly salte.
And amonge all see fyshe the forsayde conditions considered the rochet and gurnat seme to be most holsome.
For theyr meate and substance is mooste pure and than nexte a playce and a sole.
But the meate of those is more cla~my lesse frangible lesse whyte more grosse lesse subtile: nor the sauour or smel of them is nat so delicious and per chance the whitynge is more co~mendable tha~ the rochet.
For hit is nat so grosse and cla~my as a playce and a sole and hit substance is frangible inoughe but the releshe smel colour purenes of substa~ce and mobilite co~sidered hit is nat so good as the rochet and gurnade: And lyke wyse ye shall vndersta~de of herrynge.
And the fyshe called morua beynge yonge inoughe draweth nere the forsayde fyshes in goodnes so that hit haue the aboue sayde co~ditions: yet hit is grosser and more cla~my than the forsayde fyshes.
But salmon turbut and mackerell be nat so good: for they be moche grosser more cla~my harder of digestion and fuller of superfluite.
Therfore they be onely holsome for laborers and yonge folkes of stronge complection: theyr cla~mynes grossenes and coldnes maye be taken away with certaine sauces.
Amonge freshe water fyshe the forsayde conditions co~sidered the perche and pike are the best so they be fatte: and nexte are the vendosies and than lopsters.
And though the perche be more skaly than these afore sayde yet the meate therof is so whyte fra~gible and subtile as the pike and carpe: and hit is ofte founde in pondes.
And vniuersally the best freshe water fyshe of the same sorte is hit that is taken in water stonye in the bottum runnynge northe warde depe and labourynge moche where into ronneth no vrdeurs of cites: and wherin no wedes growe.
Creueces both of the see and ryuers are moche nutratiue and corrupte nat lyghtly in the stomake: but they be harde of digestion.
Farther more note that freshe fyshe moyste the body and encreace mylke and sede of generation: is verye holsome for colerike folkes.
And after great trauaile or bigge labour we shulde nat eate fishe for than hit soone corrupteth in the stomake.
And they that haue a weake stomake or full of yll humours ought to beware of eatynge fyshe.
More ouer grosse fyshe corned with a lytell salte is better than freshe fyshe.
Also fyshe fleshe to gether shulde nat be eaten: nor fyshe and white meates: nor fyshe shulde nat be eaten after other meates.
Also fyshe a lyttell salted and in smalle quantite taken is holsome: hit stereth vp the appetite and fortifieth hit if one haue an appetite therto.
The auctor sayth here that the yele is an vnholsome fyshe and specially hurtethe the voyce.
And this he proueth by the sayenge of phisitians and studentis of naturall philosophe.
The reason is an yele is a slymye fyshe cla~my and speciallye a stopper: and wantethe moche of the co~ditions of good fyshe before spoken.
And this that is sayde by an yele may be vnderstande of lampreys: all though lampreys be a lyttell holsomer tha~ yeles and lesse ieoperdus seynge they be nat so cla~mye and grosse as yeles.
And thoughe these fyshes be delicious in taste yet they be verye perillous: for theyr generation in the water is lyke generation of serpe~tes on the erthe.
Wherfore it is to be douted lest they be venomous: and therfore ye heedes and tayles in whiche the venome is wonte to be lyke wyse the strynge within shulde in no wyse be eaten.
Also hit is good to plunge them alyue in good wyne to take away theyr cla~mynes and let them lye styll therin tyll they be deed and than let them be dyght with galentyne made of the beste spicis as great estates cokes are wonte to do.
Yet hit is good to parboyle them twyse before in wyne and water: and that brothe done awaye to sythe them through and to make galantyne for them or elles to bake them or frye them in grene sauce with stronge spicis a lyttell good wyne in wynter: in sommer to dresse them with a lytell wyne vergis vineger: but he that can foreare these .ij. fyshes dothe beste.
Farther the texte saythe that chese and yeles hurte moche if they be eaten: and this is to be vnderstande if ye eate great quantite therof.
The cause of chese is before shewed at Persica poma &c.
Hit folowtth in the texte that if those thynges be taken with ofte drinkynge of wyne their hurtfulnes is amended: this shulde nat be vndersta~de of subtile and percyng wyne: nor of wyne that is gyuen in way of drinke co~ductiue: for suche wine shulde nat be gyuen vpon meate that enge~drethe yll humours whan hit is eaten: nor before nor after hit is digested: as Auicen saithe: For suche wyne enduceth great hurte: for hit causeth yl humours enge~dred of that drynke to entre in to the extreme partis of the body: whiche perauenture were nat able to entre without helpe leady~ge of the wyne.
But this is to be vnderstande of stro~ge wyne nat greatly percynge ofte and in smal qua~tite gyuen to thente~t to myxe ye meate to gether: For suche wyne doth alay the malice of ye meate co~forteth digestion and directeth the fleumatike colde humours: wherfore hit helpeth the digestio~ of chese and yeles that are of yll digestion.
The firste is that one at dyner and soupper shulde eate well and drinke ofte and a littell at ones.
And nat to do as a brute beast doth that eateth his fyl of meate and drinketh after warde: For the better ye drinke is myngled with the meate the sooner the meate is mollified and the more capace of digestion.
And here is to be noted that there is .iij. maner of drynkynges.
The fyrste is that mynglethe the meate to gether: the .ij. that delateth hit: the .iij. that quencheth thyrst.
The fyrst that we spake of is to be vnderstande of drynke myngled with our meate thoughe we be nat thyrstye.
Thus we oughte to drynke euen as we haue eaten a lyttell.
For outcepte a better reason say we may nat abyde tyll the meales ende nor tyll we be a thyrste.
And this maner drynkyng is specially good for them that fede on meate actuallye drye: as apperethe by sicke folkes that eate drye breadde.
But drynkynge to quenche thyrste for suche as be in good tempre shulde be forborne tyll the meales ende: for than comethe the true thyrste throughe the heate of the meate hotte and drye.
Hit is nat verye reasonable that thyrste and hunger shulde assayle vs bothe to gether: for they are of co~trary appetite.
and this drynke shulde be gyuen after as the thyrst is more or lesse.
Drinkynge delatiue is moste conuenient after the fyrst digestion regularlye and a lyttell before we take other meate.
And this maner of drynkynge is holsome whan the meates before taken were grosse in substance: nor thus to drynke we maye nat tarye tyll we be thyrsty.
For this drinkynge prepareth ye stomake to receiue other meate: and causeth the meate digested to descende from the stomake to the lyuer: nor this drinkynge shulde nat be in great qua~tite: to thende hit may sone be digested.
For before hit be digested hit goth nat to the lyuer.
And this is of trouthe outcepte suche drynke delatiue were water in whiche one muste nat tary tyll digestion before hit come to the lyuer.
But regularly conuenient drynke delatiue or {per}mixtiue oughte nat to be water but wyne orels ale bere syder {per}tey or suche lyke than all whiche wyne is better.
Secondly wittethe well that the grosser dryer and colder that meate is the bygger the drynke parmyxtiue and delatiue shulde be.
And contrarye wyse the hotter subtiler and moyster that meate is the weake the dry~ke {per}mixtiue delatiue shuld be.
And the more subtile hotte and digestible the meate is the weaker the drynke or wyne ought to be.
Wherfore stro~ger wyne shulde be dronke with befe than with chekyns we shulde drynke stro~ger wyne with fyshe than with flesshe.
The .ij. doctrine is that if we will eate an egge hit must be rere rostedde and newe: the cause therof is before shewed.
That is yt they some way are preised some way dispreysed.
They be lauded whan they be eaten the huskes taken away and disco~mended whan they be eaten with the huskes: for than they enstate.
And therfore it is nat artificial to eate them in the huskes for the nature of that within the huskes disagree.
The one labourethe to be losed and to go out: the other withsta~deth byndeth as Isaac saythe in dictis vniuersalibus
Wherfore a hurlynge mouynge is caused in the bodye inducynge gnawynge and inflasion in the bealye.
And peasen do nat this all onely but also all pulce as beanes chiches chestons and suche lyke.
And speciallye suche as haue moche huske as beanes and blacke ryce.
Also the huske of them all norysheth worse than the pithe within.
And here is to be noted that there is a maner of whyte rounde peasen: wherof the codde is very small thynne: one may eate these peasen with the huske more surelye than other all thoughe hit were better to hulle them.
And albe it that the reason afore sayd is true touchy~ge al pulce yet ye shall vndersta~de that the hulles of grene pulce is lesse and lesse diuersite is betwene the huskes the pithe within and more easye to digeste: And therfore some saye they be more holsome for folkes in helthe: but hit is nat so: For grene pulce is of ryght great superfluite and corruptible substance wherfore they be lesse holsomer for holle folkes.
And note this for a treuthe that drye pulce the vtter huske taken away are more holsome than grene: but grene are better than drie vnhulled.
Farther ye shall vnderstance that the substance of all pulce is inflatiue and harde of digestion: and their yll nourisheme~t is vnholsome in the regiment of helthe: but the broth of them is holsome: For the brothe of them maketh the bealy laxatiue and maketh one pisse and vnstoppeth the veynes.
Wherfore hit is holsome at suche tymes as folkes vse grosse and opilatiue meatis as on fastynge dayes.
For in this brothe or pottage conueniently made are nat the hurtes that be in the substa~ce: therin is no inflasion nor difficulte of nourishement and digestion nor the malice of norisheme~t.
The ryce or peasen muste be layde in sythynge water: and therin a good whyle to be all to robbed with ones handes: and after in the forsayde water shulde be tempered all the nyght: and therin the nexte nyghte folowynge to be boyled twyse or thryse and than dyghte and so reserued: And whan the houre of dyner drawethe nere to dresse it with cynomum and saffron and a lyttell curtsy wyne put therto: and than boyle hit ones and so eate hit at begynnyng of our refectio~.
And the brothe or pottage of ryce and of rounde white peason is better and more holsome fre~dly to mans nature: and lyke wyse theyr substance.
Here the auctor teachethe vs certeyne lessons to chose mylke.
The fyrste is that goottis mylke is holsome for them that be in a consumption or be leane or that haue a consumyng ague.
And Auicen sayth that goottis mylke and assis mylke are good for them that be in a co~sumption.
The reason is for that gootis mylke is temperate and of moche nourisheme~t.
For that is subtile and of moche aquosite humidite: wherby hit may moyst them.
Yet for trouthe this mylke throughe hit ouer moche humidite nourishethe lyttell: wherfore hit is nat so holsome for them as goottis mylke: yet this camels mylke newlye after folynge is holsome for them that haue the dropsye and for them that haue disease in the lyuer: for it reuiueth the liuer as Auicen saythe.
Secondly he saythe that assis mylke is holsomer than other for drie folkes in a consumption.
This is of trouthe comparynge assis mylke with mylke of other brute beastis: for hit enclinethe to coldnes and humidite and is subtile and soner entreth: and more slowelye conieyleth than the mylke of any other brute beast as Galen sayth.
The same saith Auicen and that after woma~s mylke there is none to assis mylke.
And he sayth if any helpe the feuer ethicke hit is assis mylke.
Yet to compare assis mylke with womans mylke hit is nat so holsome.
For womans mylke taken by suckynge is mooste holsome as Auicen sayth.
The reason is: for womans mylke is colde moyste more lyke to mans nature swiftlier entred quickelier digested more norishyng.
And this mylke to be gyuen to them that be in a co~sumptio~ shulde be mylked as nere the pacie~tis beddis syde as is possible forth with to ministre hit vnto hym lest the ayer corrupte hit.
And here is to be noted that in some cases sower or butter mylke is better for folkes in a consumption than womans mylke or assis.
Fyrste is whan by this feuer ethike they be caste in a laske.
The .ij. is whan they suspecte coagulation of the mylke in ye stomake either by vehement heate of the feuer: orels by cause the stomake of hit selfe is colerike the mylke shulde turne to coler.
The .iij. is whan the ethike is coupled with a putrified feuer: speciallye whan there be nat many opilations in the interiour partis.
For sower mylke restreineth the bealy and turneth nat lyghtly in to coler: for the buttrines of it is gone: wherby the mylke lightly enfla~meth: nor in a putrified feuer it is nat sone putrified.
The .iiij. is if the stomake be foule for tha~ the mylke corrupteth lyghtly therin.
The .v. case is whan he that hath the ethike disease abhorrethe doulce cleane mylke but nat the sower or butter mylke.
The .iij. lesso~ is that cowe milke and shyppe mylke are more nutratiue for they be fatter and grosser than other for so sayth Auicen: And that all beastis mylke that in bryngynge forth yonge continueth longer than a woman is vnholsome: but the mylke of those that beare egallye with woman is mooste holsome as cowe mylke.
But Rasis sayth: that cowe mylke is the moste grosest mylke that any beast gyuethe: and therfore hit is holsomer than other for them that desyre to be fatte.
The .iiij. lesson is that mylke hurteth them that haue ye ague or the heed ache The cause why is before shewed at Persica poma &c. Lenit et humectat. soluit sine febre butirum.
The fyrste is butter mollifieth the bealy and maketh it slyppery throughe it oylyues.
The .ij. is that butter is moyste for hit is made of the beast partis of the mylke wherfore hit muste nedes be moyste seynge that the mylke is moyst wherof it is made.
The .iij. is that hit leuseth the bealye and that is by the slypperynes that hit causeth in the guttis.
And these .iij. propretes butter induceth in a body nat sycke of a feuer: for it hurteth them that haue an ague for butter with hit vnctuosite augmentethe the heate of the feuer.
Here is to be noted that though butter cause the forsaide propretes: Yet by reason of it ouer moche humidite and vnctuosite it is vnholsome in waye of meate: speciallye to eate moche therof.
For if one vse to eate moche therof hit engendreth lothsomnes and maketh the meate to swy~me aboute the brymme of the stomake: and laxeth the bealy out of measure causeth vomite.
Therfore butter shulde in no wyse be eaten as meate in greatte quantite and speciallye hit shulde nat be eaten after other meate: but to vse hit with other meate hit is very holsome.
The .iij. hit is persynge whiche proprete procedeth of the fyrste.
Auicen resitynge these propretes saythe: that whey is subtiliatiue wasshyng leusynge: and therin is no mordication.
Rasis saythe that whey dothe expelle ruddye coler skabbes and pushes: and also pympuls in the face: and also it is holsome for them that haue the ianders: and for them that be distempered by to moche drynkynge of wyne.
The fyrste is that chese is of a colde nature.
And this is to be vnderstande of grene chese whiche is colde and moyst: and nat of olde chese whiche is hotte and drie as Auicen sayth: Orels hit may be vnderstande by chese that cruddeth onely of the mylke without mynglyng of any other thyng.
For there is some chese of hotte nature that heatethe the stomake byteth the tonge by mynglynge of other thynges there with: as some chese grene in colour: of whiche if one eate moche in quantite dothe heate and enflame the bodye.
The .ij. proprete is that chese maketh one costife: this is of trouthe specially if hit be harde and made with moche renles.
The .iij. is that chese enge~dreth grosse humours: this is trouthe of all chese: for all chese is made of the grosser and more erthye parte of the mylke.
The .iiij. {pro}prete is yt mylke byndeth the wombe and this and the .ij. is all one.
Farther the texte saith that though chese eate~ alone be vnholsome wherby cometh yll digestion yet if one eate a lyttell curtsye with breadde hit shall digest with the bread and nat other wyse: this is trouth if holle folkes and nat sycke eate hit.
We spake before of chese at Nutrit et impinguat &c. Ignari medici me dicunt esse nociuum.
Here the auctour blameth them that absolutelye reproue the vse of chese.
And here is to be noted that al chese doth nat ease euerye diseased stomake.
But in other cases all chese hurteth the stomake of selde knyttyng and euerye stomake weaked by longe syckenes.
But newe grene chese of small cla~mynes co~fortethe a hotte stomake for as Rasis sayth: hit repressethe his brounes and heate.
And eke hit comforteth a drie stomake through it humidite.
And olde chese or very tarte or moche cruddye hurtethe moche suche stomakes.
But olde chese or verye cruddye chese comfortethe a stomake where aboute hangeth moche fleme: for suche chese with his tartenes cuttethe and scourethe away the fleme.
But newe softe chese hurteth suche a stomake ryght moche.
And thus hit appereth that in some case these hurteth alwaye and nat in some.
And that newe chese is some tyme good some tyme olde.
The .ij. vtilite is ye chese eaten after other meate maketh hit to discende downe in to the place of digestion: that is the bottum of the stomake.
All this they knowe that haue the verye science of phisicke.
And of tarte chese Rasis saythe: Neuer the lesse a lyttell curtsye therof eaten after meate fortifieth the mouthe of the stomake: and taketh away the ouer moche satiete lothyng of meate that are wo~te to be enge~dred of swete vnctuous meatis about the stomakes mouthe.
The fyrste is that a man at his meate shulde drinke lyttell and ofte.
The .ij. lesson is that betwene meales we must forbeare drynke: speciallye if the meate that we dyd eate be vndigested in the stomake excepte great necessite constrayne vs: for drynkynge than letteth and breakethe digestion of the meate fyrste taken.
For hit causeth the meate to discende from ye stomake vndigested: putteth away the appetite: greueth the bodye and engendreth the feuers and other diseases.
Here the auctour sayth that one ought to begyn his soupper with drynke.
Some expounde this verse thus: If thou wylt eschewe sickenes dry~ke at soupper or thou begynne to eate.
For after phisitians a man shulde begynne his soupper with meate and nat with dry~ke.
And all though this boke was made for englishe men yet they kepe nat this rule: For at what houre of the day so euer they drinke they eate a morsell breadde fyrste.
Therfore this verse may be expounde other wyse: takynge drynke for meate moyste and easye of digestion as Hippocrates taketh drynke wha~ he sayth: Hit is easyer to fylle one with drynke tha~ with meate.
So that the sente~ce of this verse shulde be thus: It is better to begynne our soupper with drynke that is with meate moyste and easye of digestion than with grosse harde and yll of digestion.
The reason is if we eate meate moyst easie of digestion after grosse harde of digestion it wolde through the digestiue heate of the night be soner digested longe before the grosse meates.
And whan it can nat haue issue for the grosse meate vndigested: hit burneth ouer moche: or if hit issue hit pluckethe parte of the grosse meate vndigested with hit.
Therfore it is beste to begynne with meate moyst and easye of digestion: that whan hit is digested hit may without lette issue out.
Singula post oua pocula sume noua Post pisces nux sit post carnes caseus assit.
The fyrst is after the eatynge of euery newe layde egge rere rosted we muste drynke and specially a draughte of wyne.
The reason maye be by cause a newe layde egge rere rosted is of ryghte great nourishement and easely digested: and it is of that sorte that in smal quantite nourisheth moche: and principallye the yolke as is before sayde at oua centia
So that the wyne whiche is frendlye to nature causethe that the egge is more desirously drawen of the norishynge membres and helpethe hit to entre.
An egge discendeth but slowlye: and drynke helpethe hit to discende.
The .ii. doctrine is to eate nattis after fyshe in stede of For nuttis through theyr drines hyndreth thingendryng of that is wonte to be enge~dred of fishe.
And for this cause nuttis are the last seruice in lente.
The .iij. lesson is that after fleshe we must eate chese and nat nuttis: for nuttis drie ouer moche and so doth nat chese: but it causethe the meate to discende to ye buttum of the stomake where the vertue of digestion is.
And this is certayne if the chese be neyther to olde nor to newe.
Farther the texte hath in ye last verse that a nutte megge is holsome for the body: hit makethe the mouthe to sauour well hit comforteth the sighte and lyke wyse the lyuer splene and speciallye the mouthe of the stomake as Auicen saith.
But the other co~mune nuttes called a walnut is hurtful.
This walnut as Auicen saythe doth inflate ingendre ventosite in the wombe hit is harde of digestion and stereth one to vomite that by reaso~ of hit calidite.
But the .iij. nutte that is the nutte of the crosse bowe is dethe for the crosse bowe sleethe men.
Orels we maye vnderstande the nutte methel: whiche as Auicen saythe is venomous wherfore hit sleeth.
In the fyrste verse here he lerneth vs to drynke wyne after peres.
For peres (as is before sufficientlye declared) engendre ventosite: and of theyr proprete cause the colyke and engendre blud fulle of aquosite: and therfore with them one shulde drynke stronge wyne: whiche consumethe ventosites and aquosites enge~dred of peres.
Secondly the texte sayth that nuttis is a remedye agaynst venome: as hath bene shewed at Allea nux &c. Farther in the .ij. and .iij. verse he shewethe that peres eate~ without wyne are venomous that is hurtfull to mans nature the cause is shewed in ye fyrst verse.
Yet for al that peres be nat venomous simply for if they were they slee and peres so doynge are accursed.
In the .iiij. verse he shewethe that rawe peres are venomous that is: hurtful: for they make the humours to boyle and cause ye colike sleme skabbe.
Yet if they be sodde they be medicinable in maner as is before said that is to saye with wyne: and specially eaten after other meate: for so they expulce the dregges.
In the .v. verse he sayth that rawe peres greue ye stomake: for they let his digestion and inflate: but sodde peres releue the stomake greued: and dispose hit naturally.
The fyrste is after peres we must drynke for the cause before sayde.
The .ij. is that after eatynge of appuls we muste go to siege: for Auicen saythe: If swete or sower appuls fynde any grosse humours in the stomake they force them to discende from thence to the guttis: for appuls are moche inflatiue and engendre ventosites: whiche nature expelleth to the inferiour partis.
Here are declared .iij. commodites that come of cheris eatynge.
This some say is trouthe whan the stones be broken and eaten with al: for these .ij. to gether of their proprete scoure and clense.
The .ij. is that the kyrnell of the cherie stone by his vertue breaketh the stone in ones raynes or bladder: is eaten drie or made in mylke.
The .iij. is that the substance or meate of cheries enge~dreth very good bludde comforteth and fattethe the bodye.
And this is proued by experience: for we se that sparowes whiche are greatte eaters of cheries that in cherie tyme theyr lyuers be farre greatter tha~ in other seasons: wherby appereth that cheries encreace and co~forte the lyuer.
Yet here is to be noted that there be .ij. sortes of cheris grosse smalle.
And eke of the grosse are .ij. sortes some are swete and some sower.
All doulce and smalle cheris are vnholsome: for they lyghtlye corrupte and brede vermyn.
The grosse and sower cheries are called cina and of these are .ij. sortes: Some be ruddye and softe of substance: and suche must be eaten freshe and newe gethered and at begynnynge of dyner: theyr nature is to scoure the stomake and to prouoke the appetite.
The other are blacke grosse and harde of substa~ce and specially the sower.
And these shulde be eaten at ye begynnynge of dyner or soupper.
The cause is for by theyr sowernes they close the mouthe of the stomake wherby better spedier digestio~ foloweth.
Here he putteth .ij. vtilites co~mynge by eatynge of prunes.
Fyrste prunes coole the bodye: And therfore Portugals that dwelle in a hotte cou~tre alwaye with theyr meate sythe prunes.
The .ij. prunes cause one to laske by reaso~ of theyr humidite cla~mines: as Gal. saith.
This is of trouth if they be rype: for prunes yt be nat rype be stypticall norishe lytell as Auicen saith.
And though damaske prunes haue the forsayde vtilites yet proprelye they be ascriued to prunes of Armeny.
For prunes of the countre of Armeny are better than any other: And they vnbynde the wombe more vehemently than other as Auicen saythe.
For a more declaration ye shall vnderstande that rype prunes are vsed nat vnrype.
And prunes most holsome for mans nature be the longe ones that haue lyttell substance about the stone small harde in maner drie and the vtter skyn thynne: they shulde nat be swete in taste but some what sower and of this sorte are Damaske prunes: and suche refreshe and coole the body as sayde is.
There be many other sortes of prunes whose vse is nat accepted.
There be also prunes calledde wylde prunes whiche growe in ye woddes: these be nat laxatiue: of them water is distilled to by~de the wombe.
Prunes that are taken to make one to laske muste fyrste be layde in colde water: for than they coole and moyst more perfectly: and by slipperynes they leuse the coler that they come to: and so the stomake is better disposed to receyue foode.
And here is to be noted that moyst prunes and newe are more alteratiue thoughe they be of worse norishement and of more superfluite: but drie prunes co~forte more and better nouryshe the body.
And as hit is sayde by prunes so after the maner is vnderstande of cheris.
Yet nat withandynge the humidite of cheris is subtiler and lesse cla~my wherby they norishe lesse than prunes.
The fyrst is that with peches we shulde drynke muste for .ij. causes: the fyrste is for must is hotte boyleth in our body: whiche boylynge and heate the peche with it coldnes fordoth.
The .ij. cause is for peches be ryght colde and coole the bodye verye moche: Therfore that wyne shulde be dronke vpon them whiche heateth more than other.
The maner howe we shulde eate peches and other frutis is declared at Persica poma &c.
The .ij. doctrine is that with olde drie nuttis we must eate resyns.
For newe gethered nuttis are by them selfe holsome: but olde dry nuttis are greatte driers: through theyr vnctuosite they lyghtelye enflame the bodye: wherfore with them resyns must be eate whiche restrayne infla~mation drynes by reason they moyst.
And of nuttis is spoken more largely at Allea nux &c.
The .iij. doctrine is that resyns of corans hurt ye splene for it causeth opilation therof: yet they are holsome for the raynes: for by theyr prouokynge of vrine they purge the raynes.
Scrofa tumor glandes ficus cataplasmate cedit Iunge papaner ei confracta foris tenet ossa.
Here be declared .ij. holsome thynges that come by playsters made of fygges.
Fyrst figges sodde in water moyste layde to any of these .iij. diseases cureth hit that is swynes yuell kyrnels and swellynges.
By swynes yuell is vnderstande inflasion vnder the chynne about the throte.
And it is called scrofula a scrofa that is to saye a sowe or a swyne: either bicause this disease chanceth many tymes to swyne through theyr gulosite: orels by cause ye shappe of this disease is likened to swyne as Auicen sayth.
By kyrnels are vndersta~de impostumes whiche co~monly chance vnder ye arme pittis and in the groynes.
And by swellyng may be vnderstande inflasions in any parte of ye body.
Wherfore to hele these impostumes and specially to rype them figges shulde de sodde with water: and with the water shulde be mixed a litell curtsy of vineger: whiche shulde helpe the vertue of the figges to entre.
And whan it is sodde the fygges must be beate in a morter: and tha~ myngled with a curtsy of the water that they were sodde in: and so make a playster.
playster is proprely a medicine made of some herbe or flower and the ioyce therof: as this verse sayth: Tunc cataplasma facis cum succum ponis et herbam.
The .ij. vtilite is that a playster made of figges and popie sede ioyneth or setteth broken bones to gether agayne.
And they muste be sodde to gether in water wtout vineger: and than stampe hit in a morter and put therto a littell of the water that it was sodde in: and so lay hit to the sore.
The reason herof may be: bicause popie sede both taketh away the sensiblenes of the me~bres wherby the ache that is wonte to cha~ce in breakynge of bones is done away and prouoketh to slepe.
Fyggis eke drawe the humidites of the bodye to the vtter partis: whiche humidites broughte to the bones maye drawe retayne or holde them to gether but neuer perfectely knytte them.
And witteth well that there be .iij. kyndes of popis whyte redde and blacke.
Yonge are wonte to stampe the flowers therof to make them redde ynke.
Moche eaty~ge of fyggis maketh one lousy: and this is for certayne if the fygges be drie as Auicen sayth.
And he saith yt the cause is through the maliciousnes and corruption of the humour of them engendred.
And eke an other cause maye be for that figges stere one to swete moche wherof lyce are engendred.
The .ij. operation is fygges stere one to carnall luste: and lyke wyse they haue many superfluites and augmente the sede of generation.
The fyrst is that they vrine: that is by reaso~ they make the dregges harde and so the wtattrynes turneth in to moche vrine.
The .ij. vtilite is medlars make one costife throughe their sowernes and stipticalnes and therfore the texte sayth harde medlars be good to stoppe the laske.
But yet the softe medlars be better than the harde: for they noryshe more and bynde lesse.
And here is to be noted that medlars noryshe lesse than appuls peres peches fygges and suche lyke: whiche thynge apperethe playnelye by theyr egernes of relishe or taste hardnes of theyr substance after they be ryped on the tree and therfore we shulde eate fewe medlars and rather in way of medicine than meate.
And bicause they be verye stipticall they be holsome for ye laske.
And bicause medlars ripe nat on the tree softe inough to eate they must be layde tyll they be softe: and than they be more delectable and lesse stipticall.
Fyrste muste prouoketh one to pysse for in muste are the erthy {per}tis scouryngly bytynge the bladder whan they come therto: by reason wherof the bladder is constrayned to auoyde the vrine.
And this proprete is vndersta~de of mustis that haue bytynge lies as moche reinnishe muste.
For mustis that haue grosse lies are nat nyppy~ge but rather stoppynge and lettynge of vrine as is before sayde at Impedit vrinam &c.
The .ij. proprete must maketh one lyghtly laske through the same cause shewed in the fyrst proprete.
Thyrdly must is inflatiue: for the boylynge that hit maketh in the body reyseth vp ventosites.
The causes of these .ij. propretes are shewed before at Impedit vrinam
Fyrste ale engendreth in mans body grosse humours whiche is of trouth in regarde of wyne.
And after the diuersite of the corne or grosse substance the ale is made of the grosser humours are engendred.
Secondly ale augmentethe the strengthes: and this doth ale made of the best grayne wel sodde: for by reason hit nourysheth moche hit encreaceth strengthe.
Thyrdly it encreateth fleshe: by reason hit nourysheth moche: and for the same cause hit encreaceth the bludde.
And these .iij. laste propropretes is in stale ale well sodde and made of the beste grayne.
And these .ij. {pro}pretes is in clere bere yt hath moche of ye hoppe as bere of Amburgens whiche by reason of the hoppes bryngethe one in a laske.
And hit is nat good for them that haue a weake braine.
For this bere by reason of hoppis doth lyghtlye ouercome the brayne.
Seuently hit enflateth the bealye: this is of trouthe if hit be yll sodde: as Holande bere doth: whiche enflateth most and stoppeth and therfore fatteth ryghte moche.
And this proprete is for certaine in respecte of wyne.
Here is to be noted that ale may be made of ootis barly wheate.
And as the grayne is altered so is the co~plexion of the ale.
Hit that is made of barly inclineth more to colde for barlye is colde.
Hit that is made of barly and ootis stoppethe lesse and lesse engendreth ventosites and lesse nourisheth.
And ale made of wheate malte inclineth more to hete nouryshethe more and stoppethe more.
And the grosser the ale is the worse hit is the subtiler the better.
Farther ale made of thynges that maketh one dronke is worste as of darnell.
For this grayne specially engendreth heed ache and hurteth the senowes.
And therfore phisitians bydde in tyme of pestilence to vse hit with meate and drinke.
For Auicen sayth he that vseth vineger in his meate and drinke in pestile~ce tyme nedeth nat to drede the sickenes.
The .ij. is that vineger of it owne {pro}prete coleth.
Thyrdly hit maketh one leane by reason that hit driethe.
And this is for a very trouth if one take it fasty~g as Auicen sayth.
Yet neuer the lesse co~tinuall vse of vineger specially fastynge causeth many inco~uenie~ces: it febleth the syght hurteth the breast causethe the cough hit hurtethe the stomake and lyuer and veheme~tly oppresseth the senowes and ioyntes: them vexynge with arteticall grefes tremblynge and shakinge.
Fyftely vineger diminisheth ye sede of generatio~ for that hit coolethe driethe and makethe leane.
These {pro}pretes Rasis putteth sayenge Vineger is colde and drie whiche maketh leane distroieth the strengthes diminisheth the sede of generatio~ enforceth blacke coler weaketh ruddye sanguine coler and makethe the meate subtile that hit is myngled with.
Fyrste that vineger hurtethe leane folkes by reason hit drieth and hit tartnes maketh hit drie the more.
For lyke ioyned to lyke maketh ye one more furious.
And eke eueri decaide complexion is holpe by the contrarye and by the like is brought in worse case.
Secondly vineger hurteth the senowes thirdly hit maketh leane as is before fayde.
Here are declared .iij. vtilites of rapes te~perately sodde and one inco~uenience of the same.
Fyrst rapis comforte the stomake: for the stomake digesteth them well and is nat greued there with.
Yet besydes these propretes Auerrois sayth rapes greatlye co~forte the syghte.
The hurte of rapes is the continuall eatynge of them hurtethe the tethe.
In the laste verse he sayth rapis cause throwes or gnawyng in the bealy by reason they multiplie ventosites as sayth this verse: Ventum sepe rapis si tu vis viuere rapis.
Farther more note that of all rootis rapis do best norishe mans body as appereth by the swetenes founde in theyr sauour.
For all swete meates nouryshe more the body than sower bytter or terte.
Therfore by cause rapes be sweteste of all rootes lesse sharpe they be moste holsome in waye of meate: but yet they engendre grosse melancoly bloudde if they be nat well digested.
And hit is good to purifie them from the fyrst water and in no wyse to eate them rawe.
They stere one to bodily lust and clense the wayes that the vrine ronneth.
The first is that the of beastis is slowelye digested: by reason the harte fleshe is mela~colious whiche is hardly digested and slowly descendeth and as Auicen sayth is vnholsome fleshe and as Rasis saythe hit nourisheth lyttell.
The .ij. is that the mawe lyke wyse is yll of digestion and slowe of discendynge: by reason hit is a senowye membre and gristly: wherfore it digesteth yll enge~dreth yll blud.
Farther the texte saith that the extreme partis of the mawe as the bottum and brymme are better digested: by reason that those {per}tis are more fleshie and fatte.
The thyrde is that ye to~ge is of good nouryshement and that is touchynge the rote as Auicen sayth by reason hit is fleshie and of easye digestion.
And amonge all other a rosted pygges tonge ye skynne scraped of is lyke braune: as princis karuers knowe.
netis to~ge by reason of hit moystnes is nat verye holsome.
But for al this these delicate felowes or they rost a netis tonge they stoppe hit with cloues where by the moystnes is diminished and the meate is apter to eate.
The .iiij. is that the lyghtis are easye of digestion and easye to be voided out and this is by reason of theyr naturall softenes.
Yet theyr norisheme~t is vnholsome for mans nature: for hit is lyttell and flematike as Auicen saythe.
And here is to be noted that thoughe the lyghtis of a tuppe be vnholsome to eate yet hit is medicinable for a kybed or a sore hele if it be layde hotte there vnto as Auicen saythe.
The .v. is that a hennes brayne is best: whiche (as Auicen sayth) stancheth bledynge at the nose.
Hit must be eaten either with salte or spices: for of hit selfe hit {pro}uoketh one to vomite.
The brayne of a hogge is vnholsome for man: but the brayne of a shepe of a hare or a cony may be eaten with salte or spices.
And of the brayne we haue more largely spoken before at Nutrit impinguat &c. Semen feniculi fugat spiraculi culi.
Here is declared one doctrine of fenell sede called maratrum whiche breaketh wynde: by reason hit is hotte and drie.
And here is to be noted that by eatynge of fenell sede as phisitians say are enge~dred .iiij. co~modites.
And as touchynge the last of the .iiij. he saythe as folowethe: Democritus demed that venomous wormes desire newe fenell sede to co~forte sharpe their syght: and serpentis after wynter issuynge out of theyr caues do rubbe theyr eies agaynst fenell to clere theyr syght.
Farther note that fenell digesteth slowly and norisheth yll and lyttell: and therfore hit is vsed as a medicine and nat as meate.
Wherfore hit oughte nat to be vsed in the regiment of helthe but to expelle the vnholsomenes of other meates: As we vse some time to eate persly with lettis to resiste the coldnes and humidite of the lettis: so lyke wyse fenell may be sodde with gourdes and rapis to withstande the vnholsomenes of them.
Fyrste dyll comforteth the syghte and secondlye the stomake: by reason yt hit mundifieth the stomake and heteth hit: and eke for the same reason hit comforteth the syghte: for nothynge hurtethe the sight more than vnclenes of the stomake.
For from the vncleane stomake ascende vncleane vapours that hurte the eies in troubly~ge the sighty spiritis.
And besyde these Auicen rehersethe many other profites of dylle sayenge that hit aswagethe dolours breaketh wynde quencheth thyrst caused of salte moystnes hit openethe opilations of the lyuer and splene engendred of humidites: and lyke wise of the raynes bladder and matrice: hit prouoketh vrine and menstruous flixe: hit clenseth the matrice from white humidites: stereth to carnall luste.
Here thauctour puttethe one co~modite of spodiu~ and that is that spodium taken healeth the blodye flixe: by reason that of hit owne vertue hit co~fortethe the lyuer: and so the lyuer fortified (whiche is the originall fountayne of bludde) the blud is there better reteyned.
And Auicen saythe that spodium is the rootes of redes burned.
And hit is sayde that these rotes moued by the wynde and rubby~ge them selfe to gether burne one a nother.
Yet Symon the Ianway sayth that spodium is a thyng whose begynnynge is vnknowen vnto vs: hit semeth to be a thynge brente and diuisions of redes burned.
And hit dothe nat onelye helpe the bluddye flyxe but also the laske and spuynge as Rasis saythe.
Hit helpeth also a sharpe ague and is comfortable agaynst the shakynge therof and for ouer moche auoydynge of coler hit helpeth the stomake as Auicen sayth.
And as spodium dothe helpe and co~forte the lyuer: so there be other medicines that haue lyke aspecte and lyke proprete to comforte other speciall membres: as mace the harte: muske the brayne: lykeres the lyghtes caper the splene and galyngale the stomake as appereth by these verses.
Fyrste he puttethe a generall doctrine obserued euerye where: that before all other thynges salte muste be sette vpon the table as the vulgare verses teache vs: Sal primo poni debet primo{que} reponi.
Fyrst for that salte is a drier: and so with hit drines drieth vp the humidites yt wolde corrupt.
An other cause is that salte drieth and supresseth the humidites drawynge them out of the body and so shutteth the poores and consequently stoppeth the entrance of venome whiche is wonte to entre by the poores.
The .ij. holsome thynge is salte maketh mans meate sauorie.
For co~monlye we se no meatis sauorie without salte as saythe the thyrde verse.
Thyrdly ye auctour openeth .iiij. inco~ueniences of salte or meates to moche salted.
Fyrste very salte meates marre the syght for .ij. causes.
The fyrst is that salte thynges drie ouer moche whiche is contrarie to the eies the instrumentis of syghte for the eies are of the nature of water as the philosopher saith.
The .ij. cause is for that meates verye salte engendre ytche nyppynge in maner as is afore sayde.
Of mordicatiue meatis beynge in the stomake fumes mordicatiue are lyfted vp whiche by theyr nyppynge hurte the eies and make them verye redde.
And therfore we se that they that make salte haue co~mo~ly redde eies.
The .ij. hurte is that very salte meates diminishe ye sede of generation: by reason that verye salte meatis drie ryghte moche all the humidites of the bodye: wherbye also the sede of generation is dried and so lessed.
The .iij. hurte is it engendreth the scabbe: by reason that salte enge~dreth a sharpe bytynge humour whiche causeth ye scabbe.
The .iiij. hurte is hit augmenteth ytche: by reason hit engendrethe a mordicatiue ytchynge humour.
And these .iiij. hurtis Rasis remembreth speaky~ge of salte thus: Farther hit burneth theyr blud that take great quantite therof: hit febleth theyr syght minisheth the sede of generation: and enge~dreth ytche scabbe· and besydes these hurtis very salte meate engendreth rynge wormes drie scurfes morphewe lepre in them that be disposed there vnto sleathe the passage that the vrine ronnethe whan they are longe continued: yet whan hit is a lyttell poudred hit taketh awaye lothynge and maketh one to haue a good appetite.
Fyrst he saythe that these .iij. sauerinessis or relishes salte bytter and sharpe heate the body that receiueth them.
Secondly he saythe that these .iij. sauerinessis terte stipticall and ponticke coole.
Thyrdly he sayth yt these .iij. relishes vnctuous vnsauery and swete are temperate they make the bodye neither hotter nor colder.
Farther after Auice~ there be talages or sauerinesses that folowe vnsauerynes: and they be swete bytter sharpe terte pontike stiptike vnctuous: and to nombre vnsauerynes for sauerynes as ye texte doth there be .ix. and than sauerynes is taken for euery thynge iuged by the tast.
And amo~ge these talages there be .iij. hotte as sayth the texte salt bytter and sharpe: and as Auicen sayth ye sharpe is the hotter and nexte is salte and than bytter: for as moche as sharpe is stronger to resolue incidentis and scoure than bytter.
And than salte is like bytter broken to gether with colde humidite.
But pontike is colder tha~ the other: and nexte is stiptike and than eger.
And therfore all frutes that come to any swetenes haue fyrste a talage pontike of a vehement coldnes: and after that by digestiue heate of the sonne the frutes be digested there apperethe in them stiptisite: and after they decline to sowernes as grapes than to swetenes.
And thoughe terte be nat so hotte as stiptike yet throughe hit subtilite and persynge is in many of more coldnes.
And after Auicen po~tike and stiptike are in talage verye lyke: but yet the stiptike causethe the vpper parte of the tonge to be sharpe and roughe and pontike causeth the tonge to be roughe within.
And .iij. of these talages are temperate neyther excedynge hotte nor colde as swete vnctuous vnsauery: for though swete be hotte yet therin apperethe no myghtye heate as Rasis sayth.
And euery talage hath hit owne operations as Auicen and Rasis say.
The operations of swete saith Auicen be digestion sokynge and encreasynge of norishement nature louynglye desireth hit and the vertue attractiue draweth hit.
And after Rasis swete engendrethe moche ruddye colour and opilations of the lyuer and splene specially if the sayde membres be apte there vnto.
Hit mollifieth the stomake and comforteth the breast and lightis hit fatteth the body and augmenteth the sede of generation.
The operations of bytter after Auicen be sharpynge and washynge awaye.
And after Rasis bitter heateth drieth strongly and lyghtly reduceth the bludde to adust malice and augme~teth ruddye colour in the blud.
The operations of pontike talage after Auicen is contraction if the ponticite be feble orels expression if hit be stronge.
And after Rasis pontike cooleth the bodye driethe the fleshe and diminisheth the bludde if one vse hit ofte.
Also hit comforteth the stomake byndethe the wombe and engendrethe melancolye bludde.
The operation of stiptike talage after Auicen are contrarie thyckyng hardnynge and holdynge.
And after Rasis the operatio~s therof are lyke pontike though they be weaker: for he semeth to comprehende stiptike talage vnder pontike: for of stiptike he saythe nothynge expressely.
The operations of vnctuous talage after Auicen are sokynge slipperines and smalle digestion.
And after Rasis hit mollifiethe the stomake maketh one laskatyue and fyllethe one or he hath taken any necessarye quantite of meate: and it heateth specially them that be vexed with a feuer: and that haue a hotte liuer and stomake.
Hit moysteth soketh the body: but hit augmenteth fleme and slepe.
The operatio~s of sharpnes be resolution incision and putrifaction after Auicen: And after Rasis encreaceth heate lyghtlye enflameth the body and burneth the bloud turnethe hit in to redde coler and after in to blacke.
The operations of salte talage after Auicen is to scoure washe drie and let puttifaction.
The operatio~s of sharpe talage after Auicen is to cole and diuide: and after Rasis hit refrayneth coler and bludde and restrayneth the bealye if the stomake guttis be cleane: but if there in be moche fleumatike matter hit maketh the bealye laske cooleth the bodye and eke weaketh the vertue of digestion proprely in the lyuer.
It hurteth the senowes and senowye membres it drieth the body: but hit stereth vp the appetite.
But of vnsauerynes operations Rasis sayth that some vnsauery thynge norisheth well that is suche as is temperate.
There is other some that heateth temperately and an other that cooleth temperatly and if moystnes be ioyned there with hit moystethe and with a drye thynge hit drieth.
Bis duo vipa facit mundat dentes dat acutum Visum quod minus est implet minuit quod abundat.
The fyrst is they purge the tethe by reason they stycke longer in the tethe tha~ wyne alone or bread alone: therfore the fylthynes of the tethe is the better consumed and the tethe the better purged.
The .ij. co~modite is that hit sharpeth the syghte: for it letteth the yll fumes to ascende to ye brayne: whiche by theyr mynglynge to gether darke the syghte.
And this is by reason hit digesteth all yll matters beynge in the stomake.
Thyrdly hit digestethe perfectly meates nat well digested: for it closeth the mouthe of the stomake and conforteth digestion.
All this is of trouthe so that the breadde sopped in wyne be fyrste tosted or dried on imbers.
Omnibus assuetam iubeo seruare Approbo sic esse ni sit mutare necesse.
The fyrste is that hit is good for all folkes to kepe customable diete.
And by diete is vnderstande the ministrynge of meate drynke.
Breakynge from customable vse hurteth greuously: for customance is an other nature: Therfore as hit behoueth vs to kepe nature so lyke wyse hit dothe custome: and specially if the customable vse be laudable.
And as hit behoueth to kepe the wonte administration of meate and drynke: euen so hit behouethe vs to obserue custome in other thynges nat naturall for the selfe reaso~.
Wherfore if a ma~ wonte to labour moche wyll for go this custome lyue ydelly: or labour moche lesse: or go in ha~de with other labour: or take an other tyme or a noway: vndouted it shall ryght moche infeble hym.
So in like maner it is in mans diete in his slepe in his watche and suche lyke accidentis.
For truly good custome in all thyng must nedes be obserued if hit be laudable or indifferent in goodnes or hurtfulnes in respecte of hit wherto the change is made.
And wytteth well that they that be accustomed to labour and exercise them selfe in any kynde of labour all be hit they be feble or olde hit greueth them lesse and labour more strongly tha~ if they were yo~ge felowes vnaccustomed as Hippocrates sayth .ii. aphorism~. by reason that these feble or olde persones haue more inclination and custome to these labours: For nowe the custome before taken is lyghter as is sayde in the aforsayde aphorisme.
And this is the cause why we se olde feble craftes men to do that stronger and yonger than they can nat do and hit greueth them lesse: as a feble olde mylner to lyfte a greatte weyghtye sacke: smythe to awey with greatter hammer labour than a yonger ma~ nat therto accustomed.
The .ij. doctrine is that greatte harme folowethe change of diete as Hippocrates saythe: outcepte hit be nedefull to change hit.
Fyrste hit is nedeful to change it wha~ greuous diseases shulde growe therby: as custome to fede on yll meates whiche at lengthe of necessite wyll brede in vs yl diseases.
Suche a custome and lyke muste nedes be amended and changed by lyttell and lyttell but nat sodaynly.
For al sodayne cha~ges hurte veheme~tly specially from a thynge customable to vnaccustomable.
Secondly it is nedeful to change to thentent it lesse greue vs if we happen to change our diete.
For he yt vseth hym selfe to all maner diete shall hurte hym the lesse.
And this eke muste be vnderstande of other thinges nat naturall for as Hippocrates saythe .ii. aphoris.
thynge longe customed though hit be worse than these we haue nat vsed hurteth the body lesse.
And here is to be noted that euerye man shulde take hede howe he accustomethe hym to one thynge be hit neuer so good whiche to obserue were nedefull.
If a ma~ custome hym to one maner meate or drynke or to absteine holly fro~ them or to slepe or to knowe a woman carnally it were very dangerous for hym if he other whyle muste absteine from this custome.
Therfore euery body shulde be disposed to endure heate and colde and to all mocions and norisheme~tis so that the houres of slepe and watshe the house bedde and garmentis may be changed without hurte: whiche thynge may be done if one be nat to nere in obseruynge custome.
Therfore other whyle hit behoueth to change customable thinges Thus sayth Rasis.
The thyrde doctrine is that the stronger and nere way in healynge a pacient is to ministre a certayne diete: For whiche if the phisition doth nat care and wyll ministre an other vndue diete he foolishely gouerneth his pacient and healethe hym yll.
And note that there be .iij. maner of dietes grosse whiche is holle folkes diete sklender diete whiche is to gyue in maner nothinge: The thyrde is meane diete whiche absolutely is called sklender.
And this diete is diuided in to sklender diete declinynge to grosse diete: as the brothe of fleshe rere rosted egges small chickyns: and declinyng to sklender diete as mellicratum wyne of pome garnades: and meane diete whiche is called certayne diete as barly ieuse nat bearen to gether.
And this certayne diete is holsome in manye diseases but nat in all.
Hit is nat holsome in longe diseases: for in suche diseases the myght of ye pacient with suche meane diete can nat indure to consume the sickenes without great debilite: Therfore in suche diseases the meate muste be ingrossed.
Lyke wyse it is vnholsome in sharpe diseases as these that ende within .iij. dayes space or sooner: for in suche mooste sklender diete is beste as Hipp. saythe .i. aphoris.
there: The mooste souerayne helpe is to diete the pacie~t after his stre~gth and corporall myghte.
This texte reherseth .vj. thynges to be considered of the phisitian in ministryng of diete.
Fyrst of what qualite the meate ought to be: for in hotte syckenes we muste diete the pacient with colde meate: in moyste sickenes drie meate and in drye sickenes moyst meate.
Yet the naturall co~plexion must be obserued with diete lyke therto: For Gal. saythe: The hotter bodies nede the hotter medicines: the colder bodies the colder medicins &c.
The .ij. thynge is of what substance the meate ought to be: For they that be stronge and lustye and exercise greatte labour muste be dieted with grosser meate: for in them the way of digestion is stronge: so they oughte nat to vse sklender meates as chyckyns capons veale or kydde: For those fleshes in them wyll burne or be digested ouer soone: wherfore they muste nedes eate ofte.
But noble men and suche as lyue restfully muste vse diete of sklender substance: for in them ye vertue digestiue is weake nat able to digeste grosse meates: as bacon befe and fishe dried in ye sonne.
Lyke wyse they that be sicke of sharpe diseases oughte to vse more sklender diete than they that be sycke of longe diseases as a feuer quartane.
The .iij. is what tyme diete oughte to be gyuen: for they yt be in helthe oughte specially to regarde custome.
Wherfore they that ryse yerly in somer and eate but .ij. meles a day oughte to eate about the houre of .x. or a lytell before: and nat to abyde tyll noone bycause of the ouer great heate.
Lyke wyse they ought to suppe aboute the houre of .vj. or a lytell after.
But in wynter they ought to dine at a .xj. of the clocke or at .xij. bycause of the lo~ge slepynge: and than to suppe at .vij. a clocke or a littell after.
Tyme also in dietynge of sycke folkes muste be consydered.
For they that haue an ague whan it begynneth to vexe them or a littel before or after they shulde eate nothynge: for if one eate a lyttell before or whan the fytte cometh: therby nature that shulde entende to digest the meate is diuerted an other way.
If he shulde eate sone after the fytte is gone hit were vnholsome: for the vertue of digestion is very weake by reason of the fytte paste: Therfore he muste eate so longe afore as the meate may be digested or ye fytte come.
Orels so longe after the fytte is gone whan nature is come to due disposition.
This is of trouthe outcepte ye drede great febleshynge of nature: for tha~ at al tymes he muste eate.
For whan so euer ma~s strengthe be feblished by any chances he shulde eate forth with as saith Galen in the glose of this aphoris.
Conte~plari aute~ &c. Fourthly the quantite of the meate must be considered: For as hit is before sayde in somer we muste vse a small quantite of meate at euerye meale: for than the naturall heate is feble through the ouer great resolutions.
But in wynter we may eate a great dele of meate at a meale.
For tha~ the vertue digestiue is stro~ge whan the naturall heate is vnied through circu~stant colde as we sayde at Temporibus veris &c.
The .v. is howe ofte we shulde eate in a day: For in somer we muste eate oftener than in wynter: in autumpne and ver a lyttell at eche meale as is before saide.
Lyke wyse if the vertue digestiue be weake we muste eate lyttell and ofte: but if the vertue digestiue be stronge we may eate moche make fewe meales.
Syxtlye the eatynge place must be considered: whiche shulde nat be to hotte nor to colde but temperate.
The fyrst is that the brothe of colewortis and speciallye the fyrste brothe if they be sodde leuseth the bealy: by reason that in the leaues and vtter partis of cole+wortis is a sopy scourynge vertue weakely cleuynge and lyghtly separable by small decoction or boylynge: whiche spredde abrode by the same water is made laxatiue.
And this is ye skele that the fyrst water colewortis be sodde in laxe rather than the seconde.
The .ij. is that the substance of colewortes after they are boyled restrayneth the bealy: by reason that all theyr vertue laxatiue is taken away by the decoction: and the erthye drie substance remayneth whiche byndeth ye wombe.
The .iij. is that bothe taken to gether the brothe and substance of colewortis leuse the bealye: by reason the scourynge sopy vertue remayneth in ye water whiche leuseth all.
And note that colewortis engendre melancoly humours yll dreames they hurte the stomake norishe lyttell duske the syght cause one to dreame they prouoke menstruosite and vrine as Auicen and Rasis saye.
Farther more note that colewortis the decoction or sede therof kepe one from dronkennes as wryteth Aristottell .iii. partic. problem.
The reason as some thynke is the grosse fumes that by eatynge of colewortis are lyfted vp to the brayne engrossynge the fumosites of the wyne whiche engrossynge let them to entre to ye brayne.
Aristotell in the forsayd place sayth that al thy~ge that draweth to hit the moystnes of the wyne expellethe hit from the body and that coleth the body kepeth hit from dronkennes: cole wortes are of suche nature ergo &c.
And that colewortis are of this nature he prouethe thus: By the ieuse of colewortis the vndigested humidites of ye wyne are drawen from all the bodye in to the bladder: and through it coldnes lefte in the stomake whiche coleth all the body the persynge therof is fordone.
And so by this meane it kepethe a ma~ sobre.
For the subtile superfluites that naturally coude nat discende by reason the heate of the wyne stereth them to ascende vpwarde towarde ye brayne: are repressed downe and by vertue of this ieuse drawen to the bladder.
There be .iiij. that mollifie: malowes double malowes branca vrsina and mercury of whiche most co~mo~ly clisters be made to mollifie al indurate and harde mattier in man.
There be .ij. sortis of mallowes: the one bearethe a bludde redde flower the other a whyte flower: and this of hit proprete dothe mollifie more than ye fyrste.
The .ij. effecte of mallowes is yt malowe rootis shaued and suppositories made of them suche as phisitia~s are wonte to make of mercury drawe out of ma~ the indurate matter dregges The .iij. effecte is malowes cause the me~struous flixe in women and that through the great moystynge and slipperines therof: wherby ye veynes about the matrice sone poure out as Platearius sayth and as appereth by experience.
Here the auctour sayth that a mynte shulde nat be called a mynte outcepte it haue myght to kylle wormes in the bealy stomake.
mynte hath a great stronge sauour and is ryghte bytter: and therfore as worme wodde killeth wormes so doth the mynte.
And ye ieuse therof as of wormewod muste be dronke and nat the substance.
Yet note bicause hit is hotte and drie burnynge the blud hit is vnholsome in way of meate in the regiment of helthe.
But yet in medicines it is holsome for hit comforteth the stomake and heateth hit and stynteth yexynge and digesteth and prohibitethe vomite flematike and sanguine: and through inflation stereth to bodily lust and prohibiteth spittynge of bludde: hit is very holsome agaynst bytynge of a madde dogge: and if ye crymble mynt in to mylke hit wyll neuer turne to make a chese as Auicen sayth .ii. can.
Cur moritur homo cui saluia crescit in horto? Contra vim mortis non est medicamen in hortis.
Saluia confortat manum{que} tremorem Tollit et eius ope febris acuta fugit Saluia castoreum lauendula premula veris Nastur athanasia sanant paralitica membra.
Fyrste he sheweth the greatte vtilite of sage askynge as thoughe he doubted: wherfore man diethe that hath sage growynge in his gardeyne.
He answereth in the .ij. verse that no medi+cine growyng in the gardeyn can withstand deth al though in the gardeyne growe medicines that kepe the body from putrifaction and defe~de that natural humidite be nat lightly consumed away as techeth Auicen sayeng: The scie~ce of phisicke dothe nat make a man immortall nor hit dothe nat surely defe~de our bodies from outwarde hurt full thingis: nor can nat assure euery man to lyue to the laste terme and daye of his lyfe: but of .ij. thynges hit makethe vs sure that is from putrifaction and corruption: and defendeth that naturall moysture be nat lyghtly disolued consumed.
The fyrste is that sage comforteth the senowes: for it driethe the humidites by whiche the senowes be lette and leused.
The .ij. is hit taketh awaye the shakynge of the handes: by reason that it comforteth the senowes as is sayde nowe all thynge co~fortynge the senowes remoueth tremblynge for tremblynge comethe of feblenes of the senowes.
And therfore some olde men and women specially put sage leaues in theyr meate drynke.
Thirdly sage letteth the sharpe ague to assayle vs: by reason that hit driethe humours hit letteth them to putrifie wherby a sharpe feuer myght be engendred.
Farther note that sage is hotte and drie therfore hit is nat verye holsome alone in waye of meate.
Yet bicause sage comforteth the senowes greatly folkes in helth vse hit moche .ij. maner of ways.
Fyrste they make sage wyne: whiche they drynke specially at begynny~ge of dyner or souper.
This wyne is holsome for them yt haue the palsey or fallynge sickenes moderately taken and after the purgation of the accident mattiers.
Secondly they vse sage in sauces: for it vp a ma~s appetite and specially whan the stomake is ful of yll humours rawe and vndigested.
An other co~monly called noble sage whose leaues be more narowe and lesse: phisitio~s cal it silifagus
Hit is sayd that sage castorie that is a castors stones lauander primerose wattercresse and tansey cure and heale membres enfect with palsey.
Why sage doth helpe it we haue shewed for hit co~forteth ye senowes whiche by palsey be weaked.
And eke bicause sage is hotte drie it consumeth the flematike matter remaynynge in the senowes wherof ye palsey groweth.
And that castorie is holsome for the palsey appereth by that hit is mooste comfortable heatynge and dryenge of the senowes: For Auicen sayth therof that hit is subtiler and stronger than any other that heateth and drieth.
And after he sayth that hit comforteth and heateth the senowes the shakynge the moist crampe and benomed membres caused of the palsey.
And eke he sayth: there is nothyng better for ventosite in the eare tha~ to take as moche as a pease and tempre it with oyle of spike so let it droppe in to the eare.
Castoriu~ is the stones of a see beaste called castor.
The oyle also of Castorie is as specially good for the palsey as castorie after voidynge of the matter: for than hit consumeth the resydue of the mattier that remayneth comforteth the senowes.
Of laue~der apereth: For with hit swete sauour it comforteth the senowes and with hit heate dothe consume the palsey mattier.
And also of the primerose eke appereth for with hit swete sauour and heate hit comfortethe the senowes.
This flower is called premula veris bicause hit is the fyrste swete flower that spryngeth in ver.
The .v. is a watter cresse for hit is hotte drie subtile incisiue and resolutiue: wherby it taketh away ye mattier of palsey And Auicen saith hit comforteth all mollification of the senowes for hit heateth and drawethe out fleme and clenseth the senowes from fleme: and phisitians cou~saile vs to eate water cressis in lent bicause lenten meate is flematike.
Watercresse is a co~mo~ herbe growyng in colde stony watrishe places where as be many wel springes.
The .vj. is tansey: The vertue of this herbe is to purge fleme and with it heate drieth the senowes.
Also hit purgethe a man of wormes and the mattier wherof they be engendred.
And therfore frenche men vse co~monly to frie egges therwith in ye ester weke to purge away the fleme enge~dred of fyshe in the lente: wherof wormes are soone engendred in them therto disposed.
In the ende of the texte the auctour saythe that sage is called the sauer and keper of nature.
This texte declareth .iiij. {pro}pretes of rue. Fyrst hit sharpeth the sight proprely the ieuse therof as Auicen saith: and as is afore saide at Allea nux ruta
The .ij. is rewe diminishethe ye desire of carnall lust in men but in women rewe augmenteth hit: by reason that rue by hit heatynge dryenge diminisheth the sede of me~ whiche is subtile and of the nature of the ayre but in women rue maketh subtile and heatethe the sede: for in them hit is wattrishe and colde: and therfore hit sterethe them more to carnall luste.
The .iij. is rewe maketh a man quicke subtile and inuentife: by reason that by heatynge and dryenge hit maketh a mans spiritis subtile and so clerethe the wytte.
The .iiij. is that the water that rue is sodde in cast and sprinkeled about the house riddeth away flees and as phisitions say it kylleth them.
And after Auicen: whan the house is sprinkeled with the water of wylde gourdes the flees lepe flee away: And lyke wyse doth the water that blacke thorne is sodde in.
And after Auicen saythe that some haue sayde if goottis bludde be put in a pyt in the house the flees wyll gether there vnto and dye.
And lyke wyse if a logge be annoynted with the greace of an yrchyn ye flees wyll gether therto and dye. Flees can nat abyde the sauour of cole+wortis nor leaues of Oleandre.
Some say that nothynge is better to auoyde flees than thynges of stronge sauour: therfore rewe myntis horse myntis and hoppis be good and aboue all thyngis horse dounge orels hors stale is the chiefe.
Also the house spryncled with ye decoction of rape sede kylleth flees.
And the parfumyng of ye house with a bulles horne driuethe awaye flees.
Yet to take flees nothynge is better than to lay blankettis on the bed for therin they gether them self.
Here the auctour speaketh of oynions and declareth .v. thynges.
Fyrste touchynge theyr operation phisitions agree nat: For some saye they be good for flematike folkes: and some say naye as Rasis whiche sayth that they enge~dre superfluous and flematyke humours in the stomake.
Secondly Galen saythe they be ryghte hurtfull for colerike folkes: bicause as Auice~ saith oynio~s be hotte in the thyrde degree: and therfore they hurt hotte folkes as colerike be.
Thirdly oynio~s be holsome for flematike folkes: For they be hot persynge subtile scourynge and openyng wherfore they digest cutte make subtile and wype away fleumatike and cla~my humours growen in the fleumatike folkes.
Fourthly oynions be holsome for the stomake for they mundifie hit from fleme and heate hit.
And therfore Auicen saithe that hit that is eate of the oynion throughe the heate therof comfortethe a weake stomake.
And eke therfore they make a man well colered: For it is impossible for one to haue a lyuelye coler if his stomake be verye fleumatike or fylled with yll rawe flematike humours.
The .v. is oynions sodde and stamped restore heares agayne if the place where ye heares were be rubbed therwith.
This is of trouthe whan the heare gothe awaye throughe stoppynge of the pores and corruption of the mattier vnder the skynne.
For the oynions open the pores resolue the yll mattier vnder ye skynne drawe good mattier to he same place.
And therfore as Auicen saith ofte rubbyng with oynions is very holsome for balde men.
Wherfore the texte concludethe that this rubbynge with oynions prepareth ye beautie of the heed: for heares are ye beautie of the heed.
For a farther knowlege of oynious operation witteth that they stere to carnall lust {pro}uoke the appetite brynge colour in the face myngled with hony they distroy wartes they engendre thyrste they hurte the vndersta~dynge (for they enge~dre an yll grosse humour) they encreace spittell the ieuse of them is good for wattrynge eies and dothe clarifie the syghte as Auicen sayth.
Farther note that oynions hony and vineger stamped to gether is good for bytynge of a madde dogge.
And therfore some adde these .ij. verses vnto the forsayde texte.
But of this is spoken before at Allea nux. &c. Et modicum granum siccum calidum{que} sinapis.
Fyrste he putteth the co~plexio~ of mustarde sede sayeng that mustarde sede is a lyttell grayne hotte and drye: whiche is true: for it is hotte and drie vnto the .iiij. degree after Auicen .ii. canone. cap. de sinapi
Secondly he putteth .iij. propretes or effectes of mustarde sede.
The fyrste is it maketh ones eies to water: For with hit greatte heate hit maketh subtile and leusethe the humidites of the brayne: wherof than by theyr flowynge to the eies the teares come.
The .ij. effecte is hit purgethe the brayne mundifienge and clensynge away the flematike humidites of the heed.
Also hit purgethe the heed put in to the nose thyrllis by hit mordication prouokyng one to nese.
And therfore hit is put in their nostrils yt haue apoplexie for by reason of nesynge the brayne is pourged.
And lyke wyse mustarde sede through it great heate doth dissolue and leuse suche flemes as stoppe the cundites of ye brayne: of whiche foloweth apoplexie: And thus hit apperethe that mustarde sede is a great leuser consumer and clenser of flematike humidites.
The .iij. effecte is hit withstandethe poyson: For Auicen saythe that venomous wormes can nat abyde the smoke of mustarde sede.
Fyrst violettis delay dronkennes: by reason that violettis haue a temperate swete sauour whiche greatly co~forteth the brayne: For a stro~ge brayne is nat lightly ouer come with drinke but a weake is.
Also a violet is colde wherfore hit colethe the brayne: and so maketh hit vnable to receyue any fume.
The .ij. is violettis slaketh heed ache and grefe that is caused of heate as Auicen Rasis Alma. and Mesue say: by reason that violettis be colde they withstande hotte causes.
The .iij. is violettis helpe them yt haue the fallyng syckenes.
Though some say thus yet this effecte is nat co~monly ascribed vnto violettis.
And therfore if violettis haue this proprete hit is but by reason of theyr swete smell that co~forteth the brayne: whiche strengthed is nat hurte by small geefes: and consequently falleth nat in to epilencie (whiche is called the lyttell apoplexie chaunsynge by stoppynge of the sensible senowes.
For hit is subtiliatiue cuttynge and scourynge of fleme and grosse humours greuynge nature lettynge slepe.
Secondly it doth away vomite custome therof: by reason that vomite and parbrakyng is caused of a cla~my humour whiche the nettel cutteth.
Thyrdly the nettell fordothe olde coughe: and specially hony wherin nettell sede is tempered.
For the nettell auoydethe cla~mye fleme out of the breast as Rasis sayth.
And Auicen saythe of the nettell: that whan hit is dronke with water is is dronke with wyne healethe the bealy ache: For hit asswageth inflasion caused of grosse ventosite wherof the ache cometh for hit leuseth ventosite of the stomake and all other guttis and openeth stoppynge and there vnto the wyne helpeth.
Thyrdely cherfyil cessethe vometynge and the laske: by reason hit is hotte in the .iij. degree and dry in the .ij. it digesteth and drieth that mattier wherof vomite commeth.
And this is verye trouthe whan vomite or the laske come of colde flematike mattier.
And besides these effectis hit prouoketh vrine and the menstruosite and swageth ache of the sydes and raynes and speciallye taken with mellicratum.
Fyrste hit comforteth the harte strynge that is the brymme of the stomake is proprely called the harte stringis orels the vitall membres that is the wyndye membres whiche be nere the harte and specially the harte rote.
That hit comforteth the brymme of the stomake appereth in that the swete smellyng rote of enula co~forteth the senowy me~bres.
For wyne made of enula called vinum enulatum clenseth the breaste and lyghtis or longes as Auice~ sayth.
Also enula swalowed downe with hony helpeth a man to spytte: and it is one of those herbes that reioyce and co~forte the hart.
The .ij. effecte is the ieuse of this herbe with the ieuse of rue is very holsome for them yt be burste and that is specially wha~ the burstennes cometh by ventosite: for these .ij. ieuses dissolue that.
And besidis these effectis enula is good for a stomake filled with yl humours: and it openeth opilatio~s of the lyuer and splene as Rasis saythe.
And hit comforteth all hurtis colde grefes and motions of ventosites and inflasions as Auicen sayth.
Fyrst hyll worte principally the water therof taken with wyne purgeth blacke coler.
For the {pro}prete of this herbe is to melte and dissolue fleme: wherof very ofte~ the goute is wonte to be enge~dred.
And note that after Platearius hil worte is hotte and dry in the thyrde degree.
The substaunce therof is subtile the vertue comfortable through the swete smell of hit substance hit openethe and of hit qualites draweth: of hit fyrie substance or nature hit consumeth by burnynge and drienge.
Illius succo crines retinere fluentes Alitus asseritur dentisque curare dolorem.
Fyrste watercresses reteyne heares fallynge awaye if the heed be annoynted with the iewse therof orels if the ieuse or water therof be dronke.
This effecte Auicen toucheth sayeng: The drynky~ke or annoyntyng with watercressis cure tothe ache: specially if the ache come by colde: for it persethe resoluethe and heatethe as apperethe at Cur moriatur homo
Thyrdly ye ieuse of water cresse take~ with hony or the place annoynted therwith doth away skales that cleaue to ones skynne: by reason yt suche skales be enge~dred of salte fleme.
Watercresse as is sayde purgeth all fleme: therfore if hit be dronke hit resisteth the cause of skales: and the place annoynted therwith auoydeth the skales and specially myngled with hony: for that is a cle~ser and so helpeth the cressis to purge.
Beside these effectis cressis drie vp the corruptio~ of the bealy clenseth the lyghtis heateth the stomake and liuer and is holsome agaynst the grosnes of the splene: proprely wha~ therof and hony a plaister is made it causeth one to caste vp coler hit augmenteth carnall luste: and by dissoluynge auoydeth out wormes and prouoketh menstruosite as sayth Auicen.
Cecatis pullis ac lumina mater hyrundo Plinius vt scribit quamuis sunt eruta reddit.
Whan yonge swalowes be blynde the da~me bringeth celendine and rubbeth theyr eies maketh them to see: wherby the auctour shewethe hit is holsome for the sighte.
And this appereth playnly sith hit is co~monly put in medicines agaynste feblenes of syghte.
And why swalowes knowe it better tha~ other byrdes may be by cause theyr yonge be oftner blynde: swalowes donge doth make blynde: and so the da~me do~geth some tyme in the yonges eies and maketh them blynde.
And after Platearie celendine is hotte and drie in the .iij. degree.
And of it qualites and substance hit hath vertue to dissolue consume and drawe.
And the rootis therof stamped sodde in wine are good to purge the heed and womans priuite from broken moist humours if the pacie~t receyueth the smoke therof at the mouth after gargyse wyne in ye throte.
Fyrst the ieuse of wylowe poured in to ones eare kylleth wormes: by reason of the stiptisite dryenge therof.
And after Auicen nothynge is better to heale matterynge at the eares than the ieuse of wylowe leaues.
Secondly the rynde of wylowes sodde in vineger dothe awaye wartes.
And Auicen saythe wylowe ashes with vineger draweth vp wartis by the rotis: by reason of ye ashes vehement drienge.
Yet to distroy wartis nothy~g is better tha~ to rubbe them with purslane.
This purslane doth of hit {pro}prete and nat qualite after Auicen.
Thyrdlye wylowe flowers and ieuse of it frute letteth the byrthe of a childe: for through hit stiptisite and drought hit causeth the childe to be borne with great payne.
And wytteth well that saffron hath suche proprete that if one take more therof than he ought hit wyll kylle hym in reioysynge or laughynge.
Auicen saythe that to take a dra~me and a halfe wyll kylle one in reioysynge.
Hit comforteth eke the stomake by hit stiptisite and heate: and for the same cause restoreth the liuer and specially through hit stiptisite whiche wyll nat suffre the liuer to be disolued.
Yet to vse hit ouer moche induseth parbrakynge and marreth the appetite.
Of this Auicen warnethe vs sayenge: Hit causeth parbrakynge marreth the appetite bicause it is contrary to the sharpenes in the stomake whiche is cause of appetite.
Besydes these {pro}pretes faffron maketh one slepe and dullethe the wyttes and whan hit is dronke with wyne hit maketh one dronke it clenseth the eies and lettethe humours to flowe to them hit maketh one to breth well it stereth to carnal lust and maketh one to pysse.
This texte sheweth certayne propretes of the co~plexio~ of fleme.
Fyrst flematike folkes be weake by reason that theyr naturall heate whiche is begynner of all strength and operation is but feble.
Secondly flematike folkes be shorte and thycke: for theyr naturall heate is nat stronge inoughe to lengthe the bodye: and therfore hit is thycke and shorte.
Thirdly flematike folkes be fatte bicause of theyr great humidite.
Therfore Auicen sayth that superfluous grese signifieth colde and moistnes: For the bludde and the vnctious mattier of grese persynge through the veines in to the colde membres (throughe coldnes of the membres) do conieile to gether and so engendre in man moche grese as Galen sayth in his .ij. boke of operation.
He saythe after that sanguine men are myddell bare betwene the longe and the shorte.
Fourthly flematike folkes are more inclined to ydelnes and study than folkes of other co~plexion: by reason of theyr coldnes that makethe them slepe.
Fyftlye they slepe lo~ger by reason of theyr great coldnes that prouoketh them to slepe.
Syxtelye they be dull of wytte and vnderstandynge: for as temperate heate is cause of good witte and quicke vnder sta~dyng: so cold is cause of blu~t witte dul vndersta~dyng.
Seue~thly they be slouthful that is by colde: for as heate maketh a ma~ lyght quicke in mouyng: so cold maketh a man heuy slouthful.
Fyrst ofte eatynge of lekes make yonge wome~ frutfull: by reason as Auicen saythe lekes delate the matrice and taketh awaye the hardnes therof: whiche letteth the conception.
Secondly lekes stynce bledynge at the nose as Auicen saythe.
Many other effectis of lekes are rehersed at Allea nux ruta
This text declareth many co~modites of pepper: and fyrst .iij. of blacke pepper.
Fyrste blacke pepper through hit heate drines leuseth quickely: for it is hotte and drie in the .iij. degree.
Seco~dly hit purgeth fleme: for it draweth fleme from the inner parte of the body and consumeth hit.
Lyke wyse hit auoydethe fleme out that cleuethe in the breast and stomake heatynge subtilynge dissoluynge hit.
And this appereth by Auice~ sayenge: that pepper is digestiue causynge appetite.
And this speciallye is to be vnderstande by longe pepper: whiche is more holsome to digest rawe humours tha~ either whyte or blacke as witnesseth Galen.
And this appereth by Galens wordes sayenge: that hit co~forteth ye stomake more than ye other .ij.
To this agreeth Auicen sayenge: whyte pepper is more holsome for the stomake: and more vehemently dothe comforte.
The .ij. is pepper is holsome for the coughe specially caused of colde fleumatike mattier for hit heatethe dissoluethe and cutteth hit.
To this Auicen assenteth sayenge: Whan pepper is ministred in lectuaries it is holsome for the coughe and aches of the breaste.
Thyrdely white pepper is holsome for ache and that is to witte of the breaste and ve~tous payne.
And for that all pepper is good: for all pepper is a dimynysher and a voyder of wynde.
And Auicen saythe: that white pepper and longe is holsome for prickynge ache of the bealye if hit be dronke with honye freshe baye leaues.
Fourthly pepper withstandeth the causes of a colde feuer for it digesteth and heateth the mattier.
Fyftly white pepper is holsome for a shakynge feuer by reason that pepper with it heate comforteth ye senowes and consumeth the mattier spredde on them.
And Auicen sayth in rubbynge it is made an oyntme~t (with vnguentum) holsome agaynst shakynge.
These .v. {pro}pretes are ascriued to ye other ky~des of pepper as Auice~ saith.
And besyde these effectis pepper heteth the senowes and braunes of mans body: it mundifieth the lightis and a lyttell therof {pro}uoketh the vrine but moche leuseth ye bealy as saythe Auicen.
There be .iij. sortis of pepper white pepper called lencopiper longe pepper called macropiper blacke pepper called melancopiper
Hit is called whyte pepper that is very grene and moyst: and whan it is a lyttell dried and nat perfectly rype hit is called longe pepper.
But whan hit is perfectly rype hit is called blacke pepper.
The fyrst is immediate slepe after meate and that is if one eate his fyll.
For the immediate slepe wyll nat suffre the meate to digeste: and of meate vndigested are enge~dred grosse vndigested fumes: whiche with theyr grossenes stoppe the cundites of heryng: eke they engrosse trouble the spiritis of herynge.
The .ij. is to moche mouynge after meate: for that also letteth digestion and the due shuttynge of the stomakes mouthe: by reason that than the stomakes mouthe closeth nat so easely as by a lyttell walkyng wherby the meate discendethe to the bottum of the stomake.
For wha~ the stomake is nat shutte many fumes ascende to the heed that greue the herynge.
The thyrde is dronkennes wherof many fumes and vapours are enge~dred whiche asce~de to the heed organ of herynge troublyng the spirite therof and greuynge the herynge.
And dro~kennes doth nat only hurte the herynge but also the syghte and all the sensis for the same cause as is before sayde.
There be .iij. thynges as Auicen saythe that hurte the eare and other senses lothynge repletion and slepe after repletion.
And some text hath this verse: Balnea sol vomitus affert repletio clamor.
For Auicen sayth if we wyl here well and naturallye we muste eschewe the sonne laborious baynynge vomite great noyse and repletion.
Here are touched .vij. thynges whiche cause a hummynge a noyse in ones eare.
The cause is for in feare the spiritis and humours crepe inwarde towarde the harte sodaynlye: by whiche motion ventosite is lyghtly engendred whiche entrynge to the organ of the hearynge causeth tyngynge or ryngynge in the eare.
By corporall mouynge also humours and spiritis are moued of whiche motion ventosite is lyghtly engendred whiche commynge to the eares causethe ryngynge.
For ryngynge is caused through some mouynge of a vapour or ventosite about the organ of the heryng mouynge the naturall aire of those pipes co~trary to theyr course.
The .ij. is great hunger: Auicen sheweth the reason sayenge: that this thyng cha~cethe throughe humours spredde and restynge in mans body.
For whan nature fyndeth no meate she is conuerted vnto them and resoluethe moueth them.
The .iij. is vometynge: For in vometynge whiche is a laborious motion humours are specially moued to the heed.
In token wherof we se the eies and face come redde and the syghte hurte.
And thus also by vometyng vapours and ventosites are soone moued to thorgan of the herynge.
The .iiij. is ofte beatynge about the heed specially the eare.
For therby chanceth vehement motion of the naturall aire beynge in the organ of the herynge.
Wherof Hippocrates saythe: the southe wynde is mystye and duskethe the eies: for that wynde fyllethe the heed with humidites whiche dulle the wyttis and darke the syghte.
The .v. is pepper whiche through ye sharpenes therof engendrethe fumes that byte the eies.
The .vj. is garlyke whiche also hurteth the eies through it sharpenes and vaporosite as is sayd at Allea nux
The .vij. is smoke whiche hurtethe the eies through hit mordication and drienge.
The .viij. is lekes: For by eatynge of them grosse melancolye fumes are engendred: wherby the syghte is shadowed as is before sayde at Allea nux ruta. &c.
The .ix. is oynions the eatynge of whiche hurtethe the eies through theyr sharpenes.
The .x. is lens the moche eatynge wherof as Auicen sayth dusketh the syghte through the vehement dryenge therof.
The .xj. is to moche wepynge: whiche weakethe the eies for hit causeth debilite retentiue of the eies.
The .xij. is beanes: the vse wherof engendreth a grosse melancoly fume darkynge the visible spiritis as lekes do.
The .xiij. is mustarde the vse wherof febleth the syght through hit tartnes.
The .xiiij. is to loke agaynst the sonne: and that is through the vehement splendour and bryghtenes therof: wherby the syghte is distroyed: as apperethe by experie~ce.
For the veheme~t sensiblenes of a thy~g nat proporcioned to mans sense as the sonne beames corrupte mans sense.
The .xv. is to moche carnall copulation and specially after greatte fedynge or repletion or after great voidy~g or emptines: but this is all redye declared.
The .xvj. is fire the beholdynge wherof causethe vehement drines in the eies and so hurteth the syghte: and eke the bryghtnes therof hurtethe the eies.
And therfore we se co~monlye that smythes and suche as worke before the fyre be redde eied and feeble sighted.
The .xvij. is to great labour for that eke drieth vehemently.
The .xviij. is smytynge vpon the eies whiche hurteth the eies and syght for it maketh them bludde shotte troubleth ye vissible spirite: other whyle engendrethe impostumes.
The .xix. is to moche vse of or sharpe thy~ges as sauces: and that is through the tertnes of fumes of them engendred.
The .xx. is duste or walkyng in dusty places: in whiche duste fleeth light lyin to the eies duskethe the syghte.
The .xxj. and aboue other hurtfull to the eies and syght is to moche watche: For to moche watche inducethe to moche drynes in the eies.
And generally all repletions hurt the eies: and all that driethe vp nature: and all that trouble the bludde by reason of saltnes or sharpenes.
All dronkennes hurteth the eies: but vometynge co~forteth the syght in that hit purgeth the stomake: and hurteth hit in that hit moueth the mattiers of the brayne dryuynge them to the eies.
And therfore if hit be nedefull to spue hit muste be done after meate without constraynynge.
Also to moche slepe incontinent after meate and moche bludde lettynge and proprelye with ventosites hurtethe the syghte as Auicen sayth .iii. tract.
iiii. ca. iiii. where he expresseth many of the forsayde causes.
Feniculus verbena rosa celidonia ruta Ex istis fit aqua que lumina reddit acuta.
This texte recitethe .v. herbes whose water is verye holsome for the syghte.
The fyrste is fenell whose ieuse put in to the eie sharpeth the syghte after Rasis .iij. Alm~.
The .ij. is verueyn wherof the water is of many phisitians put in resceytes holsome agaynst feblenes of syghte.
The thyrde is a rose whose water dothe comforte the lyuelye spirite and syghte.
The .iiij. is celendine whose ieuse is citrine hit is called celidonia that is gyuynge celestiall gyftes.
The .v. is rewe: ye water of those .ij. herbes is holsome for the syghte as phisitians co~monly say.
Ne careas iure cum iusquiamo simul vre. Sic{que} per embotum fumum{que} cape dente remotum.
He saythe Lykes sede henbane burned to gether is good for the tothe ache.
They must be ministred on this wyse: The ieuse of he~bane with the lyke sede must be burned to gether: and the smoke must be resceiued through a fonell on the side that the ache is.
The vertue of the he~bane taketh away the felynge of the payne.
And the vertue of ye lyke sedes fume kylleth wormes: whiche other whyle lyenge in the concauites of ye tethe cause intollerable payne as Auicen saythe ii. canone cap. de porro
The fyrste is eatynge of nuttis: for nuttis drie moche: and therfore they asperate the voice and make it like a cranes voyce.
The .ij. is oyle the vse wherof may engendre horsenes: for some cla~my partis therof cleue fast to the pipe of the lyghtis causy~g horsnes.
Secondly hit may make colerike folkes hoorse for that in them ye oyle is lightly enflamed and so that inflamation causeth exasperation and horesnes: but the fyrste cause semeth better.
The thyrde is colde of the heed: For colde of the heed doth presse to gether the brayne: wherby the humours discende towarde the throte and the pype of the lyghtis: enducynge horsenes throughe to moche moystnes of the pipe.
The .iiij. is eatynge of yeles: for the eatynge of them multiplieth cla~my fleme: whiche comynge to the lyghtis stycke there styll and cause horsnes.
Nowe the vehement wetynge of the pipe of the lightis dothe chieflye cause horesnes of the voyce as all phisitians say.
The .vj. is rawe apuls for in that they be rawe they encreace fleme: and if they be nat rype but sharpe and sower they make the throte roughe.
The fyrste is abstinence from meate or fastynge for therby the mattier of reume is dimynyshed: for abstinence drieth and the mattier is better ryped and consumed: For whan nature fyndethe no matter of foode wheron she may worke: she worketh vpon reumatike mattier and consumeth hit: and so the heed is lesse fylled therwith.
Wherfore Auicen saythe: that a man hauynge the catar or the pose shulde take hede he fylle nat hym selfe with meates.
The .ij. is watche: for watche dryeth the brayne and withstandeth that ye vapours ascende nat to the heed.
The .iij. is hotte meatis and drynkes: for throughe theyr heate the colde mattier of the reume is digested.
The .iiij. is to labour moche: for therby the mattier reumatike is consumed: by reason that moche labour drieth vp ye su{per}fluites of the bodye.
And in stede of some textis haue veste and than the sentence is that warme garme~tis is holsome for the reume specially whan hit cometh by colde mattier.
The v. is inspirynge of hotte aier and speciallye if the catarre procede of colde matter: for by breathyng of warme aier the mattier is warmed and riped.
The .vj. is to drynke lyttell and endure thyrst: for therby the reumatike mattier is consumed.
And eke by lyttell drynkynge the heed is nat fylled as with moche drinkynge.
The .vij. is to holde ones breath: for that is specially good in a catarre caused of a colde mattier: by reason that this holdy~g of the breathe heatethe the partis of the breast: and so the colde fleumatike mattier causynge the catarre is better digested.
These thynges and many other Auicen toucheth sayenge: Hit behouethe to kepe the heed warme continuallye.
And also hit must be kepte from the northe wynde and proprely after the southe.
Also he must drinke no colde water: nor slepe on the day tyme: He must endure thyrst hu~ger and watche: as moche as he can: for these thynges in this sickenes are the begynnynge of helth.
Farther more Rasis biddeth hym yt hath ye reume to beware of lyenge vp ryghte.
For by lyenge vp ryghte the reumatike matter floweth to the hynder partis of man where as be no manifeste issues wherby the mattier maye voyde out: Therfore hit is to be feared lest hit flowe to the senowes and cause the crampe or palsey.
And lyke wyse he ought vtterly to forbeare wyne: for wyne is vaporous: and in that hit is verye hotte it dissolueth the mattier and augmenteth the reume: And lyke wyse he must nat stande in the sonne nor by the fire: for the sonne and fire leuse the mattier and augmenteth the reume.
In the last .ij. verses thauctour puttethe difference betwene these .iij. names catarrus branchus and corisa
And the difference standeth in ye mattier flowyng to one part or an other of the body: Wha~ the mattier ro~nethe to the breaste partis hit is called catarrus whan hit ronneth by the nose it is called corisa whan hit ronnethe to the necke hit is called branchus
But this worde reume dothe note signifie generally all maner of mattier flowyng from one membre to an other.
Here the auctour putteth a curable medicine for the fistule sayenge: that a playster made of auripigmentum brymstone white lyme sope myngled to gether healeth the fistule.
For these thyngis haue vertue to drie and mundifie: whiche ententions are requisite in healynge a fistule.
Platearie sayth auripigmentum is hotte and drie in the .iiij. degree: it dissolueth and drawethe consumethe and mundifieth.
Brymstone and sope as he sayth are hotte drie: but brymstone is more vehemente: for hit is hotte and drie in the .iiij. degree but sope is nat. Auicen saythe that lyme washed drieth without mordicatio~ and makethe steddye.
The fistule is a rounnynge sore whiche auoydeth mattier more or lesse after the diuersite and course of the moone.
Auripigme~tum is that ye grauers faste~ bras other mettals wt to stones.
Ossibus ex denis bis sentenis{que} nouenis Constat homo denis bis dentibus et duodenis Ex tricentenis decies sex quinque{que} venis.
Here thauctour nombreth the bones tethe and veynes in mans body.
Yet after the doctours of phisike as Hippocrates Galen Rasis Auerroys and Auice~ the bones in ma~ be .CCxlviij.
And though herin be variance yet there is a mayster of phisicke that saythe: Ossa ducenta sunt at{que} quater duodena.
Secondly thauctour sayth that a man most co~monly shulde haue .xxxij. tethe.
But yet hit chanceth that some men lacke .iiij. the laste tethe: whiche be behynde them that we call the grynders: these haue but .xxviij. tethe.
Some lacke these iiij. laste tethe in childe hod only: some other lacke them tyl they be very olde: and some all their life.
Here is to be noted yt after Auicen the .ij. formost tethe be called duales and .ij. on either side of these twayne are called quadrupli
There be .ij. in the vp+per iawe and .ij. in the nether: al these tethe were ordeined to cutte: and therfore some cal them cutters and speciallye the duales
Nexte vnto those quadruples are .ij. tethe aboue and .ij. benethe. called canini whose office is to breake harde thingis.
After those be .iiij. other on either side called grynders .iiij. aboue and .iiij. beneth.
After those some haue a tothe called sensus on either syde and as well aboue as benethe.
And so the holle nombre of ye tethe is .xxxij. orels .xxviij. in them that haue nat ye tethe called sensus
There is than .iiij. duales iiii. quadruples .iiij. dogge tethe .xvj. grinders .iiij. sensus
Thyrdly the text saith that there is in ma~ CCClxv. veynes as appereth in the anothamie.
Here the auctour declarethe the .iiij. humours in man as bludde fleme coler and melancoly.
And shewynge the nature and complexion of them he compareth eche to one of the .iiij. elementes.
Melancoly is colde and drye so co~pared to the erthe whiche is of lyke nature: Fleme is colde moyst and so co~pared to water.
Bludde is hotte moist and so compared to the aier.
For a farther knowlege wittethe well that after Auice~ there be .iiij. humours in ma~s body blud fleme coler and melancoly as is sayde.
The best of them is blud fyrst by reason hit is the mattier of mans spiritis: in whom consistethe mans lyfe and operations.
Secondly bicause hit is comfortable to the principles of lyfe hit is temperatlye hotte and moyste.
Thyrdly bicause hit restoreth and nourisheth the body more than the other humours: and it is called the treasure of nature: for if hit be loste dethe foloweth forth with.
Nexte to bludde in goodnes is fleme: Fyrst by reason that if nede be hit is apte to be tourned in to bludde.
Secondly bicause hit is very nere like humidite whiche is as fu~datio~ of lyfe.
After fleme in goodnes is coler: whiche is partner with natural hete so longe as it kepeth conuenient measure.
Than foloweth melancoly as dregges and durte remoued aparte from the principles of lyfe ennemy to ioye and liberalite and of nere kynred to age and dethe.
Secondly note that in the diuision of humours there is .ij. kyndes of blud that is to say naturall vnnaturall.
Naturall blud is ruddye: that is to saye veyne bludde ruddye and obscure: and arterie bludde ruddye and clere: without yll sauour: and in comparison of other humours is very swete.
Unnaturall is double: the one is vnnaturall in qualite that is to say whiche is cha~ged from good co~plexion in it selfe: orels by myngly~ge of an other humour.
There is an other vnnaturall bludde whiche throughe mynglynge of other humours is yll bothe in qualite substance quantite and in proportion of the one to ye other.
And this is double: for the one is nat naturall by mynglyng of an yll humour that cometh to hym from without.
The other is vnnaturall by mynglynge of an yll humour engendred in the selfe blud: as whan parte of the blud is putrified and the subtile parte therof is tourned in to coler and the grosse part in to melancoly: orels that coler or that mela~coly orels both remayneth in the blud.
And this vnnaturall bloud by mynglynge of an yll humour varieth from naturall bludde many wayes.
Fyrst in substance: for hit is grosser and fouler: sith mela~coly is myngled therwith: orels hit is more subtile whan wattrishenes or citrine coler is myngled therwith.
Secondlye in colour: for some tyme whan fleme is myngled therwith hit enclineth to whitenes or through melancolye to blackenes.
Thirdly in sauour: for by myngly~g of putrified humours hit is more stynkynge: orels by mynglynge of rawe humours hit hath no sauour.
Fourthly in talage: for by mynglyng of coler hit enclineth to bitternes and by melancoly to sowernes or by fleme to vnsauerynes.
Naturall is that whiche within a certeyne space wyll be bloudde: for fleme is vndigested bloudde.
There is an other spice of fleme whiche is swete and some what warme if hit be compared to the bodily hete: But comparynge hit to ruddye blud and coler hit is colde.
Fleme is naturally whyte: and this is called swete fleme extendynge this name swete to all the talages delitynge the taste: for other wise this natural fleme is nat swete: but vnsauery and watrishe and very nere the talage of water.
And to this fleme nature hath nat gyuen a {pro}pre mansion as she hath done to coler and melancoly: but nature maketh it ronne with the bloud: for it hath a very nere similitude to bloud.
And of this fleme there be .ij. necessites and one vtilite.
The fyrste necessite is that hit be nere the membres so that theyr vertue maye digeste and turne hit in to bloudde: and that the membres by hit may be nourished whan they haue loste theyr naturall foode that is for to saye good bloudde throughe restrynte of material bloud whiche restreynt is caused of the stomake lyuer through some causes accidentall.
The .ij. necessite is that hit myngle with the bloud and make hit apte to nourishe the me~bres of flematike complexion as the brayne and nuche: for that that must noryshe these me~bres must be well myngled with fleme.
The vtilite of fleme is that hit moyst the ioyntes and membres that moue moche leste they waxe drie through the heate that cometh of theyr mouynge and rubbynge.
Fyrste in hit substance: so some therof is muscillaginosu~: and that is fleme to ones semynge diuerse: for in some parte it is subtile and thynne and in some other grosse and thycke: it is called muscilaginosu~ bicause hit is lyke muscilages drawe~ out of sedes.
There is an other fleme that appereth egall in substance that is in subtilite grossenes to ones demynge: but for a trouth hit is diuers in euery parte: this is named rawe fleme.
And to auoyde hit out of the stomake Hippocrates byddethe vs spue twyse a monethe: and to voide hit out of the guttis nature hath ordeyned coler to runne from the chest of the gall to the entrayle ieiuniu~ so forthe to the other lower guttis to scoure away that fleme from the brymmes of the entrayles and to cause hit to discende downe with the other dregges and fylthe.
Some tyme this fleme is encreased in the veynes specially of olde folkes by minishyng of theyr digestio~: and there remaynynge is by lyttell littell augmented and engrossed hurtynge nature whiche can nat by the veynes therto ordeyned voyde hit out yet it doth that is possible to kepe it from the harte and other inwarde membres: and driueth it to the outwarde membres and specially to the legges: for by hit heuynes hit naturally draweth to the lower partis of man: And this is the cause why olde folkes legges are swollen that if one presse downe his fynger therin there taryethe a hole: specially towarde night and in fatte folkes suche as were wonte to be nourished with moyst meates.
There is an other spice of fleme verye subtile wattrishe lyke vnto water some what thicke: This fleme is verye often myngled with theyr spittyll that haue yll digestion and of those that be great drinkers: it runneth from ye brayne to the nose as hit is wonte in the begynnynge of the pose: and whan by decoction and boylynge in man hit cometh grosse hit is turned in to fleme grosse white and muscillage.
There is an other fleme grosse and white called gipseum the subtile partis of this fleme is dissolued through it longe bydynge in the iointis: and the grossenes therof remaineth in ye ioyntis as harde as stones.
There is an other fleme thycke and grosse lyke to molt glasse in colour cla~mynes and weight.
Secondly vnnaturall fleme differethe in talage: for there is certayne fleme yt is swete whiche is by mynglynge of bludde with fleme.
And vnder this is conteyned the vnctuous fleme: whiche is engendred by mynglynge of vnctuous bloud and fleme.
There is an other maner of vnsauerye fleme caused of rawnes: as certeyne glassy fleme.
There is an other salte fleme caused by mynglynge of coler.
And this is more bytynge drier and lyghter tha~ any other fleme through the coler mingled therwith whiche is drie lyght and sharpe.
And this fleme is ofte founde in theyr stomakes that be flematike that drinke moche stronge wyne and that vse salte and sharpe meates and cleuynge to the stomakes causeth other whyle thyrst intollerable: and runnyng by the guttis hit some tyme fleeth them: and causethe the bluddy mensyn: in the fundeme~t ofte tymes induceth stronge stiuenes.
There is an other fleme that is sharpe by mynglynge of sharpe melancolye therwith: and some tyme throughe boylynge of fleme: as hit chanceth in the swete ieuses of frutes: that fyrste boyle and after waxe ripe: And this fleme appereth oftner in theyr stomakes that digest yll than in other partis.
For naturally coler floweth to the mouthe of the stomake to stere vp thappetite: whiche desce~dyng downewarde some tyme myngled with fleme maketh it sower: and this is {per}ceyued by sower belchynges.
And other whyle this fleme is engendred in the stomake by boyly~g with a weake heate.
There is an other fleme called pontike whiche is some tyme caused by mynglyng of po~tike melancoly.
But this is seldome by reason that pontike melancolye is very scarse.
Hit is some tyme caused throughe vehement coldnes therof: wherby the moystnes therof is co~ieyled and some what altered to erthynes: and thervpon cometh no weake heate whiche causynge it to boyle shulde conuerte it in to sharpenes: nor no stronge heate whiche digestyng hit shulde turne it in to blud.
Vnnaturall coler is the fome of blud whose coler is ruddy clere that is citrine in the laste degree of citrines: as saffron heedes: and hit is lyghte and sharpe: and the hotter the more redde it is.
And after this coler is enge~dred in the heed hit deuideth in two partis one parte gothe with the bloud in to the veynes the other gothe in to the purse of the galle.
The parte that gothe with the bloud entreth therwith bothe for necessite and profite.
Hit is nedefull that hit myngle with the bloud to nourishe ye colerike me~bres.
Hit is behoueful that hit make the bloud subtile and cause hit to entre in to the veynes.
The parte that gothe to the purse of the galle gothe eke thether for necessite and profite.
The one is nedefull for all the bodye to mundifie hit from colerike superfluites.
The other necessite is in respecte of the galles purse.
The one is to washe ye entrayles from dregges and cla~my fleme cleuynge to them.
The other is to pricke ye guttis musculs that they may fele the thynge that hurteth them and voyde all other fylthynes.
The profe of this is that colike chanceth oftetymes by stoppynge of the hole that comethe from the purse of ye galle to the guttis.
For one is vnnaturall throughe outwarde cause myngled there with.
The other is vnnaturall throughe a cause in it selfe: for the substance therof is nat naturall.
Coler vnnaturall throughe an outwarde cause is an other knowen and famous: And hit is that that fleme is myngled with.
And it is called famous or notable: by reason hit is ofte enge~dred.
And of this kynde of coler cometh ye thyrde wel knowen.
There is an other yt is lesse famous and that is hit wherwith melancoly is myngled Famous coler is either citrine and engendred by mynglynge of subtile fleme with naturall coler orels hit is yolkye lyke to yolkes of egges and is enge~dred by mynglynge of grosse fleme with natural coler.
One is whan the coler is burned in hit selfe and turned to ashes from whiche the subtile parte of the coler is nat seperated but myngled therwith.
An other is whan melancoly cometh from without and mynglethe hit with the coler.
And this coler is better than other and is ruddye in colour: hit is nat clere nor flowynge but more lyke to veyne bludde.
This vnnaturall coler hauynge his owne propre substa~ce without mynglynge of any other humour is ofte engendred in the lyuer: by reason that the subtilnes of the bloud burneth hit selfe and tourneth in to coler and grossely in to melancoly.
An other coler there is engendred in the stomake of yll meatis nat digested but corrupted: orels it is engendred in the veynes by other humours.
For one is called coler prassiue lyke the colour of ye herbe called prassion: whiche is engendred of the yolkynes whan hit is burned: for ye burny~g causeth a yolky blackenes i~ ye coler whiche myngled with coler citrine enge~dreth a grene coler.
The other is called rusty coler lyke to rusty iron: it is engendred of passiue: wha~ prassiue is burned only tyl the humidite ther of be dried away: and through hit drines begynneth to waxe white.
And these .ij. last colers be yll and venomous and yet rusty is the worse.
Lyke wyse there be .ij. kyndes of melancolye naturall and vnnaturall.
The naturall is the dreggis and su{per}fluite of good bloud whose talage is betwene swete and pontike.
And this melancoly whan hit is engendred in the lyuer is parted in .ij. partis.
Of whiche one entreth with the bloud and there with remayneth in the veynes.
The fyrste parte entreth with the bloud for necessite and profite.
Hit is nedefull that it myngle with the bloud to norishe the melancoly colde and drie membres as the bones.
The vtilite is to make thycke the thynne bloud to stynte the su{per}fluous runnynge therof to make it stronge and to strengthe these membres in to whiche hit muste be conuerted.
The other parte that nedeth no bloud gothe to the splene both for necessite and profite.
The necessite is double one vniuersall throughe out the bodye to purge hit of mela~colious superfluite.
The other is but {per}ticular only to gouerne the splene.
This mela~coly is also profitable for mans body for hit runnethe to the mouthe of the stomake straynynge out the humidites that hit fyndeth there as a woman straynynge a cowes dugges drawethe out the mylke.
Secondly by reason it moueth the mouthe of the stomake through hit egernes hit maketh one haue an appetite and lust to meate.
Vnnaturall mela~coly is as a thynge burned or ashes in respecte of other humours.
Of this there are .iiij. famous kyndes though there be many nat famous.
The fyrst is ashes of coler: and this is bytter.
The .ij. is ashes of fleme: and if the fleme that is burned were very subtile and wattrishe: than the melancoly therof engendred wyll be salte in talage.
But if the fleme be grosse yt is burned: than the ashes therof or the melancoly of hit engendred enclyneth to sowernes or
The .iij. is ashes of bloud and this melancolye is laste a lyttell drawynge to swetenes.
And if natural melancoly wherof so it be be subtile: tha~ it will be very sower.
And wha~ hit is caste out vpon the grounde hit boyleth and sauoureth of the aire and causeth both flies and beastis to voide the place.
But if the naturall melancoly be grosse the vnnaturall therof inge~dred shall nat be so sower.
Qualibet ex causa nec hos leuiter mouet ira. Largus amans hylaris ridens rubei{que} coloris.
But we may nat vnderstande that sanguine folkes be proprely fatte: for that is a token of a colde complexion as saythe Auicen: But they be fatte and fleshye with all: for fatte in sanguine persones is taken for fleshye.
Auicen saythe: that abundance of ruddy fleshe and styffe signifieth a hotte and a moyst co~plexio~ as a sanguine {per}son is.
For thabu~dance of ruddy fleshe wytnesseth fortitude of vertue assimilatiue and multitude of bloud ye worke and waxe by heate and moysture as witnessethe Galen sayenge: Thabundance of fleshe is enge~dred by abundance of bloud.
For heate perfectlye digestynge and the lyke vertue to fleshe makethe the fleshe faste styffe.
Also Auicen saythe: euery fleshye body without abundance of fat grece is sanguine.
Secondly the sanguine person is mery and iocunde that is to say wt mery wordes he moueth other to laugh: orels he is gladde throughe benignite of the sanguine humour {pro}uokynge a man to gladnes and iocu~dite through clere perfect spirites enge~dred of bloud.
Thyrdly he gladly hereth fables mery sportis for the same cause.
Fourthlye he is enclyned to lecherie through heate and moystnes prouokynge to carnall copulation.
Sixtlye he delyteth to fede on good meate: by reason the sanguine {per}sone desyrethe the mooste lyke to his complexion that is good wynes and good meates.
The .viij. is the sanguine persone hath a gladsome an amiable countenance through lyuelynes of colour and fairenes of co~plexion.
The .ix. is he speaketh swetelye throughe amiablenes of sanguine nature.
The .x. is he is apt to lerne any maner of science throughe lyuelynes and perspicuite of his wytte.
The .xj. is he is nat lyghtlye angry: and this cometh through moystnes abatynge the feruour of coler prouokynge to anger.
The laste .ij. verses recite some of the forsayde tokens and also some other.
Fyrste a sanguine {per}sone is free nat couetous but liberall.
Fourthly he is moste parte smylynge: of whiche all the benignite of the bloud is cause and prouoker.
For Auicen saythe that ruddy colour of the skynne signifieth abundance of bloud: And this must be vnderstande of brighte ruddy colour nat darke: suche as is wonte to be in theyr facis that drynke stronge wynes abundantlye and that vse sauces and sharpe spices: for suche colour signifieth lepre to come.
Syxtly he gladlye singethe and herethe by reason of his mery mynde.
The .viij. is he is hardy through the hete of the bloud whiche is cause of boldnes.
The .ix. is the sanguine persone is benigne and gentyl through the bounte of the sanguine humour.
Here the auctour teacheth vs to knowe a persone of colerike complexion.
Fyrst he is hasty by reason of superfluous heate that mouethe hym to hastynes.
And therfore Auicen sayth that dedes of excessiue motion signifie heate.
Secondly the colerike persone is desirous of honour and coueteth to be vppermoste and to excelle all other: by reason that su{per}fluous heate maketh ma~s mynde prone to arroga~ce and foole hardynes.
Thyrdly they lerne lyghtlye by reason of the subtilnes of the colerike humour.
And therfore Auicen saithe that the vnderstandynge promptnes and quicke agilite to intelligence betokenethe heate of complexion.
Fourthlye they eate moche: for in them the heate digestiue is stronger more resolutiue than in other bodies.
Fyftly they encresse soone through strength of naturall heate in them whiche is cause of augmentation.
The .vj. is they be stoute stomaked that is they can suffre no iniuries by reason of the heate in them.
And therfore Auicen sayth secunda .i. doctrina .iii. cap. tertio that to take euery thynge signifieth heate.
The .vij. is they be liberall to those that honour them.
The .ix. is a colerike persone is hearye by heate openynge the pores mouyng the mattier of heares to the skynne.
And therfore hit is a co~mon sayenge the colerike man is as heary as a gotte.
The .xj. is he is soone angry through his hotte nature.
And therfore Auicen sayth: ofte angry and for a cause betoketh heate through easy motion of coler and boylynge of the bloud aboute the harte.
The .xij. is he is a waster in spendyng largely to optayne honours.
The .xiij. is he is bolde: for boldnes cometh of great heate specially about the harte.
The .xv. is he is skle~der membred and nat fleshie.
Fyrst mela~coly maketh folkes shrewde and yll manered: as they that kyll them selfe.
The .ij. is great heuines: for melancolye folkes are moste parte sad through theyr melancoly spiritis troublous darke: lyke as clere spiritis make folkes gladde.
The .iij. is they talke lyttell by reason of theyr coldnes.
The .iiij. is they be studious for they couet alway to be alone.
The .v. is they are no slepers nor slepe nat well by reason of the ouer moche drines of the brayne: and through melancoly fumes they haue horrible dreames yt wake them out of theyr slepe.
The .vj. is they be stedfaste in theyr purpose and of good memorie and harde to please: and this comethe throughe theyr drines.
The .vij. is they thynke nothynge sure they alway drede through darkenes of theyr spiritis.
In the .ij. laste verses he recitethe some of ye forsayde signes and other.
Fyftly he is simple yet disceitfull: and therfore melancoly folkes are deuoute great reders fasters and kepers of abstinence.
Seuenthly he hath an erth ye browne colour: whiche colour if hit be any thinge grene signifiethe the dominion of melancolye as Rasis sayth .ij. Alman.
Est plusquam frequens plenus mollis dolor ingens Maxime fit stontis et constipatio ventris.
Here the auctour puttethe ye colours that folowe the complexions.
flematike persone is whitely coloured: the colerike is browne and tawnye: the sanguine is ruddy: the melancoly is pale colered lyke erthe.
Afterwarde the texte declareth .xij. colours signifienge superfluite of bloud.
The fyrst is whan the face is redde by ascendyng of bloud to the heed and face.
The seco~d is whan the eies bolle out farther than they were wonte.
The .iiij. is whan the bodye is all heuye: for nature can nat susteyne nor gouerne so great qua~tite of bloud.
The .vj. is wha~ the pulce is full by reaso~ of the multitude of hotte and moyst vapours.
The .vij. is whan the pulce is softe throughe to moche humidite mollifienge the mattier.
The ix. is wha~ the bealy is costife throughe great hete that drieth vp the fylthy mattier.
The .x. is wha~ the tonge is drie and rough for like cause.
The .xj. is great thyrste through drines of the stomakes mouth enge~dred of great hete.
This Auicen affirmeth sayenge Slepe that signifieth abu~dance of bloud is whan a man dreameth he seeth redde thynges: orels yt he shedeth moche of his bloud· orels that he swymmeth in bloud and suche lyke.
The .xiij. is the swetenes of spyttell throughe swetenes of bloud.
Here is to be noted that lyke as there be tokens of abundance of bloud so there be signes of the abundance of other humours as in these verses folowynge: Accusat coleram dextre dolor asper alingua.
The tokens of abundance of fleme are co~teyned in these verses folowynge.
The signes of abundance of melancoly are conteyned in these verses folowynge.
Fyrst he sheweth what age is required to be bloud lette~ sayenge: At .xvij. yere of age one may be let bloud: And touchynge this Galen saythe: that children shulde nat be let bloud oneles they be .xiiij. yere olde at lest: bicause childre~ bodies be sone resolued from outwarde heate: and therfore by voydynge of bloud they shulde be greatlye weaked.
Also for that they nede to nouryshe theyr bodies and augment them they shulde nat diminishe theyr blud.
And eke for that they be soone dissolued from outwarde heate hit suffiseth wherfore they nede nat to be let bloud.
And wittethe well that as bloud lettynge is nat conuenient for children so it is vnholsome for olde folkes as Galen saythe: For the good bloud is littell and the yll moche: and bloud lettyng draweth away the good bloud leaueth the yll as Auicen saythe: and therfore bloud lettynge is vnco~uenient for suche persones.
Of necessite with voidynge of bloud done by bloudde lettynge mans spiritis beynge in the bloud do grealye auoyde.
Thyrdlye he sheweth howe the spiritis shulde be cherished and restored: and that is by drinkynge of wyne after the bloud lettyng: For of all thynge to norishe quickely wyne is best as is before sayde.
The spiritis also be cheryshed and restored by meatis but that is nat so quickely as by wyne.
And the meate after bloud lettynge must be lyght of digestion and a great engendrer of bloud as rere egges and suche lyke.
And all thoughe meate restore the spiritis after bloud lettynge yet let ye pacientes beware of moche meate the fyrste and .ij. day.
For Isaac saythe in dietis: that they muste drynke more than eate: and yet they must drynke lesse than they dyd before bloud lettynge: for digestion is weaker.
Fourthlye the auctour putteth .xj. conueniences of bloud letty~ge duly done.
Fyrste temperate bloud lettynge comforteth the syghte: for diminishynge of humours doth eke diminishe fumynge to the heed and the repletion therof darkynge the syght.
Secondelye hit clerethe and maketh pure the mynde and brayne through the same cause.
Thyrdly it heateth the mary: for it minishethe the superfluites that therto come and cole it.
Fourthly it purgeth the entrayles: for nature vncharged of bloud digesteth better rawe humours that be lefte.
Fyftly bloud lettynge restreyneth vometyng and the laske: for hit diuerteth the humours from the interior partis to the outwarde: specially letty~ge bloud of the armes as Auicen saith: For lettyng bloud of the feet stoppeth nat so well: yet {per}chance the bloud lettynge shall augmente the laske and that .ij. wayes.
Fyrste by bloud lettynge nature is discharged of her burden: and tha~ comforted hit prouoketh other vacuations.
Secondly if the laske be caused by great weakenes of vertue contentiue: For than for that by bloud lettynge vertue is weaked the laske is augmented.
The .vj. is that blud lettyng clereth the wyttis: For it minisheth vaporation that gothe to the heed troublethe the wyttis.
The .vij. is hit helpethe one to slepe for therby many humours be voyded by whiche sharpe vapours and diuers are lyfted vp lettynge one to slepe.
The .viij. is hit takethe awaye tediousnes and ouer great grefe: for therby vertue is vnlode~ of grefe: and eke with the bloud mela~coly the dregges of bloud whiche induceth tediousnes and grefe is drawen out.
The .ix. is hit co~forteth the herynge: for therby the vapours and humours ascendinge to the heed and letty~ge the herynge are diminished.
The .x. is hit comforteth the voyce: for therby the superfluites and humidites that may come to the breaste or pype of the lyghtis and let the voyce are diminished.
The .xj. is hit augmentethe the strengthes: for therby the body is vnladen of hit grefe wherfore vertue is augmented.
Maye september aprile are the monethes of the moone: and in them are dayes forbidden to let bloud that is the fyrste of Maye and laste of september and aprile.
Thoughe this be a co~mon rule yet hit is false.
For the forsayde dayes maye be as good and worthy to be chose~ as the other after the diuersite of constellation in them.
Farther the auctour saith yt in those days none shuld eate goose fleshe: whiche also is false erronious and very witchecraft.
thynke thauctour had this sayeng of the iewes whiche obserue suche maner.
Seco~dly he saith yt men of myddell age yonge folkes whose veynes be ful of bloud may be let bloud euery mo+neth: for those may well resist resolutio~: in them is great qua~tite of good bloud.
Thyrdly he saith: that blud lettyng for mans helth must be done in one of these .iij. monthes maie septe~ber aprile. but yet with difference.
for in aprile maie the lyuer veyne muste be let bloud bicause than in vere tyme the bloud encreaseth: and in septe~ber in the splene veyne bicause of melancoly whiche than in autumpne encreaseth.
for as Galen saith: bloud lettyng cooleth augmenteth coldnes: bicause as Isaac sayth bloud is the fou~+dacion of natural hete: and in that bloud lettyng voydeth bloud hit voydeth hete so conseque~tly cooleth.
The .ij. is a feruent colde contrey vnder whiche a cold season shulde be co~prehe~ded whiche also letteth bloud lettyng: for in a cou~trey season very cold the blud is closed in the depest partis of the body: and the bloud that taryeth in the vtter partis the colde maketh thycke whiche to voyde is no wisedome.
The .iij. is ferue~t ache: vnder whi+che eke may be co~prehended great infla~mation of the body: for if one in suche accide~tis be let bloud there foloweth motion agitatiue contrarie to nature and greatter infla~mation whiche weaketh nature more.
The cause of this motion agitatiue is attractio~ to diuers partis: for by bloud lettyng attraction is caused to the place yt is let blud: by great ache attractio~ is caused to the place of ache.
The cause of greatter infla~macio~ is yt by blud let+tyng ye humors be moued wherby they be more inflamed.
And this is trouthe whan blud lettyng is lyttell artificial.
Yet if it be done tyl one swou~d hit is holsome in the forsaide cases: for this bloud lettyng whan it ouercometh the attraction of the ache: it causeth nat motion agitatiue.
like wise it taketh awaye infla~mation whan there be no humors that shuld moue hete and cause more infla~macion.
This is Galens mynde sayeng: there is no better medicine for an i~postume of ferue~t infla~mation feuers a great ache than blud lettyng.
The .iiij. is baynyng specially resolutiue: for that letteth bloud lettyng: for that were vacuatio~ vpo~ vacuatio~ whiche nature can nat esily beare.
The v. is carnall copulacion: for i~mediately ther after one shuld nat be lette~ bloud bicause of double wea+kyng of nature.
The .vi. is to olde or to yonge as it is before touched.
Of this Auicen sayth: Take hede howe thou lettest one bloud in any of the forsaid cases: outcept thou trust in the figure in soli+dite of the musculs largenes of the veynes ye fulnes of them and ruddy colour.
The .vii. is longe sicknes: for by suche letty~g of blud nature is doubly febled both by the lo~ge sickenes diminishio~.
This is of trouthe sayth Auicen outcept there be corrupt bloud for than bloud lettyng is holsome.
The .ix. is to eate to moche meate: and vnder this is co~prised meate vndigested.
The cause hereof (as Auicen sayth) is this: there be .iij. thynges that drawe to them that is voydnes hete and secrete vertue or proprete.
Than if the veynes be empty through voydyng of bloud they drawe to them fro~ the stomake or lyuer vndigested or su{per}fluous meate or drynke: whiche vndigested meate co~men to ye me~bres can nat be amended that is digested: for ye third digestion can nat amende the faute of the .ij. nor the seco~de of the fyrst: if the faute be so great yt hit can nat conuert into the me~bres: hit there remayny~g may cause some disease.
The .x. is feblenes. for bloud lettyng is a stronge voyder as Galen sayth: therfore a feble persone may nat endure great diminishyng of blud.
The .xi. is subtile sensiblenes of the stomakes mouthe: whiche is called the hart strynge: for of suche bloud lettyng foloweth easily.
And vnder this weakenes of the stomake is eke co~prised and easy flowynge of coler to ye mouthe therof endusyng vometyng.
Wherfore they yt haue the forsaid accidentes shuld nat be let bloud: for by bloud lettyng the humors moued be enduced to the stomakes mouthe as to a place accustomed: and bicause hit is a weake an impotent membre to resiste that flixe: therfore by suche lettynge of bloud many inconueniences cha~ce.
This is one cause why many swou~d wha~ they be let bloud: by reason the coler floweth to ye stomake: whiche bytynge the stomake pyneth ye hart stomake so that hit causeth one to swou~de.
The .xij. is lothyng: for if in this lothynge one be let bloud whan the veynes be empty they drawe to them yll mattier causyng lothesomnes.
And be+sides the forsaid accidentis there be other that let bloud lettyng.
First voydyng of menstruous flixe or the emeraudes: for one diseased with eyther of these shulde nat be let bloud: yet it may be done to diuert the flixe or matter.
The .ii. is rarenes of co~position: for in rare bodies is moche dissolucion: therfore this resolution suffiseth them without euacuation as Galen sayth .ix. teigni.
The .iii. is rawnes and cla~mynes of humours: for than beware of bloud lettyng bicause it encreaseth rawenes of humours: and therfore in lo~ge sickenes ye shuld nat let bloud: for rawnes of humours encre+seth strength febleth and the sickenes prolo~geth.
And therfore Auicen sayth that in longe sickenes before one is let bloub he shuld take a laxatiue al+though he nede bothe.
One is throughe abundance of humours chokyng naturall hete: whiche chokynge bredeth rawe humours and than bloud lettynge is holsome.
Wherfore Alexander sayth: Lettyng of bloud in ye begynnyng of the dropsy is holsome: whan it cometh by abu~dance of me~struous blud that through some cause is prohibited to issue: or by abu~dance of the emeraudis: For lyke as a lyttel fire is que~ched vnder a great heape of wodde: lyke wise natural hete is suffocate with abunda~ce of humours.
The .ij. cause of rawe humors is feblenes of natural hete as in folkes of feble co~plexion or that haue ben longe sycke or be very aged: for than ye said blud lettyng is vnholsome: bicause hit augmenteth rawenes: for the blud that obser+ueth hete is drawen out and so the body is made colde and the humours more rawe: Therfore the bloud must be left to digest these rawe humours.
The .iiij. is vndue disposicion of the aire eyther to hotte or to colde: for moche hete causethe stronge resolucion: and great colde maketh ye blud thicke and vnapte to issue or auoyde.
This text declareth .v. thynges that ought to be done about bloud lettyng: some before som at the tyme some after.
The first is anoyntyng whiche other while is vsed in the bloud lettyng as to anoynte the place or veyne yt is opened: to aswage the peyne: somtyme hit is vsed after blud lettyng to kepe the gashe that it close nat vp to soone that the humours left in the veynes may haue som re+spiracion and some yll fumes voyde out.
The .ij. is to dry~ke and specially wyne whiche is good in blud lettyng if one hap to swou~de: and also hit is very holsome after blud lettyng to reuiue the spirites engendre newe blud whiche thyng in practyse all phisitians obserue.
The .iij. is baynyng whiche is holsome .iij. dayes before and .iij. dayes after blud lettyng nat the same day.
Hit is good before if one thynke he haue grosse humors within hym: for baynyng leuseth moueth humors: for the said cause hit is holsome to take a sharpe syrope before to moue dissolue and make subtile the humours.
And therfore whan ye wyll let one blud ye must rubbe the arme that the humours in the veynes about may be made subtile prepa+red to issue out more esily.
Hit is holsom after blud lettynge that the residue of humours vapours left behynd may be leused.
Hit is nat holsome the same day for baynyng maketh ye skyn lynnowe whiche made lynnowe wyl nat abyde ye stroke gy+uen in blud lettyng that is da~gerous.
The .iiij. is byndynge with lynnen clothes whiche is very holsome to stop the blud after euacuation therof: before bledyng to drawe the humours to the vey+nes and to cause them to swel better to appere.
The .v. is moderate walkyng before blud lettyng to dissolue make subtile the humors: afterward to leuse the residue of the humours lefte behynde.
Here note that some vse to be let blud fastyng: but some other say hit were better to eate a rererosted egge fyrst and therto drynke a draught of wyne about the houre of .ix. or .x. before dyner and forth with to be let blud.
The cause is wha~ ye stomake is empty nature reteyneth styl ye blud more stro~g+ly lest she shuld lacke norishement: but whan one hath eate a lyttel norishyng meate as wyne egges is than nature suffreth ye blud better to issue.
The reason is this: moche mela~coly myngled with the blud causeth heuynes and moche coler causeth a~ger: whiche .ij. humors as they be myngled with the blud are drawe~ out by blud lettyng.
Thirdly hit kepeth louers from furious rauyng for it remoueth the blud fro~ ye heed auoydyng it by the other exterior partis.
Farther note that there be .v. causes of blud lettyng.
The first is that the abundance whether it be in qualite or quantite or bothe shuld be voyded.
For as Auicen sayth two maner folkes must be let blud.
One is they that be disposed to be sicke that haue abunda~ce of blud in quantite.
The other is they yt are sicke alredy through the malice of humors or blud.
For blud lettyng for the abu~dance of blud ought to be moche: but wha~ it is done to auoyde yll blud it must be moderate as Galen saythe .ix. metategni
And therfore they do very yll yt let them selfe blede tyll they {per}ceyue the good blud issue for {per}auenture all theyr blud shall ru~ne out er they se any good blud appere.
Therfore they shuld voyde a lyttel at ones: and after the mynde of Galen in this case: before they let one blud they shuld gyue hym good meates to enge~der good blud to fulfyl the place of the yl blud auoyded: and after within a lyttell space to let hym blud a lyttel and a lyttel.
This is called directe letty~g of blud: for it is done to auoyde abunda~ce of blud and of suche humors as shulde be auoyded.
The fyrst indirecte cause is the greatnes of ye disease and greatnes of the apparent vehement infla~macion: for as Gale~ saith ther is no better medicine for an i~postume of vehe+ment infla~macion feuers great ache tha~ blud lettyng.
The .ii. indirect cause is that the mattier whiche must be auoyded be drawen to place fro~ whens it must be auoyded.
And therfore in retencion of ye menstruous flixe emeraudis the great veyne in the called sophena must be opend as Galen saith to draw downe the mattier of ye blud.
The .iij. indirect cause is to drawe ye humours to the place contrary to that place that they flow to to diuert the mattier fro~ yt place.
Therfore for to moche abu~dance of me~struosite the veyne basilica must be let blud to turne the mattier to ye co~trary part and so to voyde hit fro~ hit propre course.
And therfore he yt hath a pluresie on his lyft syde must be let blud on the right side to diuert drawe the mattier to the place co~trarie to yt place that it incli+neth to.
And like wise if it be on ye right side to let blud on the lyft.
The .iiij. indirect cause is that bi lettyng of blud one portion of the mattier may be auoyded that nature may be the stronger vpon ye residue: and so lettyng of blud is holsome whan ye body is ful lest impostumes growe: for ye regime~t of nature is feble i~ regard of these humors: wherfore a portion of ye mattier is voyded lest through vnablenes of nature in gouernyng the mattier ye mattier shuld flowe to som weake place and brede an impostume.
Here thauctor sayth yt the gashe made in lettyng blud ought to be of a mean largenes that the same grosse blud may esily issue out: for whan ye gashe is straite the pure blud onely goth out and the grosse abith styl in.
And note yt somtyme the gashe must be great somtyme small.
Fyrst bicause the hu+mours be grosse and grosse blud must be voyded: as in them yt be mela~coly.
Secondly in wynter ye gashe muste be great for colde engrosseth the humours.
Thyrdly for thabu~da~ce of humours for they auoyde better by a great gashe than a small.
But the gashe must be small whan the {per}sone is of weake strengthe that the spiritis naturall hete auoyde nat to moche: and lyke wise in a hotte season and whan the blud is pure.
Thre thynges must be consydred wha~ one is let blud.
Fyrst yt he slepe nat within .vi. houres after ye fumes enge~dred by slepe asce~de to the heed hurt ye brayne.
Fyrst lest he in slepe turne hym on the arme that is let blud and therby hurt hym.
The .ii. is lest ye humours by slepe flowe to ye peynful me~bre by reason of the incision so brede an impostume.
For Gale~ saith that if impostumes brede in ye body or in a me~bre hurt: the humours flowe thervnto.
But Auicen assigneth an other cause that by suche slepe may chance co~fraction of the me~bres: The cause may be as Galen sayth that slepe is vnholsome in the ague fyt: for natural hete goth inward and ye out ward {per}tis waxe colde ye fumes remayne vnconsumed: wherby the rigour is augmented and ye feuer fyt {pro}longed.
Also by mouyng of ye humours i~ letty~g of blud fumes are reised vp to ye senowes and braunes of ye armes: whiche remaynyng vn+consumed waxe colde in slepe and ingrosse in the vtter partes.
And therfore if one slepe i~mediately after lettyng of blud they cause confraction of the senowes and braunes of tharmes.
Secondly he sayth that one in lettyng blud must beware yt he make nat ye gashe to depe lest he hurt a senowe or an arterie strynge vnder ye veyne: for hurtyng of a senowe causeth a mortal crampe or losse of a me~+bre as an arme or a fynger: and hurt of an arteri strynge causeth bledyng vncurable.
The .iiij. is one ought nat to eate i~mediatly aft he is let blud but he must tary tyll ye humors in hym be in qete lest ye meate er hit be digested be drawen together with the blud to succour the hurt membre.
Interdictus erit minutis nubilus aer. Spiritus exultat minutis luce per auras. subtile to ru~ne through out al the body outcept the matter be furious.
The .ii. is abu~dance of the for Gale~ sayth on ye aphorisme: Inchoantilus morbis. &c. yt it is than behoueful to be let blud or take a medicine laxatiue to alleuiate nature loded with abu~dance of mattier.
The .iii. is greatnes sharpenes of the sickenes as whan there is a great an acheful impostume though the mattier be lyttel.
For Gale~ sayth: if the impostume be great ye must let blud at the begynnyng though there be but lyttel mattier: lest it breke or open er it be rype: therfore to eschewe many inco~uenie~ces blud lettyng must be done.
The .ii. rule is yt blud letty~g may nat be done on the day of mocio~ of the sickenes as in crisis) nor no other vacuacion nor diuertyng of mattier fro~ the place that nature sen+deth it to.
For Galen sayth .i. aph. that wha~ the sickenes is in hit estate neyther blud lettyng nor laxatiue shulde be done: for than the matter rypeth whiche rypeth better by quietnes
The .iii. rule is yt lettyng of blud shuld nat be done in begy~nyng of the sickenes whan crisis is remoued: for Isaac saith in his boke of vrins that though the hart be the enge~drer of the blud spiritis yet the blud is fun+dacio~ of natural hete susteyneth hit: for hete is naturally therof engendred: and therfore one voy+dyng blud voydeth hete: whiche shulde digest the mattier of the sickenes: and so co~sequently the sic+kenes is prolo~ged strengthe weaked.
And therfore hit is to drede lest through lengthynge of the sickenes and weakyng of ye stre~gthe nature shuld fayle.
The .iiii. rule is that ye body hauyng dregges or filth i~ the guttis shuld nat be let blud.
The cause is: there be .iii. thy~ges yt draw to them hete emptynes all the shap: nowe the veynes e~pted by lettyng of blud dawe to them fro~ the next me~bres as the guttis stomake wherby yt bealy is indurated the mattier in the veynes more infected: the miseraike draweth the humidites of the ordeurs the ordeurs are dried the more: therfor ye must fyrst mollifie the bealy with clisters or sup+positories except it waxe laxatiue alone.
The .v. rule is That lettyng of blud shulde nat be moche vsed: for by oft vsyng therof one waxyng olde fal+leth in to dyuers diseases as epilencie apoplexie and palsey: for by remouyng of ye blud hete ma+ny flematike su{per}fluites are engendred that cause these diseases.
The .vi. rule is that a woman me~struate or with childe shuld nat be let blud.
woma~ with childe shuld nat for therby the hete that digesteth meate is and the foode of yt that she goth with taken away: specially whan it that she goth with waxeth great for tha~ it nedeth more foode.
This sayth Hippocrates .v. aph. wha~ the menstruosite kepeth due curse voydeth natu+rally inough letty~g of blud shuld nat be done but whan it voydeth to moche than to diuert the mat+tier it must be done: for nature wolde nat be let of her operacion.
The .vii. rule is that after the cole+rike passion one shuld nat be let blud: for bi reason that lettyng of blud sturreth vp the humors a colerike on the right side of the body sta~deth ye me~bre that engendreth blud that is the lyuer: and the receptacle of coler the galle.
Autu~ne enge~dreth melancoly whiche is gethered to gether nat resolued by wenter: therfore in ver~ and wynter those veynes shuld be let blud in whiche mela~coly hath dominion whiche be the lyft side veynes: for ye splen is on the lyft syde of the body whiche is the receptacle of mela~coly.
Secondly he sayth yt these .iiii. me~bres the heed the hart the fote and the lyuer after the .iiii. seasons of the yere must be empted: the hart in ver~ the lyuer in somer the heed i~ wyn+ter and the fote in autumne.
Here he toucheth .vi. co~modites that come by lettyng blud of the called saluatella hit is the veyne on the backe of ye ha~de betwene ye myddyll fynger rynge fynger.
Fyrst it purgeth ye lyuer Seco~dly it Thyrdly it mu~difieth the breast.
The reason of all these co~modites is bicause the forsayd veyne auoydeth blud fro~ al these places as after it shall appere.
For a more ample declaracion hit is to witte that in lettyng of blud other while the veynes be opend and somtyme ye arteries.
The openy~g of the arterie is da~gerous: the chiefe cause hereof is the ouermoche bledyng: whiche is caused .ii. ways.
One is through ferue~t hete of the arterie blud. for a hotte thyng is soone mouable delateth openeth ye arterie: and ther+fore hit helpeth moche to voyde ye blud in lettyng blud the arterie.
The .ii. cause is mobilite of ye arterie: and therfore the wou~de or gashe in it is slow+lier healed: for wou~des without rest can nat heale.
Yet this letty~g of blud is holsome .iii. maner wise.
Fyrst whan there is abu~da~ce of subtile blud i~ the body.
For subtile blud of whiche na+tural blud spiritis be enge~dred resteth in the arterie: but grosse blud that norisheth the me~bres resteth in the veynes.
Lyke wyse vaporous blud is co~teyned in the arterie sanguine blud in the veynes.
Also the hottest blud whiche of the harte the hottest me~bre is enge~dred digested is co~teyned in ye arterie the other i~ the veynes.
Se+co~dly note ye veynes are opend in many me~bres somtyme in ye arme or in the great ha~de or small somtyme i~ the fote nose in the forheed in the lyppes somtyme vnder the tonge or i~ the ruffe of the mouthe somtyme in the corners of the eies toward the forheed.
Fro~ the arme pyt to the elbowe are .v. veynes to be opend as Rasis Auicen say: One is called cephalica whiche is the heed veyne: the .ii. is called basilica whiche is the liuer veyne.
The .iii. is mediana or cardiana or nigra after Auicen or matrix after Rasis.
In the lesse ha~de is saluatella so that in the arme in that it co~teyneth the more and lesse ha~de are .vi. veynes to be ope~d.
Cephalica empteth the partis aboue the necke: and therfore to open hit is good for diseasis of ye heed ye megrym other hotte grefes or caused of hotte mattier.
This veyne begynneth at the shulder goth forth toward the lyft syde of the arme.
Basilica empteth the partes vnder the necke as fro~ ye breaste lyuer: and therfore lettyng blud of this veyne is holsome for diseases of the breast lyuer and right good in a pluresy.
This veyne begynneth at the arme hole and goth alo~ge to the bowyng of the arme.
Mediana is betwene these .ii. said veines is co~pact of them both: for it is ye bra~che of eche.
And it is eke median in vacuation: for it voydeth fro~ al about vnder fro~ aboue ye necke.
Wherfore it is the vniuersall veyne to all the body in voydyng: nat vniuersall (as some say) bicause it begynneth at ye but bicause it is ye bra~che of cephalica and basilica
Therfore if ye wold let cephalica blud and it appereth nat: ye shuld rather take mediana
And like wise if ye wold let basilica blud it appereth nat ye shulde rather minishe mediana than cephalica for it agreeth better to bothe than one of them with the other.
Saluatella is the veyne betwene ye myddell and rynge fynger more declynyng to ye myddell fynger.
This veyne is opend in the right ha~de for opilacion of the lyuer and in ye lyft ha~de for opilacio~ of the splene.
There is no reason why it shuld be so as Auicen sayth but experie~ce: whiche Galen fou~de by a dreame as he sayth: He had one in cure whose lyuer splene were stopte and he dreamed to let hym blud of this veyne so he dyd and cured the pacient.
This veyne is let blud puttyng ye ha~de in warme water to engros and dilate it bicause it is subtile: and yt the gashe shulde nat close to soone and to make ye grosse blud thynne.
Assellaris is vnder basilica and appereth i~ byndyng the arme: and like iugeme~t is of it as of basilica.
Funis brachii is ouer cephalica orels the hyn+dermost bone: and is of one iugeme~t with cephalica
Therfore as Auice~ Galen say though in openyng of veynes be vniuersal vacuacion of all the body: yet nat fro~ al veynes egally: nor like ieo{per}dy is nat in all.
For Rasis sayth cephalica is ye surer basilica more to be feared: and cardiaca is to feare but nat so moche as basilica.
Cephalica is surest: for there is neyther senow aboue nor dnder hit: but vnder cardiaca is a and vpper aboue it is a subtile senowe: therfore hit is to feare lest it shuld be cutte.
Basilica is ieo{per}dous: for vnder it is an artery nere a muscul.
Saluatella is nat ieo{per}dous: and therfore ye bett to open it it wold be put in warme water.
In ye fote be .iii. veynes sciatica sophena the ha~me veyne.
These be opend whan we woll draw the blud to ye lower {per}tis as in prouokyng me~struosite: and the ha~me veyne is better than sophena or sciatica for it is nerer the matrice.
Sophena draweth blud fro~ ye yard coddis matrice: and sciatica fro~ the ancles raynes and other me~bres toward mans lyft side.
sophena fro~ the matrice me~bres there about tho they be branches of one veyne.
In the myddis of the forheed is a veyne whiche is opend for old diseasis of the face as morpheu drie scurfe scabbe. for disesis of the eies: but fyrst cephalica must be minished.
There is like wise a veyne in the nose in openyng of eche the necke must be bou~de one opend after an other: by byndyng the necke they wyl better appere.
There be veynes in the lippes whiche be opend for i~postumes i~ the mouthe or go~+mes: but cephalica is first minished.
veines i~ the ruffe of the mouth ope~d auayle agaynst reu+mes flowyng to the tethe causyng them to ake.
These veynes apere playnly must be ope~d wha~ the mattier is digested.
There be veynes i~ the cor+ners of the eies toward the forhed they be ope~d for disesis of the eies cephalica fyrst minished.
Also there be veynes vnder tonge whiche are let blud for the fyrst minished.
The veynes in the be let blud for the megrym and for great heed ache.
And those be the veynes yt Galen call iuueniles the incision of whiche maketh a ma~ vnable to get chil+dren.
Also i~ the necke be veynes called guides whi+che must be opend in the begynnyng of lepre: and specially for stoppyng of the wynd pipes in the swynacy whiche letteth one to drawe his breath.
Morella cocta necnon calida{que} lauentur Here thauctor noteth .ii. thynges.
Fyrst if heedache come by to moche dry~kyng specially of wyne or of any other dry~ke yt maketh folkes dro~ke: one must drynke cold wat vpo~ it: whiche with it coldnes ingrosseth the fumes lifted vp letteth them to hurt the brayne.
The .ii. is that if the toppe of the heed or forheed be greued with to moche hete: than the tympuls shulde be moderately chafed after washed with warme water that moderwort is sodde in: for motherworte is colde and cooleth.
Quolibet in mense confert vomitus quo{que} purgat Humores nocuos stomachi lauant ambitus omnis.
Estas more cale siccat nascatur Tunc quo{que} precipue coleram dominari.
Fyrste yt moche fastynge in sommer drieth the body: for in that that somer of hit nature is hotte and drye it the humours: the whiche also be resolued by oft sweaty~g in somer: so fastyng thervpo~ drieth ye body moche more: for wha~ the humidite of meate is gone ye hete of ye body worketh on hit owne humidites drieng them vp. Wherfore Hippocrates sayth: Hu~ger is expedie~t for those yt are very moyst: for hu~ger drieth the body.
The .ii. is: that vometyng ones a moneth is holsom: for ther+by hurtfull humours conteyned in all the circute of the stomake are voyded.
To this agreeth Auice~ sayeng: Hippocrates byddeth one vomete eche moneth twyse .ii. dayes one after an other that ye ii. day may auoyde it that the fyrst day co~ude nat: this conserueth helth scouryng the stomake from fleme coler.
The stomake hath nothy~g to purge it as the guttis haue red coler.
Fyrste hit is good for heed ache caused by moyst vaporo{us} mattier ascendyng fro~ the stomake to the heed: but if heed ache come of hit owne hurt of ye brayne tha~ vometyng doth hurt tha~ {pro}fite.
Seco~dly it clereth the syght by vaporous mattier of the stamake orels nat.
The .iii. is hit doth away wamblyng in auoydyng the humour that
The .iiii. is hit comforteth the stomake in to the whiche coler is descended ye whiche corrupteth the meate.
The .v. is hit doth away lothyng or aborryng of meate.
The .vi. is hit doth away the cause that maketh one haue a luste to sharpe ponticke and sower thynges: the whiche cause of these disposicions remoued putteth awaye the effecte therof.
The .vii. is vometynge is holsome for the laske that cometh before the dropsy: for hit auoydeth the mattier of ye sayd laske and purgeth the stomake.
The .viii. is hit is holsome for the grefes in the raynes and bladder: for the mattier flowynge to these partes hit diuerteth an other way.
The .ix. is if vometyng be done by constraynt of elborie hit auoydeth the mattier wherof lepre groweth: hit amendeth the fyrst digestion that the other digestions may the better be done.
The .x. is hit maketh one to haue a good colour.
The .xi. is hit purgeth ye stomake of a humour that causeth epilencie.
The .xii. is by stronge constraynt hit remoueth a stoppynge mattier ye whiche causeth ictericie: And like wise hit auoydeth a flematike mattier whiche comonly is cause of this stoppyng.
The .xiii. is hit auoy+deth the mattier that causeth asma the whiche is a disese causy~g one to draw his breath peynfully: and eke hit comforteth the spiritall membres by whose hete the causynge asma are consumed.
The .xiiii. is hit agaynste shakyng and palsey: for hit the mattier that is cause therof.
The .xv is holsom for one that hath great blacke his lower par+tes: for hit turneth the humours away fro~ the~ce.
Al though vometyng duely wel done be cause of these co~modites: yet whan it is vnduely done hit induceth many hurtes: for it febleth the stomake and maketh it apte for mattiers to flowe into hit hurteth the breast the syght the tethe olde heed ache. &c. as Auicen sayth .iiii.i. cap. xiiii.
The .iii. thynge that is noted in the texte is that there be foure seasons of the yere ver~ somer autumpne wynter.
Ver~ in respect of other seasons is hotte and moyste though hit be temperate in it selfe as Galen sayth in his boke of complexions: wherof hit foloweth yt this season is more apte to let blud in than the other: for hit dothe more encreace humours.
And therfore in this season moderate vse of carnal copulacion te~perate mocio~ laske flixe and swette is conuenient: and like wise te~perate bathyng to diminishe replecio~.
The .iiii. is somer heteth and drieth: and therfore hit encreaseth redde coler hotte and drye.
And for this cause in somer we must fede on colde moyst meates to diminishe the feruentnes of hete and drought: and than we must absteyn from carnal copulacion whiche also drieth: and fro~ oft bathyng and be let blud seldome for like cause.
We must vse quietnes and lyt+tell mocion: for doth moyste and moche mocion dryeth season in speciall we must vse moderate drynke: for su{per}fluous drynkyng of by reason that the pores be open doth body sodaynly a colde or causethe the palsey or laxite of the membres orels sodayne dethe: From the whiche he defende vs that lyueth and reigneth eternally.

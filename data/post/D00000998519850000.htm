the conviction of noveltie and defense of antiquitie

the preface and dedication of the worke

one none of the smalest differences betwixt trueth falsitie is that trueth is able to defend it selfe onely by trueth neither doth it euer appeare so decent either in publique or priuate as in it owne naturall habit wheras on the contrarie falsitie as being of an imperfect base qualitie can not possible subsiste maintaine it selfe except it be apparelled with the furtiue robes of trueth
and therfore our diuine sauiour knowing preuiding how easilie his seruants might be deceiued by taking the one for the other that is false doctrine for true as a most prudent circumspect louing master he giues vs a speciall warning to beware of those who come vnto vs in the garments of sheepe

insinuating herby that it is the common practice of teachers preachers of false doctrine to vse false colors

to carie the badge of trueth tho they haue no trueth in them or at the least none but such as is mingled with much falsitie deceipt for the same cause he addeth of such false prophets that inwardly they ar rauenous wolues that is what soeuer out warde shew they make how soeuer they colore the matter they are not true pastors

they come not truely to feed the flock of christs but as augustin saith of the gentilicall philosophers heretiks they come to kill destroye

iuste in this manner doth it passe with the teachers establishers of the new religion in england
they veste themselues with sheeps skins in that they make profession of reformers of the church but vnder the specious pleasant color of reformation they deforme all true religion faith virtue
king henry the
altho he was not of this religion which is at this present professed practiced in england yet was hee the first that opened the way vnto it this vnder the color of reformation an yet what monster was euer more deformed then hee he was vniformiter deformiter deformis deformed meane both with in without both in bodie soule
what a rauenous wolfe was hee howe manie religious

conuents monsteries did he deforme deface destroye
what a number of religious persons did he turne to the wyde world to lead an irreligious life exposing them to the breach of their solemne vowes to god

finally what a generall libertye did he introduce both in faith manners in all sortes of people he him selfe being the master of misrule ringleader to all licentiousnes

and according to this begining his sonne successor did continue who altho his tender yeares weaknes of bodie did not permit him to imitate the vices of his father yet had he tutors protectors that were not farre behynde their old master neither in corruption of faith nor manners
whoe seeking for new euangelists in forraine countries fou~de bucer martir others whoes fingers tickled to be working in the newe haruest who coming in to the countrye finding the people generally inclined to libertie easily made their entrance into change of religion so in a shorte tyme vnder the plausible title of reforming abuses in the church they introduced a forme of religion neuer heard of in england as neither in the rest of the christian world in all particulars thus promissing christian libertie they intruded an vnchristian corruption both in doctrine lyfe making by that meanes of an ill begining in the father a worse continuation

in the sonne
which ill begining continuatio excepting that religious interruption of queene maries tyme had a yet more vnchristian progresse in the reigne of queene elisabeth who not content with the proceedings eithers of her father or brother in that nature but adding euill to euill for politique ends as not houlding her selfe crowne safe except she did first extinguish the ancient religion of the realme by reason of the knowne flawe of her title she inacted those seuere lawes against both catholike clergie laytie which haue ben still executed by her successors iltho throu the naturall clemencie of our present soueraine not in that sanguinarie manner that then they were put in practice execution

and thus haue signified in breefe the origine continuation progresse of the new professed faith in england which notobstanding it carieth with it neuer so glorious a resemblance of reformation yet is it but a new fashion framed mierly for the profit conueniencie of the inuentors to please phantasticall curious itching wits myndes inclined to libertie and so daylie altering as newe fashions in apparell vse to alter by diuine prouidence it will at leingth vanish away turne to the old fashion againe meane to the ancient religion most vniuersally euer professed

both ther in the rest of the christian world for the furtherance adnauncement of which that which here intende to proue is that the religion whose begining successe haue nowe compendiously declared as publiquely commonly professed at this day in england is no true religio but a false erroneous doctrine practice deceitfully masked disquised with the apparell of trueth on the contrarie that the present roman faith is the onely true religion as with gods assistance by my arguments against the one in fauor of the other it will appeare to the learned louers of trueth to whome cheefely consecrate these my labors as to the most ingenious ingenuous myndes

a breefe prelocution to the readers
peraduenture at the first sight of this treatise you will expect an other campian coming to chalenge you to disputation
it is true professe am a campion in religion but not a champion to prouoke you neither doe intend to persuade you in a rhetoricall manner but onely to propose vnto your ingenuous myndes mature iudgements pure trueth pure falsitie in their owne seuerall natiue habits colors as good an euill to the end that by your free election you may stretch your handes to the one leaue the other according as you shall finde your selues moued by diuineinspiration force of reason
yet not so remissely but that if anie one should require further satisfaction let him but obtaine me a safe conduct graunted by competent authoritie will not refuse to decipher the gyrogliffe of my name as euer most readie according to apostolicall aduise to render reason of the faith professe

and althou perhaps it will be iudged more sutable to my manner of proceeding deliuerie of my doctrine to haue put it in the latin tongue yet because co~sidered ther are in our countrye manie pregnant actiue wits which neuerthelesse haue smale knowledge in that

language resolued rather to publish it in the vulgar tongue to the end that all those who ar studious of trueth may be free from impediments in their search of reason
neither is it intended for euerie pedanticall bibleist but for such as in some sorte are instructed in scholastical discipline qui potest caperecapiat

and if by the grace assistance of god my arguments shall but make so much impression in the readers as onely to reduce some passionate partiall myndes in matters of religion to such a point of temper as they shall come to iudge it a thing repugnant to reason conscience that those who haue so much reason so forcible arguments for their cause should be esteemed worthy of contumelie persecution for their profession defence of the same shall neuer accounte my paines tyme ill employed
and thus comit commende you to the grace protection of christ our sauior

the first parte of the conviction containing the impvgnative argvments
the first principal argvment
and for confutation of the english religion which assume for the firste parte of my disputation beginning with the name catholike argue in this manner
all religions which are not catholike are false religions
but the religion now publiklie professed in england is not catholike
ergo the religion nowe publiklie professed in england is a false religion

in the maior conclusion of this sylogisme there is no difficultie neither can the denie them
the minor onelie is in controuersie it proue with another sylogisme in the manner following
all religions which are not vniuersall or common are not catholike
but the religion now professed in england is not vniuersall generall or common
ergo the religion now professed in england is not catholike

that the religion is not catholike which not vniuersall generall or common is demonstrated by the signification of the worde catholike which importeth vniuersallitie or generallitie according to the vse which euen our aduersaries themselues make of it who in their bibles for the latin wordes catholica translate put in english the generall epistle of iames iude
not to stand vpon the ancient authoritie of sainct augustin other fathers councels who when they speake of the true church or faith the name catholike in that same se~se as after shall appeare
and by this the maior of the second sylogisme is sufficientlie to be true
now touching the minor wit that the religion publiklie professed in england is not generall vniuersall or common likewise proue by distinguishing all the diuers

kindes of vniuersallitie which according either to philosophie or moral doctrine can be imagined by conuincing that none of them agree to the religion of england which prosecute in this manner

all vniuersallitie in religion is either in the matter or material obiect of faith or in the time place persons that professe it or els in the rule or reason which directs them in the faith profession of it
for proofe declaration of all which particulars that none of them be founde in the religion of england it is to be supposed as certaine that the worde vniuersall signifieth not onelie generallitie but also vnitie so that the thing which is vniuersall must be one in itselfe as well as common to others that which not onelie the vsuall acception of the worde doth shewe which by aristotle the rest of the philosophers both ancient moderne is commonly taken for vnum in multis that is one thing in manie or one common to manie but also the verie etymologie sounde of the same word doth plainely declare
yea the ancient fathers also affirme the same in those places where speaking of the vniuersallitie of the church in place they say the church is one and yet dispersed ouer the whole world

as doth augustin against the epistle of gaudentius
where vsing the testimonie of sainct cyprian among

words of his he relates these
vnum est origo vna vnamater foecundis successibus copiosa
she meaning the church one head one origen

one mother replemished with frutefull successes
and in the second chapter of his booke of the vnitie of the church he saith that our ancetors called the church catholike to the end they might shewe by the name it selfe that she is in whole
in like manner vincentius lyrinensis in the third ch of his booke to the vniuersallity of the church ioyneth consent or vnion
and venerable bede vpon the
chap of the canticles affirmes that the church is called catholike quia per omnes mundi partes in vnapace in vno domini timore aedificatur
that is because it is planted or built in all partes of the world in one peace one feare of god
and thus it plainely appeares that the worde catholike or vniuersall whatsoeuer els it includes yet it must of necessitie haue vnitie in that generallitie which it signifies

this being supposed as a trueth which euen our aduersaries cannot resist
proue against them first that there is no vniuersallitie in the matter or obiect of their religion with this argumentation following
all religions which are not one the same in matter or obiect which christ his apostles preached wa~te vniuersallity in obiect or matter

but the religion professed in england at this present is not one the same in obiect or matter which christ his apostles preached
ergo the religion professed in england at this present wantes vniuersalitie in obiect or matter
the maior of this sylogisme is iucluded in the supposition before declared at the least in parte graunted euen by our aduersaries as suppose it being nothing else in sense but onelie that the particular obiects or matters which a catholike or vniuersall beleeuer imbraceth by faith are one the same doctrine in euerie point which god hath reueiled the most vniuersal church proposeth to be beleeued by all persons in the vniuersal orbe
and this appeares most true especiallie if we consider that the doctrine or obiect or anie religion cannot be conceiued to be vniuersal except it be taken in this forme manner in regard that in this sorte not otherwise it attracteth or draweth vnitie fro the founder so hath the propertie of being one without which vnitie it cannot possible be one and the same in manie in which neuerthelesse the total nature or essence of vniuersalitie consists

now touching the minor or second proposition of the same sylogisme proue it in this manner first because the religion which our

saulour his apostles preached was vniformerlie indistinctlie one the same both in matter forme meane both in obiect or matter of faith in the assent of faith itselfe therefore the apostle ephes

as he affirmes there is one onelie lord or god soe doth he in the same tenor affirme there is one faith
vnus dominus vnafides meaning that faith is one as well obiect as in acte
and yet this is otherwise according to the doctrine of the english church whose professors distinguish the obiect of their faith in to fundamentals not fundamentals which diuision of theirs cannot possible stand with vnitie as both natural reason and common sense most plainelie teach and consequentlie the matter or obtect of the english faith cannot be one the same with the obiect or matter of that religion which christ his apostles deliuered to the vniuersal world in which true religion there is no parte nor partial which is not truelie and propethe fundamental to be vniformelie vniuersallie beleeued vpon for feture of eternal saluation according to that formidable commination of the supreme iudge himselfe who without anie diuision or distinction pronounceth sentence of condemnation against all such who obstinatelie erre in their assent of faith to anie matter by him

his apostles reueiled to his church by here for such proposed to

the people how smale soeuer it may seeme to bee in it owne nature or condition how necessarie or vncessarie it is in it selfe to saluation in regard that it being once deliuered for true by god who cannot lye or deceiue it is reallie inuested with the same formal reason and motiue of credibilitie which the most noble sublime obiect or matter either humane or diuine can haue that is with the infallibilitie of the prime reueiling veritie to which all faith credit is due necessarilie to be truelie intirelie adhibited vnder paine of eternal punishment

secondlie proue the same minor proposition because the obiect or matter of the religion published by our sauiour his apostles hath annexed vnto it a certaine relation or reference of vniuersalitie to all those particular persons to which it is to be preached that is to all people which were are or will be in the world till the consummation or day of iudgement which relation is grounded in the ordinance commaunde of christ himselfe to his apostles sayeing

euntes in mundum vniuersum praedicate euangelium omni creaturae
where by the wordes all creatures is vnderstanded all nations or people as sainct mathew more plainelie declares in the same passage of his gospel where thus he relates our sauiours speech
euntes docere omnes gentes
and likewise

gregorie commenting the same text giues an ingenious exposition of it to the same purpose teaching that by those wordes omni creaturae is ment all men for saith he sed omnis creaturae nomine signatur homo
and in the same place he addes an other explication of the same wordes yet more plaine cleare for this our purpose saying that by the name of euerie creature all nations also may be signified
potest etiam creaturae nomine omnis natio gentium designari
so that it is voyde of controuersie that the religion which christ his apostles preached hath this relatiue or respectiue vniuersalitie of obiect or matter of which contrarily the english religion is quite destitute in regarde that at the least for the space of
centenarie of yeares togither partely by some of the pretended reformers partely by euidence of fact it is conuinced not to haue ben preached in anie parte or partial of the vniuersal world in all points as it is now professed in our english nation
a matter so cleare manifest by the testimonie of all histories both of those former times ours that neuer heard of anic of the professors of it who either in writing or priuate discourses or publike sermons hath absolutelie auerred it to haue ben preached without interruption euer since the time of christ his apostles

and thence it proceeds that for the auoiding the force of this or the like probation conceiue not what other refuge they can haue then to say that notobstanding the obiect or matter of their religion neyther is at this present nor hath ben in all precedent ages taught or preached yet that in respect their religion is the same which was preached by the apostles their successors in the first fiue hundreth yeares after the lawe of christ it may be tearmed vniuersal in obiect or matter euen at this present especiallie supposing it is not the multitude of beleeuers which makes the obiect or matter of religion vniuersal but the totalitie or latitude of the doctrine it selfe as being in all points the same which christ deleuered to his apostles to be preached to all nations

but to this replye it is no solution but a miere cuasion of the former argument
yet confesse that if it were true and solid the pretended reformers had reason to applaude it as a most compendious and easie course for the maintaining of their new religion
but the trueth is that this can not stand in vnitie with the doctrine faith which our sauior deliuered to his apostles they to the rest of the world which was not to continue onelie for some monethes or yeares but vntil the verie or consumation of the world
and

therefore christ our sauior to those wordes of the text of sainct mathewe euntes docete geutes going teach yee all nationes presentlie for conclusion of his speech he added centes eos seruare omnia quaeeumque mandaui ecce ego vobiscum sum omnibus vsque ad consummationem seculi teaching them to obserue althings which haue commaunded you behold am with you all dayes to the consumation of the world
in which wordes is included not onelie vniuersalitie of but also perpetuall continuation of time supposing it was vnnecessarie for christ to haue promised his contiuual assistance to his apostles except the religion which he deliuered vnto them had ben necessarily to be perpetuallie preached in all times without interruption euen till the day of iudgement in which respect it implyes that relation of which my former argument

and to this ioyne secondlie that the other of the maintainers of the english faith enterprise the defence of the visibilitie of there religion in all ages are yet farther out square then the other
in regarde by this eanes they enter in to a taske which as the of their tryall in that particular alreadie giuen experience they will be able to performe
by all which it is

euidentlie appeares that the english religion hath no such relation or respect vnto all future times intrinsecallie included in it obiect or matter or if anie reference it had it was of such temporarie smale continuance that it quite lost it by the way in all that vaste space of time which passed betweene the popedome of sainct gregorie the apostacie of martin luther

thirdly yet farther adde that the defenders of the english faith assume false abuse their hearers when they so commonly affirme that their religion is the same which was taught preached by christ his apostles which proue because it doth not indeed agree in all particulars with the obiect matter of the faith doctrine which christ his apostles published to the world as manifestly appeares by comparing some seuerall points of them both conferring the one with the other
for where can the nouelistis finde either in the scripture fathers or authenticall historie that christ his apostles taught that those onely bookes of scripture ar canonicall which the church of england holdes for such or that christians ar iustified by that faith onely by which they beleeue their sinnes are remitted the iustice of christ applyed vnto them by the faith same that euerie one in particular is bounde so to beleeue that

this faith onely is necessarie sufficient to saluation or wher doe they finde that christ his apostles preached that the onely written worde is necessarie sufficient to saluation where doe they reade in scripture or fathers that the visible church planted by christ increased by the preaching of the apostles continuated by a disinterrupted succession of pastors can erre in faith that ther is no purgatorie nor place of satisfaction either in this world or the next for lesser sinnes or the paine due to greater or that in the sacrament of eucharist the bodie bloud of christ at not contained receiued other wise then figuratiuely by faith a lone knowe they can shewe vs none of these seuerall propositions either in scriptures or doctors of the church or by anie authenticall historie or relation that the same haue ben taught by christ or his apostles
am assured that all they can performe in this case is to produce certaine textes of scripture which to the ignorant sorte of people may seeme to haue resemblance with those their positions but none soe plaine that without detortion of either sense or wordes or both or without their owne fallatious illations consequences can possible containe anie such doctrine
for example for their solifidian iustification or their iustification by faith

onely they alledge diuers passages out of the epistles of paule as that man is not iustified by the workes of the lawe but by faith that faith is reputed to iustice yet none of those shewe that faith onely iustifies much lesse doe they mention or insinuate that peculiar faith of remission of their sinnes by which the professors of the english religion beleeue they ar iustified that which is euidently convinced by the tenor of the texts then selues in which neither of the partes of the former position is contained but added by the expesitions glosses of those who violently drawe the scripturs to their peruerse purpose
and the like practice of the nouellists may easily be discouered to be vsed in the rest of the seuerall propositions aboue rehearsed in bellarmin other catholike controuertists who professedly confute the newe doctrine of the sectaries of this present age to whom remit the reader for more exact discussion of the same supposing this place is vncapable of more large proceeding

and hence it appeares that the professors of the english faith must needes confesse that according to the premisses here breefely declared confirmed the matter obiect of their religion doth not agree with that doctrine which christ his apostles planted published which is the minor proposition

of my second silogisme aboue propunded the verie same here intend to conuince
and now to the confirmation of the instance responde graunt the multitude of beleeuers doth not cause formally constitute vniuersallitie in theobiect of religion neuerthelesse if comparing one religion wit an other it is discouered to be apparently certaine that the one hath euer had a greater multitude of professors in all tymes places since the first fondation of the true faith then the other yea that the one hath had a greater number of faithfull persons for manie ages together when as the one had none at all in this case say it is manifest that the multitude of beleeuers doth euidently argue the religion so beleeued professed to be no other but that same religion which was first founded by christ our sauior with his promisse of perpetuall visibilitie cantinuation with multiplicitie of faithfull people consequently that it onely hath vniuersallitie in matter obiect that on the contrarie the other religion which can shew no such multitude of professors but is notoriously defectiue in this particular hath not anie vniuersallitie at all in the seuerall points of doctrine which it teacheth them to beleeue
and now this may suffice to demonstrate that ther is no vniuersallitie to be founde in the obiect or matter of the english religio

the second kinde of vniuersallitie of religion is in tyme which proue not to be had in the english religion in the forme following
that religion wantes true vniuersallitie of tyme which hath not ben visibly extant in all tymes since the true religion was first founded
but the religion of england hath not ben visibly extant in all tymes since the first foundation of true religion
therfore the religion of england wantes true vniuersallitie of time
the maior is most certaine maintained by many of the professors of the english faith if not by all
yet because they are not wholely vnited in this point as farre as can perceiue by their doctrine because of those whoe maintaine the visibilitie of the church fewe or none of them graunt that the church hath ben alwayes since the times of christ so visible as the romanists hould it to haue ben that is with visible pastors teachers and a visible flock or congregation of people assignable in all ages and times therefore will proue it first by plaine texts of scripture then by authoritie of ancient fathers first that the true church is absolutely visible then that it is perpetually visible

the absolute visibilitie of the church is

in all those places of scripture which speake of the church as of a knowne congregation or companie of people as math

the
tell the church
luc
confirme thy brothers

feede my sheepe

pet

feed the flocke god which is among you
paul
cor
that he himselfe did persecute the church
and most commonly his epistles are directed the churches as to the church of rome corinth ephesus
and finally ther is scarce mention of the church in the whole bible wher the visibilitie of the same is not plainely signified therefore it is compared to a citie vpon a mountaine math


according to the exposition of that place made by augustin in his booke of the vnitie of the church the

chapter
of which inuisibilitie ther are likewise plaine texts in the second chapter of isaias the fourth of micheas where conformable to the cited wordes of math the woe prophets affirme that ther will be in the latter dayes a mount aine prepared the house of god
which wordes sainct augustin most perspicuously interprets of the church of christ

also ther is a verie pregnant place to this putpose the
of isai where speaking of the people of god the prophet saith all that shall see them shall know them to be the seed which god hath blessed

which wordes christ himselfe in the fourth of luke doth plainely insinuate

to be meant of his church in regarde he applies some of the precedent words of the same chapter of isaie to himselfe the propagatior of the same church by his preaching

and according to these the like phrase of scripture the ancient fathers doe commonly speake of the christian church
augustin in his second booke against cresconius saith thus
extat ecclesia cuncta clara atque perspicua

quippe ciuitas quae abscondi non potest supra montem constituta
the church is all cleare perspicuous as being a citie which cannot hiden be placed vpon a mountaine
and chrysostome in fourth homilie vpon the
chap of isaias hath that memorable sentence
facilius est solem extingui quam ecclesiam obscurari
the sunne more easily be extinguished then the church obscured

could alledge most plaine words to same purpose out of the rest of the ancient doctors but because those twoe alone are of segreat authoritie that they ought to satisfie vnpartiall iudgement in matter of testification of the sense doctrine of ancient time touching this point therefore esteemed supersluous to produce their seuerall sentences

perhaps some of our aduersaries will say the doe not denie but both scriptures and father doe teach in generall that the church is visible

yet they denie that scriptures fathers reach that it must necessarily be visible in all ages times but rather that like vnto the noone it suffers eclypses and defects by perseeution or by other meanes

to this which is a miere voluntarie euasion as anie one of iudgement may easily perceiue answer first that supposing both the sentences of scriptures fathers of the visibilitie of the church are generall absolute without limitation it is manifestly conuinced that their meaning could not be that the church is visible onely for a time or at certaine times and not perpetually by reason that according to common rule of interpretation generall wordes are to be vnderstood properly with their extension as long as noe inconuenie~ce followes thereof as certaine it is apparent that none can followe of the continuall of the church wheras on the contrarie both manie great in conueniences insue of the want of the same as after shall be neither can anie one place either of scripture or fathers be produced by the opposers of this doctrine in which anie such limitation of the sentences of the fathers is contained either wordes or sense or in anie other sorte so as by the generalitie of the foresaid phrases of scripture ancient doctors all is excluded

secondly impugne the same euasion for that if it be once graunted that the church is not alwayes visible then it followes that in the times of the inuisibilitie of the same there are no visible pastors nor preachers to minister the true word sacraments to the people yea that there are no such people in the world consequently that thereis noe church either visible or inuisible by reason that a church whether we feigne it to be visible or inuisible essentially consists of people which people are in like manner essentially visible as muchas corporall nor can they if they would be visible except it be either by miracle or else by arte magique or some such vnlawfull meanes
nay more if they were once inuisible either by miracles arte or nature how can it be knowne but by ther owne testimonie that they euer were truely extant to which neuerthelesse noe man can prudently giue credit especially in a matter of such importance

and thus we see that out of this one of the want of visibilitie in the church a thousand others doe followe as that ther are vivisible pastors vet inuisible that ther are visible people yet inuisible that ther is a church yet noe church
and if our say ther are true pastors true faithfull people a true church that ther wants onely a true profession of faith in the pastors people

church
then replie first it is manifest that if ther be no prefession of faith in neither pastors people nor anie parte of the church then can it not possible be a true church or the church of the predestinate as they will haue it but a congregation onely or companie of timerous cowardly people which dare not professe their faith

consequently not the church of christ in which not faith onely but also profession of faith is necessarie to saluation according to the doctrine of the apostle saying that with the hart we beleeue vnto iustice

but with the mouth coufesion is made to saluation

and howbeit conceiue that the defenders of the inuisibilitie may instance say that profession of faith is not required to the essence of the true church by consequence that it may subsist with internall faith onelie neuerthelesse reioyne to this that althou should grant profession of faith in metaphisical rigor to be no essentiall parte of the true church yet is it so necessarilie annexed to the true church as it neither is nor euer will be founde without professors neither is there anie authority either of scriptures or fathers whereby it can be proued that anie such true church euer were or euer will be co~sisting of internall faith onelie
but all those places which haue aboue alledged both of the absolute visibilitie of the church necessitie of profession of

faith to saluation required by the ordinance commaundement of christ manifestlie convince the contrarie
well may our aduersaries out of their accustomed temeritie spirit of contradiction against the roman church because they haue no other meanes to maintaine the subsistance of their owne new congregation affirme teach that internall faith alone without profession makes a true church yet no iudicious man will euer be persuaded but that position is assumed by them mierlie for the aduantage of their owne ill cause which without the vse of it or some such other of like nature cannot possible be defended in the controuersie whether the true church be ours or theirs
to omit that if no externall profession of faith be required to the true church it is impossible to conceiue how anie man could euer come to knowe that such a church as consisteth of internall faith onely was euer extant in the world any in parte of time since it was once planted established by our sauior his apostles
and yet admit that it is not wholely impossible to conceiue the possibilitie of a true church without the attribute of externall profession yet this is but a metaphisicall case grounded onelie in the discourse of him who so conceiueth it by consequence it is not secure for anie man to venture his saluation vpon it as being either plainelie false in it selfe

or at the least verie subiect to error but euerie prudent man ought rather to followe the tenor of speach of the scripture fathers in the places before alledged particularlie the sentence of sainct augustin in the
chapter of his
booke against faustus

where he affirmes that men cannot be congregated or assembled together vnder one name of religion vnlesse they be tyed together with some consorte or socictie of visible signes or sacraments in which wordes althou he makes no expresse mention of profession of faith as required to a church yet doth he in effect affirme the same in other wordes teaching the communication of sacraments to be necessarie to the constitution of a church which communication of sacraments is profession of faith in one of the highest degrees as no man can denie

and now hauing sufficientlie confuted the foresaid euasion of our aduersaties touching the visibilitie will yet further adde positiue proofes of the perpetuitie of the visible church

first therefore proue it by those places of scripture which affirme that the church of christ shall neuer perish as math the

the portes of hell shall not preuaile against it
where we see the prophecie promisse of our sauior touching the perpetuitie of his church is generall without limitation of time he

speakes here of the same church of which those places of scripture speach which declare it to be visible which haue alreadie cited to that purpose for the aduersarie to limit these wordes to the inuisible church as if christ had meant that the gates of hell shall not preuaile against his inuisible church onelie is a miere voluntarie explication of their owne inuention repugnant both to the text itselfe reason to the text in regarde that all the words circumstances of it demonstrate that christ speakes of his visible church either onelie or cheefelie as is the gouernement of the church by sainct peter which church was to consist of men whose sinnes the same peter had power promised him to binde loose that vpon earth all which sounde nothing but things visible

now the foresaid explication of our aduerfaries is also contrarie to reason
first for that supposing christ planted such a church vpon earth in which there were to be alwayes visible pastors preachers to administere the sacraments

teach publish the gospell as the scriptures testifie and supposing he did not onelie commande vs to haue his faith but also to professe his name before men it is most absurde to imagin that he would or did not vse his prouidence in the conseruation of the same visible church in all times occasions as well

as the inuisible church if anie such he had established in the world

secondlie the same exposition is against reason in respect that by that limitation of our sauiors wordes which our aduersaries vse they giue vs to vnderstand that christ promissed much but performed little or nothing of importance in this particular
for if he assisted his church so weakelie that for the space of manie yeares together the members of it were driuen to conceile their faith which neuerthelesse he himselfe obledgeth them to professe in all occasions surelie he did not onelie come farre shorte of his promisse but also in a certaine manner contradicted himselfe deceiued them
and if for the gates of hell to haue so fare much vrged vexed the church as to haue all the members thereof with a bare secret dissembling faith onely without anie professing or vse of sacraments for the space of manie succeeding ages is not absolutelie to haue preuailed against it consequentlie that christs wordes are falsified then certainelie neither had they ben falsified in case hell gates had so farre preuailed as quite to extinguish euen the professors themselues yea by an impossibilitie to haueleft faith alone hanging vpon the hedges for want of other subiect all which sequels being most absurde yet consequent to our aduersaries glosse vpon the

wordes of scriptures aboue cited they euidentlie argue the falsitie of that their construction

an other pregnant place for the perpetuall continuation of the visible church is that of the to the ephesians where the apostle saith that christ appointed pastors ad consummationem sanctorum occurramus omnes in virum perfectum
that is he appointed some bishops other pastors others doctors
to the consummation of the saints till we meet all into the vnitie of faith into aperfect man that is vntill the day of iudgement
vpon which place sainct augustin in his booke of the citie hath large discourses to this purpose in the

chapters
and the trueth is that christ himselfe hauing in this speciall manner designed such persons for gouernors teachers in his church till the end of the world doubtlesse his meaning was not that they should be such dumme dogs as the establishers of the inuisibilitie doe affirme them to haue ben in their imaginarie church for a long time together but his diuine will pleasure was they should be custodes ierusalem qui tota die tota nocte non tacebunt in perpetuum
that is christ would haue them such watchmen or keepers of ierusalem that is to say the church as shall not be silent till the end of the world in no time nor vpon anie occasion

which perpetuitie of the visible gouernement of the church is grounded in the perfection of christs diuine prouidence mercie towardes the members thereof for whome of his infinitie goodnes he pleased to haue the way to saluation continuallie open which otherwise if the true church had ben at anie time hidden or inuisible as at the least some of those against whome nowe dispute will haue it then it could not possible haue ben so yea manie thousands or rather millions of men had liued dyed out of the state of saluation as being impossible for them to finde enter into the true church all that space of time in which it is feigned by them to haue remained inuisible or out of knowledge

and thus much for the impugnation of that parte of our aduersaries which defeds that the true church is not perpetuallie or in all differences of times visible the absurditie of which doctrine diuers of the defenders of the english church of later standing aduertiseing also because they find it not so plausible to their auditors as they could wish they haue ventured vpon another course indeuoring to shewo that the same church religion which is now established in england hath ben alwayes visible in the world from the time of christ his apostles euen till this present which manner of proceeding of theirs altho it is much

more difficult hard to be defended then the other now confuted that by this meanes the maintainers of it doe but incidere in syllam that is by auoyding of one incouenience they fall in to a greater yet because they persuade themselues they come nearer to the marke of prouing their church to be catholike in this respect as well as the roman church hath euer ben which indeed they might performe if they were able truelie to proue their visibilitie therfore will breefelie demonstrate that they haue no such visibilitie as is necessarie to the constirution of the true catholike church as they pretend

wherefore to come to the purpose the more clearelie to conuince my intent frame this sylogisme against the visibilitie of their church
that church wantes perpetuall visibilitie which cannot produce some visible professors of their doctrine in all points in all ages since the time of the apostles till this present
but the church of england cannot produce some visible professors of their doctrine in all points ages since the tyme of the apostles to this present
therfore the church of england wantes perpetuall visibilitie
the maior is not denyed by our aduersaries the minor hath all the difficultie that proue

and inprimis that the defenders of the english faith can produce no scripture for this point is most certaine and euident for that this is onelie a matter of fact which succeeded since the scriptures were published
by occasion of which the reader may note that those professors of the english religion who in this manner defende the visibilitie of their church doe not proceed consequenter to that other negatiue principle of theirs to wit that nothing is to be beleeued by faith but which is either expressely or by necessarie illation contained in the scriptures which generall rule of theirs in this case is manifestlie defectiue for that in it neither scripture nor deduction or consequence of scripture can seruo their turne in this particular

and if they replie that they can proue their visibilitie a priori by scriptures by those places which teach visibilitie in the church then say that this is not the matter now in question but a subtiltie to delude the reader for the controuersie is whether they can proue their visibilitie a posteriori that is whether they can yealde vs anie authenticall profe or testimonie whenby it may certainelie appeare that the religion now professed in england hath ben in deed perpetually visible in in all ages as the scripture fathers aboue alledged affirme the true church ought to bee otherwise they doe onely suppose their

church is the same which is described in the scripture but proue it not
neither doe we aske them to she we vs that such a church in generall ther is in the world as the scriptures doe mention but we vrge them to demonstrate that their church in particular hath the propertie or attribute of perpetuall visibilitie as the scriptures requires to be founde in the onely indiuiduall true church of christ till they can performe this they neither speake according to the sense of scriptures nor satisfie vs in our demaunde

wherfore proue the minor proposition of of the argument aboue framed because no authenticall historie can beproduced in which it is related that this religion of england now commonly ther professed beleeuing maintaining that ther ar but
bookes of canonicall scripture onely
that they ar to be expounded by the spirit of euerie priuat person
that man is iustified by faith onely
that ther ar onely two sacraments instituted by christ
that the bodie of christ is giuen receiued eaten in the sacrament in a spirituall manner that is by faith onely finally say that for testimonie of that these diuers others of the
articles of the english religion haue ben taught or preached in all ages since the tyme of christ his apostles in anie kingdome prouince towne or yet in anie one corner of

the whole world tho neuer so abscure ther is not extant anie kinde of recorde and therfore it is incredible in the highest degree that anie professors of it can be produced in euerie seuerall age since the foundation of the true church of christ for that if anie such had ben in anie tyme or place for so long a space together it is as certaine as it is certaine ther hath ben in all that successe of tyme sunne moone starres in the firmament or fishes in the sea that some writer or other would haue made mention of the same
and if historiographers be so curious exact in this nature that ther was neuer anie conuenticle of sectaries so smale or obscure but it hath ben noted related by some of them much lesse could such a church as our english nouellists pretend theirs to be haue lurked so closse as that no mention of it should be founde in histories or recordes of former ages before the daies of luther
it is not absolutely impossible to co~ceiue that christ might haue established an inuisible church in this world at the least for a tyme but that he should haue ordained his church with pertetuitie of visible pastors yet that neither their names seates parishes or any other monument of them either dead or aliue can be produced to make it visibly appeare that they were professors in all points of the same religion which now is professed in england

this say is aboue all admiration neither can it possible seeme credible to anie sounde vndestanding on mature iudgment

secondly proue the same minor for that diuers of our english aluersaries hauing of late vsed the vttermost of their power industrie in this particular yet haue they not come neare the performance of their purposes but in lieu of produceing professors of their religion in the seuerall ages of the church they cast in to their catalogue either such as haue ben flatly against them in diuers points in which they differ from the roman church or such as haue ben condemned for heretikes in tymes past that partely euen for doctrine co~trarie to some of the articles of the english faith as appeares for example in wiclef hus

of which the first defended that more confidence is to be placed in mans owne proper merites then in humble prayer that a preist in mortall sinne ca~not validly baptize that for ecclesiasticall persons to haue possessiones is contrarie to scripture
the second the reall presence nor merit
or els those whom the defe~ders of the english faith dusigne for members of the same were such as because they speake some thing doubtfully in onely some one point of the roman doctrine of which rake is presbiter bertrame they in their list as if they were wholely intyrely theirs
notobstanding

they are knowne to be quite apposite vnto them in all the rest of their faith profession
the which how pore inconsiderate a shifte it is the iudicious reader will presently perceiue condeme their weake false proceeding

lastely for confirmation of the of euer prouing the perpetuall visibilitie of church of england it may be added that king iames who was the greatest most defender of the newe religion that writ as it seemes considering better this then others that follow him was so warie circumspect that he would neuer cast into this most dangerous gulfe as by his monitorie in which altho his whole drift was to proue his owne church to the true church of christ yet did he make expresse mentio of the visible church more of the inuisible but onely proceedes generall termes without distinction as it impossible to maintaine the visibitie of it in all former tymes ages for which ason he prudently declined that

and in deed the trueth is that who soeuer he that shall vndertake the taske of prouing visibilitie in anie of the pretensiue formed churches will be no more able to it then an infant were able to rowle stone or accomplish the labors of

hercules
whence it is consequent that aduersaries what soeuer they pretend want vniuersalitie of tyme in their church whether they defend it to be visible or insible which is that same which the maior minor of my second sylogisme aboue proposed doe affirme which may suffice for parte of the discourse here prosecute

now touching the other twoe kyndes vniuersallitie to wit of place persons they ar so annexed one to the other that they morally speaking either all one or at the lease out of the negation of the one is necessarity inferred the nagation of the other
for example if it be true that the religion of england neither is nor was in euerie place of the world it thence infallibly falloweth that it neither nor was in all persons of the world as in like manner it also followes that if it was not for manie ages together in anie place of the world it is also manifest it was not for the same of tyme in anie person in the world by reason of this connexion betwixt the vniuersallitie of place persons will treate of both vnder the name of place supposing for certaine that whatsoeuer defect of vniuersallitie of place shall be discouered in the english religion the same defect is found to be they muersallitie of persons professors of it and here also giue the reader notice by

way that when the romanists exact of their onely to produce some professors their religion in euerie seuerall age they no smale fauor towardes them in that of proceeding in regarde that to conuince church to haue ben perpetually visible speaking they ought not onely to out some few persons of anie sorte of what soeuer but they ar obledged in to shew a perfect order or ierarchie of persons to haue ben continually their church for that both the visible church of christ was so planted in the world him selfe also progated by his apostles more ouer because the romanists defacto shewe the same to haue ben perpetually in church religion which they professe is in that church of which haue euer ben or cheefe pastors the popes of rome continuall ininterrupted succession from
peter who was the first bishop pope of most famous seat

now this being supposed proue ther is no of place in the church of by this silogisme following
ther wants vniuersallitie of place in that religion which in all points of it doctrine is nor euer hath ben preached or in all or most places of the world

but the religion of england in all points

of it doctrine neither is nor euer hath preached or professed in all or most places the world

ergo the religion of england hath no of place

proue the maior first by the or prime signification of the word which as haue alreadie aboue declared importeth one in manie or rather one in all appeareth in humane nature abstracted which is not onely one the same in manie also participated in euerie particular or indiuiduall person
and altho it is true that vniuersallitie of religion as being onely a morall matter can not be vnderstood with so much metaphisicall rigor as in naturall things it vseth to be taken yet for the verification of such generall sentences as we finde both in scripture fathers it must of necessitie be accepted with as great latitude as morally can be imagined for example if ther be anie doctrine in the world which for the space of almost
hundreth yeares neither is nor hath ben preached taught or professed in either all or at the least in most places of the world then doubtlesse can that vniuersall proposition of the into all the earth hath the sou~de of them gone forth that of augustin
she the church is like vnto a vine diffused or spred in euer place neuer be truely verified of it consequently

such a doctrine can not be truely said haue such vniuersalitie in it as scripture require to the onely true religion in reason can not be iudged lesse then in all the for said great number of yeares is at present or hath ben in times preached professed generally at the least the greater parte of the world if not in euerie therof

and touching the vniuersalitie of persons as declared before is either included or connected to the vniuersalitie of it is a matter so cleare apparent that is not to be founde in the english religion for the time paste or present that euen cheefe of the professors of it dare not it to be vniuersal in that nature as is by the authoritie of king iames himselfe salomon of their sect
whoe althou he much in his booke to christian princes persuade them he defendes no other then catholike faith yet in the end of the same is forced to confesse that notobstanding he cludes in the number all the professors of the reformation euen in other countries gge ragge yet they doe nor by much to so manie as professe the contrarie is the catholike roman doctrine preached practised in so manie nations places of the of the vniuersal

orbe
in so much that if anie of our aduersari were so impudent as to conteste or to so plaine a trueth regina austri meane euen the infidels iewes will be readie to rise proteste against him in the day of iudgement

by which and the rest haue deliuered it is clearely consequent that the english religion especially if it be intended as it is singular different in diuers points from the rest of the pretensiue reformed congregations cannot possible with anie coulor of trueth be named catholike or vniuersal in number of persons supposing that according to the doctrine of fathers the common acception of the worde among christians this appellation or sacred surname agrees onely to that christian religion which hath generalitie of persons as well as of tyme place obiect or matter which generalitie ca~not possibly be conceiued but in order or with relation to the greater nu~ber of beleeuing professing christia~s as being quite repugnant to reason that the lesser parte of a anie multitude or total number should be named either general or common much lesse reason ther is it should obtaine the most ample and vaste denomination of vniuersal especially where both parties are extant remaine in the same present time

but perhaps our aduersaries will say that to

verifying of those the like generall of scripture fathers it is not necessarie the true religion either is or hath ben alreadie diffused ouer all or most partes of the world but it is sufficient that it will be preached in all or most places before the end of the world so altho this hath not ben verified in the english religion as yet neuer the lesse it will be so extended in the tyme to come

to this replie that altho ther is some varietie among diuines the sense of the place cited some other places of scripture to the same purpose to wit whether they be vnderstood of the apostles onely or of them their successors

as also whether they signifie the tyme present or future finally whether they be verified in all rigor or onely in a common morall manner neuerthelesse finde they all agree in that the church of christ hath ben alreadie so farre extended either by the apostles them selues or at least by them their successors that it may be truely affirmed to haue ben lo~g since diuulged planted in the whole world defacto not in power or virtually onely euen according to the sense of the foresaid wordes other places of scripture which speake in the future tense as appeareth plainely by the wordes of paule in his first chapter to the colossians wher he affirmes that euen in his tyme the gospell was come vnto

hem also it is saith he in the vniuersall world doth fructifie increasens it doth in them
which words say are so cleare that ther is no place of tergiuersation or replie in this particular but that according to them it must of necessitie be graunted by our aduersaries except they will plainely contradict paul the scriptures that the foresaid extention of the faith of christ doth not expect the time to come but is alreadie made as much as serueth for explicating verifying of the same paul to the romans before related whose words in my iudgment are manifestly at the least in a cheefe parte to be vnderstood in the present tense by those otherwords of himselfe in the epistle to the collossenses eue now by me related which doubtlesse co~taine a plaine expositio of the former as appeares by the comentarie of chrysostome vpon them saying of the church of christ
adest vbique suporat vbique praestat vbique

and altho am not ignora~t that both ancient fathers moderne diuines teach that as hierome speakes vpon those wordes
pr dicabitur euangelium hoc in vniuerso mundo the complement or conclusion of the preaching of the gospell in euerie place shall not be performed before the consummation of the world as being a precedent signe therof neuerthelesse as this is true in it selfe so

it in no respect speaking absolutely contrarie to the vniuersalitie of the church which at this present is in times past hath euer ben as is euidently conuinced by the writings of the same ancient fathers moderne diuines who most frequently teach that the true church of christ was sufficiently spred in the world to make it vniuersall eue in their owne primatiue ages as their wordes by me rehearsed in diuers places of this treatise clearely testifie who also if they had liued in these present dayes might with farre greater reason haue affirmed the same of the roma church in which then owne bookes manifeste them to haue liued as partes members being nowe much more extended then at that time it was

and certainely for the defenders of the church of england to imagin that their religion hath not ben vniuersall in the world yet that hereafter it will be vniuersall before the end of the world is both voyde of probabilitie ridiculous

first because it is the nature of true religion to bring zeale feruor with it especially in the begining as appeareth in the apostles their successors in the first ages who not obstanding all the impediments that the deuill by humane wit malice could contriue yet they extend propagate the faith of christ in diuers nations kingdomes both remote barbarous

wherefore if the religion of england had ben the true faith of christ doubtlesse it would by the professors of it haue ben long since so extended dilated that it should not need to be brought to those streits as to fetch their vniuersalitie from the verie end of the world

secondly because the nature of the religion of england is such that it hath no conuenient meanes for propagation of itselfe in the whole world inregard that those to whome the charge of preaching teach the same is committed are me that are all either actually tyed to wiues children posteritie or els liue in expection desire of those temporall or transitorie commodities scarce euer dreame of extending their religion farther then their owne seuerall parishes yea their doctrine it selfe teaches them that either they must all marie of necessitie as some of them maintaine or at the least that it is more expedient secure for them to marie then to lead a single life supposing which particulars it is morally vnpossible for them euer to preach their faith to all nations as christ commaundeth with such clogges at their heeles as are wife children posteritie

thirdlie it is certainelie knowne that since the religion of england was established in the forme manner that now it is in the professors of it neuer went to ante foren nation purposely

to preach their faith much lesse haue they euer taken anie generall course for the conuersion of infidels by anie mission of ministers or by other meanes
or if anie of them haue trauelled into strange countries which are knowne to be verie fewe in number it hath ben onelie or cheefely for temporall respects as for that they haue ben silenced in their owne countrie for preaching some extrauagant errours or els for some other crime or publike offence committed or perhaps some pore vnbenificed ignorant threedbare fellowes who for want of meanes to maintaine themselues resolue desperatelie to trye their fortune in an other place onelie for that respect not for charitie or zeale of reduceing people to christian religion
and if perhaps they finde anie pore blackamore or other barbarian that heareing the name of christians desires to be of their religion yet these false apostles proceed so superficiallie with them giue them so smale ill instruction that it is to be feared that after they haue baptized them on their fashion they still remaine as black as they were before both in bodie soule
nay their deuotion is so could in this nature that they themselues are ashamed either to write or to brag of it as experience doth teach for that there is not anie booke extant that could heare of in which it may appeare that they

haue performed anie notable matter in this particular

whereas yet on the contrarie histories are full of the infinit number of infidels which the professors of the roman church haue conuerted dayly conuert to the christian faith both in the oriental occidental indies other places that with losse of their liues whatsoeuer other comodities they haue in this world as is manifest especiallie in the foure orders of mendicants the iesuits who not obstanding innumerable difficulties still continue their annuall missions ordained to that same end purpose of propagating catholike religion in all countries nations

lastelie say that for the professors of the english faith to say that their religion will be extended thro the whole world before the day of iudgement is mierlie their owne prediction to which no man of mature iudgement ought to giue credit except they first proue themselues to be true prophets which in my opinion they can no more performe then they can proue the descent of their pedegree from sainct michael the archangell
and thus wesee plainelie that the english religion as now it is professed being destitute of all meanes to propagate it self as hitherto it neither is nor euer was vniuersall in the world so neither can it be imagined with anie probable coulour of reason that euer it can possible in future

times come to be spred ouer all the nations of the whole world as according to scriptures fathers the true church ought to be the mator of my former sylogisme doth affirme
and not to insiste anie longer in this matter in like manner proue the minor proposition of the same argument by the same reasons which haue vsed for the proofe of the foresaid mator which if they be duelie applied to the english religion they will plainelie demonstrate that the religion of england neither hath ben is nor euer will be preached published in all partes of the world consequentlie that it hath not vniuersallitie of place which is that which the conclusion of the argument doth containe

it is true further conceiue that the professors of the english faith as men disposed to cauille may yet once againe replie say that in regarde their religion is the same with the religion of the apostles therefore it hath the same vniuersallitie which the apostolicall religion hath
but to this reioyne anser firste that haue shewed before that the religion now prosessed in england doth differ in diuers points from the faith of the apostles the particulars of which difference haue before specified as is that of iustification by faith onelie the deny all of the reall presence the rest

secondlie say that this replie is that kinde of absurditie in disputation which the logitia~s call petitio principij that is when that is assumed by the disputant for a true certaine principle which ought to be proued as being the verie matter in question so this is onelie an euasion of the aduersarie which hath no more force them his owne authoritie giues it which is none at all
and now by this that more which hath ben sayd touching the vniuersallitie of place persons it is most apparent that the english religion hath no such attribute consequentlie that it is defectiue in that nature
wherefore hence passe to the last gender or kynde of vniuersallitie which is that of the generall rule of faith of which there be two sortes the one is nothing els but the word of god as it is contained in the scriptures or diuine apostolicall traditions
the other rule is the visible church by whose authoritie we come to knowe certainely infallibly the true sense of the worde of god all those things which his diuine maiestie hath reuailed as matter of faith to be beleeued by all sortes of people or otherwise necessarie to saluation

and of these two rules which some diuide in to three or more thou in my opinion not so properlie conuenientlie the second which is the authoritie of the church is commonlie

called in the schooles regula proponens that is a rule or way by which the prime reuailing veritie or diuine authoritie which is the formall obiect foundation of supernaturall faith is immediatelie applied vnto beleeuers and altho if indeed the worde of god were so cleare that euerie one by reading the wordes of scripture or apostolicall traditions as they are sett downe in the councels or other recordes of the church could not but vnderstand them in a true vniforme sense the first of those two rules might suffice alone yet because the scriptures are obscure difficult in their vnderstanding as both themselues experience testifie also because out of the imperfection of nature mens iudgements often times disagree in matters of doctrine practice therefore besides that speachlesse rule meane in decision of matters of controuersie there was necessarie another liuing vocall rule by which the true meaning of the first prime rule which is the worde of god might so infallibly be declared vnto the as all doubts scruples excluded their mindes consciences might safely rest in euerie point of faith by it proposed without anie further question or tergiuersation

now to come to the purpose in that first foundation of faith which is the authoritie of god as he reuaileth matters to his church

without which true faith cannot stand the defenders of the english religion agree with the romanists as also they agree with them in the first of the two rules at the least so farre as concernes this controuersie that is they hould gods worde to be a rule of faith as the roman catholikes hould but the difference is in that our aduersaries will needs haue the worde of god to be the scripture onelie that interpreted by the spirit of euerie priuate person who reades it consequenter they hould this onelie for their rule proponent by which the diuine authoritie is applied to euerie point of faith in the beleeuers

whereas on the contrarie we romanists beleeue vse the authority of the most vniuersall church as the infallible applyer of gods reuailing veritie vnto vs in all matters of faith manners
and in this rule vpon which all certaintie of faith dependes quoad nos that is for as much as toucheth the beleeuers or credents here proue that the english religion wanteth this vniuersallitie as well as the rest of the obiect circumstances aboue discussed the which demonstrate in this forme of argument
that onelie proponent rule of faith his vniuersall which is one the same in all or at the least in the greater parte of beleeuers

but that which the professors of the english

religion hould for their proponent rule of faith is not one the same in all or the greater parte of beleeuers

ergo that which the professors of the english religion hould for their proponent rule of faith is not vniuersall
the maior of this sylogisme is euident by the definition of vniuersall which according to the doctrine of philosophers is one in all if it be taken in rigor of logike or as the metaphisitians vse the worde
or at the least it signifies the greater parte if it be accepted onely in a morall sense as here take it
from which declaration of the word vniuersall is collected no lesse cleare conuincent proofe of the minor proposition which affirmeth that the proponent rule of faith in the professors of the church of england is not one the same in all or yet in the greater parte of beleeuers
that which she we first because the priuate spirit of euerie professor of the english religion which is the onelie immediate rule of saith they professe to follow in matters of faith as the verie sounde of the worde doth declare is peculiar to those that haue it
not common to all therefore it cannot possible be generall or vniuersall

that the spirit by which the professors of the english religion interpret the worde of god is peculiar to some onelie not common

to all such as exteriorly professe the faith of christ it is manifest in that it neither passeth into other countries with co~formitie in all points of beleefe to all the rest of the pretended reformed churches as appeareth in the controuersie of the real presence with the lutherans the inamissibilitie of grace

the point of predestination free will with the arminians nay nor yet doth it agree with the spirit of all the inhabitants of england it selfe as both king iames doth plainely suppose wher he graunteth ther ar manie puritans in his realme besides papists protestants also experinental knowledge doth manifest the same it being certainely knowne generally confessed on all sides that those three sortes of people be not gouerned by one vniforme spirit but euerie one by their owne rule of faith the rule of the romanists being one common among them selues in all places of the world but on the contrarie the rule of the protestants puritans being diuided seuerall both in their owne countrie out of it both among themselues also from the catholikes wheresoeuer they be which diuision both from themselues others is an infallible argument that they haue no vniuersallitie in their propounding rule of saith
that which yet more plainely appeares is confirmed by a worke lately published by a protestant doctor his name doe not

remembers who describes seueral sectes of puritans or pure caluinists all different both among themselues from the english protestants
which diuersitie of sectes cannot stand without a different spirit or rule of faith

secondlie proue the spirit of the professors of the english religion is not one the same in all or the greater parte of credents because it is not that spirit by which the visible church hath ben in all times places persons successiuely gouerned without interruption ergo it is not an vniuersall spirit but onelie particular priuate
the antecedent of this argument is certaine for that if it were the same it would be founde conformable subordinate to the spirit of the greater parte of the christian churches the religion of england would be agreable to the religion of the same churches both in doctrine practice gouernement which neuer thelesse we see to be contrarie repugnant vnto them

thirdly the spirit of the maintainers of the present religion of england is not conformable to the spirit of their antecessors for aboue nine hu~dreth yeares together at the least therfore it is not vniuersall
that the spirit of the maintainers of the present religion of england is not conformable to the spirit of thir ancestors proue by the authoritie of all historiographers wirters euen the pretended reformers

them selues who haue either expressely testified or at the least not denyed but that in all this space of tyme euen vntill the dayes of king edward the sixt which is not yet a hundreth yeares the masse reall presence was generally approued the communion vnder one kynde practiced altars pictures vsed in churches with honor reuerence
purgatorie prayer to saints taught allowed finally all the points of doctrine manners betweene the romanists anglicans now controuersed were publikly professed all which neuerthelesse is at this time condemned quite renounced abandoned by the professors of the present english faith
of which both they we are eye witnesses at this day
which two things can not possible be done by one the same spirit of god in regarde they ar quite apposite co~tradictorie in them selues consequently the spirit of those who professe to tepugne to that same doctrine which they know acknowled their predecessors to haue imbraced as sound pious conformable to the worlde of god so manie former ages successiuely cannot be conceiued to be an vniuersall spirit but priuate proper to them selues

fourtly the spirit of the preachers teachers of the english religion is quite different from the spirit of the doctors writers that haue

adhered abeyed the roman church in euerie seuerall age as is manifest to those who read them compare their workes with the writings of the pretensiue reforming doctors of our tymes the doctrine of those that haue writ euen from the first centurie of yeares imediately following the apostles being sprinckled with pietie deuotion towardes the saints in heauen especially the virgin marie as their sermons homilies vpon their feasts other their workes doe testifie of which matter good store is to be founde especially in basil cyprian chrysostome hierome ambrose augustin
gregorie damacene bernard the rest of the roma diuines which haue writ euer since euen till this present tyme in whome also ther is frequent mention comendation of miracles operated by the saints their reliques none of which particulars appeare in anie of the writings of the professors of the english religion but rather in their bookes ordinarie sermons they indeuore most ernestly to persuade the people that they ought not to hearken after anie such matters but hould them either for false superstitious or at the least for idle superfluous impertinent so we clearely see by this that the spirit of the english professors is contrarie to the spirit of the whole torrent of the most learned renowned men of all ages past

euen to this present day consequently it can not be generall common or vniuersall nor a true spirit except the owners of it will condemne the contrarie spirit of the most learned iudicious pious men of all ages since the tyme of christ his apostles to haue ben false erroneous theirs onely the reight spirit of god
which is the highest degree of temeritie that can be imagined

lastely
in practice of virtue exercise of good life the spirit of the preachers teachers of the english religion now professed is disagreeable to the practice exercise of virtue of the doctors pastors of the roman church in all succeding tymes since the first foundation of the same a great parte of whose writings ar replenished with rules driections for prayer contemplation mortification of the bodie inordinate passions of the soule by fasting vse of hereclothes disciplines prostrations acts of obedience resignation of their willes to the commaunde of superiors vowes of obedience chastitie pouertie monasticall institutions solitarie life of monkes anachorites ermites other religious conuentuall men women finally with all other meames which possible could be imagined as either necessarie or conuenient for the exercise of a religious virtuous course of life
none of all which or at the least verie little is

to be founde in the bookes of the teachers of the english religion or heard in their publike sermons or priuate exhortations

and altho it is true that some of them as it seemes moued with emulation of the romanists who euen in this present age labore much in that kinde as our aduersaries cannot denie haue published some thing in the nature of prayer or deuotion yet is it in such a manner as they reduce the exercise of a christian life either to the exercise of faith onely or cheefly excluding or at the least not inducing to externall workes of pennance and mortification of the bodie
or els they proceed in such a newe fashion as being onely sutable to their owne newe principles of faith manners as neuer was heard in anie age of the world before the dayes of luther

that which doth particularly appeare in a certaine newe worke lately published intitled
the handmaid of pietie which neuerthelesse hath not one dramme of true pietie or one sparke of that spirit which hath reigned in the visible church since the the first plantation of christian religion which booke not obstansting it hath the name of a mannuall yet is it not conforme either to the mannuall of augustin or anie other euer vsed hitherto among christian people but forged in the anthors owne proper braine consisting of such

froathie spitle as fell beside the pulpit when he made his full of pedantik termes affectation as the worde supparte others as the verie first words of the title plainely testifie which are in latin to make it more admired dedicated to a falsely supposed patronesse of his religion
whome altho the world did winne for a smale time yet it neuer peruerted her noble constant iudgement whoe now hath returned to her ancient home with farre greater glorie vnto it then it lost by her absence

and that which is more vntolerable the profane minister with his feruor deuotion he now then mingleth a lye or a paradox
as page
where speaking of the fast of lent he affirmes
that those of his profession place not religion or the substance of gods worship in fasting or feasting as saith she the papist doe
and in the page following he saith in his owne name in the name of his brother purita~s
we hold not fasting to be a worke pleasing to god
and yet in his page
he grautes that to fast religiously at some time is gods co~maundeme~t
and pag
that lent fast is partely religious ordered by the church for religious endes bindeth the co~science mediately which larring positions of this grand doctor am not able to reco~cile
and yet for a parte of twelfe dayes deuotio he putteth the payme~t of tithes which indeed is a deuotio far more profitable to himself

then pleasing to others
all which particulars doe manifestly declare that whatsoeuer apish imitation these fellowes vse in writing some fewe bookes of deuotion prayer yet is their spirit quite contrarie to the common spirit of the vniuersall church wholely vertigenous extrauagant peculiar to themselues

and to this the like may be added of their church seruice forme of administration of sacraments as may be seeme in their booke of common prayer which as it manifest to them that read it doth notably differ from all the lyturgies publike formes of prayers pastorals that euer were vsed in the church before the preachings of luther not onely in the manner of administrating the sacraments and seruice but also in some substantiall points of them both
their being not anie mentio in the booke of common prayer of either annointing with chrisme in baptisme or of extreme vnctio of the sicke nor of consecrario of the eucharist or absolute commaunde to receiue it but onely with condition or rather with expresse order or precept that ther be a whole congregation that is some persons more disposed to communicate with the infirme partie besides himselfe that otherwise he must haue patie~ce take his iourney to an other world without his viaticum
neither is it ther ordained directly that that the communicants shall vse the homologesis

or sacrame~t of pennance co~sisting of contrition confession satisfaction as a necessarie preparation to the communion except onely in in case they finde their co~sciences troubled with anie weightie matter that when they are at the point of death contenting themselues at all other times of their receiuing the lords supper with a generall confession onely made either by one of the communicants or by the ministerin the name of the rest
the contrarie of all which particulars are neuerthelesse found in all lythurgies missals directories of former times in all places of the christian world as may be seene in the ierarchie of sainct denis the roman order of which euen the newer of the twoe was practiced in the church at the least yeares agoe

but now to conclude hauing passed throu all the seuerall kindes of vniuersalitie that can be imagined with an exact discussion of the nature properties of the same finding none of them in the religion now publikely professed in england besides this it being certaine both according to the doctrine of the ancient doctors of the church moderne diuines that the worde catholike is the same that vniuersall

generall or co~mon as is apparent by augustins responsion to petilianus wher he saith that the name caetholicu signifies secundu totum

as also against the epistle of gaudentius

teacing that the church therfore is called catholike of the greeke worde because it is exte~ded throu the whole world
this say being infallibly true it doth by necessarie conclusion follow of the premisses that the english relilion is not catholike but a priuate conuenticle or congregation in which true faith is not founde in which by consequence no saluation can be hoped or expected for such as obstinately seperating themselues from the vnitie and vniuersalitie of the most vniuersally receiued religion liue and die in it
and this may suffice for the declaration confirmation of my first ptincipall argument or demonstration

the second principal argvment
my second principal argument which proueth the falsitie of the english religion is this
that religion is false which hath a false or at the least an vncertaine canon of scripture
but the religion of england hath a false or at the least an vncertaine canon of scripture

ergo the religion of england is a false

religion
the maior doubtlesse is graunted by our aduersaries
the minor which they denie proue
and for the proofe of it suppose that the true canon of scripture can not be knowne but by some externall authoritie or meanes distinct from it selfe whether it be the iudgement of euerie faithfull person assisted by the diuine spirit as manie of our aduersaries affirme or whether it be the declaration of the church assisted by diuine inspiration of which it shall be disputed in an other place
more ouer these meanes or this authoritie must be infallible otherwise it can ingender no such certainetie in the myndes of the beleeuers touching the matter in question but they would remaine still doubtfull of the same
and the reaso for which this externall authoritie is thus required to the knowledge of the iuste quantitie of the written worde of god for the distinguishing of the true partes of the same from the apochrypha doubtfull is because that as the scriptures doe in no places affirme declare them selues either in totallitie parte reflectiuely to be the true worde of god deliuered by christ his apostles so they much lesse auerre these determinate bookes or partes of the bible no other to be the onely true authenticall scriptures

this being now supposed as certaine on both sides proue the foresaie minor to wit that

the church of england hath a false or at least an vncertaine canon of scripture by an other silogisme in this manner

that canon of scripture is false or at the least vncertaine which disagreeth from all other canons that euer were in anie christian church before the dayes of luther
but the canon of scripture vsed nowe in england is disagreeable to all other canons that euer were in anie christian church before the dayes of luther
ergo the canon of scripture vsed nowe in the church of england is a false or at the least an vncertaine canon
in the maior of this silogisme ther is no doubt
the minor proue by comparing the canon of england with those seuerall canons which according to the diuersitie of opinions in that point among some of the ancient fathers in former tymes ar founde to be three in number howbeit of those three ther was one which was euer more commonly receiued then the rest to wit that canon which in the councels of florence trent was defined to be infallible is that same which at this present the roman church vseth reiecting all other for apochryphall inauthenticall

now the first of those three canons or orders of diuine volumes consisteth of those bookes of which ther was neuer anie doubt

made but that they be sacred canonicall
the second order is of those of which ther hath alwayes doubt neither hitherto ar receiued by the church to wit the third fourth bookes of esdras the third of the machabies
the third order containeth those bookes of which ther hath ben doubt in former tymes
which ar hester
iudith tobias
the two first bookes of the machabies
the ecclesiasticus the booke of wisdome the prophet baruch
which belong to the old testament
and in the new testament the epistle to the hebrewes
the epistles of iames iude the second of peter the second third of iohn with his apochalips

nowe that the canon of the church of england doth not agree with the first order consisting of such bookes of scripture as of which no doubt hath ben euer made it is most euident for that in their canon of the old testament is included the booke of hester of which doubt hath ben made by melito nazianzene athanasius in the new testament they admit the epistle to the hebrewes the apochalips to omit others of which neuerthelesse doubt hath ben made of the first by origen of the second by eusebius which was also quite omitted by cyrill nazia~zene nay that which is more to this purpose luther did expressely reiect them both with the epistle of iames

touching the second order or canon ther is no need to bring anie proofe in regarde it is well knowe that the church of england doth not admit the two first bookes of machabeis much lesse doe they allowe of the third as likewise neither they allowe the third and fourth of esdras
lastely touching the third laste order they admit hester into their canon as by the sixt article of their new creed doth appeare but they reiect iudith tobie the machabeis ecclesiasticus the prophet baruch and yet as said before hester was doubted of at the least by melito nazianzene athanasius contrarily of the booke of iudith it is confessed by sainct hierome that it is read to haue ben numbred or counted among the holie scriptures by the councell of nyce which booke not obstanding is expresselie excluded out of the english canon of the old testament as the foresaid article of theirs doth declare

and in the canon of the new testament they put the epistle of iames iude the second of sainct peter the second third of sainct iohn his apocalips which yet in former times by some authors of accounte haue ben either quite excluded from the canon or at the least held for doubtfull
so we see that our english professors differ dissent in their canon from all the seuerall canons of scripture

that either they themselues or anie other can imagin to haue ben in the world in anie former age yea euen from the lutherans them selues whome neuerthelesse they vse to rancke among their brothers at the least whensoeuer they make for their purpose aduantage against the romanists

further more if perhaps they say they haue the true canon of scripture because they haue the same bookes of the old testament which the iewes by infallible authoritie held for canonicall and the same bookes of the new testament which the roman church houldes for canonicall
then demande of them first how they come to know that their canon is iuste the same with that of the iewes neither more nor lesse how they be assured that the ancient iewes who onelie not the moderne iewes were the true people of god by him guided ruled by what infallible meanes say doe they knowe that those iewes excluded those same bookes of the old testament out of their canon as apochripha which the roman church holdes for canonicall to wit iudith tobie sapience ecclesiasticus machabies
and vrge them thus
either they had that knowledge from the iewes themselues or from the scriptures themselues or by tradition of the church or by the spirit or inspiration of god
from the iewes they could

not possible haue certaine knowledge of the cano
for that altho their authority were once infallible in receiuing the true canon of scripture either in itselfe or by the assistance prouidence of god yet after the coming of christ his establiment of the euangelicall lawe that infallible authoritie of theirs ceased so by them no infallible knowledge of canonical scriptures could possible be from thence deriued vnto the church of christ nay neither was it suteable to the dignitie of christ his church that the iewes should interpose their authoritie in that nature

secondlie from the scriptures themselues it is cleare our aduersaries could not receiue infallible knowledge of the canon of the old testament in the manner before declared because neither the old nor new scripture doth testifie that those onely bookes are canonicall which the english catalogue includes neiter doe the writers of the newe testament cite places out of those bookes onelie but also out of either all or at the least some of those which peculiarly the roman church aloweth for canonicall which haue aboue rehearsed
for ester is cited by sainct augustin in his epistle to edicia

before him by sainct chrysostome in his third homilie to the people of antioch origen defendes for canonicall

euen those last chapters of hester of which some doubt hath ben made euen by some romanists
baruch is most frequentlie cited by the ancient fathers vnder the name of hieremte as particularlie may be knowne by sainct augustin in his
booke of the cittie
chapter
yea diuers of the fathers produce baruch by name

as sainct cyprian who cites those wordes of his
hic est deus noster
and in his sermon vpon our lords prayer he cites the epistle of hieremie contained in the last chapter of baruch

sainct cyrill also cites the same baruch by name
the like doe hilarie in the preface of his commentarie vpon the psalmes sainct clement alexandrine

sainct ambrose in his first booke of faith second chapter
eusebius cites his third chapter adding that nothing ought to be added to diuine vos by which wordes he declareth baruch to be diuine scripture as also doth theodoretus in expresse wordes commenteth vpon the whole booke

tobie is cited approued for scripture in which the holie ghost doth speake by sainct cyprian
sainct ambrose calles the same booke propheticall scripture

the like doe sainct basil in his oration of auarice sainct augustin in his booke intitled speculum iudith is mentioned by the great councell of nyce as sainct hierome testifies

or the booke of wisedome is alledged

by ancient denis the same doe melito in his epistle to ones sainct cyprian

in his booke of the habit of virgens sainct cyrill calles it diuine scripture sainct augustin also calles it canonicall in his first booke of predest the
chap
ecclesiasticus is cited by clement alexandrine sainct cyprian epiphanius ambrose as diuine oracles sainct augustin calles it diuine scripture produceing those wordes altiorate ne quaesieris

the same fathers with gregory nazianzene cite the machabies as appeareth by sainct cyprian in his exhortation to martyrdome the
chapter
nazianzene in his oration of the machabies sainct ambrose in his second booke of iob the

chapters sainct isidore in his sixt booke
first cap sainct augustin in two seuerall places alowes of these bookes often times citeth them
as in his
booke of the cittie of god
chapter
in his second booke against the epistles of gaudentius chapter
all which is a conuincent argument that those bookes out of which the foresaid places are cited in this manner by these ancient graue renowned doctors are canonicall of as great authoritie as the rest how beit they might otherwise haue ben vnknowe for such to the iewes both in regard that as the lawe of christ is more perfect then the old lawe was so it ought in reason to haue more perfect knowledge

of the worde of god as likewise it hath of diuers other misteries of faith then the professors of that lawe had as also for that as in the lawe of christ there are other matters of faith manners gouernement then were in the time of the old testament so might it be necessary for the greater confirmation of christs doctrine discipline that some of those bookes which were not knowne to the iewes should be declared to christians for canonicall scripture

thirdly from tradition of the church the english canon could not possible receiue authoritie first because the maintainers of it denie the authoritie of the visible church to be infallible consequentlie it is cleare the canon of scripture cannot haue sufficient warrant from it
secondlie
it is most apparent that the primatiue church was not certaine in some of the first ages whether all the bookes of the old testament which the english church houldes for canonicall were in the canon of the iewes which vncertaintie still remained vntill the councell of carthage celebrated in austins time determined the matter
against which english canon are also authenticall witnesses mileto

athanasius nazianzene of which at the least the two latter authors to wit athanasius nazianzene euen

according to the graunt of daniell chamier one of our most peremptorie aduersaries doe omit the booke of hester in the computation of their canon of the old testament whome altho chamier doth reprehend for the same

yet is he so impudent that in another place of the same booke he numbreth both the same athanasius nazianzene as defenders of his owne canon which neuerthelesse includeth hester as the english cano~doth

so that it remaineth most euident there was no such certaine traditio in the primatiue church as could make the english canon as they now vse it infallible the whole church at that time hauing determined nothing iudicially aboute that particular consequentlie it is manifestlie false for the professors of the english religion to affirme that they haue the tradition of the church for proofe of their canon
to which may be added that our aduersaries in maintaining their canon by tradition they should proceed preposterouslie in respect that whereas in all other points of doctrine they relect the authoritie of traditions as insufficient contratie to the worde of god or at the least as vncertaine yet in this particular of the canonicall scripture which is one of the most important points of all other vpon which all the rest of christian faith dependes they would offer to relie vpon the same

and altho our aduersaries particularly daniell chamier doe labor eue till they sweate in prouing their canon to be the same with the canon of the ancient iewes yet doth not one of the thors that haue writ since the matter was determined by the councell of carthage exclude from the christian canon those bookes which the roman church did receiue for canonicall euer since that councell
and how beit hierome is he that of all antiquitie doth fauore our aduersaries in this particular point yet besides that he writ before the matter was determined by pope innoce~tius the first the councell of carthage neuerthelesse as he doth not soe defend the canon of the iewes but that he admitteth of the authoritie of the first councell of nyce in receiuing the booke of hester in to the canon of the christian church so doubtlesse if he had liued in succeeding tymes he would haue done the same touching the rest of the bookes of the old testament which were afterwardes added by the foresaid councell of carthage other since that tyme
to omit that the professors of the pretended reformation neither proceed consequenter to their owne principles if in establishing of their canon they follow the authoritie of fathers whome they make account to be subiect to error deceipt neither

doe they deale securely in casting the maine foundation of their faith vpon the authority of one onely man especially considering that hierome out of an inordinate opinion affection he had to ioseph the iew not onely in this but also in some other points of doctrinesuffered himselfe to be caried somat beyond the limits of reason tho neuer beyond the limits of the true catholike faith
and yet here desire the reader to be aduertised that this which haue vttered touching the agreement of the english canon of hierome is onely by way of concessiue supposition in fauor of my antagonists with whome dispute euen vpon termes of this liberall graunt persuading my selfe neuerthelesse that the canon of the old testament which hierome rehearseth in his prologue is not taken by him for the onely true authenticall canon of the christian church but onely his meaning is to relate the number of those bookes of the ancient scripture according to the most common opinion of the iewes of his tyme
that which is manifestely co~uinced by the authoritie of the same hierome in the like case touching certaine chapters of the prophet daniel of which altho in his preface to that booke he once affirmed them not to be of authenticall authoritie yet afterwardes in his second apologie

against rufinus he declareth his meaning in the foresaid prologue was not to signifie his opinion in that particular but onely to relate the doctrine or saying of the iewes
now this being so it is plainely certaine that our aduersaries of all the ancie~t fathers haue not as much as one hierome vndoubtedly in fauor of their canon but onely the authoritie of the iewes

seco~dly our aduersaries ca~not haue recourse to the spirit for the approbatio of the cano of the old testament first because if they relie vpon this they ought to proue it before to be the true spirit of god which moueth them to beleeue their canon to be of infallible authoritie that either by some other canonicall scripture or by some other conuincent reason or motiue as by miracles sanctitie or by other externall testimonie otherwise they them selues can neither safely relie vpon it nor we can iustely giue credit vnto it for that it is manifestly declared in the authenticall scriptures them selues that ther be euill spirits as well as good by which men ar moued yea that same spirit which seemes good is often tymes discouered knowne to be the spirit of the common animie who the more easily coulerably to deceiue delude doth transforme him selfe in to an angell of leight notobstanding he is darkenes it selfe

finally that spirit by which the defenders

of the iudaicall cano for so our aduersaries suppose theirs to bee proue the authoritie of it is contrarie as well in other points of faith as in this to the spirit of the most visible florishing church in all ages neither is it common generall conformable to the greater parte of christians but extrauagant singular priuate particular to them selues as haue shewed in my precedent argument consequently it can not be the spirit of god but an ill spirit a familiar a bee in a box to which who soeuer doth obey followe will doubtlesse be led at the length in to a laberinth of errors wher he will perish without redemption

more ouer for as much as concerneth the canon of the new testament for our aduersaries to say they haue it from vs is a verie pore shift considering the want of authoritie which they hould to be in our church as being in their opinion of no credit in other matters of faith yea plainely erroneous antichristian it doth thence manifestly follow vpon their principles that their canon can not possible haue infallible certainetie in regarde that the whole grounde on which such certaintie depende this supposed to be the authoritie of our church which they neuerthesse peremptorily auerre not onely to besubiect to error but also to haue alreadie erred in diuers points of faith
frome whence from the rest which

hath ben inculcated in the proofe of the minor of my second silogisme the consequence both of it my first silogisme doth inauoydably followe to wit that the religion of england is plainely false as not hauing anie certaine infallible rule wherby to know the true canonicall scriptures of the old new testament

the third pringipal argvment
my third principall argument against the english religio frame in this manner
that religion is false which hath not the true interpretation sense of scriptures
but the english religion hath not the true interpretation fense of scriptures

ergo the english religion is a false religion
the maior can not be denyed by our aduersaries
the minor in which onely the question consisteth proue first ont of their translations of the bible in to the english tongue of which that most famous defender of the new english faith king iames of great britanie in the publike assembly had by his authoritie as hampton courte the yeare
sitting as president cathedratically pronou~ced that he had neuer yet seene anie bible qnid

adhuc egemus testibus reightly translated into the english tongue
and altho the same king iames for that reaso caused an other newe translation to be made in which some thing which were in the former editions are amended corrected yet find by one of them which haue my selfe printed at london the yeare
that it containeth still diuers of the same errors which were in the first tra~slations of which the king himself did co~plaine as appeareth by the second chapter of the acts

wher for the wordes non relinques animam meam in inferno that is in plaine english thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell the foresaid bible hath thou will not leaue my soule in graue vsing also the verie same translation vpon the wordes of the
psalme out of which they ar cited by the author of the acts of the apostles
that which is done by the professors of the english religion for no other end then that those who please may freely defend their negatiue positio of the reall discent of christ in to hell as beza ingenuonsly confesseth in his annotation vpon this place the affirmatiue of which neuerthelesse the apostolicall creed doth expressely teach vs
in which passage our aduersaries shewe both extreame great partiallitie great impudencie in regarde that in the greeke text which they them selues most superstitiously professe to follow hath the worde undefined span alphabet in this

place which by the septuagint is put commonly for the worde sheol in hebrew as it is also by them selues translated in other places of scripture as hierome doth in like manner turne the same worde undefined span alphabet in to infernus in latin in english hell throu the whole bible

and altho daniell chamier in his booke vpon christs descent in to hell not daring to deme this manner of translatio to haue ben made by the septuagint hierome

doth murmure grumble at them for the same as if they did often times detorte the greeke latin wordes to the sense of the hebrew with neglect of the propertie of the language yet this is but one doctors opinion if he had more to alledge of his owne sect it were no great matter for that by the common iudgement of the whole christian world those twoe sacred translaters farre surpasse in knowledge of the scriptures all the doctors that euer were or will be of his faction tho they esteeme the~selues neuer so wise learned

and suppose the septuagint hierome doe in deed frequently followe the sense rather then the propertie of the hebrewe words what offence commit they in that nay then what commendation doe they not rather deserue in respect it is a generally knowne rule of the best tra~slators not to tye themselues to the wordes but to the sense
as on the contrarie what reprehe~sion

is not due to the whose cheefe studie is with neglect of that sense which those ancie~t expositors who haue gone before them both in time virtue learning to inuent violently drawe newe interpretations of scripture out of the etymologies first imposition of wordes according to the verbal sounde and not according to the common acception of them which yet is the common practice of the nouelists of these our dayes as is most apparent euen by that particular passage which haue in ha~d that is the place aboue cited in the second chapter of the acts thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell

aboute which daniel chamier hauing turned himselfe euerie way tossed all the dictionaries he could finde for his purpose yet could he not finde one author more ancient then iohn caluin his great master and first founder of his religion whoe teacheth that either in this place or in anie other place of scripture according to the proper ordinarie vse the word undefined span alphabet doth signifie the bodie carcasse or life the word undefined span alphabet the graue as he his fellow partners will needs haue the to signifie as they vsually translate them in their bibles excepting onely arias montanus if he be truely cited by chamier

how be it himselfe grauntes that in the cited place of the
psalme the hebrewe wordes in steed of which the septuagint putteth undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet doe signifie the

soule hell which is all that we can desire
for if the hebrewe text be the fou~taine of all true translations as all the nouelists will haue it neither can their translation of this place be true nor ours false for that theirs according to our aduersarie chamiers dissents from the hebrewe ours agrees

diuers other places of the english nouelists corrupted translations might be produced as that of the
of mathewe wher for hymno dicto in the latin hymnizantes in the greeke they translate when they had sung a psalme
in the
of the acts ouerseers for bishops
and in the ninte chapter of the first to the corinthians
haue we not power to lead about a wife where they put a wife for a woman as if all woman were wiues
and in the first chapter of the second epistle of peter they leaue out the wordes by good workes which neuerthelesse are founde in diuers greeke copies yea caluin himselfe grauntes that if they be not expressed in the text yet they are subintellected or vnderstood

and to this may be added by the way that altho it is not ill of it selfe to translate the bible into vulgar languages if it be done truely sincerely by the authoritie of the church or her cheefe pastor yet by these few examples we may learne how greately the word of god is abused by false translations how farre the

trueth is preiudicated by such partiall proceeding supposing that all the foresaid places as they are by them turned in to the english tongue doe fauore diuers points of their new doctrine wheras on the contrarie they expressely make against it if they be truely tra~flated
and particularly those wordes of their sixtineth psalme thou wilt not leaue my soule in graue are so absurdely contrarie to sense so extrauaga~t in the phrase manner of speech as the like is not to be found in anie translation that euer was extant euer since the scriptures were first published in vulgar tongues euen among the pretended reformers themselues
but now this may suffice for examples of false translation of the scriptures vsed by our aduersaries for the first proofe of the minor of my silogisme aboue framed

which further proue secondly for as much as concerneth the exposition of the scriptures because the manner of interpretation which both our english professors also the rest of the pretensiue reformers vse is scarce in anie thing coformable to the expositio of the ancie~t fathers doctors of the precedent ages as it ought to be according to the rule of augustin in his second booke against iulian where in the begining he faith the christian people ought rather to adhere to the fathers then vnto those which teach the contrarie towards

the end of the same booke he addeth thus that which they to wit the fathers found in the church they hold that which they had fro their fathers they deliuered to their sonnes
but our newe interpreters as they are in their positions so are they in their expositions of the worde of god singular full of affected apish imitation of the iewish glosses neither doe they scarce euer alledge anie other expositions or constructions then those of rabbi salomon
rabbi kimchi aben ezra the rest of that rabble
notobstanding they cannot be ignorant but that some of them were either scribes phariseis or saduceis if not all of whome it may be presumed with reason that they frame their expositions more commonly according to their owne false traditions the according to the true sense meaning of the lawe
by which proceeding the reader may consider how impossible it is for our aduersaries to satisfie their consciences in the deliuerie of such doctrine as dependes vpon so vncertaine fayleable grou~des in how miserable a case that flock is which hath his instruction in matters of saluatio from such pastors as partely out of the writings of those profane iewes enimies of christ partely also by their owne industrie coine new sense out of the old obstruse decayed significations of wordes which they find in pedantik humanists lexico~s dictonaries neglecting the commo

current acceptions ecclesiasticall vse of the same
by all which the conclusion of my proposed argument doth appeare true sound which is that the professors of the english faith haue no certaine and infallible interpretation sense of the diuine scriptures consequently their religion must needs be voyde of trueth

the fovrth principal argvment
my fourth principall argument propou~d in the forme following
that religion is false which hath a false rule of faith
but the english religion hath a false rule of faith
ergo the english religio is a false religion
the maior is not denyed by our aduersaries therefore it needs no proofe and it they should be so refractorie as to denie it it is co~uinced by the verie leight of naturall reason which teacheth that the ruled followes the nature of the rule so that it cannot possible be streighter then the rule it selfe no more then a boton can be round if the moulde be square

now that the english religion hath a false

rule of faith which is the minor of my silogisme demonstrate thus by an other silogisme

the religion of england hath for the rule of faith scriptures interpreted expounded by euerie particular member of their church
but the scriptures interpreted expounded by euerie particular member of their church is a false rule of faith
therefore the religion of england hath a false rule of faith
that the scriptures expounded by euerie particular member of the church is a false rule of faith euidently proue because the true rule of faith is of it owne nature certaine common knowne to all beleeuers not priuate vnknowne certaine to him onely who hath it
otherwise no man can certainely infallibly knowe what it is except himselfe conseque~tly none but he onely can followe it wheras the true rule of faith is such as euerie one is bounde to knowe imbrace vpon perill of his saluation

secondly proue that this english rule is false because it is subiect to error the maintainers of themselues confessing that no man can infallibly interpreter the scriptures so that his expositions euen in the greatest matters of faith be vndoubtedly true certaine in such sorte as he can infallibly persuade others that they are

according to that sense which the holye gost intended when he dictated them to the diuine writers
for confirmation of which further adde that our aduersaries commonly teach that not onely euerie particular priuate person may erre in faith but also the whole number of bishops prelates of their church assembled in a synod or councell
out of which it is infallibly consequent that their rule of faith is not certaine either in it selfe or at the least not to others neither can others lawfully follow it for the same reason that it is vnknowne vnto them subiect to error deceipte
besides altho the professors of the english religion should denie this same

yet is it conuinced concluded by scripture it selfe saying for what man knowes the things of a man but the spirit of man which is in him

thirdly if the english rule of faith were not false to wit scriptures expounded by euerie member of the church it would thence necessarily followe that ther were no need of prechers teachers in the church of england to propose declare the worde of god vn the people because euerie particular man woman that can read the bible can sufficiently vnderstand expounde it them selues at the least for as much as concernes their saluation
and for the ignorant sorte which can not read it were also in vaine for them to haue preachers

in regarde they can propose vnto them no other rule of faith then scriptures expounded by their owne particular spirit which neuerthelesse eue according to their owne doctrine is fallible subiect to error by consequence obledgeth no man to followe it but rather to auoy de it by all meanes possible

fourthly proue the same because this rule of our aduersaries serues no mans turne but his owne who hath it that but vnto wardely neither doth it obledge others to beleeue it neither is it one the same but as manie as ther be people in the whole church of england all which is most absurde repugnant to the nature of true faith which ought to be one in all the christian world certaine in fallible binding all persons to embrace it by diuine precept commaund which neuerthelesse could not be such if the rule which it followeth were not one without all multipllcation diuision
and to this may be ioy ned for conclusion of the proofe of this argument that which haue deliuered touching our aduersaries false translation erroneous manner of interpretation of diuine scriptures

the fift principal argvment
my fift principall argument in order to proue the falsitie of the english religion is this
that religion is false which hath not a perpetuall disinterrupted succession of bishops preists deriued from the apostles
but the english religion hath not a perpetuall disinterrupted succession of bishops preists deriued from the apostles
ergo the english religion is a false religio

the maior proposition is so certaine and cleare that our aduersaries a the least all or most of those of the protestant faith can not denie it
and if perpaps anie of them or anie other sectaries should be so frontlesse imprudent as to denie it they ar manifestly conuinced by those places of scripture which proue the perpetuitie of the gouernement of the church of christ in generall
as in the fourth to the ephesians where it is affirmed that christ gaue to his church pastors doctors that is bishops preists to the consummation of the saints vnto the word of the ministerit that to rule gouerne feed the flock of the

church vntill the co~summation of the world
and the prophet dauid in his
psalme faith that god founded his citie that is the church as augustin expoundes it for euer
and surely if god established his church for euer as truely according to this he did it can neuer wa~t bishops preists for that if it should wa~t them then it were no more a true church according to the saying hierome
wher ther is no preist ther is no church
in which word sacerdos preist

he includeth also bishops as being cheefely preists those without whome no preists can be made of ordained sainct cyprian also in the second epistle of his fourth booke towardes the end teaches that the true church cannot stand without bishops preists
and sainct augustin saith plainelie that it is the succession of preists by preists he meaneth also bishops which keepes him in the church

and in his epistle
vpon the psalme against donatus he chalengeth his aduersaries the donatists to number the preists which haue ben euen from the seat of sainct peter see who hath succeeded each other in that order of fathers in which order of fathers meaning the popes whose names he specifiech in his epistle to generosus euen from peter to anastasius who was pope in his time because he findeth not one donatist therefore he concludes that their religion is false not

to be followed
so that the reader may plainelie perceiue by these authorities of which kinde manie more might be alledged if need were the place did admit anie larger discourse that the ancient fathers held the want of succession of bishops preists for a common infallible argument of the falsitie of that religion which not obstanding whatsoeuer other colores of truth it might seeme to haue by pretext of scripture or otherwise was destitute of the same
that which is sufficient for the proofe of the mator of my sylogisme in case anie of the defenders of the english religion should haue the face to denie it

wherefore hence passe to the minor to wit that the english religion hath not a continuall disinterrupted succession of preists bishops derined from the apostles which proue first because it is certaine by the testimonie of all writers of those ages that frome the time of sainct gregorie pope of rome who sent sainct augustin the monke into england to plant the then professed roman faith ther were no other preists or bishops but such as had their authority deriued from the roman seat such bishops onelie as were ordained consecrated with the same matter forme of order with vnction miter crosier other such ornaments ceremonies as the church of rome actuallie vseth at this day

nay nor yet in the time of wiclif or since is there anie mention in anie historie writer or recorde either catholike or protestant of anie kinde of eyther bishops preists or ordination of the same vsed in england before the reigne of edwarde the sixt
wherefore altho we should graunt the patrons of the english faith that their religion was professed in england in more ancient times as they pretend the contrarie of which neuerthelesse is as certaine as it is certaine there is no mention of it in anie more ancienthistorie or recorde then the dayes of edward the sixt yet is it manifest that it hath had a notable interruption in the succession of bishops preists to wit for the space of
yeares at the least euen according to the confession of our aduersaries and consequentlie it is euident that it hath not a continuall disinterrupted succession of bishops preists deriued from the apostles

secondlie proue there is no coutinuall disinterrupted succession of bishops preists in the english religion deriued from the apostles
because altho we should admit that in the time of king edward by reason of the immediate succession of his newe religion to the religion of his father henry the
at whose death we doe not denie but there were true bishops preists lefte who might perhaps for as much as concerneth the essence of the order

thou not lawfullie either haue consecrated others or they themselues haue serued in the church according to the newe forme of the same which fact need not here dispute but omit as vngranted neuerthelesse it is certaine graunted by both parties that euen in this there was another plaine interruption that within a verie shorte time vpon the succession of queene marie to the crowne in here brothers place who exauthorizing all that newe brood of bishops preists reestablished the roman religion in the same forme with such prelates preists as had ben in the realme in all former times as not onelie all written histories recordes but also some eye witnesses who then did see the change being yet aliue can at this daye testifie the same
so that euen in this particular manner the newe religion of england hath suffered an interruption in the succession of bishops preists

thirdlie
proue the same minor proposition because at the time of the last change of religion at the death of queene marie all the roman bishops were deposed depriued of their dignities excepting onelie the archbishop of canterburie whose seat was vacant by his death others were put in their places by the authoritie of queene elizabeth here parleament who neuerthelesse were such as did not

agree either in vocation mission or ordination with their predecessors as appeareth particularly in master parker who not obstanding he was the cheefe of the as being archbishop of caterburie primate yet is he confessed by master mason a minister professed defender of the newe clargie of england to haue ben the first of
archbishops since fainct augustin that receiued orders consecration without the popes bulles the rest of the ceremomes vsed in the ordination of all those
that preceded him
and the same he might haue said of the newe bishops of these dayes comparing them with all that longe space of time

the which difference in the manner of consecration altho it were alone sufficient according to the doctrine of the roman church to exclude the ordained from true succession as being at the least schismaticall in itselfe contrarie to the practice of ancient times euen before the dayes of sainct augustin the apostle of our countrie as both the writings of the ancient fathers which will produce in an other place also some ancient authenticall histories or recordes of the realme doe testifie yet euen according to the principles of the english religion there is an essentiall defect founde in the same in regarde that master barlowe by the foresaid defender of the english ministerie reported to haue ben the

consecrator of parker had neuer anie consecration himselfe
or if he had anie he was made bishop if not preist also onelie according to the forme diuised in the time of edward the sixt confirmed by queene elizabeth the eight yeare of her reigne
that which suppose master mason himselfe doth not deny
which forme as it is set in their rituall or manner of making bishops preists deacons printed at london
as being neither founde in scripture nor conformable to anie other forme of consecratio euer vsed in any christian church since the christian religion was founded the persons co~secrated or ordained according to the tenor of it ca~not possible betrue bishops preists or deacons by necessarie consequence neither master parker nor anie other of his fellowe bishops could receiue true order or consecration as being ordained both by one that had no power of order himself nor yet did cousecrate them with the same essentiall matter forme which hath ben commonlie vsed in the christian world in ancient ages but onelie according to that new forme which as master mason confesseth being deuised authorized onelie by king edwarde queene elizabeth who had no power to alter the forme of ordination practiced generallie in the christian church before their times could not possible giue the apostolicall power

of ordination consequentlie they had no continuall disinterrupted succession in that nature deriued from the apostles which is that by the minor of my argument intend to conuince

peraduenture our aduersaries will replie say
first that the whole essentiall matter forme of order consisting of imposition of handes the wordes receiue the holie ghost were applyed to master parker the rest of the ministrie in their ordination the roman rites or ceremonies onelie omitted which neither make nor marre the substance of the order
but to this reioine first that this doth not cleare master barlowes consecration of which there being no authenticall register or recorde extant he cannot be esteemed to haue ben a true bishop consequenthe he had no power to consecrate others so master parker supposing he had the true matter forme of episcopall order applied vnto him yet could he not be true bishop for want of authoritie in his ordainer who could not possible giue that he had not himselfe

secondlie
it is false that those wordes receiue the holie ghost with imposition of handes onelie are the whole matter forme of consecration of bishops for that neither scripture councels nor fathers nor the ancient

practice of the church doe teach the same but rather on the contrarie it is manifest that another forme of ordination was vsed in the primatiue church as doth appeare to omit other authorities by the wordes of sainct ambrose vpon the
chapter of the acts of the apostles
where expounding those words ieiunantes imponentesque manies he saith that imposition of handes is mysticall wordes where with the person elected is confirmed to this worke receiuing authoritie his conscience bearing him witnesse that he may be bould in our lordes name to offer sacrifice to god
by which wordes the reader may plainelie perceiue that in sainct ambroses time there was more required in the matter forme of consecration of bishops then imposition of handes onelie with those wordes receiue the holie ghost to wit some other wordes by which the person ordained receiueth power to offer sacrifice which wordes neuerthelesse were neuer vsed in the consecration either of master parker or anie other of the bishops or ministers of the english church as by them themselues is confessed who by necessarie sequele must also needs confesse the same bishops ministers to be essentiallie defectiue voy de of true ordination

thirdlie according to the storie of the nagges head tauerne as it was related by master

neale some time professor of languages in oxford who was a man that both by reason of his ancient yeares as also for the meanes he had to know the trueth as being imployed about this same busines by bishop boner then deposed prisoner ought in all reason to be credited master parker was not ordained at all by master barlowe but by master scorie who by reason he had she name of bishop during the reigne of king enwarde because master kitching being a true bishop tho then deposed with the rest of the catholike bishops of queenes maries time partelie out of scruple of conscience partelie for feare of excommunication menaced towardes him by bishop bonner refused to consecrate the newe superintendents vndertooke the worke in the foresaid tauerne where a meeting was made to that purpose scorie causing them all to kneele he tooke the bible laid it vpon them bidding them take authoritie to preach the worde of god sincerelie who without anie more wordes or deedes all escaped bishops of the new fashion and master parker hauing either better fortune or better fauor then the rest for his parce he got the archbishoprie of canterburie and the primacie of england
the others being seased according to their seuerall lots and election of the queene

whence it clearelie appeareth that by which

soeuer of these formes master parker his fellowes were consecrated yet they haue no true canonicall ordination neither according to the scriptures nor according to the ancient practice of the church by vnauoidable consequence they haue no true succession deriued from the apostles but as an ancient father saith of other heretikes of his time so we may say of them that succeeding to none they are prodigiouslie borne of themselues

and sainct cyprian of others saith in like manner that without anie lawe of ordination they preferre themselues assume the name of bishops not hauing the episcopate coferred vpon them by anie
both which sentences may verie aptelie be applyed to our nominall bishops of england who as haue declared receiue their bishopries without law full authoritie

yet notobstanding all this which hath ben said perhaps some of them will insiste further in their owne defence say that althou they haue no personall succession yet they haue doctrinall succession from the apostles in respect they maintaine the same doctrine which the apostles their successors in the primatiue church preached tought

to which anser that this is the common euasion of those onelie who defend the inuisibilitie of the church but it doth nothing auaile those who pretende to defend the continuall

visibilitie of the same as they doe against whome now dispute
secondlie whosoeuer maintaines this it is but a miere shif or cloake wherewith to couer the nakednes of their new borne religion which if it had not falselie disguised itselfe with the apostolicall robes it could not for shame haue appeared in publike by reason of the great deformitie it hath in doctrine

thirdly
if the english religion hath succession of doctrine not of persons wher was it from the fift or sixt hundreth yeare till the dayes of luther
was it in men or in beasts in beastes they will not say for the auoyding of their owne shame
and if it was in men then showe vs wher when those men liued otherwise we will giue no more credit vnto our aduersaries wordes then we doe whe they crye out say it is apostolicall doctrine but proues it not as ordinarily they do both in their bookes preachings

peradue~ture they will say their religion was neither in men nor beasts but in bookes they meane in the bookes of the old newe testament
but this is yet more false absurde then the rest for that doctrine inuolued in bookes can not make succession succession being and order or series of things imediately following one other which order doctrine meluded in papers or partchement can not possible

haue as being one the same obiect of faith quite indistinguible in it selfe can be onely intentionally or obiectiuely distinguished or deuided by the persons in which as an accident it is subiected receiued
besides
all the tyme that those fantastikes imagin their doctrine to haue ben continually successiue in the bible if they them selues or at least other their companions in sect were not as ther confesse howe can they knowe at this present that anie such bookes or doctrine was then in the world when themselues were not
if they say they haue that knowledge from the romanists then say why doe they not also giue credit vnto the same romanists in other matters of faith as particularly in that point of the number of canonicall scriptures of the true sense of them as they ar applyed to euerie controuersie betwixt vs them during that long space in which ther were none of their religion extant among all which points of difference ther is none more important then that of the infallible knowledge of those diuine bookes which the romanists had in their custodie all the tyme of their aduersaries non existence to be the onely true authenticall worde of god
so that for these men to affirme they haue all wayes had a doctrinall succession from the apostles without a personall is a miere puritanicall dreame a

chymericall conceite paradox of their owne forgeing an idea of plato abstracted onely by distracted myndes

finally for proofe that the english religion hath no true preists bishops adde that our sauior ordained his apostles not onely to preach his worde but also to remit sinnes offer sacrifice according to those two texts of scripture

whose sinnes you shall remit they shall be remitted
and doe this in my remembrance
wherfore our aduersaries the of the newe religion of england whoe haue not all this specified in the forme of their ordination canot possible according to diuine institution trueth of the scriptures be iudged to receiue either of the twoe powers when they are created ministers so they cannot in is other respect truely be called preists bishop but onely by force virtue of that sophisticall ridiculous conseence they haue benefices bishoprikes therfore they are preists bishops
and yet besides this haue one other argument
so vrgent forcible against our aduersaries that it alone is sufficient to conuince euen the most obstinate iudgeme~ts that the preiuereformed clergie of england bath no authoritie power or to preach or reache the gospell consequently that they ar not true prsts nor bishops
lay the fou~datio of my argument vpon the whole streinth of

diuine principle of paule
quomodopraeabum nisi mittantur how shall they preach cept they be sent which as being an expresse xt of scripture is receiued by both parties for trueth
contriue my silogisme in manner

those who haue no mission want authoritie or iurisdiction to preach teach the gospell
but the newe english clergie hath no mission
ergo the newe english clergie wantes power or iurisdiction to preach
the maior proposition is so plainely in scripture that am persuaded euen the most pure caluinist or caluinian puritan dares not absolutely denie it
for proofe of the minor suppose agree with my aduersaries that ther are two onely genders or kyndes of mission
viz
either ordinarie or exterordinarie
this agreement so supposed argue thus if the professors of the english religion haue mission it is either ordinarie or exterordinarie
but the professors of the english religion haue neither ordinarie nor extraordinarie mission
ergo the professors of the english religion haue no mission

that the professors of the english haue no extraordinarie missio need not to proue in regarde knowe excepting of the puritan faction extraordinarie is not maintained by our aduersaries
and anie either puritan anabaptist or other sectarie will auerre is mission to the for the same reason that he defendes it to extraordinarie he is bounde to proue it by extraordinarie meanes he must shoue his or letters of ordination brought from firmed with the broade seale of miracles prophecie or other manifestly diuine testimonie or else it is to be reiected as counterfeit euidence forged to deceiue cousen simple ignorant people with euident preiudice to their eternal saluation
and so leauing this as a fictitions of the founders or inuenters of it voyde of both diuine humanane authoritie neither giueing anie satisfaction to mature solid iudgements passe to the ordinarie mission which our aduersaties most commo~ly pretend will manifestly proue they ardestitute of it because as exterordinarie mission can not be obtained but by exterordinarie means so neither can ordinarie mission be had but by ordinarie meanes
now this supposed proceed thus in forme of argument

ordinae nussion can be receiued of those onely who by contiall succession of

bishops preists from the apostles

but the professors of the english religion not receiued their mission from those haue continuall succession of bishops preists from the apostles
ergo the professors of the english religion no ordinarie mission
the minor propositio in which alone the difference controuersie may seeme to stand if ther be proue because those who succed from the apostles in the foresaid manner of whome the professors of the english faith against whome now dispute confesse they receiued their mission if anie they haue ar from the popes of rome or such others as deriued their authoritie from that seat

but now it is a fact clearer them the cleare light of the clearest day that neither the pope himselfe nor anie other who deriued his authoritie from him did euer conferre anie mission power inrisdiction or authoritie to preach teache or minister sacraments vpon anie of the professors of the english religion that which by this dilemma
for all those who can be imagined to haue giuen anie mission to the professors of the english faith at the tyme of change of religion either they were roman catholiks at that present or not if they still remained roman catholike then is it infallibly certaine they would neuer haue offered

to giue mission are power to them whom they held for heretiks an enimies to their own faith profession yea if they had attempted anie such matter their attempte had be voyde in regarde the roman church by of her ecclesiastical canons anulles all such collation of iurisdictionarie power to heretikes and according to this it is herby apparently concluded that the professors of the english religion neither one way nor other could possible receiue anie mission power or authoritie to preach the gospell or minister sacrament after their manner at their first admittance to the ministrie

it is true doctor cranmer from whome the bishops and ministers of the english religion alledge they immediatly had their mission is supposed to haue had the caracter of episcopall presbyterall order yet supposing by reason of his seperation from the faith obedience of the roman church from which he receiued all the power of order iurisdiction they pretend he was depriued of iurisdictio ingenuously co~fesse my iudgeme~t is conuinced by force of argument that they cannot possible haue anie ordinarie mission of episcopal or preistlie function for the preaching of the worde of god administration of the sacraments either according to diuine or ecclesiasticall institution

and know indeed sonne of our aduersaries manie monethes paste after a long time of deliberation hoping to satisfie their owne restesse mindes an others in this their most important busines produced certaine new founde registers for testimonie of their predecessors ordination
but in my iudgement the authoritie of the is so suspicious that they ought not to moue anie prude~t vnderstanding
and if they were authenticall why did they conceile them till this present time in which no man vrged them in anie speciall manner to bring them to leight whereas yet they haue so often since the change of religion demaunded ben to shewe their letters of ordination in other occasions

moreouer suppose their registers were neuer so true authenticall yet since they doe not testifie that their ordination was in matter forme authoritie of the ordinators perpetually vsed in the catholike church they neither satisfie vs in our demaunde nor yet are they sufficient warrant either to the conscie~ces of those that vse them or those who relie vpon the effect of them in their reception of the sacraments
neither surely are those registers of anie greater force for iustification of the ordination of our english pretensiue reformed clergie then the writings of an vsurarie contract iustifie an vsurer in his recept of money in that vnlawfull manner which they declare
and so

conclude both for this the reasons aboue alledged particularly for their most apparent defect of vocation mission that their case is verie considerable yea lamentable both in respect of themselues in regarde of those whose soules are by their owne misfortune co~mitted to their charge gouernement
and this may now suffice for the declaration confirmation of this my fift cheefe generall argument which concludeth the faith of england to be an erroneous false religion

the sixt principal argvment
my sixt principall argument is this
that religion is false which hath no true adoration or worship of god proper to him onely
but the english religion hath no adoratio nor worship of god proper to him onely
ergo the religio of engla~d is a false religio

the maior must of necessitie be graunted by the professors of the english reigno least otherwise they destroye amhilate the verie life of all religion which is the worship or adoration of one onely god with such honor as is proper due vnto him as both diuine faith leight of

nature doe teach yea doutlesse the trueth of this proposition is contained in the first commaundement which doth not onely exclude the pluralitie of gods their adoration but also includeth that worship which is due proper to one onely god not to anie creature or oother entitie whatsoeuer
and for this cause god himself in other places co~maundes dominum deum tuum adorabis illi soli seruies
thou shalt adore thy lord thy god serue him onely
and honore meu alteri non dabo
will not giue my honor to another wher god calles it his owne honor because ther is a kinde of honor due proper vnto him onely not common to others
and now this precept being grounded in the lawe of nature the naturall instinct of reason doth likewise suggest the same so that no rationall creature can denie it

nowe the minor of my silogisme in which all or the greatest parte of the difficultie consists proue it by an other silogisme in this manner
that religion hath no true adoration or worship of god which hath no exercise of a true proper sacrifice or oblation
but the religion of england hath no exercise of a true proper sacrifice or oblation
ergo the religion of england hath no true adoration or worship of god

the maior of the latter silogisme in case it

should be denied by our aduersaries proue first by scripture then by testimonies of ancient fathers to wit that true religion cannot stand without true proper worship of god by frequent vse or exercise of a true proper sacrifice

and altho this might be sufficiently proued by a generall induction drawne not onely from the practice of the vniuersall world in all ages as well in the professors of the true god of which the old testament giueth euidence as also from the false religion of all sortes of idolaters gentils paganes
yet because knowe the nouelists out of their presumption impudencie will not stick to denie the consequence will omit to persecute this manner of argume~t onely insist in those authorities of scripture doctors of the church which immediatly conuince the same to be true also in our christian religion of the new testament

my first proofe of scripture take out of some certaine places of the prophets which notobstanding they seeme to belong to the old testament yet in realitie they appertaine to the newe as being predictions of the state of religion in the same
to which purpose the prophesie of malachie is most plaine for the future practice of a proper generall sacrifice in the new testament affirming
that the

lord of hostes saith this
haue no will in you meaning the preists of the old testament nor will receiue an offering at your handes for from therising of the sunne to the setting my name is great among the gentils in euerieplace is ther sacrificed offered vnto my name a cleane oblation because my name is great among nations
thus farre the prophet
now the wordes circumsta~ces of this place so plainely demonstrate that the prophet malachie speakes of some kinde of sacrifice which was not the or euer before vsed in anie time or place but was to be vsed in the new testament that our aduersaries least they should be conuinced of error in their religion for that it hath no externall oblation to god at all they finde no other refuge then to feigne that the prophet speaketh onely of the metaphoricall sacrifice of prayer good workes
which interpretation of theirs altho it were neuer so true as it is most clearely false yet is it little sutable to other positions practice at least of caluinists

as that good works are sinnes in themselues yea damnable if god did not mercifully perdon them that they are not pleasing to god
nay prayer good workes are so litle couldly practiced among them all that if ther were no other sacrifice in the world doubtlesse god almightie should by them especially be verie couldly serued

how be it that cleare it is out of the related

text that malachie treates not of anie vnpropersacrifice
first because it is euident that he prophesied of such a future sacrifice as should be more proper pleasing to god then thesacrifices offered in the time of the old lawe which neuerthelesse being properly and truely sacrifices altho in other respects defectiue that which should succeed vnto them could not in comparison of them be esteemed more proper pleasing sacrifice to god then they were if truely and properly it had not ben a sacrifice

secondly
the hebrewe text with the cleane oblation ioyneth incense which coniunction of both those rites togither doth manifestly shewe the prophesie to be of an externall rite oblation to god consequently a proper sacrifice
thirdly
it is plaine by the wordes of the text that the prophet speaketh of such an externall ritie as mayntaines the greatnes of gods name euen among gentiles infidels which prayer good workes onely cannot effecte by reason they ar neither so apparent knowne among the nor so publike a testimonie of the maiestie of god as sacrifice is without which his diuine renowne magnificence soueraintie would be extinguished in people in processe of time

fourthly true proper sacrifice is an essentiall parte of a true proper religion a maine distinctiue signe from vn proper false

religions of such a one the prophet treates as is both different from the sacrifice of the gentiles yea of the iewes them selues now prayer workes ar common to euerie religion euerie one according to their seuerall manner

and to this declaration of the text adde the expesitions of all those ancient fathers who haue applyed this place of malachie to the eucharist as to the onely proper sacrifice of the newe testament ther being not one extant in all antiquitie who hath deliuered anie contrarie sense of it or that hath explicated it of prayers or workes alone
iustin martyr who liued within the compasse of the second age speaketh plainely to this purpose citing the wordes of the prophet

in which he affirmes that malachie foretels a newe oblation to succeed the sacrifice of the iewes saying
de hostijs quae ipsi deo nobis gentibus vbique offeruntur id est eucharistiae tum predicit cum ait nobis nomen suum gloria affici vobis autem pollui
which is this in english
god by malachye the prophet for in this ma~ner iustin speaketh in his precedent wordes doth prophesie of the hoastes or sacrifices which are in euerie place offered by vs gentils meaning conuerted gentils that is of the bread of the eucharist likewise of the cup of the encharist when he saith that his name is glorified by vs but

polluted by you meaning the preists of the old testament

now since this renowned martyr both particularly declares that the prophet malachies prediction is meante of the eucharist supposing he further affirmes the same eucharist to haue ben offered by the christian preists of his tyme in all places yea that therby the name of god is glorified it is extreame want of iudgement or rather plaine madnes in our aduersaries to denie that the prophet speaketh of a true proper sacrifice

and althou the same father in his precedent lines doth insinuate that the eucharist is a gratiarumaction or rendering of thankes for diuers benefits receiued by christians at the handes of god as the creation of the worlde the memorie of their redemption other of that nature yet those or the like causes of the offering of the eucharist doe no more diminish the nature of a true sacrifice included in the same then hostia pacifica the hoaste of pacification did cease to be a true oblation or sacrifice because it was offered by way of thankes giuing for benefits receiued or els to obtaine new fauors graces of god almightie
by which also the friuolous euasion of kemntitius other nouellists appeares to be voyde of force while they endeuoure to illude the streingth of this most pregnant testimonie for the proofe of the

euchariticall sacrifice of the lawe of christ for that reason to wit because the author of the same testimonie in the same place affirmes our sauior to haue comaunded the eucharist to be celebrated in remembrance of his death an passion as if the one the other could not be included in the same action either according to diuine scripture or naturall reason neither of which is founde repugnant but rather most conformable agreeing

irenaeus in like manner being one of the same standing testifies that the prophet malachie did presignifie the eucharist in those same wordes which he cites saith
that bread which is made of a creature he that is christ tooke gaue thankes saying this is my bodie
and likewise the chalis which is of a creature which is according to vs confessed it to be his owne bloud taught vs a newe oblation of the newe testament which the church receiuing from the apostles offers to god in the vniuersall world to him who giues vs for nourishment the primicies of first frutes of his giftes of which malachie one of the twelue prophets did so presignifie
lhaue no pleasure in you
and that sainct irenaeus speaketh not of an vnproper sacrifice as kemnitius some other sectaries doe cauille is most euident by other wordes of his towardes the end of the same chapter where he addeth that the former

people that is the iewes shall cease to offer to god yet neuerthelesse that in euerie place a pure sacrifice is offerred vnto him his name glorified among the gentils

more ouer in his
chapter he saith that one kinde of sacrifice is reproued by god meaning the sacrifice of the iewes to which the sacrifice the of church succeedes
by which discourse particularlie by those wordes which he saith of christ noui testamenti nouam docuit oblatiouem that is he taught a newe oblation of the newe testament it is clearelie conuinced that this holie father by the worde oblation could not possible vnderstand almes as our aduersaries contendes because altho it be in some sorte an oblation to god yet is it neither newe nor proper to the newe testament onelie but common to both old newe as the scripture it self doth most frequently teach inculcate
more ouer this place of sainct irenaeus did so farre conuince the iudgement of caluin in this particular that like the deuils which according to the relation of the euangelist acknowledged christ against their wils he confesseth him to haue expounded it of the masse iuste as the romanists of later times vse to interpret applie it hath no other refuge then plainelie to contradict the foresaid ancient fathers exposition in this impudent audatious manner sayeing of the roman diuines
when they

obiect the place of malachie to be vnderstood so of the sacrifice of the masse by irenaeus the offering of melchisedech in like manner by athanasius ambrose augustin arnobius it is breefelie ansered that the same writers doe in other places also interpret bread the bodie of christ but so ridiculouslie that reason trueth constreineth vs to dissent from them thus this saucie nouellist speakes of his betters whose pride bouldnes the centurists imitate treating this same point in their third centurie as if they were the onelie men in the world borne for reason not those rather who immediatelie succeeding the apostles did infinitlie surpasse them both in virtue knowledge of christian doctrine true sense of gods diuine worde institution

tertullian declaring the sacrifice prophecied by malachie against marcion

alluding to his wordes saith thus
in euerie place sacrifice is offerred to my name pure sacrifice viz of glorie relation benediction prayse hymnes
in which wordes the entyre tenor of the masse is breefelie described thou soma't obscurelie as the custome of this author is
by relation he vnderstandes the epistle gospell by benediction the consecration by praise himnes the glorie prayers other spirituall passages contained in that misterie
and altho this author in an other place of this same booke doth

affirme the place of malachie to be vnderstanded of sacrifice of praier in his booke against the iewes of spirituall not of terrene sacrifices yet in neither place doth he deny it to be truely interpreted of the eucharist but in the first place he calleth it a spirituall sacrifice because it was instituted by the diuine spirit not by humane inuention as also for that it is not ministred in that carnall grosse manner in which the iewish sacrifices were ministred by effusion of bloud by fire knife but by benediction consecration as such a pure oblation ought to be handled celebrated
in the second place tertullian onelie interpreteth one parte of the sentence of malachie to wit the word incense which is in the hebrewe text of prayer offered to god
but the other wordes oblatio munda he expoundes of the sacrifice of the masse in the place nowe cited
to which if we adde an other place of the same author in which he speaketh of the eucharisticall sacrifice

all tergiuersation must necessarily cease in anie indifferent minde touching this authors true meaning
for thus he saith
will not thy station be more solemne if thou assiste at gods altar
hauing receiued reserued the bodie of our lord both the one the other is safe the participation of the sacrifice the execution of the office
by which wordes it is manifest that ancient tertullian could neuer denie the sacrament

of the altar to be a proper oblation who here so absolutelie affirmes it to be a sacrifice celebrated in the altar

cyprian liuing within the third hundreth yeare in like manner cites the same place of malachie in the
chapter of his booke against the iewes to proue that which he putteth in the title of the same chapter to wit that the ancie~t sacrifice is euacuated a new on celebrated which newe sacrifice can be no other the the eucharist which onely no other is new in respect of the sacrifices of the old testament

the next in order age is eusebius who liuing in the beginning of the

yeare interprets this place of malachie in the same sense sayeing
we therefore sacrifice vnto the most high god a sacrifice of laude we sacrifice a sacrifice deo plenum full of god and bringing an odoriferous sent with it a sacred or sacrosainct sacrifice we sacrifice after a newe manner a pure or cleane sacrifice according to the newe testament
where it is plaine that eusebius applies the place of malachie to the solemne sacrifice of the masse which is performed by prayer oblation therefore called by his a sacrifice of laude which onelie can be truelie said to be full of god by reason of christ whome it containeth which onelie can be called truely the sacrifice of the new testament affirmed to be

offered in a newe fashion
all which particular speciall circumstances no man of iudgement or common sense can applie to prayer or almes onelie

chrysostome in his commentarie of the psalme
hauing cited the wordes of malachie addes his exposition of them saying
behould howe copiouslie clearlie he malachie hath declared the mysticall table which is the incruent or vnbloudie hoaste furthermore he calleth the sacred prayers which are offered after the hoaste pure thymiame or odoriferous perfume

thus chry sostome of the prophet malachie

hierome altho by the worde incense he vnderstandes prayer yet the worde pure ohlation he commonlie interpreteth to be the oblation of the eucharist as also did sainct irenaeus before him in the place cited
which exposition is as fit for the romanists as can be imagined supposing the masse includes both prayer pure oblation or sacrifice
and the same say of sainct augustin who soeuer els of the fathers interprets the foresaid worde in the prophecie of malachie in that manner

moreouer sainct augustin both in his


booke of the citie vseth the same place of malachie for proofe of the cessation of the iewish sacrifices exercise of the christian sacrifice by the preists of christ according to

the order of melchisadech for thus he discourseth against the iewes in the first of the two places cited
haue no will in yee nor offering will receiue at your hand
for from the rising of the sunne to the setting my name is great among the gentils in euerie place shall be sacrificed a pure oblation is offerred to my name
this sacrifice since we see it offered in all places from the rising of the sunne to the setting by the sacerdoce or preist function of christ according to the order of melchisadech but the sacrifice of the iewes to whome it is said haue no pleasure in you they cannot denie to haue ceased why doe they yet expect an other christ since this which they reade prophecied see accomplished could not be fulfilled but by him
it is true sainct augustin speaketh not so plaine in the second place as here he doth neuerthelesse he alludes to the same place in the same sense

theodoret also comments vpon this same place of malachie in the same sense in most plaine wordes teaching that according to the prediction of malachie in lieu of irrationall hoastes is now sacrificed an immaculate lambe

lastelie sainct damacen rupert agree to

the rest in the exposition of the place of malachie whose wordes altho most plaine doe not cite because knowe the nouellists commonlie reiect their authoritie as not being writers

of the first fiue hundreth yeares
in which how little reason they haue to proceed in that manner with learned graue authors will not now discusse onelie this say that doubt not but anie indifferent reader will absolutelie condemne them of extreame temeritie in offering to resist such an armie of old soldiers as haue here placed in battill aray to feight against them
and hence passe to the producing of testimonies of the new testament for proofe of a proper sacrifice in the lawe of christ

christ in the fourth chapter of the euangell of sainct iohn affirmeth that the houre is now come when true adorers shall adore the eternall father in spirit truth neither in the mountaine of samaria nor in ierusalem as he said immediatly before

in which place the worde adore signifies to sacrifice as in diuers other places of scripture it doth particularlie the
of genesis where abraham preparing to sacrifice is sonne saith to his seruants
expect here with the asse the boy makeing haste thither after we haue adored will returne vnto you
where it is cleare that the worde adore cannot signifie anie other adoration then that which abraham was aboute that is the sacrifice of his sonne
the likeplace you haue iohn the
of certaine gentils who ascended in to the temple to adore in the feast day
and the

eunuch come to adore in ierusalem the
of the acts

in fine according to the iudgement of theodoret rupert this place of sainct iohn alludes to that other of malachie aboue cited discussed hath the like sense
which perhaps these two authors receiued from eusebius who affirmes the same in his first booke of his euang demonst sixt chapter
thence it is consequent that this place is vnderstanded of the eucharist as the place of the prophet is that is in a proper signification of sacrifice

and other principall proofe of a proper sacrifice in the newe testament is deduced from the institution of the eucharist the
of sainct mathew the
of sainct marke the
of luke the
chapter of the first to the corinthians in this manner forme of sylogisme
a proper sacrifice is an externall oblation of some sensible permanent creature consecrated changed by mysticall ryte or ceremonie by a lawfull preist for the a knowledgement of the diuine maiestie supreme power dominion of god
but christ in his last supper made such an oblation when he instituted the eucharist
ergo christ in his laft supper offered a proper sacrifice when he instituted the eucharist

in the maior there is no controuersie betwixt

vs our aduersaries as suppose or at the least persuade my selfe they will not much stand vpon it
the minor proue by an other sylogisme

christ in his laste supper being a lawfull preist according to the order of melchisadech offered his owne bodie bloude to his eternall father vnder the sensible formes of bread wine commaunding his apostles to doe the same
but this is a true proper sacrifice
therefore christ offered commaunded his apostles to offer a true proper sacrifice in his last supper
the maior of this latter sylogisme proue because except christ had not offered in this manner in his last supper he had neuer performed the function of a true preist according to the order of melchisadec
neither had he properlie verified fulfilled the figure of the pasquall lambe
nor could he haue truelie affirmed his bloud in his last supper to be the bloud of the new testament if he had not offered then both bodie bloud in sacrifice

moreouer the euanglist luke relating the institution of the eucharist vnder the forme of wine affirmes our sauior to haue vsed these wordes
this chalis is the new testament in my bloud which is shed for you

in which wordes both the worde shed which is the present

tense as also the relatiue which which according to the greek text which our aduersaries most esteme followe must of necessitie haue relation to the present sheding of the cup or chalis like wise those wordes for you manifestly conclude that our sauiour did then in that solemne action of his last supper sacrifice his bloud the same is of his bodie of which the same luke saith in the present tense which is giuen for you yea say all the circumstances plainely demonstrate to all vnobstinate mindes that christ did truely properly sacrifice his bodie bloud when he instituted deliuered the eucharist to his apostles with an expresse commaundement to doe the same
and hence it necessarily followes that tho eucharist is a true proper sacrifice of the new testame~t as often as it is celebrated by preists according to the institutio precept of christ

an other argument to proue that the eucharist is a proper sacrifice frame thus
that is a proper sacrifice in which a victime or hoaste is receiued as a thing offered of giuen for the receiuers in honor of god
but in the eucharist the victime or hoast of christs bodie bloud is receiued as a thing offered or giuen for the receiuers in honor of god
ergo the eucharist is a proper sacrifice

in the maior there is no doubt as conceiue

the minor in which the controuersie standes
proue first because luke affirmes christ to haue said
this is my bodie which is giuen for you

and the like he saith of the chalis in the manner aboue declared according to the phrase of the greeke text
and according to this sense of the euangelist augustin in the
booke
chapters of his confessions relates that his mother day lie serued the altar in which she did knowe the holie victime or hoaste to be dispensed or ministred
now that ther is oblation in the eucharist the verie nature of the matter doth plainely argue for that where a victime or hoaste is ther of necessitie must be immolation as being correlatiues the one in respect of the other yea and immolation necessarily includes oblatio for the sanie reason of correlation moreouer both these are included in consecration which by the power of gods worde maketh present the bodie and bloud of christ in such a manner as they may be decently conueniently consummated by participation of the sacrament

and in this sorte the eucharist included all those conditions which a proper sacrifice euen according to our aduersaries at least the lutherans ought to haue
first the substance of the hoaste or victim
secondly a certaine ryte or action of offering prescribed by god which is the celebration of the eucharist instituted by

christ in the forme described by the euangelists the apostle paule

thirdly the person offering deputed by god to that function which is the preist
fourthly
the same intention of offering or the same end which is appointed by god in his worde that is to the honor of god for the representation of the passion of christ
neyther is it necessarie that all these particulars be contained in the institution in expresse wordes but it is sufficient that they be included in it in some intelligible manner
otherwises it followes that the passion of christ had ben no true proper sacrifice because he vsed not the wordes offer or sacrifice when he suffered vpon the crosse which sequele am persuaded our aduersaries will not graunte

diuers other places of scripture ar alledged by bellarmin other diuines for the proofe of this point but for the auoy dance of prolixitie will conclude with that onely of the
chapter of the acts
where for the ordination of paule bernabe it is related that the apostles were ministing to our lord fasting
now to minister to our lord can not consist either in prayer onely or in singing uf psalmes which needed no kynde of ministration more then opening their mouthes hartes wher as yet the worde ministere doth necessarily include some externall ryte more the that as the greke

worde undefined span alphabet doth clearely denote signifie
and therfore erasmus a great fauorit of the nouellists doubted not plainely to translate for the wordes ministantibus domino sacrificeing to god

to the authoritie of scriptures will here adde such testimonies of ancient fathers as haue not yet cited such as being within the compasse of the fiue priuatiue ages clearly testifie the eucharist to be a sacrifice cyprian saith thus who is more preist dei summi of the cheefe god our lord iesus christ

who offered sacrifice to god the father offered that same which melchisedech offered to wit bread wine that is his bodie bloud
which wordes ar so plaine that they forced the centurists to confesse of this father
that he affirmed the preist to performe the office of christ offer sacrifice to god the father
now if according to cyprian the preist performes the office of christ offers sacrifice as the centurians confesse of

cyprian doubtlesse it is no other but the eucharist which he offereth

the glorious martyr hypotelicus in his oratio of antichrist introduceth christ saying to the prests of he newe testament in the day of iudgement come you
rashops preist who dayly immolatedor facrificed my pretions bodie bloud in the world

ambrose vpon the psalme we did se saith he the paince of preists coming vnto vs wi did se

him heare him offering for vs his bloud
let vs preists followe him that we may offer sacrifice vnto him for altho we be infirme or weake in merit yet ar we honorable in sacrifice for altho christ doth not at the leaste as they conceiue now seeme to offer yet he is offered on earth when christs boilie is offered
yea he is manifested to offer in vs whose wordedoth sanctifie the sacrifice which is offered

gregorie nyssene in his first oration vpon the resurrection hath these memorable wordes
for inthat ineffable secret to men inuisible manner of sacrifice by his diuine ordinance he doth prcoccupate the violent brunt offers him selfe for vs being both victim oblation both preist lambe of god
when did this happen when he exhibited his bodie to be eaten his bloud to be drunken by his familiar freindes

chrysostome in his

homilie vpon the first to the corinthians speaking of christ saith that he commaunded himselfe to be offered iusteed of brute beastes
and in another place he speaketh thus
the sacred oblation it selfe whether peter or paul or of what merit soeuer the preist is who offers it is the same which christ himselfe gaue to his disciples which now also preists make this hath nothing lesse them that
why so because men doe not sacrifice this but christ who had consecrated it before

augustin in diuers places of his workes but most clearely in his second sermon vpon

the psalme
of our sauior saith thus in plaine termes
he christ instituted a sacrifice of his bodie bloud according to the order of melchisadech

and conformable to this the same augustin in his
epistle affirmes the sacrifice of vs catholike christians to be demonstrated not onely by the euangelicall but also by the propheticall bookes
also in his
chapter of his
bookes of the citie of god he hath most expresse wordes to the same purpose which because they are somat large otherwise well knowne omit them to be viewed by the reader if he please

leo the great also one of the writers of the fift age in his seuenth sermon of the passion teaches that the sacrifices of the old lawe yealded or gaue place to the sacrifice of the eucharist as the shadow to the bodie
his wordes at these
wherfore to the end that the shadowes should yeald to the bodie images to the presence of veritie or truth the ancient obseruance is taken a way with a newe sacrament one hoaste is changed in to an other bloud doth exclude bloud the legall sestinitie while it is changed is fulfilled
and some lines after he addes but iesus knowing certainely his counsell being vndaunted in the ordinance of has father did consu~mate the old testament instituted the newe pasque for his disciples being set to eate the mysticall supper when in the courte of carphas it was consulted how christ

should be put to death he ordaiding the sacrament of his bodie bloud did teach in what manner an hoaste was to be offered to god

and the same father in an other place ordaining that more masses then one be celebrated in one the same church when one doth not serue by reason of the multitude of the pleople saith thus
our will is that when the solemnitie of afeast hath drawne such a multitude of faithfull persons together as the church can not receiue let then the oblation of the sacrifice be vndoubtedly reiterated or repeated
since it is a thing full of pietie reason that so often as the church is filled with newe people so often an other following sacrifice be offered
for it must needs be that some parte of the people be depriued of their deuotio if the custome of celebrating one onely masse obserued they onely that come first may offer the sacrifice
thus this ancient graue father in whose wordes oblation sacrifice of the masse ar three seuerall tymes repeated

isichius or hesichius who liued aboute the same tyme hath these wordes touching the same matter

our lord being at supper with his disciples first with the figuratiue lambe afterwardes offered his owne sacrifice

rupert in like manner speaketh of the same sacrifice saying
our lord being in the agome of his passion first immolated or sacrificed him selfe to god the father with his owne proper bandes taking bread

now to co~clude since the testimonies of these fathers doctors of the primatiue church ar both most ancient as being all included in the circle of the first fiue hundreth yeares next succeeding to the time of christ his apostles

also they being so plaine pregnant that a cheefe aduersarie was forced to confesse that ther is frequent mention in the ancient writers treaking of the eucharist of the wordes sacrifice oblation hoaste victim to which may be added that the same fathers in like manner vse the wordes altar preist verie commonly all which ar so fit for the purpose of signifiing a true proper sacrifice that no writer either diuine or profane could euer inuent other more significant apte as it vndoubtedly appeares for that their writings manifest that they neuer vsed anie other wordes or phrases when they treated of the nature vse of a proper sacrifice since this say is so apparently true ernestly request of my reader to consider how voyde not onely of reason but also of common sense the sectaries of this our present age may iustely be iudged how shamelesly obstinate they be who denie that to be a true proper sacrifice which is as plainely affirmed to be such both by scripture it selfe the true interpreters ther of as in wordes phrases they possible could declare to humane sense vnderstanding
and with

this conclude the proofe of the maior of my sixt last argument framed directly against the english relion hence passe to the second parte of my treatise in which will positiuely demonstrate by six other affirmatiue arguments the truth of the roman faith nowe professed in the greater parte of the christian world framing compounding my silogismes of the contradictorie propositions to those which haue vsed before for the confutation of the english faith in this insuing manner

the second parte of the conviction containing the defensiue arguments
epigraph

adhuc excellentiorem viam vobis demonstro

cor

altho in realitie rigor of truth especially for the more learned sorte of people ther is no necessitie of other proofe of the truth of the roman catholike faith then the disproofe which haue alreadie made of the english religion in regarde that ther being onely their religion ours here in question theirs being false as haue plainely demonstrated ours must by vnauoy dable consequence be true supposing two contradictories cannot be both true in one and

the same matter or subiect neuerthelesse for greater satisfaction of the reader more cleare conuincement of the truth will breefely proceed by positiue affirmatiue arguments in defence of the roman faith religion

the hrst principal argvment
propounde my first sylogisme in this forme manner
that onely religion is true which is truely catholike
but the roman religion onely is truly catholike
therefore the roman religion is the onely true religion
the maior needs no proofe as being graunted by our aduersaries being once admitted with the minor the other doth thence necessarily follow according to the rules of logike which teaches that the premisses being true truely disposed the consequence cannot faile

the minor which our antagonists denye prone because the roman religion onely hath all the conditions required to true cathoe that is it hath vniuersalitie of matter

or obiect of faith it hath vniuersallitie of time place persons that professe it also it hath vniuersallitie of the rule or reason which directs the professors in the confession exercise of their faith with all it hath vnitie in the same

and first that the roman religion hath vniuersallitie in matter it is most manifest for that the aduersaries them selues can not denye but that it conprehendeth by faith beleeueth not onely all that is contained in the scriptures but also what soeuer els is proposed by their church as matter of faith comprehended either in the written worde of god or diuine traditions which are the vnwritten worde of god which is the most large compleit vniuersallitie of faith that can be imagined to the latitude of which the obiect or matter of the english faith comes not neare as being by them limited to the bare scriptures onely
as likewise because they denie points which the roman church maintaines for matters of faith
as ar purgatorie prayer to saincts

secondly
that the roman religion hath vniuersallitie in the rule or reason which guideth the professors of it in their true beleefe it is also euident in regarde they neither beleeue nor refuse beleeue anie thing as matter of faith for anie other immediate motiue or cause then for that it is proposed vnto them by the

infallible authoritie of their church to be beleeued or not to be beleeued as the worde of god which is the prime formall obiect of their faith which generallitie or vniuersalitie of rule is so great solid that it is inpossible to imagin anie more ample perfect in that nature

thirdly
this most constant vnuariable vniuersallitie of the totall rule of faith as it is but one onely in it selfe so doth one onely agreeable vniforme consent of faith necessarily flowe issue out of it as frome a most cleare fountaine which is vnitie in the same faith among all euerie one of the professors of it supposing that according to true philosophie where the formall obiect is one the actions tho neuerso manie must of necessitie be of one the same species or nature that which in supernaturall faith is yet more certaine apparent by reason the obiect of it is exceedingly more vniforme vnuariable then anie naturall obiect is

fourthly
vniuersallitie of tyme place persons is so manifestly founde in the roman religion that the aduersaries them selues confesse that ther hath ben euer a visible roman religion in the world from the tyme of the apostles euen to this present day which yet if they were so impudent as to denie all histories all writings all acts monuncents euen

the verie stones them selues in manie places would quite conuince confounde them
onely one exception or euasion they haue to wit by alledgeing that altho the roman church for the space of the fiue hundreth first yeares was a true church yea the mother church of all the rest of the particular christian churches

as great king iames doth ingenuously confesse yet say they hath it since fayled in faith of the church of christ is turned in to the seat of antichrist viz when phocas the emperour gaue vnto boniface the third pope of that name the title of vniuersall bishop

this therefore is our aduersaries common allegation for proofe of the supposed defection of the roman church in matters of faith but so feeble friuolous false that both they themselues if they were not verie bleareyed all others might as it were in a miroir or perspectiue glasse clearely discouer this by the viewe of the successe of times to be but false colors painting whereby to limme their owne inexcusable defection from that faith which they founde vniuersallie established in the christian world when their first founders began to broach their owne pretended reformation

for first say that if for either phocas to giue or bonifacius to take the title of vniuersall bishop were to reuolt or make a defection

from the true faith or church then should the whole generall councell of calcedon haue reuolted from the true faith by offering to attribute it to pope leo

as sainct gregorie doth testifie if this had ben so hainous a busines as our aduersaries contend it is temeritie to affirme or imagine that so famous a councell consisting of so manie graue learned bishops both grecians latin which our aduersaries themselues admit for legitimate would euer haue as much as mentioned such a matter

secondlie
this being a matter of fact which can not be decided by either scriptures or ancient fathers or the primatiue ages in regarde it is knowne to haue happened after them both our onelie iudges must be those historians who haue made relation of this passage
now those relators which are anastasius bibliothecarius pulus diaconus ado venerable beda none of them affirme either that phocas did giue boniface anie authoritie of primacie which he had not afore nor yet doe they or laye anie censure vpon the one or the other for that action whatsouer it was

thirdlie
certaine it is that neither boniface nor anie of his successors euer either claimed or vsed in their publike acts or writings thetitle of vniuersall bishop but rather all of them humble themselues so farre as they ordinarilie

stile themselues no other then seruants of the seruants of god howsoeuer that title stile might be offered them or vsed by others for their greater honor authoritie

fourthly
suppose pope boniface others his successors had accepted vsed the title of vniuersall bishop meane in a true sense that is so as vniuersall bishop signifies onelie bishop or pastor of the vniuersall church what great odious crime had this ben therefore to deserue the name of antichrist or vsurper of the supremicie in the vniuersall church since that both the title of head of the vniuersall church the authoritie also of the head was attributed vnto precedent popes long before the time of phocas

as doth appeare not onelie by the testimonies of two famous emperours iustinian valentinian but also by the acts of the chalcedon councels that title is acknowledged in plaine termes
in so much that euen in those prime ages it was turned in to a common prouerbe that the first seat that is the roman seat was to beiudged by noman

fiftlie if pope boniface is to be accounted antichrist by the professors of the english religion because they feigne him to haue vsurped the title power of vniuersall bishop how pray will their kings escape the same censure who haue receiued the title power of the head of the english church from their predecessor

king henrie the
who neuerthelesse had no more power nay much lesse to conferre it vpon them then the emperour phocas had to declare the same or the like to be due to the pope

lastelie
the truth is that it is not founde in anie of the foresaid historiographers or anie others of the roman religion that phocas gaue to the pope eyther the power or yet the title of vniuersall bishop but they relate onelie that phocas by his imperial edict did declare against the presumption of iohn patriarch of constantinople that this title of head or bishop of the vniuersall church was proper to the bishop of rome but not to him or anie other moreouer that it was no way due to the bishops of the constantinopolitan seat or church
and this onelie the cited authors relate without anie mention of the wordes vniuersall bishop but onelie they mention the wordes primate prime seat head of the churches or the like phrases as may be seene in their bookes
so that this is a grosse imposture of the nouellists of our time in vsing the testimonies of these graue authors against the popes of rome by miere cheating cousinage by this meanes in steed of prouing their intent they proue nothing els but themselues to be miere sycophants deceiuers to whome supposing they publish to the world

the forsaid supposititious change of religion made by pope boniface in the roma church without either diuine or humane testimonie more then their owne presumed presumptious authoritie no prudent christian ought to giue anie more credit then he giues to the incredulous impious iewes who calumniate christ as a peruerter of the lawe of god because he established his owne most perfect church religion in lieu of their ceremoniall synogog
and by this it is cleare that the minor proposition of this my first argument standes still firme vnanserable to wit that the roman religion onelie is euer was truelie catholike which is that here intend to demonstrate

the second principal argvment
this my second argument reduce to this forme of sylogisme
that onelie religion is true which hath the true canon of scripture
but the roman religion onelie hath the true canon of scripture
therefore the roman religion onelie is the true religion

the maior doubtlesse is graunted as certaine by our aduersaries wherefore it needes no further proofe

the minor which knowe they denie proue because the roman church onelie hath that same canon of scripture which hath ben generallie receiued in the church both before since the time of sainct augustin who in his second booke of christian doctrine hath the verie same number names of volumes which at this present the roman church vseth in formor ages vsed since the time of the apostles

which canonical bookes sainct augustin receiued from the councell of carthage this councell from pope the first of that name who also had them as descending by tradition of all or at the least of the cheefe greater parte of the church since they were deliuered to it by the apostles as haue more largelie declared in the confutation of the english canon in which point need not insiste anie longer because the same arguments which vsed for disproofe of it abundantelie serue for the proofe of the minor proposition of this my positiue argument to wit that the roman church onelie hath that same canon of scripture completly intirely which hath ben euer most generallie receiued in the christian world

the third principal argvment
my third reason for demonstration of the trueth of the roman religion is this
that religion onely is true which hath the true interpretation sense of scripture
but the roman religion onely hath the true interpretation sense of scripture
therfore the roman religion onely is the true religion

the maior of this silogisme is allowed for true questionlesse by both parties
the minor onely is in contronersie for the more cleare proofe of which it is to be supposed that both parties agree in this point to wit that that church onely hath the true infallible interpretation sense of scripture which hath the infallible assistance of the holie cost in that action altho in deed this argreement well considered is onely in wordes for not obstanding this it yet further remaineth controuersed betwixt vs our aduersaries in whome this speciall assistance of the diuine spirit resides whether in prelates pastors of the church duely bled or in ee particular

person of the church
in which controuersie neuerthelesse both parties yet further accorde that whersoeuer the foresaid true inspuration of god doth assist ther onely is the true interpretation of the diuine worde

besides this it is to be supposed that ther ar two manners or two sortes of meanes or wayes by which people attaine to the true vnderstanding sense of the scriptures
the one is by a sole conference of one place of scripture with another by euerie priuat christia man or woma learned or vnlearned by reading the bare text of the scripture iudging of the sense according to the spirit which guides them good or bad
the other way or manner of exposition is performed not by a miere solitarie or priuate conference comparison of places of scripture one with another but both by comparing or collating them in that maner also by an exacte viewe of the expositions of the holie learned fathers or doctors of all former tymes succeeding ages euen to the present tyme in which the expounders liue which forme of proceeding as it is most mainfest neither is to be performed by euerie priuate person authe~tically with infallible certainelie but by the publike pastors of the church especially by the cheefe pastor of it
now this being noted aduertised proue the of my argume~t her silogisme in manner

that church hath the true interpretation

sense of scripture which receiueth it from the preists prelates pastors especially the cheefe pastor of the church succeeding linially fro the apostles by conference of places viewe of expositions of the holie fathers doctors of all successiue ages from the apostles to the end of he world not by euerie priuat man or woman

but the roman church onely receines the interpretation sense of scripture frome the preists prelates pastors especially the cheese pastor of the church in the forsaid manner
ergo the roman church onely hath the true interpretation sense of scripture
the major of this silogisme in which the difficulte co~sistes could proue first by scriptures which both in the old newe testament assigne this facultie power to preists bishops pastors as gouerners rules of the church with a strict commaunde for the people to obey them
but because not here professe to make exact large discourse vpon that point but onely intend breefely to make good iustifie my former argumentation therfore remit the rest of the places of scripture which could alledge to be se as they at cited declared by bellarmin other diuines will vrge onely that one text of paule in his epistle to the ephesians which is most cleare pregnant for this purpose

wherfore in his

chapter of this epistle speaking of the institution of the ecclesiasticall hierarchie by christ he saith thus
and he gaue some apostles some prophets other some euangelists others pastors doctors to the consummatior of the saints vnto the worke of the ministrie vnto the edification of the bodie of christ vntill we meet all into the vnitie of faith knowledge of the sonne of god into a perfect man into the of the age of the fulnes of christ that now we be not children wauering with euerie winde of doctrine in the wickednes of men in craftines of the circumuention of error
by which wordes it is manifest that our sauior among the rest appointed pastors doctors them not onely for the ecclesiasticall gouernement of the church but also to deliuer the true doctrine of christ to the people least if they were left to them selues in that particular of the knowledge of the true faith they should fall into errors this was thus ordained by christ not for anie limited tyme but eue vnto the consummation of the world in all ages
by which it is euident that since christ our sauior as the apostle relates point this order subordination of the cgie in his church for the gouernement instruction of the members therof in true faith perfection of virtuous life as superiors to whome he commaunded them to obey according to that of the apostle

obedite prepositis subiacete eis
it is say by necessarie consequence most manifest that christs diuine pleasure also was that the common people should not be their owne caruers but should receiue the interpretation sense of his diuine worde from those whome he himselfe designed for their rulers superiors in all matters concerning the safetie of their soules supposing as a certaine euident trueth that the whole structure perfection of a christian faith life doth necessarily depened vpon the orthodoxe sense meaning of the worde of god
that which the generall perpetuall practice of the church from tyme to tyme doth manifestly conuince which in all occasions of controuersie in matters of faith manners hath vsed no other proceeding then by assembling of councels consisting of the prelates pastors cheefely of the cheefe supreme pastors the bishops of rome according to their seuerall tymes standings for deciding of doubdts questions broached by erroneous teachers that by declaration of the true se~se of those places of scripture aboute which the controuersie was begun
for so did the generall councell of nyce vnder pope siluester expounde declare to the whole church euerie particular member therof the true sense of those wordes pater me est
and in the first councell of constantinople

vnder pope damasus those

ego dominus formans tonitru creans spiritum
and those spiritus pronobis
in the councell of ephesus vnder pope celestin against nestorius those

deus deus meus quare me dereliquisti
and those habitu inuentus vt homo
in the councell of chalcedon vnder pope leo against entyches those

verhum carofactum est

to this adde consent of fathers who write of this matter generally teaching this same doctrine

irenaeus in his booke against heresies saith thus
we ought not still to seeke for the trueth others which may easily befounde in the church since the apostles haue most abundantly deposited in it as in a rich storchouse all things appertaining to truth

that all those that will may receiue liquore of life for it is the entrance into life all others are robbers

in which wordes it is plaine that by the church irenaeus vnderstandes no other then the bishops cheefe pastors from whome as he teaches the rest of the people must receiue their doctrine
and therefore he addes in another place that those meaning bishops who haue succession from the apostles ioyntly with the succession of their episcopate or bishoprie receiued a certaine grace or gifte of trueth according to the pleasure of god the father

and in this same matter in like forte augustin speaketh in his first tenth chapter

of his seco~d booke against iulian saying in the first place
am now to perfurme that which is put in the third place of my disposition which is to subutrter destroye by the sentenees of bishops whoe haue handled the scriptures with great commendation or glorie by the assistance of god thy machinations iuan
and a little after he addes of the same bishps doctors

saying whom christian people ought to antepose or prefer before your profane nouelties adhere to them rather then to you
by which wordes augustin whoe euen in our aduersaries iudgement is a faithfull witnes of antiquitie plainely testifies what the practise of the ancie~t church was in this particular of the peoples receiuing the scriptures expositio sense from their superiors not from anie other priuate person or euerie one by his owne reading industrie how soeuer he may seeme to haue the spirit of god for interpretation of his worde

and now by this to omit of her testimonies of fathers to this purpose which cannot be included in so smale a compasse conclude the whole confirmation force of my silogisme assuring my selfe that none of solid iudgement can firmely persuade themselues how beit for temporall respects to accommodate themselues to the current of the time they may exteriorly professe the contrarie to be credible that christ our sauiour whose wisdome was

diuine infinit should haue taught the professors of his faith to playe euerie man in his humor with the sacred scripture to haue co~mitted the true authenticall exposition of it to euerie iack gill rather them to his· preists bishops cheefe commaunders of his church in a linial succession from the apostles as being publike visible ministers to whom it should obey especially in matters of faith saluation

the fovrth principall argvment
my fourth argument for positiue proofe of the roman religion is as followeth
that religion onely is true which hath a publike knowne rule of faith
but the roman religion onely hath a publike knowne rule of faith
to roman religion onely is the true religion

touching the filogisme ther may seeme to be controuersie betwixt vs the nouelists

both in the maior the minor wherefore will proue them both seuerall tho breefely as the nature of my disputation requires

the maior proposition proue aduertising the reader by the way that by a publike rule of faith meane such a rule as is cognoscible or as may be knowne to all sortes of people as well those which are alreadie members of the true church faith as also to others who as yet being out of it desire by their conuersion to be receiued into it
this supposed argue in this manner
it is a necessarie propertie of the true religio to haue a publike knowne rule of faith
therefore the true religion necessarily hath a publike knowne rule of faith

the antecendent of the argument in which onely the difficultie of it co~sists proue because if the true religion hath not a publike knowne rule of faith it is impossible for such as want it to finde it in regarde that finding cannot be had but by seeking

to seeke or inquire for that which is not so publike that it can possible be found is to seeke not to finde consequently to labore in vaine
now true religion is of it owne nature such as may befound by those who endeuore to knowe it as day lie experience doth teach
and therfore our sauior saith quaerite inuenietis seeke you shall finde which sentence being generall it

cannot be more comodiouslie vnderstanded then of true religion as being the most important businesse which people can inquire for or seeke in this world as being the onelie way to saluation

concerning the minor of both my sylogismes which in substance are one the same proposition to wit that the roman religion onelie hath the necessarie propertie of a true religion and not the english faith that is a publike knowne rule of faith it is most euident for that the rule of faith which the roman church proposeth to be followed is the worde of god expounded by the publike visible knowne authoritie of the bishops pastors of the most vniuersall church in the manner forme aboue declared in my precedent demonstration and not as the professors of the english religion teach to wit by euerie priuate person in a sense secret onelie knowne to him who hath it which cannot possible be anie more vnderstanded or perceiued by others then the most secret cogitations of an others mynde all which as it plainelie appeareth is quite repugnant as it were doth directly intercept the meanes ordained by god for the saluation of soules who out of his infinit bountie mercie hath prouided a way to paradise so plaine perspicious that euen children may be able to finde

walkein
and now by this the force of my fift argument remaines confirmed established the trueth of the roman religion conuinced

the fift principal argvment
my fift positiue argument propose in this manner
that religion onelie is true which hath a perpetuall disinterrupted succession of true bishops preists deriued from the apostles
but the roman religion onelie hath a perpetuall disinterupted succession of true bishops preists deriued from the apostles
ergo the roman religion onelie is the true religion
the maior knowe not certainelie whether the aduersaries will grant or no but in case they denie it haue sufficientlie proued it before in my demonstration of their want of succession

the minor in which the controuersie either intirely or cheesely consistes proue first by

the same reasons arguments conuinced in the fifte principall sylogisme of the first parte of this treatise that the english religion hath no such succession from whence vpon the in which we both agree that there is no other true religion but theirs or ours it infalliblie followes that the roman religion onlie hath perpetuall succession of prelates pastors

secondly
proue this succession in the roman church by graunt of all or the greater parte of the aduersaries who most ordinarilie vse to distinguish betwixt succession of persons succession of doctrine leauing the first for vs claiming the second to themselues altho most falselie as haue sufficiently demonstrated in my negatiue argument vpon this point
yet if anie be so obstinate as to denie the continuall succession of pastors in the roman church let him onelie read sainct augustin's epistle to generosus he will finde by him related the names of all the bishops of rome from sainct peter to pope anastasius who the did sit as cheefe pastor in the church of rome
and the rest of the roman bishops names he may finde in diuers moderne histories or chronologies particularlie in platina onuphrius yea in the centurists or centuators who notobstanding they be aduersaries yet we are content to admit them

for our iudges in this particular of the personall succession of pastors in the church of rome
and now by this that which haue treated touching this same matter in my negatiue argument framed against the english religion in the first parte of my disputation this argument also is sufficientlie declared to be sounde of approued force efficacie

the sixt principal argvment
frame my sixt last principall argument in this manner
that onelie religion is true which hath practiseth a true proper externall sacrifice
but the roman religion onelie hath practiseth a true proper externall sacrifice
ergo the roman religion onelie is the true religion

the maior which onelie is in question haue largelie proued alreadie in the declaration confirmation of my negatiue argument propounded against the english religion in this point
to which adde that externall sacrifice is the essentiall parte of the externall seruice of

god the verie quintessence of religion ordained for a speciall acknowledgement of his supreme power dominion maiestie
and althou it is true that christ our sauior offered himselfe in sacrifice vpon the crosse for the reconciliation of humane nature which sacrifice was of farre greater estimation value in the sight of god then all the oblations sacrifices of the old testament therefore had no necessitie to be offered more then once neuerthelesse because this sacrifice was onelie or cheefelie for the redemption of man kynde was not offered by vs but by him alone for vs therefore it was further conuenient necessarie that besides that singular diuine oblation there should be a quotidian daylie sacrifice in the church on our partes both for a perpetuall memorie of the former

also for an externall protestation of our owne infirmitie the soueraine power maiestie of him who created vs conserueth vs by his continuall prouidence manutention for a signe testimonie of our gratitude towardes him from whome we receiue essence life motion

sacrifice onelie is an honor peculiar to god alone of which he himselfe saith honorem meum alteri non dabo
all other sortes of honor as prayers prayse of their owne qualitie nature

ar common to creatures for we may lawfullie both praye prayse mortall men euen in this world but sacrifice vnto them we can not no not to the greatest angell or saint in heauen
and in this cheefelie consistes the error of gentils pagan people which had not ben so grosse if they had not sacrificed to creatures but onelie giuen them supreme honor of laude prayer
it seemes the verie instinct of nature tought men to sacrifice to god that god sacrifice in some sorte ar correlatiues according to the sayeing of god himselfe of himselfe
si dominus sum vbi est honor meus that worde meus significes propertie in other things much more in this of sacrifice
hence it is that no natio was euer so barbarous which if it did acknowledge anie kynde of god thou neuer so false absurde did not honore him with sacrifice
and surely they commit no lesse crime them heigh treason against the diuine supremacie who depriue god of the honor of sacrifice yea doublesse they take a course to extinguish by degrees the memorie of that attribute open the way to athisme who extinguish the exercise of an externall sacrifice
if in the tyme of the old testament sacrifices were so frequent when god almightie conferred his giftes with a scarce sparing much more freque~tly with farre more

deuotion perfection ought a sacrifice to be offered in the lawe of christ which is by excellencie named the lawe of grace because of the infinit abundance of graces fauors benefits which god powereth vpon those who embrace the true faith religion supposing that by how much the gifts be greater by so much the acknowledgment ought to be more exact accurate

now for conclusion of my whole treatise aduertice the reader that haue put all my arguments in such a forme of sylogisme as is most cleare obuious of that nature that if the premisses be once graunted for true the consequence most vndoubtedlie followes
they be also in a mode figure most knowne common
for these termes that religion are to be accepted for a kynde of vniuersal or indefinit subiect as signifying one among manie indeterminately so euery sylogisme is in darij which both in mode figure is one of the plaineth formes
which forme of argument iudged most fit for my purpose in respect my cheefe designe in this matter is to conuince the vnderstanding of the more intelligent scholasticall sorte of people in the truth of the roman religion falsitie of the contrarie who if they haue so much ingenuitie in them as to yeald to

the truth when by iudicious meditation pondering of the premisses they shall finde it discouered set in their seight doubt not but they will perceiue themselues by force of the consequences concluded captiuated in obedience of faith which is that onelie honor or profit hope desire to reape of my labors

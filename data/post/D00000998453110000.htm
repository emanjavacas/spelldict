The whiche preserueth man fro deth Unto the vertue who so take hede That in a gardyne amyd of Nazareth fayre somtyme gan to sprynge a sprede That thorowe the worlde both in lengthe brede The fleshe odoure and the swetnesse Hs comforteth of all hupnesse.
Nazareth with bethlem the besyde This the maketh of name more Than other Rome: and full of pryde myghty Troye with the wall renowne holdeth to be peregall In honour pryce or reuerence Unto your passynge worthy excellence.
If for the fruyte co~mendyd be the tree Thou hast more laude and commendacion For thy floure sprynge out of the Than hath Ausike or worthy Scipyon: Of Rome Cesar or of Fabyon Though her names were sotyme graue in golde Her ydel fame to thyne may not be colde Therfore reioyse and be right glad and light Nazareth of name moste flourynge: For out of the floure moste fayre of sight Moste full of grace somtyme dyd sprynge Of the whiche fully remembrynge So longe agone spake holy ysaie When that he sayd in his prophecie.
That on this floure playnly sholde reste The holy ghost for his chosen place As for the fayrest and also for the beste That euer was and moste full of grace Whose passynge beaute no stormes may defface But euer a lyke contynueth fresshe of hewe Withouten fadynge the coloure is so trewe.
For this is floure that god hymselfe behelde The whyte Lelye of the chosyn vale The swete Rose of the fayre felde Whiche of colour waxith neuer pale The vyolet our langour to auale Purpyll he wyd thorowe mercy and pyte To socoure all that in mischyefe be.
And from the stocke of Ioachym and Anne This holy floure had her origynall To hym afore by signe shewyd whan The angell tolde hym playnly that there shall Of hym be borne a mayde inspeciall Chosen of god most chiefe of her alye And for her mekenesse hyght shall Marye.
And whan the Angell at the yate of golde Had of this mayde the byrth prophected And all the maner of hem bothe tolde In bokes olde as it is specifyed Home to her house anone they haue them byed she conceyueth this faythfull treue wyfe Ioachym the holy truyte of lyfe.

This is to saye the holy dawnynge Of th mayde of her natiuyte The nyght gan voyde of our olde mornynge Is the Angell in fygure dydse With suche a touche made Iacob be Sore: in his senewes lyke as it is founde In me~bre where lust doth moste habde.

Howe our lady was oyd in to the temple Capi. .iii.
ANd alter thre yere was the vsage moders she left as in sowk than in her age Unto the temple they brynge vnto god they made osterynge this mayde for to abyde there With other maydensÂ· that in the temple were.
And not withstandyng her passyng tendernes youthe but of ys thre goddes helpe this braunche of holines Withouten helpe went vp gree by alo that all myghten se that aulter grete an hight And whan her moder therof had asight.
For veray ioye anone she a downe And sayd thus that all my gen here God from aboue herde Of his goodnes and graunted my prayer And comforted In syg of hem that at my payne And of at me Nowe hath he ben my synguler refute To my trystesse For he hath made the to bere Thorowe his myghty vitacion And made clere my confusyon And all me woo for to ouergone Onely by grace amyd all my fone.
And thorowe his myght hertes hath bowyd Of hym that gan to chace at my pryde Wherfore she hathe vnto god auowyd That her doghter shall in the temple abyde The holy ghoste for to be her guyde For euer more by godes purueyaunce Thorowe her mekenesse hym to do plesaunce.
Forth all her lyfe there to slepe and wake Hym for to serue with humble That all maydens myght ensample take Of her alone to lyue in clennes And specially of her porte tnaunce and chere If that hym lest of herthey myght lere.
Full of vertue of all outrage Her herte was that god to dwelle in there And day day as she in age Ryght so in vertue gan she to encreace And nyght ne daye wolde she neuer ceace To exclude slouthe and vyces to werraye With hande to worche or with mouthe to praye.
For but in god her herte nought delyteth So vpon hym entierly was her thought And frome aboue by grace he her vysiteth That euery thynge but hym she set at nought Of worldly lust she hathe so lytell thought That out of mynde she let it euer slyde That nought but god maye in her abyde.
And whan that she xv. yere dyd attayne She was as sad in conuersacion And also demure sothely for to sayne From all chyldehede and dissolution In gouernaunce and discresion And in talkynge as wyse and sage As any mayde of thyrty yere of age.
ANd of her rule this was her vsage From day to day this holy mayde entyere From pryme at morne by contynuaunce Tyll thre of the bell to be in her prayere And tyll the sonne was at mydday spere On golde and siluer on wulles soe With her handes she wolde wyrche ofte.
And From god Whiche that Thankynge And after anone this may de is went Agayne to tyll went to And at with hym she toke her reste.
This lyfe she and this In whome was yet founde offence And neuer man sawe this mayde But eu meke and of Of herte clene and pu of concience This lyfe she led and as teche Of wordes and of speche.
The meate also that was to her brought Out of the for With herte and with a thought To poore and that lyd in To it was all hee plesaunce And who that of her has a syght Of all dysease was made gl and lyght.
And euery wyght greuyd with sekenes touche of her hem hole anone And they at were in thought and in Whan they her malyce was agone And thus she was to euery Of all ryte and remedye With a of her godely eye.
And of this as it is tolde Her godely face was so full of lyght That no man myght susteyne to For it was clerer than the sonne bryght That the crowne in the wynters nyght Of Adryanne ne of the sterres seuen To her fayrnes ne be not for to neuen.
Yet neuer man tempted was to synne Whyle he behelde on her goodely face The holy ghost so hoole was her within That all enuyrone spredde gan his grace Where that she was present in the place For alway god gaue her to her presence So fulsome lyght of heuenly influence.
Ne none so fayre was neuer founde in ryme As was that mayde of Iuda and Syon The doughter chosen of Iherusalem Of Dauidis sede to besette alone Of all maydens to She bare the pryse as well in fayrnes As she excelled in vertue and goodnes.
Let be thou grece and speke not of Eleyne Ne thou Troye of yonge Pollycene Ne Rome of Lucresse with her eyen tweyne Ne thou Cartage of the fresshe quene Dido that was somtyme so fayre to sene Let be your boost and take of hem no hede Whose beauce fayleth as floure in frosty mede.
And Iudith And of And Rachell fayre Iacob can you tell But she alone of womanhede the well Of bounte beaute that neuer fade may Nought lyke a floure th storysshed but in maye.
Passeth echone bothe nyghe and ferre Bothe in fayrnes and in perfeccion Ryght as the sonne doth a lytell sterre And as the Rubye hathe the renowne Of stones all and domynacion Ryght so this mayde to speke of holynes Of women all is lady and maystres.
Of whom spake somtyme wyse Salamon In sapience woso lyste to seke That she was chosen for herselfe alone This whyte downe with her meke Whose chekes weren hee beaute for to eke with lylyes meynte fresshe roses reed This is to say who so can take hede.
Fyrst with the Rose: of womanly sufferaunce And with the fayre lylye next of chastyte She was ennewed to yeue her suffysaunce As well in goodnes as in beaute And as he sayeth she fayrer was Than Pheus platly or Lucyne With hornes full of heuen whan they shyne.
And of this mayde as saynt sayth In his writtynge her beaute to Of face fayre but fayrer yet of fayth He sayth: she was this holy pure virgyne Whose chaste herte to nothynge dyd enclyne For all her beaute: but to holynes Of whome also this auctour sayth expres.
That she was doughter of Dauid by Sterre of the see and godes owne ancille Euen in this worlde alwey of one And godes spouse his hestys to fulfyll And euer redy for to do his wyll Christes temple and also receptacle Of the holy ghoste and chosen tabernacle.
The yare of bruenÂ· and also the fayrnes Of women all whoso loketh a ryght Of may denhede lady and prynces One of the fyue that her lampes lyght Redy to mete with her spouse at nyght Full prudently away at the yare That for no stouthe she came not to late.
In fygure theÂ· the chaundelabre of golde That somtyme her seuen lampes shene This is to saye the recey of the holde Of god preserued for she was so clene Thorowe her meryte endewed for to bene By grace of hym that is of power moste With the seuen yestes of the holy ghosteÂ· How one lady receynge the seuen yestes of the holy ghoste.
Ca. v. THe fyrste yesteÂ· was the yeste of drede To thynge th shall god The nexte pyte of veray women hede To rewe on allÂ· that she sawe in dysease The thyrde conuynge god and man to please The fourthe the we her stedfastnesse Onely by vertue al vyces to oppresse.
Of counceyll the she had excellence To kepe her pure in virgynyte For ay with counceyll yed is prudence Of vnderstandynge eke the yeste had she For god hym selfe chose with her to be And of wysdome so god lyst her To knowe erhe thyuge that was to his plesau~ce.
She was also the Trone voyde of synne That standeth so royall in godes owne syght To fore whiche seuen lampes brenne With heuenly fyre so spyrytuall of lyght That neuer wast but euer alyche bryght Contynued in one here aboue in heuen By the whiche Trone: and the lampesseuen.
Is vnderstande this mayde moste entere With seuen vertues that in her were That somtyme wt ghostely lyght so clere Thorowe lyght of vertue in Onely thorowe that dyd in her And all they were grounded in Her lyght to god: more pleasauntly to distres.
For fayth in her had a grounde so stable That it was voyde of all doublenes Her hope of truste was also mayntynable in god by sykernes Whose charite so large gan hym dres That vp to god hasted ranne the fyre With herte of clennes to all by desyre.
in vertue prubent in gouernaunce She hath also conueyed with clennes And she had attempetaunce In all her werkes with grete And euer annexyd vnto righwysnes within her herte of womanly bounte She had of custome mercy and pyte.
Sothfaste ensample also of chastyre As sayeth Ambrose she was in thought and And treue myrrour of virginite Of poorte benygne full of lowlyhede As humble of chere and feminine of drede Prudent of speche of what she lyste to shewe Large of sentence and but of wordes
To praye and rede that was euer her lyfe Of herte wer: by deuocyon To god alwey with thought contemplatyfe Ful And ydel neuer from And specially to Her hands was at the
And full she was of compassyon To rewe in all that woo or smerte Well wylled euer with hole affeccion To euery wyght so longe was her herte Sad with all this that her neuer asterde looke a of her eyen fayre So close of sight was this debonayre.
And in Psalme of holy prophecye To loke and rede she founde most desyte And she sawe and founde in Isaye Of Cristys hyrthe how he dyd wryte To god she lye her tender handes whyte Besechyng hym she myght abyde and The blesfull day of his
And in the boke of Elyzabeth That is of her auysions synde howe this mayde of Nazareth Sayd euery day seuen orisons That callyd ben her peticions With humble herte this blesfull yonge mayde Full lowly knelyng euen thus she sayde.
Ca. v. Blisfull lorde that knowest the entente Of euery herte in thyne eternal sight yeue me grace the first co~maundement To fulfyll as it is skylle and ryght And graunt with herte will and myght And all my soule and all my knowynge The fyrst to loue aboue all other thynge.
And giue me myght playnly to fulfyll The next biddinge like to thy plesaunce And for to loue with herte and all my wyll My neyghbour in dede and countenaunce Right as my selfe with euery circumstaunce And here with all for ioye and smerte What thou louest to loue with all myne herteÂ· Thy precepte graunt eke that may Fulfyll also bothe erly and late In suche maner as moste is to thy paye Benygne lorde and make me for to hate Mankyndes so for he made fyrst debate In kynde of man and made hym to trespace Agaynst the and to liese his grace.
And lorde graunt me for thy mercy digne Aboue all thynge for to haue mekenes And make me humble sufferaunt benygne With pacience inwarde myldenese Of all vertues gyue me eke largenese To be acceptyd the to queme and serue To fynde onely thy grace may deserue.
And also lord with quakyng herte drede Mekely praye vnto thy deite Me for to graunte of thy godlyhede The gracious houre for to abyde and see In whiche the holy chosen mayden free In to this world hereafter shall be bore Lyke as Prophetes hath wrytten here before.
How that she shall by thyne eleccion Be mayde and mother to thy sone dere Nowe good lorde here myne oryson To kepe myn eyen and my syght entyere That may se her holy halowyd chere Her sakerid beaute holy countynaunce If thou grace list me so moche auaunce.
And kepe myne eres that they may also Here her speche her dally aunce And with my tong speke that mayden vnto Paciently thorowe her sufferaunce Of wordly Ioye this were suffysaunce And her to loue like as desyre Benygne lorde so set myn herte afyre.
And lord also on me saue thou vouche Though therto haue no wordynesse That holy mayde to handyll and touche Myn owne lady and my maystresse And that may with humble buxumnesse Upon my fete in al my best wyse Go vnto her for to do seruyce.
And to that floure of vyrgynyte Graunte also lorde that may haue space Mekely to bowe knele vpon me knee Under supporte onely of her grace And to honour the goodly yong face Other sone as she dothe hym wrappe In clothes softe lyggyng in her lappe.
And loue hym best playnly to my laste With all myn herte myn hole seruyce Withouten chaunge while my lyfe may laste Right as thy selfe lorde caust best deuyse So that may in faythfull humble wyse In all this worlde nomore grace attayne Than loue hym best with all my myght payne And to thy grace also lorde praye To graunt me to fulfyll in dede Hooly the statutes and mekely to obeye Within the temple as here hem rede For but thou helpe may no thynge spede As of my lyfe: therfore vnto the All co~mytte as thou list it be.
The obseruaunces the preceptes all That to thy temple lorde ben partynent So let thy grace by mercy on me falle That may do hem with all myn hole ente~ts And euery byddyng and co~maundement That thy mynystres assygnen vnto me Make me fulfille with al humylite.
And thy temple thy holy house Benygne lorde kepe me from all damage And make thy people to be vertuouse To thy pleasaunce of euery maner age Therfore to serue with herte hoole corage And where they erre lorde on any syde Or thou do right let mercy be her guyde.
And thus this mayde alway day by day In the temple makith her prayers To please god what she can or may The chyef resorte of all her desyres Tyll she attayne to fourtene yeres With herte auowyd bothe in thought dede For to contynue in her maydenhede.
Of whose entent god wote ful vnware Wherin su~me of them that in the temple abyde Of whiche a bisshope callyd Abyathar Cast hym fully for to sette a syde Her purpose playnly an so for to prouyde That her auowe made of chastyte Shulde not holde but vtterly that she.
Shold be wedded sothely yf he myght Unto his sone of hygh affection For that she in euery wyghtes sight So passyng good of condicion And to fulfyll his entencion Abyathar byhoteth golde and rente To the bisshoppes to make her to assente.
To this purpose to her they gone And what they may they gan her excite And to afferme to her euerichone With sugred tonges of many wordes whyte That god aboue doth hym more delyte In birthe of children than in virgynite Or any suche auowyd chastite.
And more in children is honoured in certayn And more in hem hath he his pleasaunce Than in suche as ben not but barayn Without fruyt thorowe mysgouernau~ce And holy wrytte makith remembraunce That no man was sothely for to tell Without seed blessed in Israell.
To whom anone with loke downe cast chere Benygnely in full humble wyse This holy mayde sayd as ye shull here Certes quod she yfye will you auyse Whiche in your selfe so prudent ben and wyse And well aduerte in your discressioune That Abell somtyme had a dowble croune.
One for his faithfull trewe sacrifise Offryng to god of humble herte and free And another as shall deuyse For he his body kept in chastite And Ely eke as ye may rede and see For he in herte was a mayden clene He was rauysshed aboue the sterres seuene.
Body and all in a chare of fyre For he hym kepte from all corrupcion Therfore in vayne is playnly your desyre To speke with me of this opynion For god wel knoweth myn entencyon Howe haue vowyd as it to hym is couthe To be a mayde fro my tender outhe.
And all my lyfe so forth to perseuere For lyfe or deth onely for his sake From whiche purpose shall not disseuere Thorowe his grace whether slepe or wake To kepe and holde haue vndertake My maydenhede go full yore Agaynst whiche ne spekith to me nomore.
And whan they sawe her herte not mutable But euer stedfast of one affeccion And euer as one centre stable They haue made a conuocacion Of all the kynredes in conclusion The eyght day for to come in fere By one assent to of this matere.
This is to say that of olde vsage custome kepe for a memoriall That euery mayde of fourtene yere of age Riche and poore of the stocke ryall In the temple no lenger dwell shall But be statute shall be take and maryed By the lawe and no lenger taryedÂ· And whan they were assembled al in one Isacar in opyn audyence Gan to pronounce afore hem euerichone Ful prudently the su~me of his sentence And said with your pacience So yt your eres offende not ne greue Declare shal my meynyng with your leue.
If ye remembre sithen Salamon the kynge Of Israel ceptre bare and crowne In this temple so ryal in byldyng Haue yong maydens by deuysion Of custome had her conuersacion Bothe kynges doughters prophytes ake As ye may fynde yf ye lyst to seke.
But to the age of fourtene yere Abyden here and no lenger of spake As ye wel knowe withouten any were And than be remeuyd from her place And in her stede other dyd pace As custome was eche in her lynage Delyuerd was vnto mariage And as a lawe it hath be kept full trewe Unto this tyme in hygh lowe estate But now Marie hath fonde an ordre newe To kepe her clene and inuyolate Agaynst whiche there no debate For of fre chose and hertely volunte She hath to god auowed chastyte.
Wherfore me semeth it were well sittyng To her purpose by good discressyon Fyrst that we myght fully haue knowyng Of goddes wyll in this opynion For thant were a more perfeccion Her clene entente as semyth vnto me And eke the stronger of auctorite.
Fyrst that we myght knowe veryly To whose kepyng she shall commytted be And they assenten herto veraly Withouten more of hygh or lowe degre And of accorde of one vnyte The prestes all begonnen to procede To cast lotte downe by eche kynrede.
The whiche lotte on Iuda fyll anone As suppos ethrogh goodes purueaunce And Isacar amonge hem euerichone Purposed hath a newe ordynaunce That euery wyght of that allyaunce That wyfles were withouten more delaye Shulde brynge a yerde agaynst the next daye.
And to the bisshop hyest of echone Eueryche of hem dyd his yerde brynge Amonge whiche Ioseph had brought one Though he were olde passed his likynge And he alone made his offerynge To god aboue and a sacrifyse In the olde lawe suche as was the guyse.
And god to hym than dyd appere And with the bad that he sholde gone And put them euerichone in fere Insancta sanctorum liggyng one by one And in the morowe to come agayne echone Eueriche his yerde to receyue agayne And vpon whiche yerde onely were seyne.

But vtterly vpon none them of alle At thylke tyme was theyre nothyng sayne For godes heste was noughte ye Other desyre to put hem in certeyne Wherfore the bisshop with newe fyre agayne Entred is in to the senturye And whyle that he a whyle there gantarye.

He gan remembre playnly in his mynde That of disdayne and wylfull necligence The yerde of Ioseph was left behynde Wherby he knewe that he had done offence And gan alone to brynge hit in presence And toke
Ioseph deuoutely in his honde Amonge hem all there they dyd stonde.

Blessed arte hou blessed is thy chaunce Thy face blessed thyne aduenture And blessed is thyne humble attendaunce And thou are blessed so longe tendure For to possede so feare a creature So good so holy nowe in thy passyng age So clene a mayde to haue in mariage.
And she alone by preestes of the lawe was vnto his gouernaunce But sely Ioseph gan hym to withdrawe With humble chere shamefast countenaunce And said certes there is none accordaunce Betwene her yougth in fayrnesse And me whome age with vnluste doth oppresse.

Howe mercy and peace rightwysnes trouthe dysputed for the redempcion of mankynde.
Ca. xi. No that is bounde and fettered in prison Thynketh longe after delyuerauuce And he that feieth payne and passyon Desyreth sore after allegeaunce And who that is in sorowe and penaunce.
Lytell wondre of hertely heuynesse Though he coueyte relees of his distresse.
And who that lyueth in langour in wo Feare in exyle and prescripcion And is with sette with many a cruell fo And can no gayne to his saluacion To escape deth without grete raunson Full longe he thynketh of full litell space While he in bondes abydeth after grace.
And yet to recorde of olde felicite In sothfastnes encreseth more his payne Than all the constraynte of his aduersite And causeth hym more to sygh playne For ioye passed can herten more constrayne Her welthe afore to be wepe and wayle Than all the torment that hem dothe assayle.
who coulde euersith the worlde began Of more ioye or of gladnes tell Than somtyme coulde the worthy kynde of man That shapen was in paradyse to dwell Tyll he alas was banysshed in to hell Feare in exyle from his possession And there to abyde stocked in pryson.
And he that lost his riches and honoure His myrthe his ioye his olde welfare His force his myght and holy his socoure And was of vertue nakyd made and bare And laye full secke languyssenge in care So feare proscripte out of his contre That by the lawe there may no recouerbe.
Laye plunged downe without remedye That whan mercy wolde haue ben Right wysnes gan hit anone denye And whan that peace for recouer gan to crye.
Came trouth forth with a sterne face And sayd playnly that he gete no grace.
For peace and mercy to gyder assembled ware Full longe agone to trete of this matere And rightwysnes with hem was eke there And trouth also with a deynous chere And whan they were all foure in fere As ye haue herde and gan to entrete Than fyrst of all cruelly to threte.
Trouthe beganne almoste in a rage Of cruell ire and of melancolye And sayd shortly that man for his outrage Of veray Right must nedes dye And thus began the contrauersye Betwene the susteren trouthe alway in one Sayd playnly that recouer was there none.
For quod Trouth at his creacion Tolde hym the parell afore his offence But he me put out of his bandon And gaue to me no maner audyence And quod Right all my dyligence Wolde hym haue rewlyd but he toke none hede Wherfore of me he gete none helpe at nede.
And whan he gaue credence to the snake He made his quarell euen agaynst Right And agayne Trouth he fallely gan to take Whan he her clene put out of his sight And agayn peace began a quarell to fight Whan he from hym mercy sette aferre And so he sette hym selfe all out of herre.
Therfore quod Right pleteth for hym nomore But let hym haue as he hath deserued ye do grete wronge yf ye wyll hym restore That hath his heste to you not conserued Ayes quod mercy nature hath reserued To peace my suster playnly and to me On wretches euer for to haue pyte.

Wherfore quod mercy purpose vtterlye Hym to releue yf can or maye And quod peace wyll helpe faythfullye The greate yre and rancour to allaye Of iugement to put it in delaye And here vpon to fynde full refuge wyll procede afore the hye Iuge.
Howe mercy and peace brought in this plee before the hyghe iuge Ca. xii.

Remembre lorde amonge thy werkes all Howe thou madest mercy souerayne That whan that euer vnto the she call Thou maiste not of right her prayer disdayne And specially whan that we bothe twayne To thyne hyghnes for any thynge requyre Thou muste of grace fulfyll our prayere.
Is not thy mercy greate aboue the heuen Thyne owne doughter chefe of thyne alye And hath her place aboue the sterres seuen With the ordres of euery Ierarchye Whome daye by daye thou canst so magnefye Amonge thy werkes to make her empresse To helpe wretches whan they ben in distresse.
Thy mercy eke abydeth euer with the Lyke thy gretnes thy magnyficence And who that dothe mercy and pyte Dothe sacrefice hygh in thy presence And is not mercy of more excellence (Lyke as the sauter well reherce can) Upon the erthe than the lyfe of man.
Thy selfe also as it is playnly couthe Auysedly who so taketh hede therto Sayest openly with thyne owne mouthe That a thousande thou canst thy mercy do And holy Dauid recordeth eke also With his Harpe aboue all thynge That he thy mercyes eternally shall synge.
And howe myghte eke any creature Upon erthe in any maner kynde Without mercy any whyle endure For all were gone yf mercy were behynde Wherfore lorde on mercy haue thy mynde The wofull captyfe to take vnto thy grace That hath so longe be seuered fro thy face.
And though that be humble meke fre Forsothe lorde of ouete and of right yet euer in owne my dwellyng is with the.
For selde or neuer parte out of thy sight Peace is my name that power hath myght Thorowe my connyng they that be mortal fone By the helpe of the to accorde in to one.
Â¶And also lorde as holy writte can tell That of thy peace there may none ende be And eke thy peace doth euery wyght excell And art thy selfe of very duere Called the prynce of peace and vnyte And yet by hotest wretches to releue That is mankynde shall neuer fro hym meue.
Â¶And Iob recordeth the holsomest fruyte Of all thys worlde spryngeth out of peace Now lorde sithen am made to be refuyte And to the wofull comfort and encreace Graunte of thy grace nowe a full releace That and mercy may the sone confounde Of caytyse that lyeth in pryson bounde.
Â¶So that he may haue lyberte To go at large and haue rempssion Of this thraldome and captyuyte And be delyuered out of this pryson So that there may be made redempsyon For his seruage and fynall paye Lorde of thy mercy without more delaye.
Â¶And whan they had her mater full purposyd Mercy and peace with full hygh sentence Touchynge man with synne so enclosed The iuge gaue benigne audyence And whan he had kept longe scilence For all the skilles to hym that they layde Yet at the lasteÂ·to hem thus hesayde.
Â¶Howe god the father of heue~ answered to mercy and peace.
owne doughter next to myne alye Though your request come of te~der herte ye moste consydere with a prudent eye Of ryghtwysnes it may not me asterte Lyke your askyng by tauour to aduerte Unto the cause that ye represent But right and trouth fully wolde assent.
Â¶Withouten whome may not procede To execute any maner iugement Wherfore let call her in this greate nede For worche by her auysement And whan they waren come and present Than trouth alone touchynge this matere Sayd openly that all myghten here.
Â¶If hit so be this man that trespaced Ne be not dede for his iniquyte Though vtterly the franchesse is defaced Bothe of my suster ryghtwysnes and me And fynally our bothe lyberte.
Goeth vnto nought of our iurisdiccion But he be punysshed for his trausgression.
Â¶The worde of God that playnly may not erre Tolde hym afore withouten any drede The greate parelle of this mortall warre Etynge the appell that he muste be dede But he slouthe toke therto none hede Wherfore he muste as right lyste prouide Without mercy the dome of deth abyde.
Â¶And though that peace be of pyte meued Man to delyuere with zele of routhe Righwisnes wolde than be agreued With me to consente that am called trouthe And as me semeth it were to greate aslouthe Dome or cause plee or any sute Without vs tweyne to be execute.
Â¶Me semyth eke my syster peace dothe wronge To foster a man holde agaynst vs twayne That hath ben conuersaunt so longe Amonge vs discorde to restrayne Therfore quod peace nowe wyll not fayne To do myne office right to modefye That she of rigoure cause hym not to dye.
Â¶Than quod right of necessyte Hit muste folowe though he were my brother That he muste dye by dome of equyte Or in his name be dede su~me other So of my shyppe guyded is the rather That ne may wawe nor for wynde More than the anker of trouth wyll me bynde.
Â¶Certes quod mercy so it not dysplease Unto your noble and wyse prouidence His deth to you may be lytell ease For holy writte reherceth in sentence If you consyderd in your aduertence That deth of synners the hygh god to queme Is werst of yfye of right list deme.
Â¶For synfull blode is no sacrefyse To god aboue that euery thynge Than muste ye deth of one deuyse That is of synne innocent and clene And is vnder the sonne shene Thorowe the worlde to reherce mankynde It were full harde suche one for to fynde.
Â¶For rust with rust may not scoured be Ne with fylth may be purefyed But who is soyled with dishoneste To wasshe another it is not aplyed Blacke vnto white may not be dyed Ne blode enfecte with corrupcion To god for synne is none oblacion.
Â¶Fygure herof ye may not be dyed As the byble maketh mencion Howe that a lambe of spotte fylthe free Somtyme was take by eleccion And offred vp in satisfaccion To god for synne for to signefye Who sholde for mannes ransome dye.
Must be clene pure and innocent Right as a lambe from euery spotte blame And trewly vnder the firmamente There was nonesuche sithen Adam dyd atame The fruyte to ete for eyther halte or lame In souerayne vertue is all the kynde of man Wherfore quod mercy the best rede that can.
That peace my syster cesse this discorde And all the stryte that is vs bytwene And that we praye our iuge myghty lorde To this mater benygnely to sene And of his grace to shape suche a mene For trouth right so prudently ordeyne That peace ne haue no cause to pleyne.
And this request is nought agaynst right Ne vnto trouth playnly none oftence If that our iuge of his greate myght Ordeyne so in his prouydence To scape awaye thorowe his sapyence That trouth and right be not displeased Thorow peace me though man be holpe eased.
Howe the father of heuen accorded the fouresystren Ca. xiiii.
ANd whan that she by reason had fyned That grounded was playnly vpon skyll The hygh iuge by mercy is enclyned To condescende of grace to her wyll And in suche wyse her askynge to fulfyll That right be serued trouthe not dysmayed That peace she shulde eke be well apayed.
And by sentence alone diffynytyfe The iuge sayd for conclusion An innocent pure and clene of lyfe Shall mekely dye to paye the raunson For mannes gylt and trasgression And he so frely shall the deth abaye In all his payne that he worde shall saye.
And thus shall right in all maner thynge Haue her desyre and trouth shall not fayle But agreably in theyr worchynge To execute fully to stynte this batayle And for that peace in moche may anayle And mercy eke shall not be agreued Her brother askynge also shall be achyeued.
To fynde a man that shall vndertake This myghty quarell of mercy and pyte To suffre deth lonely for mannes sake Uncompellyd frely and of volunte That is a lambe withouten spotte shall be And with his blode shall wasshe vndefouled The gylt of man with rust of synne mouled.
BUt for to wete of what stocke he shal spring Ot what kynrede and of what estate My sothfast worde eternally lyuynge Myne owne sonne with me encreate Shall downe be sent to be incarnate And wrappe hym selfe in the mortall kynde Of man (for loue) so that he may fynde.
clene grounde his palayce vnto bylde In all the erthe neyther of lyme ne stone But in a mayde debonayre and mylde The humble doughter of Iuda and Syon And vnto her shall trouthe mercy gone By one accorde sent afore my face Lyke my deuyse to chese me a place.
And say to her in all maner thynge Her tabernacle that she make fayre Agaynst the comyng of her myghty kynge Whiche is my sonne and myne owne heyre That in her breste shall haue his repeyre Where trouth mercy shall to By one assent and her rancour lete.
And there shall peace kysse rightwysnes And all the susters accorde in that place And right shall leue all her stourdines And trewthes swerde shall nomore manace And fynally mercy shall purchace chartour of pardon like this mayden cle
That he shall mowe escape daungers myd the forest free from euery trappe While the mayde that causeth all this peace Hath the vnycorne slepyng in her lappe That thorowe mekenes shal his horne so wrappe There it was wonte to slee by vyolence Thorowe deth it shall agayne deth be defence.
Agaynst venym more holsome than Euery poyson asofte and aswage Whan the lyon maketh his habitacle Within a mayde but of tender age And Gabriell shall gone on message To her alone myne owne secretarie With newe tydinges no lenger tarye.
ANd right forthwt the angel tarieth nought But helde his waye from the see of glorye Unto this mayde clene in will and thought Where as she sat in her oratorye With herte with hole memorie Greate to god and all her full mynde To whome the angell whan he dyd her fynde.
Benignely with all humylite Sayd vnto her alone as ye shallen here Hayle full of grace our lorde is with the Ne drede the not but be right glad of chere That art to god so acceptable and dere That hooly his grace is vpon the fall To be moste blessed amonge women all.
And with that worde thorowe goddes myght All hole the somme of the deyte That from heuen his blisfull bemys bright Shadde on therthe of our humanyte Whan in the breste of a mayden fre The holy ghoste by fre eleccion For his mekenes hath made his mancion.
For wha~ that Bernarde somtyme gan beholde With thought vp lifte by contemplacion The bright sonne in herte he gan to colde Iuly astoned in his aspeccion And full deuoutly in a meditacion Therof remembrynge as he gan take hede Sayde euen thus quakyng in a drede.
Lorde quod he so am agrysed And sore a drade to loke on this clerenesse And yet well more with feare am supprised For to beholde for myne vnworthynesse Any worde to wryte or to expresse Of this mysterie and greate pryuyte Benigne lorde lest thou saye to me.
What arte thou bolde or darest in any wyse My rightwisnes to tell or to wrytte Or to presume so hardely to deuyse My testament with thy mouth endyte That certes lorde but yf thou respyte My wretchidnes by supporte of thy grace greately drede of deth for my trespace.
But wolde god through his greate myght And his goodnes lyke to my desyre That from thaulter that brenneth in his sight No lytell sparcle but a flame of fyre Wolde downe discende myne herte to enspyre For to consume with his feruent hete The rusty filthe that in my mouthe dothe flete.
And all vnclennesse cankered there of olde To make clene and to scoure awaye That thorowe his grace durste be so bolde Other to wryte or some worde to saye That was rehercid vpon the blisfull daye Whan Gabriell and Marie mette In Nazareth and humbly her grette.
But sithen this man so parfyte of lyuynge This holy Bernarde so good and gracious So dredfull was this mater in writtinge That was of lyfe so inly vertuous Howe dare than be presumptuous wofull wretche in any maner To take on me this parfyte hygh emprise.
My lippes pollute my mouth wt synne ysoyled Myne herte vnclene and full of cursidnesse My thought also with all vyces foyled My breste receyte cheste of wretchidnesse That me to wryte of any parfitnesse Nat onely drede of presumpsion But for to esche we the indignacion.
Of god aboue for my greate offence That am bolde or hardy in his sight To dare presume the greate excellence For to descryue of her that was so bright But vnder hope that mercy passeth right And that disdayne my style not veraye With humble herte thus to hym praye.
recapitulacio~ of the wordes of Gabriell to our Lady howe holy men by diuyne liknesses wrote of our Lady in co~me~ dacion of her.
Capitulo. Lorde whose mercy goth not declyne But euer stondith hole in one That somtyme sendest downe from Seraphyne To saye an Angell with a stone Wherwith he began to touche his mouthe alone To purge his lippes from all pollucion So let thy grace to me descende downe.
My rude tonge to explite and spede Somwhat to say in commendacion Ofher that is well of womanhede And thorowe her helpe and meditacion Be to my style full direccion And let thy grace alwaye be present This boke to forther after myne entent.
For of my lyfe for to vndertake To speke or write in so deuoute matere Lyttell wonder though tremble or quake And chaunge bothe countenaunce and chere Sithen this maydeu of vertue tresorere Perturbed was in loke and in vysage Of Gabriell to here the message.
And full demurely stylle gan abyde And in her herte castinge vp and downe Full prudently vpon euery syde The maner of this salutacion And howe hit might in conclusion In any wyse fully performed be She stondynge hole in her vyrginite.
And whan the Angell sawe her lowly hede Her humble countenaunce chaunged in her face He sayde Marye for nothynge that you drede For to fore god thou haste founde grace And shalt conceyue within a litell space And in thy wombe of all vertu And shall hym calle (whan he is borne) Iesu.
That shall be greate named sothfastlye Sone of the hyest that euer was of myght And god to hym shall leue yeue full iustlye The see of Dauid his owne fathers right And he shall reygne in euery wyghtes sight In the house of Iacob eternally by ligne Whose kyngdom euer shall laste neuer fyne.
Surmountynge eke as in excellence That vtwardly gaue so meruaylous
And wonderfull to her audience Than she full mekely of greate reuerence And loke downe cast other eyen clere Benignely the Angell gan enquere.
In what maner shall this thynge betyde Sithen no man knowe in no degre Quod Gabriell within thy blessed syde The holy ghoste shally shrowded be And all the vertue of the Trynite Enclose shall in thy breste so clene The sonne of lyfe with all his bemes shene.
Wherfore this childe that shall of the be borne Shall called be goddes sone eterne Beholde see a lytell here
Conceyued hath sithen gone halfe yere Though she forage went to haue bene barayne And is with childe to put all in certayne.
That to god is nothynge impossyble But as hym list may euery thynge fulfyll Unto whose worde be fully nowe credible Byholde quod she of god the meke ancille With all myne herte obeyeng to his wyll In euery thynge right as hym liste it be And like thy worde fall it vnto me.
Lo she that was chosyn for to bene Of all this worlde lady and empres Of heuen erthe alone to be quene And goddes mother for her holynes Lo for all this howe lowly with mekenes She all committeth vnto goddes wyll As he ordeyneth redy to fulfill.
And wolde not calle her selfe none other name But goddes handmayde in full lowe manere where is all the transitorye fame Where is your boste or daren you apere Of pompe or pryde or surquedrye in fere With your forblowe blowyng vanyte Sithen that a mayde thorowe her humylite.
Of pryde hath nowe wonne the victorye And openly hath gyuen hym a fall Thorowe whose lowlynes hygh kyng of glorie Within her wombe hath made in speciall His dwellynge place his hospitall And with one worde of the mayde spoke The holy ghoste is in her breste yloke.
ANd wha~ Angell from her departed was And she alone in her tabernacle Right as the sonne perissheth thorowe the glasse Thorowe the cristall berall or spectacle Without harme right so by myracle In to her closer the fathers sapyence Entred is withouten vyolence.
Or any wemme vnto her maydenhede On any syde in party or in all For goddes takyng our manhede In her hath bylde his paleyce pryncipall And vnder pyght this mancion With seuen pylers as made is memorye And therin sette his reclynatorie.
Whiche is perfourmed all of pure golde Onely to vs for to signefye That he all holy made hath his holde Within this mayde that called is Marye And seuen pylers that sholden this mayde gye Ben seuen spirites so as can disserne Of god aboue this mayde to gouerne.
For all the tresoure of his sapience And all the wisdome of heuen and erthe therto And all the richesse of spirituall science In her were shette and closed eke also For she is toure without wordes And house of puore in whiche Salamon Shette all his tresour in his possession.
She was the castell of the cristall wall That neuer man myght yet vnclose In whiche the kynge that made and causeth all His dwellyng chefe by grace gan dispose And like as dewe discendeth on the rose With syluer dropes and of the leues fayre The fresshe beaulte ne myght not payre.
Ne as the rayne in Aprille or in Maye Causeth the vertue to renne out of the rote The greate fayrnes nought appeyre maye On vyolettes and on herbes sote Right so this grace of all our greues bote The grace of god amyde the bely whyte The beaute causeth to be of more delyte.
And as the cokyle with heuenly dewe so clene Of kynde engendreth whyte perles rounde And hath no cherisshyng but the sonne shene To his fosterynge as it is playnly founde Right so this mayde of grace moste habounde peerle hath closed within her brestes whyte That fro~ the deth myght all our rau~soune quyte.
She was eke the gate of the lockes bright Sette in the northe of hygh deuocion Of whiche somtyme the Prophete had a sight Ezechyell as is written in his auysion Whiche stode euer close in conclusion That neuer man entre shall pace But god hym selfe to make his dwellynge place.
And yet in sothe as reherce can So as the of Gedyon was wette Before he taught with hem of Madyan With heuenly dewe enuyron all be sette In signe onely he spede shall the bette Right so hath god on her his grace shewed With the holy ghoste whan she was bydewedÂ· In token playnly she shulde socoure be Unto mankynde manly for to fight Agaynst the deuyll that hath in his pouste All madyan with his fell myght And thorowe the helpe of this mayden bright And thorowe the dewe of her heuenly grace We shall this serpent from our bondes chace.
She was also of golde the ryche vrne Kepynge the man of our saluacion That all our wo may to ioye tourne With holsome fode and full perfection She was also as scripture maketh mencion The yerde of Aaron with fruyte and leues Of vertue moste to comforte vs and glade.
She was the aultre Cedre golde and stone Stedfast and true in perfeccion And as the Cedre conseruynge all in one His body clene from all corrupcion And for to make a full oblacion Of euery vertue to god in chastyte She shone as golde by parfyte charyte.
And on this aulter she made her sacrefyce With fyre of loue brennyng as bright To god and man in euery maner wyse As downe the sterres on the frosty nyght Her frankensence gaue so clere a light Thorowe good ensaumple that the parfyte leuen Of her lyuinge raught in to heuen.
She was the trone where that Salamon For worthynes sette his ryall set With golde and yuore that so bright shone That all aboute the beaute men myght see The golde was loue the yuore chastite And twelue Lyons so greate huge and large That of this werke bare vp the charge.
Of the olde lawe weren Prophetes twelue That longe before gan beholde and see That Salamon goddes sone hym selfe Sholde in this mayde beholde his ryall see So that in soth her clene virginite To be a mother sholde nothing lette Amyd her breste that he his trone sette.
She was the woman that saynt Iohan Sawe in heuen so richely appere Cladde in a sonne whiche brighter shone Than Phebus doth in his longe spere And twelue sterres that passyngly were clere So as to hym playnly dyd seme Weren sette aboue in her dyademe.
And as hym thought at her feet there stood large mone bright and nothing pale In fygure onely that she that is so good To swage the bitter of our olde bale The sonne of lyfe made to auale Downe to the erthe to gouerne vs and guye And eke the mone to vs doth signefye.
All holy churche large to beholde Within this mayde had his originall Whan fynally with his rightes olde The synagoge of Iewys had a fall For in this mayde the fyrst faythfull wall Of holy churche God gan fyrst to bylde Whan with his sonne he made her go with chylde And to reforme the rudenes vtterly Of blynde folkes that coude not parceyue Howe that Marie myght kyndly mayde be and a chylde conceyue That yf hym list reason to conceyue They may examples right ynowe fynde Of this mater accordinge vnto kynde.
Autentyke conclusions agaynst vnbeleufull men that sayde~ that Christe might not be borne of a mayde Capitulo. xx. Blynde man thorowe thyne iniquyte Why hast thou lost thy reason thy sight That thou of malyce list not for to see Howe Christ Iesu thorowe his greate myght To his disciples helde the waye right Thorowe the yates yshette by greate deffence Without brekyng or any vyolence.
Why myght he not of his magnificence Within a mayde make his mancion And she yet stode in hygh excellence Of maydenhede from all corrupcion ye ben to blynde in your discression That liste not to see also howe he rose From deth to lyfe in his sepulture close.
And here withall thou mayste also aduerte Howe he full graciously of his myghty grace Made Peter out of pryson to sterte And where hym lyste frely for to pace And yet the dores were shutte of the place What wonder than though god by myracle Within a mayde made his habitacle.
And beyng close and parfytly shette With all the bondes of clene vyrginite For sothfastly her clennesse was not lette Upon no syde ue yet her chastite But encreasyd and fauour for to se That goddes so~ne list to light adowne Within this mayde to make his mancion.
Eke Heldefons telleth of a tree In stede of fruyte hereth byrdes smale From yere to yere by kynde as men may se Without medlyng of female or of male This veryly is soth playnly and no tale Tha~ wondre not though Crist were borne bitwene.
Eke certeyne byrdes called bultures Without medlyng conceyuyng by nature As bokes sayne withouten any lees And of her lyfe an hondred yere endure Than the lorde of euery creature That causeth all no wonder though say Though that he were conceyuyd of a maye.
And Plunius in bokes naturall Wrytte of a roche greate and large also That wyll remeue with a fynger small But yf a man do all his myght therto It wyll not stere neyther to fro Right so this mayde that is of vertue moste With a fynger of the holy ghoste And with a touche of his myghty grace Conserued hath stedfast god and man That neuer myght remeue from her face Of thylke auowe that she fyrst began To be a mayde as fertorth as she can In herte wyll as any roche stable That from his grounde is not remeuable.
This clerke also this wise Plunius Sayth in Tauriche there is an erthe founde That of nature isso vertuous That will cure euery maner wounde Right so Marie was the erthe founde That god out chose by eleccion To bere the fruyte of our redempcion That shulde be helthe and also medecine To all our woundes whan they ake or smerte And our greues our hurtes fyne From deth to make vs to asterte With holsome bawme percinge to the herte Our festerid soris that they shull ake nomore Ne that she ne were we were all forlore.
And ferthermore this auctour can eke tell Within his boke who so loketh a right To Iupiter sacred is a well That whan it hath queynte his brondes bright That efte agayne hit geueth them a newe light Who list assaye soth as he shall fynde What wonder than though the god of kynde.
Amyd this well from fylthe of synne colde Full of vertue with fayre stremes clere His lodging toke his myghty holde And thorowe his grace sette hit newe afyre With the holy ghoste that that withouten were Though she were colde from all flesshlyhede She brent in loue hotter than the glede.
And in Falisco as hym liste to wryte Is a well that causeth eke of newe Whan the oxen drynke to be whyte And sodaynly to chaunge her hewe What meruayle than though the well trewe The well of helthe and of lyfe eterne The lorde of all so as can disserne.
These stremes shedde in to this mayde fre To make her whightest as in holynesse That bothe sholde mayde and mother be And euer in one kepe her clennesse Withouten chaunge so that her whitnesse Ne fadeth neuer in beaute ne in coloure Of mayden hede to bere bothe lefe and floure.
And who that wolde dispute in this matere holde hym madde or elles out of mynde For yf he haue his eyen hole and clere He shall nowe se prefe ynough by kynde For he that made bothe lefe and rynde And with a worde these waste wordes wylde Myght make a mayde for to go with chylde.
And he that made the hygh cristall heuen The firmament also euery spere The golden axtre the sterres seuen Cithera: so lusty for to appere And rede marce with his sterne hcere Myght he not eke onely for our sake Within a mayde of man the kynde take.
And he that causeth fowles in the ayre In her kynde to and multeplye And fysshe eke with fynnes sleid fayre In depe to gouerne hem and gye And doth one lyue another dye And geueth beastes her fode vpon the grounde And in his kynde doth hem to abounde.
Sithen he is lorde and causeth all thynge To haue beyng yf shall not fayne And is the prynce and the worthy Kyng That all enbraceth in his myghty chayne Why myght he not by power souerayne At his fre choyse that all may saue and lese To his mother a clene mayde these.
Who causeth the fruyte out of the harde tre By vertue onely that spryngeth from the rote To growe wexe like as men may se With leues grene newe blosmes sote Is it not that lorde that for all our bote Wolde of a mayde as reherce can Mekely be borne without touche of man.
For he that doth the tender braunches sprynge And fresshe floures in the greate mede That weren in wynter dede eke droppinge Of bawme voyde of Myght he not make his grayne to growe sede Within her brest that was bothe mayde and wyfe Wherof is made the sothfast breade of lyfe.
And he that grauyd of his greate Without poyntell in the harde stone And the tables with letters clere and bright His ten preceptes buyldynges The same lorde of his power alone Hath made this mayde here in erthe lowe chylde conceyue and no man to knowe.
And he that made the busshe to appere All on flame with ferly sparcles shene And whan Moyses gan to approche nere And yet no harme came to the bowes grene The same lorde hath conserued clene His habytacle his herber swete In this may de from all flesshely hete.
And he that made the of Moyses Of a serpent to take the liknesse In the hall amonge all the prees Where Pharao the people dyd oppresse And in deserte the Byble bereth wytnesse The Ryuer made to renne of the stone The thriste to staunche of the people alone.
And ouer this for to verefye His greate myght: Sampson the stronge man As Iudicum doth playnly specefye Dranke the water that from the chanell ran And he that made the flodes of Iurdan To torne agayne for loue of Iosue That all his people clerely myght se And howe wawes gan asondre breke And lyke and hylle to stonde hygh on lofte And he that made the Asse to speke To Balaam? for he rode so softe Why myght he not by power preued ofte Sithen he the yren made in the water houe Be of a mayde borne for mannes loue.
And he that made a angell for to take Abacuk the prophete by a litell heare And sodaynly brynge hym to the lake In Babylon whiche was so feare And to visite ligginge in his feare Danyell amonge the beastes rage Tyll he to hym brought the potage.
The dores shutte of the stronge pryson For to aswage of hunger all his payue And in a moment to his mancion Full sodaynly restored hym agayne Why myght he not as well in certayne The same lorde of a may de than Take flesshe and blode and bycome man.
And he that made the sonne at Gabaon To stonde shyne vpon the bright shelde Of Iosue and towarde Achalon The mone also as all the hooste behelde The longe day they faught in the felde Agaynst the Kynges of myghty of Amorre That his people clerely myght se.
And he that made the shade we to retourne In the orlage of Kyng Ezechye By ten degrees onely to parfourme By heste made to hym of saye Why myght he nat that all this worlde shall gye Of a may de by the same skyll Frely be borne at his owne wyll.
And he that fedde with fyue loues smale Fyue thousande in solytarie place Ferre in deserte sittinge in a Thorowe the foyson and plente of his grace The same lorde why myght he not purchace Within a may de duringe her maydenhede Whan that hym liste to take his manhede.
For as the Bee bothe waxe and hony shede At the hyue who taketh hede therto Right so Marie flouring in maydenhede Bare in her wombe god and man also And yet in sothe she was bothe two dare afferme one persone in fere mayde clene and Christes mother dere.
And as the beame shynyng from so ferre Shedith his light as men maye well espye Withouten harme of hynderyng of the sterre And so as Manna fyl downe fro the skye Right so this floure that called is Maria With wombe halowed into chastyte Conceyued hath in her virgynite.
And as the Barnacle in the harde tre Of kynde bredeth and the vyne floure Causeth the wyne florre for to be Thorowe Bachus might grapes gouernoure Right so in soth mankyndes sauyoure As the barnacle and floure out of the vyne Spronge of Marie she beyng virgine.
And as a worme vnder a stone Of therthe cometh without engendure And as the Feuyr of whiche there is but one To asshes brent rene with by nature Right so this lorde that all hath in his cure Our kynde agayne for synne to renewe Toke flesshe and blode in this mayde trewe.
And as the Snowe fro Iupiter doth Thorowe the force of Sagittarius And zepherus dothe the floures fall On whyte blosmes whan she doth blowe Right so in sothe the grace alight Of the holy ghoste like a wynde cherisshyng Amydde the mayde to make his dwellyng.
And to the floure did no duresse But parfytly conserued her beaute From euery storme and flesshely An lyke fresshe of fayrnes for to se As by examples more than two or thre As ye to forne haue herde deuyse Whiche as me semeth ought ynough
To all that be grounded in the fayth Agaynst falshede to stande at defence And yet in suche so as saynt Gregore sayth Fayth hath no merite where as euydence Or mannes reason: geueth experience But he that leueth and fyndeth no reason Ne kynde according is worthy more guerdon.
But yf that any be nowe in this place That hath doute or ambyguyte Thorowe false errour that doth his herte enbrace Eyther of malice or of iniquyte For to accuse the blessed virginite Of Marie playnly this is my But if so be that he amende sonne.
And are mercy for his greate Of her that is of mercy grounde and well That he of vengeaunce haue experience With Ixyon downe depe in hell And that the clapper of his destuned bell May cankre sone mene his false tonge Be doumbe for euer neuer efte to be ronge.

FOr what in sothe vpon any syde Is Phebus chare appeyred of his light Though eyen rawe may not abyde For to beholde agaynst his bemes bright Right so playnly though the goundy sight Of here may nat sustene For to beholde the clerenes of this quene.
May in no wyse sothely disencreace Her clere light ne her brightnesse Whose fayre stremes shullen neuer seace Withouten Eclipse to shyne in clennesse For of this mayde as bokes done expresse Whan Gabriell to heuen drowe the cooste She replenisshed was of the holy ghoste.
Rose vp alone and out of Nazareth Towarde the mounteyns fast gan her hye And there she sale with mekely Elizabeth Within the house of treue Zacharie And right forth with whan she dyd espye Of Marie the meke salutacion And thorowe her eres whan passed was the soun Within her wombe playnly thus to tale For very Ioye and spirituell gladnesse The yonge infane with his lymes smale Reioysed hym the Gospell sayth expresse And she fulfilled in very sothfastnesse With the holy ghoste lowde gan to crye And euen thus sayd vnto Marie.
Blessed art thou amonge woman all And of thy wombe blessed the fruyte also And howe to me of happe is newe befall My lordes mother for to come me to For very ioye note what may do For sothfastly thy greatyng as here Within my wombe my litell childe nowe here? Rioyseth hym for gladnes as he can That of all wo myne herte it doth releue And blessed are thou that fyrst this ioye began The worde of god so faythfully to beleue Nowe be right glad thyne herte meue For all thynge shall performed be That ben of god byhested vnto the.
Marie than with a deuoute entente With loke benignely and full humble The same houre beyng ay present Elizabeth her owne cosyndere With a full meke and humble chere And all the accorde and hole melodie Of the holy ghoste sayd in her armonye.
WIth laude and prise my soule magnefieth Eternall lorde bothe one two and thre That all hath made and euery thyng nowe gyeth Whiche of his myght and bounteous pyte Of his goodnes and hygh benignite Onely of mercy list to haue plesaunce For to consyder and graciously to se To my mekenes and humble attendaunce.
My spryte also with herte thought in fere Reioysed hath with fulsome habundaunce In god that is myne herte souerayne entere And all my ioye and all my suffisaunce My hole desyre and all my sustenaunce Within my thought so depe he is graue That but in hym without variaunce In all this worlde can no gladnes haue.
For he from heuen goodly hath beholde Of his handmay de the humilite Wherfore in soth all onely for he wolde All kynredes shall be blessed (call me) Of the whiche the thanke lorde be vnto the With pryce and honour of euery voyce and tonge Thorowe armony of sothfast vnyte For this alone be to thy name songe.
For he to me hath do thynges greate Of hygh renowne and passinge excellence His grace made fully me to flete For he is myghty of his magnifycence His name holy and moste of That wyll loue hit shall me neuer sterte With all my trewe faythfull diligence To thanke hym of all my hole herte.
And he his mercy moste passyngly famous For kyn to kyn so downe to kynrede Shall thorowe his grace be so plenteous Perpetually that it shall procede And specially to them that louen and drede Myne owne lorde with herte wylle and mynde To suche his pyte shall euer sprynge sprede Of due right neuer be behynde.
He hath his arme enforced made stronge His dredefull myght that men may se knowe And proude men they reyne not full longe He serued made hem full lowe With al his herte downe of the whele hem throwe For to ae her surquedrie and pryde Or they were ware her pompe was ouer throwe Full sodenly and leyde her boste a syde.
And myghty tyrauntes from her ryall so He hath avayled and put a downe And humble and meke her He hath enhaunced to full hygh renowne For he can make atransmutacion From lowe to hygh as it is sene full ofte And whan hym li the dominacion Of wordly pompe to tall full vnsofte.
He hath fulfilled and fostered in her nede With the goodes of plentuous largenes Hem that were hongry indygent in drede And hem reled of all her wretchednes And he the riche hath raught from his richesse Full wylde waste to make vpon the playne And sodenly plungyde in distresse All solytary left hym ligge in vayne.
For he his chylde chosen of Israell Benignely hath taken to his grace And of his mercy is remembred well To voyde onely vengeaunce from his face And humble peace shall occupye his place And pyte shall besesed in his stall And trouthe shall his right so enbrace To sette mercy aboue his Werkes all.
As he hath spoken faythfully behight To our fathers that hath ben here tofore To Abraham to his sede of right That his mercy shall laste euermore For nere his mercy all the worlde were lore Unto the whiche to make man attayne He hath made mercy our kynde to restore And of all his werkes to be souerayne.
Howe our Lady after the byrthe of saynt Iohan Baptiste tourned to Nazareth.
ANd whan this blessed gracious dyte Was sayd to god deuoutly of Marie fynde after playnly howe that she Styll in the house bode of Zacharie Thre monthes the Gospell may notlye And after that rede in certayne To Nazareth that she went agayne.
And there aboue in In her prayers alway day by daye With many an holy meditacion To queme her lorde in what she can or maye From whome her thought went neuer awaye Her full mnyde ne her remenbraunce For but in hym she hath no plesaunce.
In all this worlde of no maner thynge For all her ioye was on hym to thynke What euer she dyd prayeng or worchynge Nothinge but he might in her herte synke For fynally whether she wake or wynke Amyd her herte he was alway present So fixe on hym was sette her hole entent.
And day by day this holy lyfe she lad This party emayde thorowe hygh deuocion So seruent loue vnto god she had There may be made no deuision For she sequestred her opynion From all the worlde let it playnly gone So hole to god she gaue her herte alone.
For euer in loue she brent more and more Towarde god in his hygh seruice? Was all her luste with herte sette so sore All erthely thynge she fully doth despyse And day by day her wombe gan to ryse Through the fulfilling of the holy ghoste Therin by loke whome she loued moste.
This mene while Ioseph ay soiourned In Galilee god wote full innocent Of all this thynge and why he not retourned Was for that he was so diligent In with all his full entent Sondry werkes of meruaylous empryse By carpentrye to forge and deuise.
For in this crafte inpassyng excellence He had in soth hygh discression And was had moste in reuerence Of all the werkmen of that regyon And for he had in connyng suche renowne Lyke a mayster there is nomore to saye The werkmen all his bidding dyd obaye.
And when he had all werke acheued He is repayred to Nazareth agayne But lorde howe he was in his herte ameued When that Marie he hath with childe yseyne That sore astoned he nat what he may sayne So at his herte it sat so inwardly Tyll at the laste he abrayed sodaynly.
And sayd alas howe it is fall of newe In myne absence or what thyng may this be Sithen this mayde so faithfull so trewe Is with chylde god wote not with me That somtyme had auowed chastite And to my kepyng eke deliuered was What shall saye of this sodeyne cas.
What shall answere my selfe to excuse Unto the bysshop yf he me appose For eyther muste playnly her accuse Or my gylte with this gylte enuose This thynge is opene may it nat enclose blessed god so do me nowe this grace Out of my brest this wofull ghoste to trace.
For certes lorde it were thy wyll had leuer vtterly to dye Than thorowe my worde this mayde for to spyll As more nede yf her bewraye And on my selfe yf the charge laye For to afferme she hath conceyuyd by me more accuse her vowe of chastyte.
And so my selfe appeche of vntreuth Sithen in soth dyd her neuer knowe blessed lorde haue on this mater For vtterly my wyt is brought so lowe To see corne growe where no sede is sowe And reason also platly can none Howe a mayde with chylde sholde gone.
And floure forthe in her virginite neuer sawe ne neuer yet dyd rede And this doute my reason can nat se Howe that Marie hath kept her In myne absence this double drede My witte is brought wote not where to tourne For double cause that haue nowe to mourne.
That one is my fantasye May neuer accorde that she dyd offence And reason playnly agayn warde doth And vpon kynde grounded his sentence To preue sothely without resistence That neuer woman in natures sight Without a man a chylde conceyue myght.
And with that worde he brest out for to wepe Lyke as he wolde all in teres browne And for the constreynt of his syghes depe Stode on the poynt for to haue fallen downe His sodayne wo made hym almoste sowne So for distresse this Ioseph far in age Of inwarde thought cought was in a rage.
Howe the Maydens that weren atte~dau~t to our Lady comforted Iosephe Capitulo. xxiiii.
ANd whan the Mayde~s weren And euer in one abyding on Marie And vnderstode what that Ioseph mente All atones they began to crye And saide Ioseph leue thy fantasye And thyne errour for it is folye Withouten auyse to sodaynlye.
And certenly with all our herte entere Of knowlegynge in very sykernesse We wyll recorde euerichone in fere All openly touching her clennesse And here vpon bere openly wytnesse Li as we knowe vnto this same daye Though all this worlde at ones wyll say nay.
For we in soth thorowe busy diligence Haue ben with her bothe day night And neuer departed out of her presence But euer in one had of her a syght And late erly with all our myght On her awayted without wordes mo And from our sight she dyd neuer go.
And euery houre bothe tyde and tyme Of vs there was no deuysion And all the morowe tyde tyll hygh She neuer stynte of her deuocion To be in prayer and in oryson And eche day by continuaunce certeyne houre she had a dalyaunce.
With holy angels that with her knelid or stode And on a tyme thorowe goddes Of his hande she toke her holy fode As nedefull was to her sustenaunce And this in soth hath ben her gouernaunce And as we echone of her can recorde Wherfore Ioseph this lyfe doth not accorde.
In sothfastnes of thyne opynion That so misdemeth of this mayden fre Of fantasye or of false suspeccion For to accuse her vyrginite Of whiche thynge we dare ensure the That no wight made sothely to deuyse But the holy ghoste her wombe for to ryse.
And here vpon we recorde can Of all the tyme thou were in Galilee She neuer aloue with was no man And what she spake we myght here and se Wherfore Ioseph let thy tales be And deme nat amys in worde nor in thought For all this thyng by goddes hande is wrought.
And by his angels comyng on message Is this thynge fully brought aboute Therfore Ioseph let thyne yre asswage And of Marie be nothyng in doute? Certes quod he may not voyde oute My fantasye to assent in any wyse: It shulde be lyke as ye nowe deuyse.
For by an agell it were impossible Her to conceyue lyke as ye witnesse But yf it so were that it be credyble Some wyght by sleyght takyng the liknes Of an angell thorowe fraudelent falsenes Thorowe innocence shortly to conclude By engyne of fraude her thought to delude.
And efte agayne for his inwarde payne He gan to chaunge bothe face and hewe And from his eyen the salte teres rayne Lyke as he wolde drowne hym selfe of newe So sore he gan in herte for to rewe For this mater that for his mortall wo He can no rede ne wote what he may do.
And in his herte he caste many awaye To haue fou~de refute with all his full mynde And thought alway he wolde her not betraye For he was rightfull playnly as fynde And thus he gan in sondry thoughtes wynde As in Balaunce for possed vp and downe Tyll at the laste in conclusion.
He purposeth fully casteth hym vtterly To go his waye sothely if he myght And thought he wolde forsake her pryuely And neuer more to come in her sight Tyll an Angell on the same nyght Sent downe from god to Ioseph dyd appere Whyle that he slepte and sayde as ye shall here.
Howe the Angel warned Ioseph to abyde with our Lady.
Thou Ioseph ne drede thou not blyue Thou the sone of Dauid of lyne by dissent For to take Marie to thy wyue Whiche is a mayde with all her full entent With whome is ay the holy ghoste present Of whome god as the tell beforne In veray soth that shall of her be borne.
And like in sothÂ· as writeth Of this materÂ· that for thre Unto Ioseph as he telleth vs The Angell came and fyrste he sayde that Sithen he was rightfull that no degre Of purpose rightfull he sholde vnrightfully This holy mayde forsake pryuely.
Another cause he writeth the expresse That his forsakinge might to her name Be dishonour and cause in sothfastnesse Of vntreue tonges for to speke her shame And though in her there were no spotte of blame Suspeccion to voyde on euer eyther syde The Angell bad that Ioseph shulde abydeÂ· The thyrde cause also moste trewe Was that he with more diligence Sholde her kepe whan he the knews That she was clene without all offence And wiste playnly that by magnificence Of the holy ghoste his erreur to enchace Conceyued hath this mayde full of grace.
And whan Ioseph abrayed out of his slepe And in his herte by reuolucion to caste and to take kepe Agaynste the morowe of his auysion He caught comforte and consolacion Of all that euer he was afore dispayred And to Marie agayne he repayred.
And hole herte That he to hym hath so In recomforte of his in His clared openly And of He asketh mercy of humble affeccion That euer to her he had suspeccionÂ· And of his errour of his trespace This hore graye with all humilite With wepynge gan to are grace And she alone of womanly pyte His heuines whan she dyd se Comforted hym in all that euer she might And he alone in all theyr sight.
And all her maydens standinge enuyron Gan euen thus for to cryowde Certes quod he my derke suspeccion Came of blyndenes for none other coude But nowe in soth the mysty blacke cloude Of ignoraunce is so clarefyed That all the trouth to me is verefyed.
Thorowe grace of god that myne olde Is nowe from chaced clene awaye Haue me excused of my derke dulnesse With all myne herte benignely praye My nyght of is in to daye That may nowe with myne eyen olde The bright bemes of Tytan well beholdeÂ· That for derknes what to done Onely for lacke of his bemes bright Weren me berafte thorowe the clowdy mone And hath within me no clere insighte That this Eclips was caused all to sone By hersodeyn interpocession That was chefe grounde of my suspeccion.
This is to sayn that myne erthely thought So was oppressod derked and borne downe That woldely skyes that myght nought Ne was nor worthy to haue inspeccion Of this derke knowelege by relacion Tyll the sonne of his grace dyd shyne My wytte Eclipsed fully to enlumyne.
For he to me hath his Angell sent Myne ignoraunce fully for to clere Wherfore of you in all my best ye maydens that be present here axe mercy with all myne herte entere Of all that euer that hath be spoken sayd And lowly praye you be not euyll a payd.
And they echone thanked god of all With herte and wyll bothe in worde and dede That he on Ioseph hath inspeciall His grace of newe made for to sprede To voyde awaye all his hole drede Of euery conceyt and imageninge To make hym knowe the trouthe of this thynge.
There thorowe in soth the ioye gan renewe Amonge hem all echone of one accorde The armonye entuned was so trewe Betwene hem that there was none discorde Nat so moche as a litell worde And thus in ioye a whyle lete hem dwell And of the Bysshops forth will tell.
Howe the Bisshop dyd do sompmon Ioseph for our Lady was with chylde Capitulo. xxvii.
TOuchynge this thinge playnly yf conne Howe worde by worde sothely in sentence Of this thynge the rumour is yronne And reported that thorow necligence Of this Ioseph: or by vyolence Howe that Marie goth with chylde greate Wherfore they haue in a sodeyn heate.
Cyted hym afore hym to apere And he came forthe with sober countenaunce Of whome anone the Bysshop gan enquere Abyathar of his gouernaunce From poynt to poynt with euery circumstaunce Touchinge this thynge what it might amounte Or howe that Ioseph wolde yeue a counte.
That Marie debonayre and so mylde That somtyme was of suche opynyon In the temple is greate nowe with chylde pages missing] Of tonges large and euery fantasye As is somtyme shewed by the hewe Of them that dranke the drynke of Ielosye As Numeri dothe clerely specefye Wherfore anone there is nomore to seye Make you redy for ye bothe tweye.
Shulle~ make a taste whether it be soure or sote There is none agaynsay ne excusacion Tyll the trouthe be ryped in the rote Ne shullen procede to this conclusion That god list make a declaracion Of all this thynge for fauour or for routhe There is no mene but the playne trouthe.
For yf god liste that your innocence Lyke your deserte by openly excused Than is your merite of your excellence That ye toforne falsely were accused And sithen this prefe may nat be refused But that ye muste obeye to the lawe Come of anone you not withdrawe.
Do sette her forth and brynge her to presence That hath in vertue so excellent a name In whome was neuer yet founde offence But vnto this tyme euer floureth in her fame And standeth at large from euery maner blame Nowe let her come lyke as god your ewre For you disposeth taketh your auenture.
And she was of her frendes brought Knowinge not what all this might mene Deuoyde of drede bothe in herte and thought For drede in soth: may nat do no tene To conscience that is of synne clene Ne vengeaunce there no place ocupyeth Where innocence a soule vngylty gyeth.
For the fyre may no whyle brenne After the brondes be taken awaye Ne the ryuer holde his course and renne The hede sprynge drye sothely this is no naye Ne vengeaunce playnly make may none assaye To execute agaynst innocence Ne voyde of synne his mighty vyolence.
For nothinge but synne may engender shame For selde or nat ben the chekes rede Of hym in soth that is deuoyde of blame For who so is clene taketh litell hede To wynke or blenke for ony maner drede And for the assaute of ony misty cloude Light of vertue may no whyle shroude.
It may a while be derked with a skye As is amonge the fayre bright sonne And with the wyndes of malice and enuye The clere sterres often wexen donne But whan trouth sette abroche his tonne To make the soth openly be knowe The wynde of falsenes may no lenger blowe.
Howe our Ladyes frendes wayled and morned whan the Bysshoppes made so stronge a prefe of her virginyte.
THan sythen trouthe may no whyle dare Hornes shrynke ne hyde hym in his neste But lyke a sonne his light abrode declare Whan she that was the veray chosen cheste Of all clennesse and there with all the beste Of all good howe myght it betyde Her light of vertue to be sette a syde.
That it nyll shyne maugre who sayth naye Whan her beames ben openly discured As golde in fyre fyned by assaye And as the tryed siluer is depured And she that was in vertue moste assured Where the holy ghoste his dwellinge dyd sette Howe myght than ony mystes lette.
The clere light of her parfytnesse Or ony maner prefe or probacion In ony parte for to make it lesse For light wyll out it may not be borne downe And so will trouthe haue dominacion For ony falsenes that men can conspyre Than she that was so fully sette a fyre.
Of the holy ghoste ne dare but lytell drede To drynke water whether it be thyke or clere To take a of her may denhede For her harme it shall haue no power For to deface her coloure or her there But rather amende more and clarefye The derke dymmynge of euery clowde skye And so Marie standynge in the place And all her frendes about enuyron Where men may se vpon many a face Of frendely routhe and compassion The salte teeres fall and renne downe For drede and loue they had for to sene So harde assaye made on her age grene.
But she alwaye constant as a wall In thought in chere abasshed neuer a dele Ne in her herte dredeth nat at all But vpon god tristeth alwaye wele That he of trouth shall trye out the stele And by that she spake but wordes fewe Withouten speche he shall the dede shewe.
And whan the water fully was confecte Lyke the statute and the rytes olde Bisshoppe hath the cuppe fyrste directe Unto Ioseph and hym the parell tolde And manly he gan it holde And dranke her vp chaunged nat his chere And seuen tymes aboute the Aultere.
Of face and colour alwaye lyke newe And to Marie also the Bisshope brought cuppe of water she of herte trewe Accepteth eke this godely fresshe of hewe And or she dranke this holy parfyte mayde All openly thus to god she sayde.
Howe our Lady prayed to god to shewe her virginite.
OSothfast lorde that hast the knowlechynge Of euery thynge thorowe thy might And art so truwe and so iuste a kyng To hygh and lowe thou wilt do right And nothing may be shrouded fro thy sight Thorowe none engyne ne thy face asterte But sothtastly knowest euery herte.
So that no wight fade may ne fayne Tofore the eye of thy sapience Nowe let thy grace downe fro heuen trayne Clerely in dede and nat by apparence To shewe in me yf there be offence Of any gylte myne auowe to appeche To the praye so thy light to reche.
That it be couthe here all openly To wete in soth whether in chastite Haue ledde my lyfe as faythfully Lyke as thou knowest for the loue of the And if haue my virginite Concerned hole this is myne oryson Make openly a demonstracian.
And with that worde the drinke she dyd ataste And went her course aboute the Aultre And all the people gan to gasen faste If any signe dyd in her appere Other in colour countenaunce or chere But all for nought playnly as tolde The more on her they loken and beholde.
The more she was in her sight fayre And lyke as Phebus in Ioly grene maye Whan she hath chased the derke misty ayre Shineth more clere the bright Somers daye Whan thylke vapours ben driuen clere awaye Right so Ioseph and also Marie So fresshe were in euery wightes eye.
That to beholde they thought it dyd he~ goode The longe daye in her opynion For in her face alwaye was the bloode Without poling or any drawing downe And alwaye more fayre of inspeccion Of whiche thinge the people gan meruayle And for astoned thoughten her wittes fayle.
Howe the Bysshope and the people dre+de hem of the assaye that was made to our Lady Capitulo. xxxiii.
Lest that god on he~ wolde take For they so ferre goddes might haue assayed Of errour blynde and ignoraunce And right forthwith of hertely repentaunce They bonchen her brestes with fystes wo~der sore And all attones fellen downe afore.
This holy mayde with humble reuerence And wolden her fete haue kyssed there a none Askynge mercy of her greate offence And she forgaue it hem euery chone And all the Bisshoppes and the people gone Benignely to brynge her awaye And to her paleyse fully her conueye.
Of whome the noyse to the heuen ronge With herte and speche as they magnefye The lorde aboue in euery wightes tonge For ioye and myrthe gan hym glorefye And all the daye thus in melodye They ladde forth tyll it drowe to eue And godely than of her they toke her leue.
And forth they went euery man his waye In the storye as made is memorye But Marie in all the haste she maye Entred is in to her oratorie As she that hath wonne the victorie Of all tho that aforne gan muse Her mayden hede of malice to accuse.
And thorowe her merite hath ye mouthes shette And lippes closed of hem that weren in were And day by day kepinge her closette Continuelly laye in her prayere Expectaunt euer lyke as ye shall here With humble herte and deuoute obeysaunce Upon the tyme of her delyueraunce.
The holy ghoste beynge ay her guyde Her chaumbre she kept her day awaytinge As ye shall here if ye liste to abyde And god toforne yet or the byrdes singe And or that Flora doth the floris sprynge Tofore the calendes of Apryll or of Maye My purpose is playnly if that maye.
For to procede forth in his dyte So as can or make mencion Of the feste and solempnite That called is the Incarnacion Onely through helpe and supportacion Of her that is so plenteous benigne Or that Phebus entre in the signe.
With this carecte of the Ariete Of this feste somwhat shall wryte But alas the Rethorikes swete Of Petrake fraunces that coude so endyte And Eullius with all his wordes whyte Full longe agone and full olde of date Is dede alas and passed into fate.
ANd eke my maister Chaucers nowe is gre+ue The noble rethore Poete of Britaine That worthy was the laurer to haue Of Poetrie and the palme attayne That made firste to distille and rayne The golde dewe dropes of speche eloquence In to our tonge thrugh his excellence.
And fonde the floures firste of rethorike Our rude speche onely to enlumine That in our tonge was neuer none hym lyke For as the sonne dothe in heuen shyne In mydday spere downe to vs by lyne In whose presence no sterre may appere Right so his dyttes withouten any pere? Euery makinge with his light distayne In sothfastnes who so taketh hede Wherfore no wonder though myne herte playne Upon his deth and for sorowe blede For want of hym nowe in my greate nede That sholde alas conueye and directe And with his supporte amende and correcte.
The wronge traces of my rude penne There as erre and go not lyne right But that for he ne may me can nomore but with all my might With all myne herte myne inwarde sight Prayeth for hym that nowe lyeth in cheste To god aboue to gyue his soule good reste.
And as can forthe will procede Sithen of his helpe there may no socour be And though my penne be quakinge ay for drede Nether to Clyo ne to Calyope Me liste not call for to helpe me Ne to no muse my poyncell for to gye But leue all this and saye vnto Marie.
clere Castell and the chaste Toure Of the holy ghoste mother and virgine Be thou my helpe conceyle and socoure And let the stremes of thy mercy shyne In to my breste this thyrde boke to fyne That thorowe thy supporte and benigne grace It to parforme may haue lyfe and space.
Howe Criste was borne after the maki~ge of the worlde fyue thousande and hondred foure score and. xix. yere.

His name was regestred with hem there Perpetuelly to be in mynde And this discriuinge if ye liste to here Was made fyrste in Sirie as fynde By one Cirinus the people for to bynde To be to Rome.

Howe Ioseph our Lady went to Bethleem to paye trybute.
THe yere of Herode thyrty yere and one Whan made was the discripsion As ye haue herde that Ioseph muste gone To Bethleem for conclusion To paye his tribute in his owne towne As the statute afore dothe specefye By cause that he and also Marie Wherof the housholde the tribe borne Called Iuda and of the kynrede Of worthy Dauid as haue sayde toforne And on her iourney as they gan hem spede And holy Ioseph dyd her brydell lede And sodeynly Marie than abrayde And vnto Ioseph euen thus she sayde.
wys quod she me thinketh that se Two folkes greately discordinge Upon the waye apperinge vnto me That one reioysinge that other compleyninge To whome Ioseph benignely lokinge Answered agayn bad her ryde in peace And prayed her also nat to be rechelece Ony wordes for to speke in vayne But holde her waye and her iourney right And vnwarely afore them in the playne Appered an Angell with face sterne bright Of whome the beaute gaue a pleasaunt light The place enuyron and a swete odoure And his clothynge lyke the Lyly floure.
Was whyte in soth as snowe that falleth newe Whiche gan anone chere and loke to meue And therewithall with a chaunged hewe Began also Ioseph to repreue And shortely bad his wordes that he leue And sayde in soth that he was to blame For to be bolde ony wordes to tame.
Agaynste Marie through thy necligence To saye that she spake ony wordes vayne For that she sawe was none apparence But veray soth as she hath it sayne For truste me well and be right certayne Of this folke of whiche she spake to the In sothfastnes lyke as thou shalt se Ben the folkes and the peoples twayne That ben disseuered in full large space That one of Iewes that wepe shall and playne With many tere distillinge in her face That wilfully shall refuse his grace Of frowarde herte for to be benigne To deuoyde and playnly to resigne.
The Synagoge with her rightes olde Whiche in shorte tyme shall drawe to decline And her faces quenche and wexe colde With sacred light that weren wonte to shyne For tyme is come that they muste fyne And the waylinge of her derked chere Unclose shall shewe as bright and clere.
This tyme of grace fully to obeye With herte will with humble chere For goddes worde that no man may withsaye Hath hasted it gone full many a yere To Abraham and also Isaac in feare And to Iacob that in her holy sede Full hastely who so will take hede.
Shall all the peoples blessed be Through out the worlde in euery lande reme And with that worde that Ioseph might se The Angell stye aboue the Sonne beme And he goth forthe towarde Bethleme With Marie tyll that they bothe twayne In full litell space gan to attayne.

That was sequestred and sette a syde Out of all prees the story sayth expresse Made for bestes therin to abyde Full streyte narowe shadoweth with derknesse In to the whiche Ioseph gan hym dresse With Marie to reste there all night And as she entred a newe sodeyn lightÂ· All the place enlumined enuyron That shoue as bright as ony somers day So that this litell humble mancion Was fresshe and light as Phebus is in May Whiche gan to wexe and encreace ay Whyle she was there all be that it was night And right anone the sothfast Sonne of light.
Of all our ioye cast hym to aryse And shedde his light to glade all mankynde For towarde midnight shortly to deuyse Whan all was hushte holy writte maketh mynde As sothely as he dyd hym wynde In the sydes of this holy mayde So esely this newe sonne abrayde.
Whan he was borne in to this mortall lyfe Upon the erthe to shede his brightnesse Withouten helpe of ony mid wyfe Or of his mother trauayle or sekenesse For she that fyrste conceyued in clennesse It sat right well that she shulde also Withouten trauayle or ony maner wo For to go quyte at her deliueraunce And specially haue a prerogatyfe In her chyldinge to fele no penaunce Sithen she was mayde mother and wyfe Chosen of god for to stynte our stryfe Of all women by her selfe alone Wherfore it sat nat her to crye and grone.
Lyke to other women that be inly syke In the tyme of theyr trauaylinge Wherfore sithen she was to none other lyke No payne felte she the houre of her childinge And as fynde at her deliueringe There was no wight but her selfe alone For thylke tyme Ioseph was out gone.
Howe Ioseph went to seche a myd wyfe to our Lady.
IN full greate haste to enquere and seke Some mid wyfe to helpe in this nede And in this whyle with her eyen meke She chylded hath this floure of maydenhede And home agayne as Ioseph gan hym spede And to the place the midwyues brought Euen at the dore abasshed in her thought.
Stoden still a stoned of that light And the brightnesse that shone in the place Agayne kynde that tyme of the night That they ne might susteyne in her face And no wonder for the Sonne of grace Within whiche caste his light so ferre Of whome the Mone and eche other Sterre.
Receyuen her light eueriche in her spere All by that he laye here in erthe lowe In a stable with his sacred chere Sole with his mother that no man dyd knowe Of whome her loke she mekely gan to throwe Godely beholdynge his fayre yonge face And knelynge downe began to enbrace.
His tender lymmes in her armes twayne And wrapped hym in clothes tenderlye And toke hym vp sothely gan hym leyne In her lappe and full humbly She behelde his features by an by So fayre shapen in party and in all And with her mylke very celestiall.
And heuenly lycour of her pappes smale His tender lymmes she spredde in euery coste The whyte bawme to make it auale Fet from the conduyte of the holy ghoste Upon the thynge that she loued moste And gaue hym so wke of the pyment That spronge grewe out of the holy rote.

And lifte hym vp sothely in to the stall Where the Asse and the Oxe stode And on her knees she gan anone to fall And worshipped hym this beste of all good That gyueth to Angels and to man food And than this mayde with chere With face erecte and handes eke in fere.
deuoute prayer that our Lady made whan Christe was borne.
TO god aboue began thus for to praye lorde quod she with all my full might Tho whome eche thynge iustely muste obeye To the than as it is skyll and right That thou so godely liste to haue a sight To my mekenes though vnworthy be And nat disdayne of thy benignite.

As it is right Ioseph with vs twayne To take his parte what fortune so betyde Lyke as thou liste of grace to ordayne And than anone right in the tyde Ioseph cam me and stode her besyde And sodeynly whan he the chylde doth Full humbly knelinge on his kne.
Howe the midwyfe durste nat entre with Ioseph in to the house for a greate light appered within.
WOrshipped hym wt all his herte might With all his will all his full thought And telled Marie for feare of the light The midwyues that he had brought Astoned were that durste nought Entre me but kepte hem aferre For cause onely that a newe sterre.

And he therto mekely dyd obeye And with a knyfe made full sharpe of stone His mother lokynge with a pyteous eye The chylde was corue therwithall anone That all aboute the reed blode gan gone Without abode as saythe Bonauenture And for the payne he dyd endure.

The thyrde maner ye maye eke consyder Howe with the knyfe of greate aduersite That he was kyte firste whan he cam hyder Takynge for vs our humanite And alther laste with full cruelte For vs he suffred circumcision Upon the crosse durynge his passion.
Howe Christe suffred circumcision in his chosen people lii. in foure maner who so can take hede Christe in it is chosen by good inspeccion Here in this worlde withouten any drede Of newe he suffred circumcision The fyrste is made by false detraccion That awaye bothe frende and fame And the shynynge of her goode name.
The seconde is by false tyrannye Of suche that haue no conscience at all But taketh awaye by cursed Unrightfully her goodes temporall And the thyrde sothely is moste mortall Of heretykes that falsely disobeye To holy chyrche to out faythe vareye.
The fourth is made by effusion of blode Of tyraunte that the body sleeth Whan they of malice agayn the fayth stode To execute her venym vp by deth To make to yelde vp the breth Whome Christe Iesu eternally in glorie Ordayned hath palme of victorie.
Eke fyue tymes Christe in his manhede Shed his blode by effusion And alther fyrste he dyd blede Upon the daye of circumcision And in soth tofore his passion Upon the hyll for auguysshe whan heswete The rede blode whiche all his body wette.
The thyrde tyme his blode moste vertuous Gan out by many a cruell wounde Whan that he was this kynge moste gracious Of the Iewes to a pyler bounde The fourth tyme eke as it is founde He spent his blode for our alther good Whan he was nayled hygh vpon the rood.
And alther laste whan Longeus a fere Through his herte playnly as fynde On Caluere hym perced with a spere That blode water as bokes make mynde Gan streme downe to his eyen blynde By whose vertue anone this paynym knyght Onely of grace recouered hath his sight.
And in his bokes eke as it is tolde Howe the pyece of his Incision Was by an Angell in an vrne of golde To Charles brough in a vision And he anone of greate affeccion Of this myracle for the excellence Made it be kept for greate reuerence.
And at Acon but Full many a yete by reuolucion In a chyrche sothely of Marie But clerkes haue an opinion That the daye of Resurrexion Whan Christe Iesu rose from deth to lyue.
To the place where that it cain fro Sithen that it was sothely as fynde Of his manhede parteynynge therto And a patty longynge to his kynde Though be so that bokes make mynde That in Rome it is yet preserued And yere by yere whan this teste is serued.
In a churche whiche men of custome call Sancta Sanctorum of olde foundacion The same daye there the prestes all Solempnely make a stacion Whan all the people gone on procession Fully in hope better for to spede From yere to yere there they singe and rede.
And ferthermore the storie dothe deuise The same daye righ fortwith anone In the Temple as they hym circumcise He named was Iesu of echone The whiche name longe or that agone Was of the Angell tolde sayde afore To his mother or that he were bore.
Howe the people of god that duke Iosue had in gouernau~ce weren saued by the stedfaste beleue of the name of Iesus.

For this is the name who so can discerne Moste excellent and moste of dignite The name of names sacred from eterne As say the Bernarde who so liste to se Figured fyrste vnto Iosue Through his knyghthode whan he sholde lede The people of god to saue hem in her nede.
For this is the name that hertes moste desyre For therin is so passynge swetenes For it may beste with grace enspyre And with plente of all goodely ryches It is comforte so socoure in sekenes Refuyte alfo reste and remedye To all tho that felen maladye.
Agaynste In all this worlde th maye For this name and deuyne That hertes seke it dothe with hole habounde It cureth sores it heleth euery wounde And saueth man fro many a swerde spere Where euer they ryden in laude ferre or nere.
It is firste writen in the boke of lyfe For worthyest and moste of reuerence And it is eke beste preseruatyfe Agayne the assent of the vyolence Of wicked eyre to voyde pestelence And from the deth hem that playnen sore Of his vertue to helthe it dothe restore.
It is also sothfaste saluacion To all that be in pouerte and in nede It is deffence it is proteccion In eche parille and in euery drede It is also the guerdon and the mede In them that in exyle of oultrage Repeyre fynall of her pylgrymage.
This is the welle with the foure streames Wherof writeth Bernarde in his sentence That through worlde refressheth all Romayns It is so holsom of suche excellence The fyrste he calleth the streame of sapience Of whiche the flode moste inly is habounde And right wisnes he nameth the secounde.

Whan we shall parte out of this wofull lyfe And make an ende of this captiuite Or Herodes through his mortall stryfe The fende by trappe vs thorowe his cruelte Nowe that tyme lady of thy benignite Agaynste the snares of this dredfull werre To lyfe eterne be thou our loode Sterre.
Glorie and pryce laude hygh honoure blessed quene be gyuen vnto the That were of golde the close chaste toure Surely founded vpon humilite Shette with the keye of From all synne fully to be assured And of the holy ghoste rounde aboute enuired.
That neuer no brennynge of flesshely hete Assayle might thyne holy tabernacle With dewe of grace thy closette was so swete Fulfilled with vertue onely by myracle God chase thy wombe for his tabernacle And halowed it so clene in euery cooste To make it sacrarie for his owne ghooste.
Natwithstandynge that thou were so clene Aboue all other by eleccion Of mekenes onely thou heuenly quene Thou liste to haue none indignacion The day to passe of thy purificacion But to fulfille the precepte of the lawe In euery thynge nat a poynte withdrawe.
But euen lyke as it is specified Leuitici who so can vnderstande To the Temple to be purified Thou mekely come thyne offrynge in hande All be the lawe sette on the no bande For it is there made mencion Touchynge the lawe of purificacion.
If a women conceyue by a man And haue a chylde by medlynge hem betwene That it be a male the lawe teacheth than Fourty dayes that she shulde be vnclene And kepe her close no man shulde her sene And after that she shulde her offrynge In lawe expressed to the Temple brynge.
But taketh thede in conclusion Howe this lawe lyke as ye shall fynde Ne was nat put but by condicion Onely to them that corupt weren by kynde Through touche of man of suche is made mynde The dayes nombred of her purgacion To come and make her oblacion.
And brynge a lambe the whiche in sacrefise Shulde all be brought in the holy place And a pygeon as lawe doth deuise She shulde eke offre as for her trespace And than all fylthe from her to enchace She of the preste halowed sacrefied Retorneth home and fully purifyed.
And if she had in her possession Redely no lambe onely for pouerte Than shulde she take for her oblacion Two turtell Doues therwithall go fre Or two pygeons like as ye may se Leuitici where as by distinction Of this offerynge is made discripcion.
But this may de who so can take hede Excluded fro this condicion That bare a chylde without mannes Brynge euer from all corruption Where through she was from suche oblacion By lawe excepte was vnder no charge For her clennes standynge at her large.
For of her wombe the cloyster virginall Was euer eliche bothe firste and laste Closed shytte as Castell pryncipall For the holy ghoste deuised and caste And at bothe tymes shytte as lyke faste In her chyldynge nomore through grace ybroke Than at her conceyuynge than it was vnloke.
For nature withouten any stryfe Repugnaunce or any resistence Gaue this maybe prerogatyfe As mother to haue experience Onely of chyldynge fele none offence Nether of sekenes ne of suche maner wo In trauelynge as other women do.
She was excepte from all suche passion For her clennes so was none but she And yet her tyme of purification She dyd abyde of her humilite And like as lawe ordeyneth by decrete After all this of custome as she oughte To the Temple she her offerynge broughte.
To gyue example onely of mekenes To the lawe she mekely wolde obeye Fro poynte to poynte the Gospell sayth expres And on no syde wolde it withsaye And though that she of golde no keye To bye a lambe for pouerte constreynynge yet she full mekely to make her offerynge.
Brought two Turtels as it is sayde aforne That was the offrynge of pore folke echone Whiche to the Temple whan she hath borne As custome was she offered hem anon And after that olde Simeon With humble herte and a full payne The chylde embracynge in his armes twayne.
Howe Simeon receyued Christe of our Lady in the Temple.
OF his mother goodely gan hym take Of louynge and greate deuocion And suche a ioye of hym gan to make Within hym selfe of hygh affeccion That heue coude nother by worde ne soun Outwarde declare neyther with chere ne face The passynge ioye that gan his herte enbrace.
And he was rightfull holy and vertuous This olde man this blessed Simeon Dredefull also and passynge famous Amonge the prestes to reken hem euerichone That was expectant and full longe agone Of the comforte and consolacion Of Israel in his entencion.
For he had answer of the holy ghoste In his prayere that he shulde se The byrthe of Christe that is of power moste And eke fro deth that he shall go fre To the tyme of his natiuite And to the daye that with his eyen olde The byrthe of hym that he may beholde.
The whiche day that with his eyen olde And for that he by reuelacion The tyme knowe he hath the waye To the Temple with hygh deuocion To se of Christe the presentacion Howe that Marie and Ioseph eke also The chylde presented and her offerynge do.
And for that Christe was the fyrste borne After the lawe in his tender age Nat of as ye haue herde toforne But of Iuda comen by lignage Therfore his mother moste holy of vysage Her offrynge made liste nat for to stryue For hym agayne to paye shyllynges fyue.
Lyke as the custome of the lawe was She mekely made his redempcion And Simeon beholdynge all this cas Full in his inspeccion For loue brennynge by affeccion Of very herte sodaynly abrayed Holdynge the chylde euen thus he seyed.
Howe where and whan Simeon made Nunc dimittis secundum verbum tuum in pace.
Blisfull lorde of thy hygh grace It that thou liste nowe thou mayste me lete Out of this lyfe in rest and peace to pace And suffre me to dye in quyete For nowe to me deth is wonder swete Nowe haue sene thy helthe and thy socoure And of mankynde lorde and sauyoure.
Whiche thou haste dyght afore the faces all Of eche people to make hem glad and light To lete thy grace so to erthe fall Thorowe all worlde to shewe his bemes bright That maye be called for comforte of his light Unto all the gentyles the reuelacion The glorie also and the saluacion.
Of Israel the people in speciall To voyde hem out of all derkenes And Marie full mekely listeneth all And gan merueyle with greate aduisednes Of the wordes that he gan expres And Ioseph eke gan to wonder also And Simeon hem blessynge bothe twoÂ· Spake to Maxie and sayde in audience Beholde and se in thyne inspeccion Howe he is put in ruyne and offence Of many one here in his region And to so me in resurrexion That shall releue thorowe his mighty grace And thorowe thy soule shal a sharpe swerde pace.
Of hertely wo to se his passion That passyngly shall be bitter and fell To opene hertes by confession Her soroufull thoughtes openly to tell And Anna than doughter of Phanuell Borne of the Trybe of the kynrede Called Asser sothely as rede.

profytable declaracion of the of the Turtell and the Doue Capitulo. lxxxi.
NOwe as me semeth in this hye That named is the Purification Euery man oughte to be glad and mery And with good and Deuoutely brynge his oblacion And offre fyrste the turtell of innocence Of very mekenes and hertely pacience.
And who wolde this offrynge make a right He maye nat fayle none of bothe two Fyrste shyne in clennes with his chaste light As the Turtell and therwith also Lyche the Doue bothe in and wo His herte daunte so by temporaunce To voyde rancour and plante in sufferaunce.
And as the Turtell by contemplacion For synne soroweth with greate waymentynge Onely for loue of thylke eternall dileccion That lasteth ay and hath none endynge And as the byrthe sheweth the comynge Of grene wherwith fresshe byrdes newe Right so of vertue with floures fayre of hewe.
He muste exampell of the Turtell take And be well ware that he nat ne varye But lyue sole whan he hath loste his make And in prayer be also solitarie And loke alwaye that he nat ne tarye On no careyne of no flesshely hede And with all this to take also hede.
That he his lyfe lede nat in vayne But like a Doue busely aspye Where he maye the grayne And that he out of companye Waytynge also the galle of enuye And that he haue indignacion Of synfull luste out of corrupcion.
Of any careyne to foster hym and fede And euermore with all his dusy payne Eschewynge synne loue god and drede And with the Doue syghe and compleyne For his offence and with wynges twayne Take his flight as ferforth as he can Thorowe parfyte loue bothe to god and man.
And as the Doue touchet eke her make Onely with kissynge whan they to gyder gone So moste heÂ· whether he slepe or wake Thorowe chastite set his herte in one And lyke a Doue maketh his neste of stone This is to seye amonge all his pleasaunce He muste his daunte with penaunce.
And as the Doue with her eyen meke Of kynde aspyeth amyd the Riuere The Haukes shadowe whan he dothe her seke Sechynge his repaste bothe ferre and nere Right so muste he with parfyte eyen clere Amyd the watres full of wo and stryfe In the wawes of his mortall lyfe.
The dedely shadowe of the fende esche That wayteth hym with snares large huge And to the deth ay dothe hym pursewe To trappe hym here in his deluge And lyke a Doue to his refuge By grace onely if he maye escape Or deth bytraye hym with his sodeyne trape.
And who so by clennes with the Turtell As tofore haue made mencion And lyke a Doue afore his perill fleeth Of deth to esche we the persecution And can be meke in tribulation dare recorde it write it for soth Truely to god he his offerynge doth.
And who that euer liueth in chastite And hath enuy enclosed in his herte He maye well offre what so that he be To god a Turtell but the Doue nought Wherfore they muste be to gyther brought That clennes by sothfaste vnite Without partynge be knytte with charite.
And sothely than there is no more to sayne Whan his offerynge and oblation Is iustely made to god of bothe twayne It is accepted of more deuocion And for to make a shorte discripcion Of the Turtell and the Doues kynde Redeth these verses and ye shull it fynde.
Alta cantando gemit veniens Uer Nunciat et caste viuit solus que moratur Pullos fo morticinium que fugit Erranea legat volat sociata cadauera Felle care que per oscula tangit Petro dat huic dum fugit hoste visum Rostro non ledit geminos pullos bene nutrit.
This feste also bothe of more and lesse Through out the worlde in euery region Called is the feste of For sondry skylles in conclusion As olde bokes make mencion And howe this feste fyrste toke his name So as can to you wyll atame.
SOmtyme whan Rome through his hye renou~ Was moste flourige power might Euery fyfthe yere by reuolucion In Februarie vpon the firste night Eche man and chylde with a taper light Went in the cyte two and two a pas Unto a Temple whiche sacred was.
To of olde fundacion That mother was to Mars omnipotente In whose honoure this procession Ordeyned was by greate auysemente At eche lustre wenynge in her entente That her power and greate worthynes Preserued was through helpe of this goddes.
From all assaute of euery aduersayre Supposynge fully in her oppinion That she fortune made debonayre For to susteyne the honoure of her towne And through her helpe and meditacion That mighty Mars to encrease her glorie In all conqueste gaue to hym glorie.
For whiche cause through out the cyte As ye haue herde of hygh lowe estate Was fyrste ordeyned this solempnite In the Temple that was consecrate To Februa the goddes fortunate Thorowe helpe of whome they were victorious And so this custome supersticious.
In Rome towne as myne auctor seyth Obserued was longe and many a daye yet after that they tourned to the feyth But euer in one this ryte they kepte alwaye For olde customme is harde to put awaye And also vsage greueth folke full sore To do awaye that they haue kepte yore.
But at the laste Pope Of the people seynge this errour And that the customme was full Dyde his deuoyre and also his laboure That ryte to chaunge in to the honoure Of our Lady so that this hye feste From the hyest downe to the loweste.
Euery man and woman in her hande To the Temple shulde a taper brynge Thorowe out the worlde in euery maner lande And ther withall make her offrynge After the Gospell the prestes hand kissynge With light solempne that all might it sene In honoure onely of the heuen quene.
That best may be our mediatrice To her sone that is without fayle Bothe lorde and kynge and she Of lande and see of peace and of batayle Withouten whome no conquest maye auayle For she hath power more in sothfastnes Than Februa of Rome the goddes.
And thus this ryte was vtterly refused By Sergius as ye haue herde deuise That was aforne of hem of Rome vsed Full many a daye in her paynym wyse Whome to she we all Christen muste despise And of Candels whan this rite gan passe Came the name fyrste of Candelmasse.
This feste also of full longe agone The name toke of the procession Made of Anna and holy Simeon When they hym mete with greate deuocion Brought to the Temple to this oblacion As was the lawe custome and vsaunce Of holy churche for a remembraunce.
Obserued for the fro yere to yere Of February on the fyrste daye With sacred light vpon taperis clere Shynynge as bright as Phebus in Maye Whan the people in what they can or maye Full redy ben of one entencion To make in figure a presentacion.
Of Christe Iesu with all her full might Signefied who so can take hede By the tapre that we offre light For tyrste the waxe betokeneth his manhede The weke his soule the fyre his godhede For as the waxe is made of newe Thorowe small bees of floures fresshe of hewe.
Thorowe clennes onely and diligent labours On blossomes gadred to hyue brought So Christes manhode growe out of a floure Whose fresshe beaute of coloure fadeth nought For a mayde clene in will and thought Lyche as waxe of floure sote and glade Is tryed out and dothe hem nat to fade.
So Christe Iesu conseruynge her clennes His manhode toke of a mayde fre She standynge hole flourynge in fayrenes With all the fresshenes of virginite And as a tapre is one to gether on thre So thylke lorde that is bothe thre and one Toke flesshe and blode to saue vs euerychone.
Of a mayde whiche this daye fro Bethleem Mekely wente to be purified To the Temple of Ierusalem As her toforne it is specified In whose honour this feste is magnefied Of all Christen men with fresshe tapres shene To signefye who so that will be clene.
Muste offre a taper to gether made of thre Of feythe and werke and true entencion For sothfastly but they conioyned be Withoute partynge or deuision Nother his offrynge ne oblacion Howe fayre outwarde playnly that it seme To god aboue it maye neuer queme.
And though his taper brenne bright all daye And enuiron make his light to shede If werke of fay the prolonged be awaye And true entent folowe nat the dede Fare well his guerdon his merite his mede For whan these thre be nat knytte in oneÂ· He is nat able to offrynge for to gone.
For if these thre to gyder be nat meynte Feyth werke and hoole entencion His offrynge fareth but as a taper queynte That gyueth no light but brightnes enuiron For derke of dede from all deuocion His offrynge is but if this thre Be knette in one thorowe perfyte vnite.
Nowe Christe that art the sothfaste holy The hert of man for to enlumyne Upon vs wretches for thy see so bright Lete the Sonne of thy mercy shyne For loue of her that is a pure virgyne Whiche on this daye to the Temple went Of mekenes onely the for to present.
Thorowe whose prayer lorde of thy might Graunte vs grace whan we be olde And shall dye to holde our tapers light Tofore thy see where that it is tolde Seuen Chaundelars all of pure golde Fresshely with light standeafore thy face Theder to come of mercy graunt vs grace.
And in this exyle where as we soiourne Graunt vs lorde whyle that we ben here In February as Phebus dothe retourne The circuite of his golden spere Upon this daye ay fro yere to yere With tapers fresshe and bright torches shene To kepe and halowe in honoure of that quene To whome this feste is in speciall Dedicat bothe of more and lasse Whiche bare her chylde in a litell stall Betwene an Oxe and a sely Asse And blessed quene this feste of Candelmasse To thy seruauntes shelde and socour be To kepe and saue from all aduersite.

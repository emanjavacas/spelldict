a dialogue betwixt lewis and the devil in the last year of his puissance with his last will and testament

lewis
what shrill and eccho'd groans possess my soul and what curs'd fiends my spirits thus controul sure the dog cerberus begins to howl

devil
make haste away have prepared room burning flames for thee to have thy doom trifle for thy fatal hour is come

lewis
am not lewis king of great renown who all curs'd hereticks did trample down who dare withstand my diadem and crown

devil
thou must submit both soul and body too and leave behind thee all thy popish crew thy pomp must drop into the shades below thy curs'd pride must have an overthrow thou straight along to hell must with me flee there end thy days in endless misery

lewis
didst thou not promise to prolong my years keep me free from jealousies and fears my bloody hands thou givest power to spill the blood of hereticks even at my will not thy dearest friend escape thy rage will nothing but my blood thy wrath asswage took thee as a friend therefore forbear to hinder me in my enjoyments here

devil
didst thou expect that shou'd take the pains to help thee in thy plots and have no gains

lewis
my diadem and crown i'll freely give for to escape eternity and live

devil
how canst thou live on earth and never dye canst thou escape a vast eternity no sure therefore make haste and come away thy soul and body shall my ransome pay in hell's consuming fire there shalt thou be tormented still with viper's cruelty

lewis
since no longer with thee can prevail since all my worldly power begins to fail since have left no time for to repent my sins here's my last will and testament

the will

unto my heir crown and scepter leave and my tyrannick actions do bequeath to him that he may ne'er delight in peace but daily wars and rumours may increase that he his subjects may oppress with fear and all the hereticks in pieces tear and when has laid his kingdom all in gore be hurried hence unto the stygian shore and there enjoy me who am gone before

to jemmy bequeath a prince of wales and would another but my vigour fails but hope my son and heir so kindly prove to dandle molly in the charms of love

my subject's curses to the pope leave and thus my worldly goods do bequeath
my stinking tomb an epitaph needs none since soul and body to the devil's gone

finis

VERIE PROFITABLE AND NECESSARIE DISCOVRSE CONCERNING THE obseruation and keeping of the Sabboth day, seruing as well to confute the superstition of the Iewes, which obstinately vrge the strict keeping of the seuenth day, as also to ouerthrowe the vaine and godlesse reasons of others, that stiffely at this day maintaine, that Christians ought to keepe no set or appoynted time to worship and serue the Lord in, in his Church and faithfull Congregation.
WRITTEN IN LATINE BY ZAcharias Vrsinus, sometimes Reader of the Diuinitie lecture in the Vniuersitie of Heidelberg in Germanie, and very nevvly turned into English, by Iohn Stockvvood Schoolemaster of Tunbridge.
TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL AND VERtuous Ladie, the Ladie Pellam of Laughton in the Countie of Sussex, Iohn Stockwood Schoolemaster of Tunbridge, vvisheth a plentifull increase of all spirituall and heauenly graces, and in the life to come, the perfect and ful fruition of ioyes euerlasting.
BEing not ignorant (right worshipful and vertuous Ladie) of the manifolde disputations not onely among the learned, but also of the great varietie diuersitie of opinions among the vulgar people and simple sorte, concerning the Sabboth day, the right vse of the same: some with the wayward and superstitious Iewes obstinately and stifly maintaining the ceremonial obseruation of the seuenth day,
the which they hold in no wise to be mutable, or to be altered and changed: others with the Atheists and godlesse Epicures vtterly denying, that there ought to
be any obseruation and keping of any day at all as wholly dedicated vnto the Lorde his seruice: and yet moreouer some others, who albeit they graunt it meete requisite that there should be some certain set day of the week seuered out fro~ the rest for the vse of the ministerie Church meetings, yea and the same also to bee that daye which we co~monly call the or Lords day, yet holding it lawfull as well on the same day, as any other day in the week, to exercise the customable vsual works, euery man of his ordinarie trade vocation: haue thought with my selfe that could not do better the~ to see: out a remedie for the staying of the co~sciences of the weaker number in this great varietie and doubtfulnes of assertions, tending to the ouerthrow of religion and impeachment of gods seruice.
Meeting therfore with a godly learned Worke of one Vrsinus a German in the which are profou~dly pithily handled many theologicall discourses and points of religion, among the rest, this of the Sabboth, in his expositio~ of the
co~ma~dement, finding the argume~t sit for the circumstance of the time, haue turned the same into our mother tongue, for the further
benefit of the godly christianly disposed, that they may haue in this poynt wherwith to satisfie both the~selues and others.
For in this smal treatise is debated the right vse of the Sabboth day,
what exercises on the same are allowable what to be refrained, wherin it is kept, wherin it is broke~: their argument co~futed, that think it not lawfull for Christians to keepe the the Lords day, their reasons also answered, which so stoutly co~tend for the Iewish obseruatio~ of the seue~th day: al these things being proued with most strong euident proues out of the word of God and holy scriptures, that in such sort, that the lyke is hardly to be met withall in so briefe short a Pa~phlet or treatise.
The necessitie heerof is apparant in regard of the time, wherein is so diuersly disputed concerning this questio~: the profit likewise shall easily (I doubt not) be reaped of all such as with single harts vpright mindes shal dilige~tly and without parcialitie peruse the same.
This my small labour, such as it is (simple slender confesse, in regard of my pains in tra~slating, but much behoueful auailable, in regard of the matter, for the church people of god) make bold to offer vnto
to the gentle acceptation of your good Ladiship, for manie causes.
First, that besides the manie other heauenlye graces of faith, knowledge of the will of God, loue vnto his euerlasting truth and holy Scriptures, care to walk in life and conuersation accordingly: with making much of the professors, and chiefly the preachers of the same: it maye be a further spur vnto you, to the stirring vp increasing of your godlye zeale for the Lord his seruice carefull sanctifying of his holy Sabboth, not onely in your owne person, but also in your whole familye: so that it may be truly said of you, to the glorie of God comfort of his people, as we read of that good vertuous captaine Iehoschuahh: my houshold wil serue the Lord.
For albeit the nu~ber be smal, the people few that haue a due regard of christian spending the Lordes daye, in hearing the word preached, in receiuing the sacraments, in praier, supplication, in priuate co~ferring with their families at home, of the word publiky preached (the greatest multitude both of men and women of all degrees and callinges, letting loose the raynes, and giuing
out the bridle vnto all kinde of vanities licentiousnesse) yet let this be your crowne and glorie (good madame) letting these go, to haue imitated and followed the example of those vertuous gentlewome~ of Thessalonica, whose praise is in the Gospel,
for their great diligence in reuerent obseruing the Sabboth day, in vsual frequenting resorti~g to heare the word, for the great co~fort of their soules.
And further, in the same place is the example of the godlye wome~ of Beroea co~mended, who not of custo~e,
but of zeale, not of constraint, but with all willingnesse, not as sad heauie, but with all readynesse and ioyfulnesse, not onelie heard the word preached by Paule and Silas, at the publike assemblies and meetings of the Church, but also vsed dailie and priuate conference in their houses at home, in serching the Scriptures, whether the things were so or no.
How comfortable is that also which we read in the
of the practise of the zealous women of Philippos, who in the coldnesse and slacknesse of men (as may appeare, very probablie be gathered) customablie assembled to the riuer without the Citie, to heare Paule preach on the Sabboth, where by
the opening of the heart of Lydia, it pleased the Lorde by the conuersion of one poore woman to beginne his kingdome in Macedonia, which woman is praised not onelie for religiousnesse in her selfe, but also for her whole familie, beeing godlie and christia~lie disposed.
For the text doth mention, that she was baptised, all her house: which Sacrame~t (no doubt) the holy Apostle would not haue administred vnto the~, vnlesse he had found in them the fruites testimonies of true Christianitie:
And here at no hand may wee let passe the worthie co~mendation, which Iohn giueth vnto the most vertuous worshipful Lady and her children, whose conuersation before the world was agreeable vnto their profession, according as the truth of the Lord requireth that it should be.
Which singular and notable exa~ple, as it generallie concerneth al christian and godly women, so dooth it most neerelie and properlie belong vnto your good Ladiship, all other gentle women of your place and calling.
For, if whatsoeuer examples of the olde fathers in the Scriptures are written for our learning, that by reading their examples, we should
expresse and followe their vertues, then doubtlesse are all women of great worshippe and dignitie of this godlie Ladie to learne, that it is not sufficient that they be religious and godlie themselues, but that they also labour to haue their whole families and households vnfainedlie to feare the Lord, which thing cannot bee performed without the diligent hearing of the word on the Lords day, other meetings of the Church, and priuate labouring in instructing and dailie teaching of our charges at home, the which good exercise, as can hope for at the handes of manie, so can promise and assure my selfe, that it shall bee carefullie practised of your W. of whome heare so well for zeale and loue of the truth, nothing doubting but that beeing compassed about with so greate a cloude of witnesses,
whose care hath beene so vehement and earnest for the true spending of the Sabboth, and Christian education of their famylies, with performance of other dueties of Godlynesse, all lets and stumbling blockes being remooued, you will dailie adde vnto that great good forwardnes, which the lord hath
wrought in you alredie a plentiful increase in all vertues, beautifying and garnishing a Christian Ladie, God by his holie spirite working in your heart a burning desire euerie daie more and more to imitate the commendable examples of these holy matrones before alleadged.
Secondlie, hauing receiued many benefits at the hands of that worthie Knight, sir Iohn Pellam, your late deceased husband, a Gentleman so well deseruing of his common wealth and Countrie, that verie enuie her selfe, if neuer so faine she woulde, shall yet neuer be able to burie in the dark lake of obliuion his due deserued praises: haue thought it meete and requisite to giue out before the world some dutifull testimonie of a thankfull minde in regard of the same, least might worthilie be condempned of that vice which is both hated of God and detested of men, meane the foule staine of ingratitude, which the verie Heathen haue recorded to be the chiefe vnto all filthinesse,
as being alwaies accompanied with blushles shamelesnesse, which may easily perswade vnto al kind of wickednes.
Thirdlie, in regard of your owne W. omitting such good graces, as are generally
knowen by the working of God his spirite to be in you, to the comfort of the godlie, (because that you of your modestie cannot abide to heare them, nor without suspition of flatterie may be thought to name them) the particular knowledge of vndeserued gentlenes from your good L. meant vnto me, most worthilie craueth some dutifull signification of my gratefull remembraunce of such most curteous kindnesse, the which, because my poore abilitie wyll suffer no other waie to expresse, accept (I most humblie beseech you) these paper thanks, vntil God shall offer some fitter occasion to testifie that vnfained thankefulnesse, which your singular courtesie most iustlie doth require, praying in the meane season the Lord, most abundauntlie in this life to direct you in all your waies to his glorie, and ioy of his chosen, and in the life to come to make you partaker of those vnspeakable blessings, which in most rich mercy he hath prepared for all those that in his Christ do trulie feare and serue him, to whome be all glorie both now and for euer Ame~. Fro~ Tunbridge, the
RIGHT GODlie and learned exposition vpon the fourth Commandement, concerning the Sabboth, and right vse of the same.
Sixe daies shalt thou worke, and doe all thy worke: but the seauenth daie there shall bee a Sabboth vnto the Lord thy God.
Thou shalt doe no worke, neither thou, nor thy sonne, nor thy daughter, nor thy seruaunt, nor thy maide, nor thy cattell, nor the straunger which is within thy gates.
For in sixe daies the Lord made heauen, earth, the sea, and whatsoeuer are in them, and rested the seauenth daie, and therefore he blessed the seauenth daie, and hallowed it.
THere are two parts of this lawe, the commandement, the reason of ye same.
And again, there are two parts of the co~mandement, of the which the one is morall or euerlasting, namelie,
that is to saie, that some certaine time be appointed for the ministerie of the Church, or publike worshippe of God.
The other is ceremoniall, and for a time, namelie, that this time shuld be the seuenth daie, and that in it should be obserued and kept the ceremonies of the Leuiticall lawe.
And that this part is for a time, and the other euerlasting, we doe vnderstand by the end of the commaundement, and causes of both these parts.
The end of the commaundement is the publike praising of God in the congregation, or the conseruation or maintenance and vse of the ministerie of the Church, which is an office ordained by God, to teach the Church concerning God and his will out of the word of God deliuered by the Prophets and Apostles, and to minister the sacraments according to the ordinaunce of God.
And God would haue at all times of the world that there shuld be publique assemblies of the Church, in the which should sound true doctrine concerning God, for these causes especially.
The first: that in mankinde God might be praised and called vpon,
but also with the publike voyce of the Church in this life, Psalm.
The second: that the publike and ordinarie preaching of doctrine, the rehearsing of prayers, and and vsing of ceremonies might be an exercise stirring vp and fostering faith and godlinesse, as the which without exercises by reason of our infirmitie and weakenesse doth very easely were colde.
He hath giuen some Apostles, others Prophetes, others Euangelists, others Pastors, and Doctors vnto the worke of the ministerie, vnto the edifying of the bodie of Christ: vntill we all come vnto the knowledge of the Sonne of GOD, vnto a perfect man, vnto the measure of the stature of Christ full growen, that wee be no longer children, which do wauer, and are caried about with euerie winde of doctrine, &c.
The third: that one should prouoke and stir vp another by their example vnto godlines, and vnto the praysing of God.
wil shew forth thy name vnto my brethre~, in the middest of the co~gregation will praise thee: yee that feare the Lord praise him, the whole seede of Iacob
The fourth: that consent and agréement in doctrine, and in the worship of God might be kepte in the church.
He hath giuen Pastors and Doctours vnto the growing together of the Saints, vntill that we all attaine vnto the vnitie of faith.
The fifth: that the church may be séene heard in mankind, and discerned knowen from the other multitude of men blasphemons idolatrous.
And God will haue the Church to be séene, that ye elect may be gathered vnto it, and the reprobate or become the more inexcusable, whilest they despise the voyce heard, and the calling of God, goe about to represse and keepe backe the same.
But haue they not heard? yea the sound of them hath gone forth into all the earth, and their wordes into the endes of the world.
Thankes be vnto God, who causeth, that we alwaies triumph in Christ, by vs in all places doth make manifest the sauor of his knowledge.
For we are the good sauour of Christ vnto God, in those which are saued, and in those which doo perish: to these the sauour of death vnto death, vnto them the sauour of life vnto life.
vnto the fall and rising againe of many in Israel, and for a signe that shall be spoken against, that the thoughts may be layde open out of manie hearts.
These causes appertaine not vnto any one certein time, but vnto al times of the Church and of the world.
Therefore God wil alwaies haue the ministerie of his Church preserued, and the vse and exercise therof frequented, practised, haunted:
and therefore the kinde of this commandement, or the morall part therof, fro~ the beginning of the world euen vnto the end, doth binde al men, namely that some Sabboth be kept, yt is to say, yt some time be appointed for sermons, publike praiers, and ministring of ye sacraments.
But contrariwise ye seuenth day was appointed by God vnto the ministerie euen fro~ the beginning of ye world, to signifie,
that men after the example of God ought to rest from their works, that is to say, from their daily labours belonging vnto this life, but especially from sinne, giue them selues wholly vnto the meditation and thinking vpon, and vnto the praising and setting forth of the workes of God.
and the ceremonie of resting the seauenth daie was withall made a Sacrament, that is to saie, a token of sanctification, wherby God did signifie, that he was the sanctifier of the Church, that is, to forgiue her her sinnes, to receiue her into fauour, to endue and gouerne her by the holie Ghost, to the beginning of a new and euerlasting life in this life, and afterward to be perfected and finished for and by the promised Messias.
Ye shal keep my Sabboths: because it is a signe betweene me and you in your generations, that yee may know that am the Lord, which doo sanctifie you.
And haue giuen vnto them my Sabboths, that they should be for a signe betweene me and them, that they shuld know that am the Lord which doe sanctifie them.
Forasmuch then as the Sabboth of the seauenth daie was a figure putting the people in minde both of their duetie, or of godlynesse towards God, and of the benefit of God performed towardes his people by Christ: it was with other ceremonies taken awaie by the comming of Christ, by whome that was fulfilled the
which those ceremonies did signifie, which thing also Paule doeth witnesse Colloss.
Let no man therefore condempne you for meate, or drinke, or in regard of an holie daie, or new moone, or Sabboths, the which are a shadowe of things to come, but the bodie is of Christ.
forasmuch as we eue~ our selues confesse, that the law of the ten commaundements is perpetuall or euerlasting: and that the precept touching the Sabboth is part of the ten Commaundements, therefore it is not to be abolished or taken awaie.
We answere, that the Decalogue or ten commaundements is perpetuall or euerlasting, so far as it is morall: and that the additions or circumstances of the morall commaundements for signification sake, were to be kept no longer then vntil the comming of the Messias.
Secondlie they replie, [Obiectio~ that it is written concerning the Sabboth.
It is an euerlasting couenant: it is an euerlasting signe betweene me the sonnes of Israel.
first that the ceremonial Sabboth is perpetuall vnto the comming of Christ, which was ye end of ceremonies.
Secondly, that the Sabboth is euerlasting, concerning the signification, which is a ceasing from sinne, and a rest in the Lord.
For so all the figures of the olde lawe are euerlasting, yea, the kingdome of Dauid it selfe, the which notwithstanding was to be destroied before the comming of the Messias.
The Scepter shal not be taken awaie from Iuda vntill Silo come.
My seruant Dauid shall be a Prince vnto the~ for euer.
In the same place, And the Gentiles shall know, that the Lord doe sanctifie Israel, forasmuch as my sanctuarie shal be among them for euer.
Thirdlie they saie: albeit it should bée graunted, that ye ceremonies of Moses are mutable or such as may be chaunged, yet the lawes giuen before Moses are vnchaungeable, amongest the which is also the kéeping of the seauenth daie.
We denie the Maior, as touching ceremonies: for ceremonies ordeined by God before Moses, because they were figures of benefites to be receiued in the Messias to come, are taken away by his comming, as circu~cision giuen vnto Abraham: as
That the lawes giuen by God before the fall, are not figures of benefits to be receiued in ye Messias, and that they do bind all mankinde at all times: for then as at that time the promise concerning the Messias was not yet giuen, and there was one the same condition estate of all mankind, ye which was comprehended in our first parents: but the Sabboth of the seuenth day was ordained of God, after the creation of the world was finished, before ye fall of mankinde: therefore it is vniuersall and perpetuall.
We answere by distinguishing of the Maior: the which is true concerning morall lawes, the natural knowledges wherof were imprinted in the mind of man in the creation, but is not true as touching ye ceremonie or kéeping of the seuenth day, as which after the fall in the lawe of Moses was made a figure of the benefites to be receiued in the Messias, and therefore lyke as other ceremonies, either then, or before ordeined, was made subiect vnto chaunge by the comming of the Messias.
For God woulde not haue shadowes of things to come to remain, the things the~selues being exhibited and giuen alredie.
Albeit therefore that we graunt, that the exercises of the worshippe of God on the seauenth day were to be obserued kept by the commandement of God, as wel as if men had not sinned (like as the exercise of absteining from the trée of knowledge of good and euill) as after they had sinned: yet after that God placed this ceremonie among the shadowes of the Messias to come, by this selfe same new lawe giuen by Moses, he made the same chaungeable together with the other Ceremonies.
If fifthly it be obiected: The cause of a law being perpetuall, maketh the lawe also to be perpetuall: but the cause of halowing the seuenth daye, namely the remembraunce and setting forth of the creation, and the meditating and thinking vpon the workes of God is perpetuall: Therfore the law of the seuenth day, eue~ after that Christ is come, is vnchangeable, &c.
Héere also we distinguish the Maior, namely that the law is vnchangeable in
regard of the cause or end vnchangeable, if that cause or ende doo necessarilye and perpetually require this law as an effect or meanes: but not so, if at other times, and by other means we may better come vnto that end, or if the by an other law may as well attaine vnto the same end.
Forasmuch then, as there may be a meditation and setting forth of the workes of God, as well vppon an other day, as vpon the seuenth day, as at the beginning for a cause applied vnto the first times, God ordeined the seuenth daye for ye ministerie, so afterward for a cause applied vnto the times of the Messias being come, he abrogated or toke away the same lawe, and lefte it at libertie vnto the Church to choose other dayes: Which Church for a probable and reasonable cause, chose the first day, on the which the rising againe of Christ fell, by the which a spiritual euerlasting Sabboth is begun in vs.
And that this change alteration was made by the Church in ye times of ye Apostles, it appeareth out of ye
chapter of the Acts: The first day of the weeke, the Disciples being gathered together to break bread, Paule preached.
Against the reason of those which dispute against the obseruation or keeping of the first day of the weeke, commonlye called the Sunday.
But against this kéeping also of the first day among the christians some haue disputed, saying that Paule Colos.
forbiddeth in the Church of Christ difference of dayes, and therefore that the kéeping of the first day or Sunne day is no lesse to be disallowed then the obseruing of the seuenth day.
Vnto these we must answere by the difference of the Iewish and Christian obseruation.
The kéeping of the Lorde his day doth differ fro~ the Iewish Sabboth: first, for that the Sabboth of the seuenth day, as a ceremonial part of the worship of God, might not be omitted of ye Iewes or chaunged, because of the expresse commandement of God: but the Church of Christ,
whether it appoint the first day or anie other day for the ministerie, doth it without the breach of her libertie to do otherwise, if there be iust cause, that is to
ye old Sabboth was a figure or shadow of things in the new testament to be fulfilled by Christ: but in ye new testament ye signification hath ceased, regard is onely had of order comelinesse, without the which there can be either no ministerie of the Church at all, or els not ordered wel, and as it ought to be.
this name Sabboth is first of all peculiarly attributed vnto the seauenth daye, because of God his resting fro~ the creation of the world, because of the rest of the people of God that day to bee obserued.
Secondly, it signifieth also other feasts, in which ye people were to rest as well as on the
The next day after the Sabboth the Priest shall offer a Gomer.
In the seauenth moneth, on the first daie of the same, you shal haue a Sabboth, a token of sounding with trumpets, an holy conuocation or assembly.
Also for the feast of Tabernacles: The fiftéenth day of the fifth moneth ye shall kéepe a feast vnto the Lorde, seuen dayes:
on the first daie shall be a Sabboth, and on the eight daie also shall be a Sabboth.
In this sense and signification the name Sabboth agréeth also vnto the daies, in which in the new Testament the Church doth exercise the publike worship of God.
Thirdlie, by a figure called Synechdoche, they also call a weeke of daies a Sabboth, as Leuit.
From the daie in which ye offer a Gomer of lifting vp, there shall be seuen full weekes, Math.
On the last Sabboth, when as it dawned into the first daie of the Sabboths, that is to saie, of the wéeke.
Verie earlie the first daie of the Sabboths, that is, of the wéeke, they came vnto the Sepulchre.
And from hence, by a figure called Cathacresis, it is take~ also for a wéeke of yeares.
Thou shalt number vnto thee seauen Sabboths of yeares, that is to saie, times seuen yeares, the which daies of seuen Sabbothes of yeares will make yeares.
Fourthlie, it is taken for euerie seuenth yeare, in which the people of the Iewes was commaunded to leaue off the tilling of their ground.
When as yee shall enter into the land, the which giue vnto you, then the land shall keepe a Sabboth
Sixe yeares thou shalt sowe thy ground, &c. but in the seauenth yeare there shall be a Sabboth of rest vnto the land, a Sabboth vnto the Lorde: thou shalt not sowe thy field, nor cut thy vineyard.
Then the land shall finish her Sabbothes, all the daies in which she hath bene desolate and wast, because she rested not in your Sabboths, whilest ye dwelled in her.
Fifthlie, by this word Sabboth is vnderstoode spirituall rest, that is to say,
ceasing from sinne, or the leauing off of our owne workes, and the execution or dooing of the workes of God, that is, of such as are by him commaunded vnto vs, and doo appertaine vnto his worship and glorie.
This spirituall Sabboth is begun in this life in them that are conuerted, and is finished in the life euerlasting: and is termed a Sabboth or rest, both because this is indeede a true rest from labours and miseries, and our hallowing and dedicating vnto the worshippe of God, and also because yt in times past it was signified by the ceremonial Sabboth.
There is therfore lefte some rest vnto the people of GOD.
his rest, rested also himself from his works, as God rested from his.
Let vs studie therfore to enter into that rest, &c. Ies.
And it shall come to passe, that from moneth to moneth, and from Sabboth vnto Sabboth all flesh shall come, worship before me, sayth the Lord.
Out of these significations of the word, the first and the second haue place in this co~mandement as co~cerning the wordes, the fifth by an allegorie: This also doth the manner of the figures shew, in the ordeining of the which God will alwayes haue their signification to bée vnderstoode and obserued.
If thou tourne awaie thy foote from the Sabboth, that thou doe not thine owne will on mine holie daie, and call the Sabboth thy delight, that it be holie, honourable vnto the Lord, and shalt honour it, that thou doo not thine owne wayes, that thine own will be not found and that thou finde not a word.
And therefore with a vehemencie he saith, as of a thing most straightlie commaunded: Remember that thou keepe holie the Sabboth daie, that is, that with greate care and religion thou hallowe it.
commaundeth him to be put to death, which shall breake the Sabboth.
When as he complaineth of the corruption of the whole worshippe of God: he sayth that the Sabboth is broken: of which straightnesse in requiring of the kéeping of the Sabboth, there are euidentlie apparant two causes especiallie: The one, for that the neglecting of the ministerie of the Church doeth verie easilie corrupt and blot out the doctrine and worshippe of GOD: The other, for that by the straight requiring of the figuratiue Sabboth, GOD woulde declare the greatnesse and necessitie of the thing signified, to wit, of the spirituall Sabboth.
The same may bée vnderstoode by the ende of the ceremoniall and morall commandement touching the Sabboth.
For GOD will haue the externall or outwarde Sabboth to serue vnto the beginning and finishing in vs of the spirituall Sabboth.
Hée will not therefore haue that obserued and kepte without this.
Finallie, héereby this same is manifest, in that he commaundeth the Sabboth to bée hallowed, that is, not to bée spent in lasie
idlenes, but to haue sinne to be auoyded, and holy workes to be done therein.
For God is sayd to halow the Sabboth, because he appoynteth it vnto the worship of God: men also are commanded to halow it, that is to say, to apply it vnto that ende wherevnto it is ordeined by God, or to doo those things the which God hath co~manded in the same to be done.
Héerevnto apperteyneth that he saith that it is a Sabboth vnto the Lord, that is, dedicated vnto his worship.
And therefore appointing sixe dayes for other labours, and the seuenth vnto the worship of God, his meaning is not that the other dayes the worship of God, and thinking vppon the workes of God should be omitted or lefte off.
Thou shalt rehearse them vnto thy sonnes, and shalt speake of them, whe~ as thou shalt sit in thine house, and when as thou shalt walke by the way, and when as thou shalt lye in thy bed, and when thou shalt arise.
But he requireth these two things, the first, that on the Sabboth daye, not
but also the publike worship of God be exercised in the Church: the other, that at that time other labours, which on other daies euerie man doth exercise according vnto his vocation calling, should giue place as well vnto the priuate, as publike worship of God.
the which also Christ in the Gospell doth often confute, namelie, that it was vnlawfull on the Sabboth daye to doe anie workes appertaining vnto the necessitie of their owne lyfe, or the life of others, for it appeareth by the end of the commaundement, that onelie seruile workes, or such as hinder the exercise of the ministerie, are forbidden by God, and not such as doe not hinder the publike worshippe of God, or else doe further, nourish and set forth the same.
Christ defendeth his Disciples plucking the of corne on the Sabboth daie to driue awaie hunger, healeth him that had a withered hand.
sayth, That without anie sinne on the Sabboth daie cattell or beastes falling into a ditch, are thence drawen out, and Luke
And Iudas Machabeus fought on the Sabboth, that there might be some to kéepe the Sabboth.
And of this and such like acts two reasons are giuen.
If we so do, as our brethren haue done, that wee fight not against the Gentiles for our life religion, they will now on a sodaine driue vs out of the land.
Therefore they appointed within the~selues within with these words: what me~ so euer shall by battaile set vpon vs on the Sabboth daie, we wil fight with them, least we all die, as our brethren are dead.
For the defence of their life and religion, they saie well, that they may sight euen on the Sabboth daie.
With the same reasons Christ defendeth himselfe and his Disciples.
Chapter of Oseas: But if yee had knowen, what this is, will haue mercie
and not sacrifice, yee woulde not haue condemned the innocents and guiltlesse.
The Sabboth was made for man, and not man for the Sabboth, that is, the ceremoniall workes ought to giue place vnto the morall, that rather the ceremonies bée omitted, then the workes of loue, the which either our owne necessitie, or of our neighbour doth require.
Haue yee not read in the lawe, that on the Sabboth the Priestes in the Temple prophane the Sabboth, and are without faulte? And saie vnto you, that one greater then the Temple is heere.
If a man receiue circumcision on the Sabboth, and yet the lawe of Moses is not broken, are yee offended with mee, that haue cured an whole man on the Sabboth? In which wordes hee teacheth that such workes, as hinder not the exercise of the Sabboth, but rather set foorth and confirme the same, such as are workes pertaining vnto the worship God, or vnto holie ceremonies, or vnto loue of our neighbour, in such sorte,
that necessitie will not suffer them to bée put off vntill another time, doe not break the Sabboth, but are especiallie required to the right obseruation and kéeping of the same.
He will haue our families also and our children to cease from labours, for two causes: first and principallie, that these also by their parents and masters maye bee brought vp and instructed in the worship of God, and to be admitted accustomed vnto the exercise of the ministerie of the church: for he wil haue these also reckoned among the members of his Church, and doth exhort them by the example of his rest vnto the of the Sabboth Secondlie, because he wil haue loue and bountifulnesse towardes our neighbours, to bée exercised and seene in his Church, in our whole life, and also especiallie on the Sabboth.
Therefore hee reciteth this cause also of the outward rest, or sabboth, albeit it be accidentall and a second came, rest from labours might be vnto seruant and our familie, by calling to remembraunce the bondage in hée the Iew to vse rtesie toward
their seruants, the which they in bondage wished to be shewed vnto themselues.
That thy and thy may rest as well as thou: remember that thou wast a seruaunt in the land of Aegypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee thence by a strong ha~d, and a stretched out arme.
Therefore the Lord thy God hath commaunded thee to keepe the Sabboth daie.
such as were conuerted vnto true religion, like as Israelites and of the householde of the Church: and such as were still Infidels he also co~maundeth to cease from labour, not in regard of themselues, but in respect of the Israelites, and that for two causes: first, least by their example they should giue offence vnto the Church: secondlie, least their libertie might bee an occasion vnto the Iewes by them to doe workes on the Sabboth, which by themselues it was not lawfull for them to doe, and so iniurie should bée done vnto the lawe of GOD,
the which forbiddeth, not onelie by our selues, but also by others to do such works and businesse on the Sabboth as call
men awaie from the worshippe of God, and studying vpon the workes and will of God.
And héere out appeareth an answere vnto thrée questions or obiections.
Whether other nations also were bound vnto the Iewish ceremonies, if they dwelled amongst the Iewes?
Whether straungers from the Church, may or ought to bee compelled vnto religion?
And, whether the Sacraments, amongst the which also the Sabboth was, ought to be common vnto the Infidels with the Church?
For as concerning binding and constraint, the straungers which dwelled among the Iewes were not constrayned either vnto al ceremonies, or religion, but vnto the outward discipline, the which was necessarie for the auoiding of offences of the Church, in which they liued: for the magistrate ought to be the kéeper of discipline, according vnto both tables of ye Decalogue, or ten co~mandements, amo~gst his subiects, both to forbid manifest idolatrie and blasphemies: and also concerning
forrainers strangers, so far as he may, to take héed yt open offences be not giue~ vnto his subiectes.
Furthermore, as touching binding ther was an especial consideratio~ of the Sabboth, ye which was not at length by Moses, but euen from the beginning of the world, commaunded vnto all men by God, and therfore bound all men vnto the comming of the Messias, albeit that this commandement was so farre growen out of vse among them, that it was reckoned among the chiefe reproches, wherewithall they mocked and taunted the Iewes.
But this ceremonie was no Sacrament vnto the Infidels, because that neither this promise appertained vnto them, that ye Lord would be the sanctifier of them, neither were they constrained to cease from their ordinarie workes for the testifying or professing of this promise, but onelie to auoid offence and occasion of sinning, which by them might bee giuen vnto the people of GOD: for so Nehem.
The people promise by oath, that on the Sabboth and holie daies, they woulde not receiue anie thing of the people of the lande, the which brought merchaundise or victuall to sell on the Sabboth daie.
Nehemias by shutting the gates and garrison of souldiours, kéepeth the Tyrians dwelling at Ierusalem, and bringing in wares to be solde on ye Sabboth, from comming that day into the Citie, least occasion might be giuen vnto the Iewes to breake the Sabboth.
These things are better vnderstood by this, that the Cattell also are commanded to rest, whose rest had no signification eyther of the worship of God or any sacrament, but was commanded in regarde of the men, first that occasion of working might be cut off from them, the labour or vse of their cattell being forbidden: and secondly, that sparing their brute beasts, they might learn, how great a regard god would haue of gentlenesse and equitie to be vsed towards men: the which cause also Paule alledgeth of the commandeme~t of not the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne.
Cor. Hath the Lord a care of Oxen? or doth he not altogether say this for vs? For, for vs is this written, that he which ploweth ought to plow in hope: and he that treadeth out the corne in hope, ought to be partaker of his hope, &c.
taken from God his resting, apperteineth vnto the circumstance or ceremoniall precept concerning the seuenth day: God rested on that day: that is to say, he ceased to make new parts of the world, as which was alreadie perfected and finished, and such as God would haue it for to be.
This daye therefore he dedicated or appoynted vnto the worship of God: first,
that by the example of his rest, as by a most effectuall and strong argument, he might exhort men vnto the following of him, in leauing off of the ordinarie works of the
dayes, as God on the seuenth daye rested from the workes of the sixe dayes, that is from the creating of newe partes of the world.
Secondly, that this rest of the seuenth day might be a monument and token of the perfecting and ishing of the creation by God, and of the continuing on that day of the perpetual preseruation and gouerning of his workes, vnto his glorie benefit of his elect and chosen, and therefore might be a spur vnto the consideration and setting forth of these works and benefites towardes mankinde, for whose
sake all other things are made and preserued by God, that out of the same mankinde, made and formed after his owne image, he might gather and preserue a Church vnto himselfe, the which in this life and for euer might praise him.
Now the imitation and following of his rest, vnto the which by his owne example he doth exhort vs, is of two sorts: ceremoniall, and signifying: and morall or spirituall, or signified.
For the workes, the which are called the workes of men, are of two sorts: for some are by God commanded vnto euerie particular person, but yet hindering the publike worship of God, if they be co~tinued without intermission or ceasing, namelye the workes of euerie man his proper vocation and calling, the ministerie of ye church, and such things as appertaine vnto the exercise and preseruation of the same excepted.
Some are forbidde~ by God, namely sinnes, the which are in such sort ye proper workes of the diuell and of men, that in this respect that they are sinnes, they can in no wise be referred vnto God.
Both these kindes of workes of men are forbidden, but in a difference of
The first is, workes are forbidden in a certaine respect,
namely so farre foorth as they hinder the ministerie of the church, or giue offence: but sinnes are forbidden simply.
The second, for that workes are onely forbidden on the Sabboth daye: but sinnes are commanded to be lefte at all times.
The thirde, for that the ceasing from workes, is a figure, but the ceasing from sinnes is the thing signified by the figure, and therefore ordeined by the appoynting of this figure, according vnto the exposition of the figure set down Heb.
He that is entered into his rest, rested also himselfe from his workes, as God did from his.
that it establisheth the publike worship of god, or ministery of the church, and the exercise and honour of the same.
For this is ye halowing, or holy of vse the Sabboth, that is to saye, of the time appoynted vnto the ministerie, when as on that day, holy workes, the which God
hath commanded at that time to be done, are exercised.
Now the partes of this halowing, or the workes of the Sabboth, the which on the Sabboth ought to bee done partly by the Ministers and partly by the Church, are these especially.
Truly to teach the Church concerning God, and his will.
For in this place is spoken of the dutie of the Ministers of the Church, vnto whom it appertaineth not onely in the publike assemblyes of the Church, faithfully to deliuer teach true doctrine, but as necessitie occasion shall be offered, to instruct and admonish euen particular persons, and to employ themselues vnto the amendment and saluation of all them that are committed to their charge.
Concerning doctrine in the meetings of the Church there is spoken Exod.
The first and seuenth day of Easter, there shall be vnto you an holy conuocation or assembling together.
That ye teach the children of Israel all the Statutes which the Lord hath spoke~ vnto the~, by the hand of Moses.
They fulfilled the wordes of the Prophets, the which are read euery Sabboth.
which preach him, when as hee is read in the Sinagogues euerie Sabboth.
And Paule, as his custome was, went in vnto them, and three Sabboth daies disputed with them, out of the scripture, &c.
As touching ye office of ministers in priuate instruction and admonition, we read.
He reasoned in the Sinagogue with the Iewes, and religious persons, in the market daily with all that he met.
Take heed therefore vnto your selues, and vnto the whole flocke in the which the holye Ghost hath made you ouerseers to feede the church of God, &c. Againe: Watch therfore, remembring, that I, by the space of three yeares ceased not day and night with teares to admonish euerie one.
Preach the word, bee earnest in season, out of season: rebuke, reprooue, exhort with all mildenesse and doctrine.
But watch thou in all thinges, suffer, do the worke of an Euangelist,
To minister the Sacramentes according vnto the ordinance of God.
And as doctrine, so also the administration of the Sacraments is not tied vnto those daies, in which the méetings of the Church are
made, but it is sufficient concerning the publike ministration, if it be done by the ministers of the church, as those which do represent a publike person, and roome of God in ye ministerie speaking vnto men, and that those things be done in the assemblyes of the Church, the which God hath tied vnto the ministers.
So circumcision was ministred at anye daye which was the eight day after the birth of the childe: so baptisme may be ministred on any day.
Yet the ministring of the Sacrament ought especially to bee vsed on the Sabboth daye.
besides the daily sacrifices, there are also set forth certaine sacrifices which ought to be vsed on the Sabboth, and other holy dayes And Christ in such sort ordained his supper, as ye which among other endes, ought also to be the sinowe of the Congregation of the church, that it might be ministred either in a small or great assembly of the Church.
The bread which wee breake, is it not the communion of the bodie of Christ? Because we being manie are one bread, one
Therefore when yee come together into one place, this is not to eate the Lords supper.
In the same place, Therfore (my brethere~) when ye come together to eate, tarrie one for another.
And vnto the lawfull administration of the Sacraments appertaineth also the shutting out of those,
whome God hath commanded to be shut out from them.
Like as it was not lawfull for strangers from the nation and religion of ye Iewes, nor for the vncircumcised to eate the Paschall Lambe.
so the Church of God ought not to admit or receiue vnto the Supper of the Lorde, such as are not baptized, or such as being baptized, yet in doctrine or manners are strangers from Christianitie.
that is, to come often vnto the assemblies of the Church, to heare and learne the heauenly doctrine, and diligentlye to meditate and examine the doctrine being heard, and especiallye to bestowe the dayes appoynted for the ministerie, in
reading, studying, and handling of diuine matters: for inasmuch as God will haue ministers of the Church to be, he will also that there bée hearers of the doctrine, and the same also diligent.
And the desire to learne is not without priuate meditation.
for that they receiued the worde with all ioyfulnesse, dailie searching the Scriptures, whether the thinges were so or no: and especiall to such as serue alreadie, or meane in time to come to serue the Church a diligent studie to know the doctrine is inioyned.
Take heede vnto reading, exhortatio~, doctrine: foreslow not the gifte which is in thee, the which was giuen to prophesie, with the laying on of the hands of the oldership.
Exercise these things: in these be thou, that thy profiting be manifest vnto all.
Take heed vnto thy selfe, and vnto doctrine: in these continue.
For if thou doe this, thou shalt saue thy and those that thee.
will haue a of the Church to bee fit to teach, and to confute and ouerthrow aduersaries
So God commanded the Passeouer to be kept in the assembly of the people, and appoynted certaine sacrifices vnto other feast dayes and Sabboths.
The first day of the weeke, when as the Disciples were come together to breake bread, Paul preached, &c.
For as God will haue true doctrine to be heard, so he will also haue the lawfull vse of the sacraments to be séene in the publike assemblyes of the Church: because that he will haue both these to be a note, whereby the Church may be knowen and discerned from other nations sectes.
The sacraments also, like as the word, are an instrument, or exercise to stirre vp and maintaine faith and godlynesse in vs.
They are also a publike profession of our faith and thankfulnesse vnto God, and a part of the publike worship of God in the church.
And therfore the vse of the~ is most especialy agreeable vnto the Sabboth.
Publike calling vpon God, wherby we do ioyne our confession,
For God wil be called vpon not onely priuately of euerye man, but also publikely by the
Church, for his glorie, and our comfort, to wit, that we should not doubt, that we are heard of God, when as he hath promised hearing not onely vnto vs, but also vnto others, and vnto ye whole church, praying for vs together with vs.
For to this ende he hath added a peculiar promise vnto common praiers, Matth.
Againe say vnto you, if two of you shal agree together vpon earth, whatsoeuer they shall aske, it shall be graunted vnto them of my father which is in heaue~.
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am in the middest of them.
And and the praysing of God, is promised vnto God as an especiall worship.
Of thee shall bee my praise in a Congregation of much people, will pay my vowes before them that feare him.
Forasmuch as if thou blesse in spirit, he which occupieth the roome of an vnlearned person, how shall he say Amen vnto thy For he knoweth not what thou saiest.
exhort therefore before all things, that there be made supplications, prayers, requests,
for all men, for Kings, and for al that are set in authoritie, that we may lead a quiet a peaceable life in all godlinesse and chastitie, &c.
but boasting hypocrisie, saying: When thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and shutting thy doore pray vnto thy Father which is in secret, and thy father which seeth thee in secret, shal reward thee openly.
The wordes going before do witnesse this: When thou prayest, be not as the hypocrites.
For they loue to pray standing in their assemblies and corners of the streetes, that they maye be seene of men.
And hypocrisie is a counterfaiting boasting and vaine shewing of godlynesse Taring therefore this,
he speaketh not of the desire to please god, and of praysing him as well publikely as priuately, but he will haue those also which praye publikely, to haue regarde not vnto the iudgement and eyes of men but of God concerning vs, and not to looke vnto our glorie, but vnto the glorie of God.
The honour of the ministerie of the Church, which containeth many things: first, reuerence, that is an acknowledging of the order and wil of God in ye appointing and preseruation of the ministerie, and the gathering together of the church by the same,
and the declaration shewing forth of this our iudgement of the ministerie both in wordes and déedes.
Let a man so esteeme of vs as of the Ministers of Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God.
Therefore we are Embassadours in the name of Christ, as if God you by vs: wee praye you in the name of Christ, that ye be reconciled vnto God.
Secondly, Loue, by the which we willingly both resort vnto the assemblies of the church, and do heare and learne the doctrine of the church, and do wish well vnto the faithful ministers of the church, not onely in respect of the dutie of loue, but also in regard of ye ministerie which they execute.
My soule longeth, yea, and fainteth for the Courtes of the Lord, my heart my flesh reioyce in the liuing God.
reioyced with them that sayd vnto me, we will goe into the house of the Lord.
Also, For my bretheren sake will now speake peace of thee, because of the house of the Lord our God, will seek thy good.
Hethertoo appertaine the workes of loue towardes God, and towards our neighbor, that is, the whole life of a Christian, which is the spirituall Sabboth For it is nothing els to kéepe a spirituall Sabboth,
then in the ordering of our life to obey the voyce of God sounding by the ministerie of the Church.
For God will haue the doctrine learned to this ende, that it may be obeyed.
Performe ye the word in deed, and be not hearers onely, deceiuing your selues: because if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be compared vnto a man beholding the countenance of his birth in a glasse, for hee hath behelde himselfe, and went his waye, and by and by forgetteth what manner one he was.
Sabboth to be kepte all our life time, hée will haue the examples and testimonies of the same especially to be shewed forth on the outward or ceremoniall Sabboth day, that is, at those times which are appoynted for the teaching and learning of the word of God.
For if a man al ye time doo not shewe foorth a desire to obey God, when as the doctrine ringeth in his eares, and when as other cares being laid aside, God will haue vs to thinke vpon godlynesse and repentance, he sufficiently declareth that he will not doo it at another time.
There it hath alwayes bene the manner in the Church, on the Sabboth day to giue almes, to exercise ye workes of loue towardes the néedie.
Send parts vnto him for whom nothing is prepared, because it is an holy daye vnto our Lord.
that he will haue the Sabboth kept, that rest maye be giuen to seruaunts and to our familie: least that with the continuaunce of laboures they should be too much brought downe.
the gathering for the Saintes, as haue appoynted vnto the Churches of Galatia, so doo yee also.
Euerie first daye of the weeke, let euerie one of you laye a side with himselfe, laying vp that, which thorough the gentlenesse of GOD he maye.
all these works of the Sabboth are ioyntly expressed together: The Disciples were abiding in the doctrine of the Apostles, and in fellowshippe, and breaking of bread, and prayers.
honour comprehendeth also Thankfulnesse, that is, duties concerning the preseruation of the Ministerie and Ministers.
For if GOD will haue a Ministerie to be in the Church, hée will also that euerye one, according to their abilitie, doo further the maintenaunce of the same, that is, that they bestowe theyr money and trauayle vpon the nourishing and defending of godly Ministers and teachers.
Hethertoo appertaine the lawes of Moses, concerning the first borne, first fruits, tenthes, and very many offerings, the
which were appointed vnto the Priestes Leuites in steade of a stipend, wherewithall to maintaine the life of them and theirs, that they might attend vppon the ministerie.
Albeit the circumstaunces of these lawes be abolished taken awaie, yet the generall remaineth for euer, because God will haue the ministerie preserued euen vntill the end of the worlde.
Take heed vnto thy selfe that thou forsake not the Leuite all thy daies vppon thy land.
Who goeth on warfare at anie time vpon his owne charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flocke? Doth not the lawe also saie these things? For it is written in the lawe of Moses, Thou shalt not musle the mouth of the Oxe, that treadeth out the corne.
Also, If we haue sowen vnto you spirituall things, is it a great matter, if we reap your fleshlie things? Again, Are ye ignorant, that they which serue about holie thinges, doe eate of the thinges which are of the altar? And they that serue at the altar, doe take parte of the altar? So the Lord hath ordeined, that they which preach the Gospell, should liue of the Gospell.
The elders which doe rule well, let them be counted worthie of double honour, especiallie those that do labour in the word and in doctrine.
For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not musle vp the mouth of the Oxe, that treadeth out the corne.
He that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receiue the reward of a Prophet.
Héerevnto also pertaineth the examples of the widowe of Sarepta, nourishing the Prophet Elias.
Of the Church of Damascus, letting downe Paule by the wall Acts.
In this part of the honour towardes the ministerie is also conteined the maintenaunce of schooles:
inasmuch as without the studies of learning and arts men are neither fit to teach, neither can the puritie of doctrine be preserued and defended against Heretikes.
promiseth a reward vnto those, the which for the furtherance and imparting of doctrine do well vnto those which doe either alreadie teach, or which are in time to come to teach, or whose trauaile
doth serue, or shall héereafter serue for the preseruation of doctrine.
Fiftlie and lastlie, vnto this honour of the ministerie is also required vprightnes or gentlenesse in bearing with the infirmities of the ministers, the which doe not notoriouslie or manifestlie corrupt or forslow their office, hurt the Church with offence.
Receiue not an accusation against an Elder, but vnder two or three witnesses.
Forasmuch then as this is the sanctifiing or hallowing of the Sabboth, it followeth that the thinges wherewith the Sabboth is prophaned or broken, are contrarie vnto these workes.
Against the teaching of doctrine is set the leauing or forslowing of the duetie of teaching,
All her are dumbe dogges, which are not able to barke, sleeping, taking their ease, verie diligent to sleepe.
And they are rauenous dogges, which knowe not when they are full, and the Shepheardes themselues vnderstande nothing, they haue all gone aside after their owne waie, euerie one vnto his couetousnesse in his place.
the Shepheardes that haue fedde themselues: Doe not shepheardes feede their flocke? Yee haue eaten the fat, and doo cloath your selues with the wooll: ye haue killed the fat, but haue not fed the sheepe: the weake haue ye not comforted, and the sicke haue yee not healed, and the broken haue ye not bound vp, that that was cast downe yee haue not brought againe, that which was lost ye haue not sought, but ye haue reigned ouer them cruellie and tyrannouslie.
Also corrupting and mangling of doctrine, or bowing of the same vnto the opinions, affections, desires, or profite of the ministers, or magistrates, or others.
For wee doe not, as manie, make merchaundise of the woorde of GOD, but wee speake of Christ, as of sinceritie, as of GOD, in the sight of God.
Against the administration of the Sacramentes is either the leauing or foreslowing of the exhortation of the Church to vse the Sacramentes,
or an vnlawfull admistration, when as some thing is either taken from the ceremonies ordeined
by God, or when some thing is changed in them, or when as such are shut out fro~ the Sacraments, as ought to be receiued, or such receiued which by the ordinance of God ought to be kept fro~ them, or when as the people are not instructed concerning the right vse of them.
Against the desire to learne doctrine, is the contempt neglecting of doctrine, that is, either not to be present at holie Sermons, when there is no lawfull cause to let vs, and on the Sabboth to doe workes that might be put off vntill another time, or to giue no eares vnto holie Sermons, or not to meditate and search the doctrine of the Church, but especiallie negligence to knowe the doctrine in the ministers, or in those, which by God are called vnto the studie of doctrine, and either ought one daie to serue vnto the setting forth of doctrine, or haue greater occasion and opportunitie to learne the same, then others.
He that gathered sticks on the Sabboth daie, is stoned to death.
Paine of death is set down against them that on the Sabboth doe works hindering the ministerie.
As often as a man heareth the word of that kingdome, and vnderstandeth it not, then commeth that wicked one, and taketh awaie that which was sowen in his heart.
This is he which receiueth the séede by the way side, &c. Math.
Let them alone, they are blinde, guides of the blinde: if the blinde leade the blinde, they both fall into the ditch.
Vnto whome so euer much hath bene giuen, much shall be required of him againe, and with whom they haue laid downe much, the more they will aske againe at his hands.
Also curiositie, the which is a desire to know or to heare things not reuealed by God, not necessarie, or new things Pro. As to eate much honie, is not good: so the out of the glorie of the diuine things is no glorie.
Search not vnconsideratlie after thinges that are more hard then thou art able to attaine vnto: and concerning things that are aboue thy power, foolishlie seeke not after them.
The thinges that are commaunded thee of God, the same studie thou holilie vpon.
For it is not needfull for thee, to beholde with thine eyes the thinges that are
secret: the things that are not necessarie, but superfluous vnto thy talke, meddle not curiouslie with them.
For mo thinges are opened vnto thee, then the wit of man is able to comprehend.
Giue no eare vnto fables, and endlesse genealogies, the which doe rather breed questions, then edifying of God, which is by faith.
Reiect or cast awaie foolish and vnlearned questions, knowing that they doe breede strifes.
Refrain foolish questions and genealogies, and and strifes about the lawe: for they are vnprofitable and vaine.
There will be a time when as they shal not abide sound doctrine, but itching in their eares, they according vnto their owne lustes, shall heape vp vnto themselues teachers, and shall turne awaie their eares from the truth, and bee turned vnto fables.
Vnto the lawfull vse and receiuing of the Sacraments is repugna~t the leauing off and contempt of the same.
Also ye prophaning of them, when as they are vsed and receiued, not after that sorte which
God hath commaunded, or not of those, for whome they were ordained.
Also superstitious receiuing, when as saluation and the grace of GOD are tied vnto the obseruation of the ceremonies, or else are vsed vnto other endes wherevnto they are not ordained by GOD. Gen.
Hee that is vncircumcised shall be rooted out from among his people.
GOD threatneth death vnto Moses because of his sonne which was not circumcised.
Priests, which contemne my name, and haue sayd, Wherein haue wee contemned thy name? Which doe offer vppon mine altar, polluted bread, and yee haue sayd, wherein haue wee polluted the same? &c. Ese.
Hee that sacrificeth an Oxe, dooth sinne as much as hee that slayeth a man, &c.
Hee that eateth and drinketh vnworthilie, eateth and drinketh vnto himselfe damnation.
the neglecting of them, and the hypocriticall béeing present at them without
Also the rehearsing of them not seruing vnto the edifying of the Church.
If thou blesse in spirite, he, which occupieth the roome of an ignorant person, how shall hee say Amen vnto thy giuing of thankes? For he knoweth not what thou saist.
For thou giuest thankes well, but another is not edified.
In like manner also is against the vse and exercise of the whole ministerie, not onely the particular leauing of duetie in euerie priuate person, but by his example, or any manner of hinderance, by his commaundement or perswasion, the calling away of his children, familie, or others, from the vse and exercise of the same.
Vnto the honour of the Ministerie, the contempt and despising of the same is co~trarie, whereby either the ministerie of of the Church is abolished and taken away, or is committed vnto vnworthye persons, or is denied to be ye instrument ye which God will vse for the gathering together of his Church: or when as the ministers are reproched.
Ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake.
Or when as doctrine is not obeyed in the leading of our life: but especially when as on the Sabboth daye, the workes of loue godlinesse are neglected, and the time imployed vnto vaine and wicked things, or spent in lewdnesse: or when as necessarie maintenance is not giuen vnto the Ministers, defence and other dueties of thankefulnesse and courtesie are not performed vnto them: that saye nothing, when as the Ministers are wronged and hurte: when as the maintenance of schooles and learning is not cared for: or els when as the infirmities and wants in the ministers that may be borne withall, are bitterly taunted, or when as because of them the ministerie is despised or neglected.
THus saith the Lord: Take heede vnto your selues: and carrie no burthens on the Sabboth day, or bring them in into the gates of Ierusalem.
Neither carrie out burthens out of your houses on the Sabboth daie, nor do ye anie worke: but sanctifie and keepe holie the Sabboth daie, as commanded your elders.
Who hearkned not, nor bowed their eare: but hardned their necke, not hearkening nor receiuing instruction.
For it shall come to passe, that if by obeying ye will obey me, the saying of the Lord, in not bringing in burthens into the gates of the Citie on the Sabboth day: and in sanctifying and hallowing of the Sabboth daie, that ye doe no work therin.
That kings and Princes shall enter into the gates of this Citie, sitting vpon the throne of Dauid, and riding on chariots and horses, they and their Princes, and the men of Iuda, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and this citie shall remaine for euer.
And they shall come out of the cities of Iuda, and from places about Ierusalem, and also out of the land of Beniamin, both out of a low place, out of the mountaine, and from the South part, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifice, and gifts with franckinsence, and bringing offeringes of vnto the house of the Lord.
to sanctifie the Sabboth daie, and not carrye burthens entering into the gates of Ierusale~ on the Sabboth daie: certainlie will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, which shall consume the pallaces of Ierusalem, and shal not be quenched.

a true copy of sir henry hides speech on the scaffold immediately before his execution before the exchange on the of march
taken in from his mouth by john hinde
london printed by peter cole at the sign of the in cornhil by the exchange
mdcl

reader take notice this speech following is published in those very words that the gentleman delivered them and though there be some abrupt breakings off and other expressions not so smooth as might have been yet could not with honesty alter a word and therefore have tyed my self to his own expressions that may neither abuse the world or the dying man or my self
the gentleman came in a coach to the scaffold attended by the lieutenant of the tower and the sheriffs of london and also in his company one of his servants and doctor hide

sir henry hide
am now come to put in practice the christian profession and as owe a death to nature and sin now pay it upon the score of grace

dr hide
blessed be god that hath enabled you to it god hath and will enable you

sir hide
looking round on the people he said a populous city god bless it and grant they may live to his grace
then turning to his man he said john pray now though have not been a good master to you be you a good servant and accompany me with your prayers and help me both in body and minde
john have you my things about you john then staying for his servants they being not on the scaffold he said had rather have my servants then strangers
then the lieutenant of the tower coming to him he said pray sir rejoyce with me thank almighty god am brought hither to suffer for him

lieut of the tower
am glad you are so comforted gods will be fulfilled in all things

sir hide
if god call me to him and glorifie him it is well seek onely the company of your christian prayers

of the tower
shall not be wanting in that god willing

then the chyrurgion coming but not his kinsman who was called for he said my kinsman is of no use you may be useful about my body
hope mr sheriff that you'll give order may have a little more room here

sheriff
yes yes sir

sir hide
and likewise for liberty of speech and that it shall please you for am not acquainted with the forms here of england that may speak my one sense am now going into the presence of almighty god a very little without any disturbance

sheriff
why sir you shall

sir hide
john where is my coffin

john
it is here sir

sheriff
sir it seems these men cannot be found

sir hide
but if mr barret could be found
after some stay mr barret being not found the sheriff spake to him saying

sheriff
you have your liberty you know your time

sir hide
where is the place of standing that way or this way pointing towards the exchange and the poultrey

sheriff
which way you please you may stand which way you will but that way you must lie pointing towards the exchange

sir hide
am indifferent it is not the way to heaven where a man stands
one brought word to him that there was no help to be had

sir hide
that is no hindrance to my felicity

dr hide
god enable you that you may finde that joy and comfort which is due to the glory of his holy name he will not forsake you that have put your trust in him

sir hide
will open my heart and my mouth with thanksgiving if this gentleman please to give way
then turning towards the poultrey he put of his hat and said glory be to god on high on earth peace to men

christian people come hither to die am brought hither to die and that may die humbly beseech the assistance of your christian prayers that by the benefit of them my passage may be the more easie yet because men in that condition which it hath pleased god to reduce me carry more credit to their speeches in the discharge of my duty towards god shall use a few words and so dispatch

pray all of you joyn with me to praise this almighty god to whom desire to render all hearty thanks as for all his mercies so in particular for this that he hath brought me hither that whereas owe a duty to sin and to nature that now can pay the account a debt to nature can pay it upon the account of grace
and because it is fit to render an account of that hope that is in me shall tell you to the praise of almighty god that have been born and bred up in the doctrine of the church of england have no negative religion beleeving to be saved by the onely merits of my saviour jesus christ putting off his hat and whatsoever else is profest in the doctrine and discipline of the church of england authorized by law humbly beseeching almighty god to restore unto this church her peace prosperity and patrimony whereof have been an obedient and a loving however an unworthy son and now both my hope being confident and my faith perfected there remains onely christian charity charity we carry into heaven charity on earth and that leave beseeching all whomsoever have offended whether have or no to forgive me as from the

bottom of my heart do them whomsoever blessing almighty god for the happy advantage he takes to bring me nearer to heaven blessing almighty god that he hath given me this advantage as he hath been merciful to me before the foundation of the world in my saviour so that now he hath in mercy honored me with a suffering for his name in obedience to his commandment

on this day was summoned before that justice which condemned me on friday last praised be almighty god that by this way he hath brought me the nearer to himself putting off his hat my charge presume is publike as my punishment is visible if there have been any thing in the management of my part being unskilful having discontinued my own countrey many years shall beseech the christian charity of all you my beloved countreymen to impute it unto the right part the ignorance that is in this skilful way of managing it was objected unto me there that had a vanity of delighting to speak in strange tongues
was best skill'd in the italian but free from that vanity thank almighty god and therefore would in defence of my life if it had been the custom here or the judges favor have used that language

it was objected that did not so freely as a cavalier own my master was told since came into england for other skill have not in your laws that a legal denial in law might be tolerable hope did not exceed the bounds of that in anything for god forbid that should be ashamed of serving so good so pious so just a master putting off his hat for that therein rejoyce and humbly beseech

almighty god to fill my heart and my tongue and all that hear me this day with thankfulness for it

as to the business that another construction had been made and believed here then what was there the righteous god knoweth it if any weakness is in the management those were mine was sent to serve and protect not to injure any and as god acquits me of the intention in matter of fact as having done any maner of evil that way however here understood blessed be his holy name putting off his hat so those gentlemen of the turky company if they would but seriously consider for they know it very well the impossibility of my doing them any maner of harm
whereas that of the embassie objected against me that my master never honored me withal was never worthy of it was his messenger an internuncio for the conservation onely of his good subjects of all the merchants untill such time as he could confirm that gentleman now resident or to send any other and they themselves know that there was impossibility in me as bless god there was an innocency in me unto any such intention to do them any harm for my masters commands were the contrary was onely sent for their good as never owned the title so the very letters themselves speaking no other never did so much as think of any maner of address unto the grand seignior but gave him the letter from my master the rest of the english nation that were there present may when they please assert so much
this would insert that those gentlemen as they have been losers by the miscarriages of others may now have no breach of their charity with me but if it be as it seems it is now in this countrey

a sin to be loyal hope my god hath forgiven that when it is upon harmless imployment not invading any according to his just masters order for indeed have been always bred up in that religion my allegiance hath been incorporated into my religion and have thought it a great part of the service due from me to almighty god to serve the king putting off his hat
need not make any apology for any thing in relation to the present things in england for were as spake before my judges were as evil as my sentence hath here made me black it were impossible for me to have prejudiced any body in england or to england belonging in that imployment but bless god for his infinite mercy in jesus christ putting off his hat who hath brought me home to him here in this way it was the best physick for the curing of my soul and those that have done it have no more power then that of my body
leave nothing behinde me but that am willing to part withal all that am going to is desireable and that you may all know that almighty god hath totally wrought in me a total denial of my self and that there is that perfect reformation of me within and of my own corruptions by the blessed assistance of his holy spirit desire almighty god in the abundance of the bowels of his mercy in jesus christ not onely to forgive every enemy if any such be in the world here or wheresoever but to bring him into his bosom so much good and particular comfort as he may at any time whether the cause were just or unjust have wished me any maner of evil for take him to be the happy instrument of bringing me to heaven
it is tedious but have an inward comfort bless almighty god pray gentlemen

give leave speaking to some that prest upon him should never do it but to give satisfaction to all charitable hearts
have been troublesom

sheriff
you have your liberty to speak more if you please

sir hide

but as to that part mr sheriff that did concern the denial as it was affirmed by master attorney general of my masters imployment truly landing at whitehall told that councel there was just commissions to an old officer by the blessing of god have by me and have other good things that god hath blessed me withal more then all the good christians in the world that are not the grand seignior slaves and we that are merchants abroad we allow our selves any sufferance that may induce to our own safety inlargement of trade or preservation of what is ours
why had by the grace of my gracious master a confirmation of my old commission of consulage in greece but as to the embassie no more then my credential letters did speak nor no more then that attempted an internuncio they call it in those places which is a messenger between the one and the other king
they both unhappily dyed of several deaths and both violent too and it is a custom not unknown to you master sheriff and other gentlemen that practice in the world that princes of course for the continuation of amity do send messengers where there is peace that the transaction of those publike expressions of recipocrol affections may be performed but for embassie god forbid should own it never had it however they have used it as the happy means to bring me to god this day
beseech god in the bowels of my saviour to forgive

those people that have done it as owe them no harm so god pay them home with all the good of this and an everlasting life

as for power have been long absent here in england meddle with none sufficient for me is gods grace to the salvation of my soul
have been always fearful of offending almighty god according to the grace he hath given me but to learn a and that must say master sheriff to you and all others that hear me cannot dispence with my conscience to give offence to almighty god
am now if it may be with your commission master sheriff to pour out my soul to almighty god in two or three words the place is straitned
if knew wherein to give any satisfaction to any thing whatsoever wherein have offended or no am here in the fear of god to do it
forgive with all my soul and my forgiveness is clear as am now going to receive happiness at the hand of my saviour but if thought it were satisfaction to sir thomas bendish and all the company or any who may think they have offended me am come master sheriff to pay that obedience willingly that debt owe to nature to pay it upon the score of a subject because conscience within me not that for the intentions of serving my prince that could deserve such a death though ten thousand times more other ways

doctor hide
there was some suspition that you might impart the way you were upon to some of those servants that were with you

sir henry hide

humbly thank you for remembring me of it and if any be here of the turky company

this day or any friend of theirs shall desire them from a dying man to take this truth that neither my brother my innocent brother that is with me nor other gentlemen with me in my company have contributed any thing to their disturbance it was my own business whatsoever hath been done that hath been to evil or loss though deny both of them in my intentions come not here to accuse any man nor to excuse my self but to praise god for all his deliverances yet know shall do god a great deal of service and them a great deal of justice in not involving any of my company in any thing of mischief
cannot answer objections finde a man may be in turky or any place all the world over where they will give that language which they hold fitting but this is beneath me
blessed be almighty god that hath called me to the knowledge of him and this ready obedience which pay and merciful accepting of my saviour and patient death and beseech you all whatever you are that you will accompany me with your prayers whereby my soul may be assisted within me in that passage to my saviour whither am going
am weak of body have discontinued long from the kingdom am unacquainted with new forms have desired to serve god according to his commandments after the old way have begged mercy of god for all my offences to him and have had my pardon sealed from heaven by the blood of my saviour beg pardon of all whosoever whether have offended them or no truly forgive them and have besought almighty god to pour his blessings upon them
accuse no man finde fault nor quarrel with no man neither

with the persons that were the occasions they were but the instruments neither at the persons condemning
accept thankfully the sentence of death upon my self and beseech almighty god that may be the last that may suffer upon this score or upon any other

master sheriff if there be any thing wherein can give any other satisfaction to any christian whatsoever in any kinde as spake in general bless almighty god from my own heart now so assisted by the especial operation and motions and dictates of the holy ghost if can know any thing wherein or how to be now in my dying not having served god so well in my life serviceable to the church of god of christ and the full satisfaction of any whatsoever am here ready am unacqainted but in my extasies to heaven there is that glory am going to
beseech almighty god that he will give me grace to bless his holy name as for all as for jesus christ and in him all things so particularly for this that he hath thought me worthy to bring me hither for my faithfulness to my master for doing what was commanded by my master that is the most pious and most just prince in all the world
my master hath suffered bitterly in england and if there be any failing in his service the fault is onely mine
god knows have done nothing in the business but by the instance of the merchants delivered my letters and there they lie to other things am a stranger
hope that god will give me the grace of perseverance in that christian religion in that loyalty to my prince in that love to all the world that now being to give up my account to

him that may with comfort be received in the arms of his mercy

if there be any thing master sheriff that may give satisfaction in am ready to do it according to the poor talent have
will receive my punishment in the way god hath prepared for me and many ways have been taken up
truly am bound to all that see me and many thousands more since came into england not an uncivil look we had strange reports abroad not an uncivil look from any god repay them all and return them from the throne of his grace into their own bosoms
and god in particular bless that honorable lady who was the occasion of the coming of my lords grace of armagh with the confirmation of those glorious and eternal messages of comfort which now am going to enjoy being thankful to all those that know me and know me not for since am come hither whereas might have received prejudice in respect to my loyalty which is not the way now have from them all received courtesie the lord repay them
thank god am otherwise bred and my allegiance hath been incorporated imbodied into my religion and besides the great desires of other gentlemen that might not go out of the world but that the world might see that the grace of god hath had a perfect reformation in me and a willing and thankful submission to his will therefore repent me not of it but beseech almighty god to bless and prosper all people whatsoever that to this kingdom belong
as my speech is imperfect so is my health
have forced my self in this discourse to give that satisfaction which could
and beseech you mr sheriff

if you can hear of any gentlemen that are wronged what offer here am to answer it and beseech you joyn with me in your christian prayers that may have a passage whither am now going to give an account not onely of every deed but of every word

then turning to his man he said

sir hide

sir hide

sheriff

sir hide

then rising again upon his knees he spake to the executioner having the ax in his hand

sir hide

and then taking the ax in his hand he kissed it and returned it to the executioner again saying

sir hide

grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord

it's written of the bereans

that they were more noble then those in thessalonica
what more nobly descended more nobly educated of greater antiquity learning valour power renown or any other external priviledge prerogative or respect not so for if by the bereans we understand the citizens of berea which was a city

in macedonia not far from pella where alexander the great was born they came far short of the thessalonians in many if not in all the forementioned respects
or if by them we understand the jewes which dwelt in berea

and had a synagogue there whereinto paul entred when he came thither as is most consonant and agreeable to the text they were in outward respects in the very same condition wherein the thessalonian jews were not more enobled dignified preferred
but herein they were more noble then those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of minde and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so

that is according to one for they received the doctrine of the gospel very readily every day searching the scriptures diligently that they might see how those things that they had learned by the apostles instruction agreed with the prophecies and figures of the law

or according to another they chearfully received

the word of our gospel and took pains to search the scriptures and to compare our doctrine with the text of the prophets to see if we had alledged them aright
having thus received the word thus searched the scriptures which the other did not they were therefore more noble then they more ingenuous better affected

to be well reported of reputed of both whilst they are alive and when they shall be dead is that which all should and many do affect

for a good name is rather to be chosen then great riches

and a good name is better then precious ointment
nor are the deserving to be deprived of their due commendation for hereby not onely of deserving they become more deserving

but others also endeavour to follow them propound them as fit patterns for their imitation

paul is not here deprived of his due nor are the bereans of theirs but both commended by the holy ghost in this sacred history

paul for that having been so often

in danger and suffered so much already of the jews

as at damascus when they took counsel to kill him and to this intent watched the gates day and night for the prevention whereof the disciples let him down by the wall in a banket

at antioch where they spake against those things which were spoken by him contradicting and blaspheming where also they stirred up the devout and honourable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against him and barnabas and expelled him out of their coasts

at iconium where there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them so that for their own preservation they fled unto lystra and derbe
at lystra where they perswaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead

at philippi where both he and silas had many stripes laid upon them were cast into prison with a charge given unto the jaylor to keep them safely
at thessalonica

where the iews which believed not moved with envy

took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people
that having say been already in such dangers and suffered so much he would again adventure by going into the synagogue of the iews which was in berea and there preaching the word and testifying the gospel of the grace of god oh the faith patience zeal magnanimity charity confidence and constancy of this faithful servant of christ yea

the more his enemies were the greater his troubles the more the greater was his resolution
what saith he himself the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying

that bonds and afflictions abids me but none of these things move me neither count my life dear unto my self so that might finish my course with joy and the ministery which have received of the lord jesus to testifie the gospel of the grace

of god

and again the diseiples having said to him through the spirit that he should not go up to ierusalem
and agabus foretold that the iews at ierusalem would binde him and deliver him into the hands of the gentiles whereupon all they that were present besought him not to go up to ierusalem he answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for am not ready to be bound onely but also to dye at ierusalem for the name of the lord jesus

the bereans that they admitted paul into their synagogue permitted him to preach there did not disturb him whilst he was not onely heard him but received the word by him taught with all readiness of minde examining and trying the same as being unto them new and whereof they had not formerly heard nor were therewith acquainted at all by the scriptures of the old testament which they daily and duly searched for their further both satisfaction and confirmation
whereunto may be added

that they were not led away with the errour of the wicked jews did not follow them though a multitude in evil but loved what they loathed embraced what they despised received what they rejected the good word of god taught by the apostle paul

were ministers now such as paul was people now such as the bereans were how happily might they enjoy each other how much would unity and amity abound how much love concord peace what mutual endeavours for the good of each other how would god be glorified the church edified the gospel flourish truth triumph errour decrease satan lose of his power and interest

but alas what factions and fractions what jars and wars what divisions shismes rents breaches are among them how do they persecute prosecute one another as they differ in judgement especially about their meum and tuum the one seeking to get what they conceive

to be their due the other seeking to retain what they conceive to be none of theirs so between them there's no small alienation of affections
for the divisions of reuben

there were once among the people of god great thoughts heb
impressions of heart
oh that for our present divisions we were thus affected then would we employ the utmost of our endeavours especially fervent and constant prayer unto god to quench this fire make up this breach heal this sore till then we are physicians of no value

in the mean time as timothy was a diligent follower of pauls doctrine

manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience so let all such as are or would be reputed gods ministers herein follow paul follow timothy

let them study to shew themselves approved unto god workmen that need not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
let them preach the word

be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all

and doctrine
great is their dignity

great also is their duty

and
every of which calleth upon them to be diligent and faithful in the execution of their ministeriall function
and for the people would they but seriously consider what the apostle paul required of them with relation unto their ministers

let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of

double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine
and again

obey them that have the rule over you and submit your selves for they which for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you
without peradventure they would be swift to hear

to hear the word of god the excellency necessity and utility whereof who is able sufficiently to express and to receive with meekness the ingrafted word

which is able to save their souls
this even this the souls salvation being of more value then the whole world is that which is mainly to be aimed at both in preaching and hearing

to further this the preacher is to hold fast the form of sound words whereby both the substance of sound christian doctrine and the form of expressing and delivering it may be understood
he is to preach

but rightly dividing the word of truth
he is to speak but as the oracles of god
he must preach the

gospel

but not with wisdom of words or speech
he must utter by the tongue words easie to be understood how else shall it be known what is spoken shall he not speak into the air shall he edifie the ignorant and unlearned shall he not be unto them a barbarian the apostle paul did excel in learning was a notable linguist logician rhetorician what not yet what saith he of himself thank my god speak with tongues more then you all yet in the church had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice might teach others also then ten thousand words in an unknown tongue
in preaching regard is to be had unto the auditory whether they be learned or unlearned knowing or ignorant to use learning in a learned auditory is suteable but plainness is most fit for a plain auditory

there are who run before they are sent and take upon them to be teachers of others they themselves standing in need of instruction both

about the matter or what they are to teach and about the method or how they are to teach

to remedy both and that that which is daily done will be done howsoever here may be well done to the glory of god and edification of his people have thought good to communicare what was many years ago bestowed upon me by a dear friend and faithful minister of gods word now with god a plain platform for preaching whereof if they whose learning is but small and their experience in preaching not very great shall be pleased to make use doubt not but that through gods blessing on their endeavours both their matter and method of preaching will prove satisfactory and give good content

there are many who have writ on this subjest as mr perkins in his art of prophesying
mr bernard in his faithful shepherd
keckerman in his rhetorica ecclesiastica sculterus in his method of preaching

erasmus in his ecclesiastes
jacohus reneccius in his clav
sacrosanctae theologiae
solomon glassius in his philologia sacra
weems in his christian synagogue
hyperius illyricus with diverse others

but this platform being so short and substantial so plain and easie to be understood and containing so much in such a small bulk

conceive to be most fit especially for the unskilful unexperienced young beginner

for this humble crave your honours patronage that under your names it may appear in publique
and vouchsafe also your protection unto a poor orphan the destruction of corruption or an antidote against fleshly lusts which was some years ago exposed unto publique view and had patrons who were then able to defend it but those being either dead or disabled it now runneth unto your honours for shelter

both these present unto your honours as tokens of my thankfulness

for your continued favours

the almighty god who is the exceeding great reward of all them that walk uprightly before him in whose hand is the length of dayes bless and prolong your dayes here to the advancement of his glory the propagation of the gospel and the comfort supportation and encouragement of all the conscionable faithful painful and religious labourers in the lords harvest and after this life crown you with glory for ever
so prayeth

your honours in all humble duty andrew symson

a plain platform for preaching whereby the word of truth may be rightly divided and he that speaketh speak as the oracles of god
what preaching is

preaching is an ordinance of god for the saving of mens souls through the publique interpretation of the scriptures by the voice of

one assigned unto that office in the church of god

ii
ministers are bound to preach the word every minister is bound constantly to perform this duty among the people where god hath set him for he is to use not alone one or two but all means of saving them seeing all are little enough and this of preaching is one of the most special and chiefest

iii
what the interpreting of the word is

the interpreting of the word is the finding out the order sum and meaning thereof
this is done by a logical rhetorical and grammatical analysis of the portion of scripture treated of of which alone the

logical is commonly to be brought in publique and that with tearms not savouring of art when the people are unlearned and without art

iiii
the rules to be observed herein
in interpreting the word these three rules are of speciall use


the literall and largest sense of scripture is the true sense so far as it breeds not some disagrement and jarre between the several parts of scriputre compared together

when any such disagreement will arise from the literal and largest sense then must recourse be had to a figurative sense or to some distinction or limitation one of which will surely clear the text


no distinction nor limitation must be embraced but that which hath direct ground out of the scripture and will naturally arise from the comparing of places both different and agreeing
and the figures must also be so explained as that we must have some plain places of scripture upon which to ground our explication of them

if these three rules be not followed the scripture will be made as a nose of wax we framing it to our opinions not our opinions to it


the word is most conveniently handled by way of doctrine and use

the word of god is most conveniently applied unto the hearers by way of doctrine and use
for this course

of teaching is most easie for the capacity and memory of the simplest hearer and most commodious for the speaker himself
for hereby he shall be sure to keep himself within the compass of his text and to speak nothing but what is naturally grounded upon that scripture which he then handleth

vi
what a doctrine is
a doctrine is some proposition expressed in the text or else rightly deduced from the same
if it be plainly expressed it needs little proof the text it self proving the same
and for such doctrines they may be easily seen and perceived by any

vii
how a doctrine is to be raised from the text
for the deducing of a doctrine from the text this rule is most sure and infallible
frame a true categorical syllogisme chiefly of the first figure whereof something in the text being the medius terminus and the doctrine the conclusion then the doctrine is soundly gathered else not

viii
the order to be used in the handling of a doctrine
the doctrine whether expressed or deduced must be orderly and substantially handled
this saving any mans better judgement may be done very conveniently in four parts


by proposing the doctrine

or setting down the proposition shewing clearly how it is gathered out of the text


by illustrating the same both by a repetition of the same thing in some variety of tearms to the number of two or three whereof the last if it may be is to be the most short and pithy that it may best stick in the memory and most delight the hearer and also by some fit and apt similitude
but herein care must be had
not to exceed for similitudes being chiefly for delight two are enough

the protasis must be a thing well known to the hearer not some abstruse thing in nature whereof he is more ignorant and less capable then of the doctrine it self which is tob illustrated
this were as if one should go about to explain an obscure

thing by that which is more obsure
obscurum per obscurius


by confirming it both by allegation of like places of scriptures which tend to the same end two or three may suffice for in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be estabished cor
and by reasons
the reasons may be taken from the cause effects or any place of logick which if they be strong and lightsomely delivered do much affect


by explaining the doctrine and that by speaking of both or one of the tearms of the proposition whether shall seem most needful shewing both the kindes degrees causes effects adjuncts thereof or some of those as shall be most behooful
but it is to be remembred

that these explanations must be used onely in matters as concern the most necessary points of religion or some most excellent vertue or notorious vice or something that the hearer doth not in likelihood well conceive of

by those four directions if duly followed the doctrine will be plentifully and substantially handled
and when the explanation is needful it is best to handle it last that the minde of the hearer may still hang as it were upon the preachers mouth desiring to hear him speak for when a man thinks that such a thing is true which yet he doth not fully understand he is hereupon the more desirous to have it fully laid open

ix
how an use is to be raised
the use is a proposition deduced from the doctrine where the same rule must be observed which hath been already propounded viz
the doctrine must be the medius terminus the use the conclusion of a true syllogisme
then is it a right and well collected use else not



all uses do respect principally

either the judgement or the practice

the judgement


for confutation of a false opinion which the present point doth well and fitly serve to confute


for confirmation of a truth or instruction to be well grounded in the truth which the present point serveth to confirm and manifest

the practice
and that either


to reprove and terrifie an offender that he may leave off and forsake his sin or
to admonish and exhort unto the performance of good duties or
to comfort strengthen and comfirm the godly that they faint not

xi
how the uses are to be handled

the uses also may be conveniently handled in this order


propose the use shewing clearly how it followeth from the doctrine


amplifie the use and enlarge

it that it may work with more strength and life upon the affections of the hearer


press it more particularly upon the present auditory and every particular soul therein

xii
each use may be severaly amplified
the several uses admit of several wayes of amplification

xiii
an use of confutation how to be amplified
an use of confutation may be thus amplified


by a plain narration and description of the errour to be refuted and that as year as may be in the very words used by the adversary


by shewing how contrary

the doctrine in hand and the point to be confuted are each to other and how they cannot stand together


by taking away such idle distinctions as the adversary haply doth or may use to reconcile them
or if no shift be yet by a concession that if it were as they say and think yet that would not follow which they intend

xiii
how an use of confirmation and instruction is to be amplified
an use of conformation of the truth and instruction to rest in it may be amplified after the same manner that the former


by declaring the point to be confirmed


by shewing directly that

it must needs follow upon the point in hand


by answering such cavils as are or may be brought against it

xv
how to amplifie an use of reproof
an use of reproof may be amplified


by a clear describing of the parties to be reproved namely they that do so and so offend that no man may exempt himself that is guilty and here it will be best and most fit to use the very words of scripture


by declaring certain adjuncts of the fault viz
the commonness of it whereby the reproof will appear to be needfull and therefore the more to be attended unto

the dangerousness of it to the soul

body name estate of every of which it's fit to give one or more pregnant examples

the unfitness and unbeseeming of it in respect of our profession age calling
the easiness or hardness of leaving it hereby to make such as are guilty ashamed not to overcome or diligent to resist
and here the means would be propounded to keep against it


by meeting with such cavils as are used in defence thereof or any objection that may be made against the reproof which yet must be done with the spirit of meekness to prevent an occasion of grief to any weak heart

xvi
an use of admonition or exhortation how to be amplified

an use of admonition or

exhortation to the practice of a vertue must be amplified


by a lively description of the thing and parties to whom and of which the exhortation is made and is tob pressed

by a declaration of the profit commodity and benefit that will arise from such practice and here an example is very fit and convenient as also of the possibility of attaining to the vertue by striving where the means furthering the performance of the duty must be declared

by meeting with doubts and objections that may be made against the duty or why a man should not do it

xvii
an us of comfort how to be amplified
an use of comfort may be amplified


by a description of the parties to whom it belongeth and that clearly that no man may abuse himself

by a declaration of the comfort it self how needful certain great constant it is and here also examples are of great force

by meeting with the loose conclusions of carnal men and setting them down in brief by shewing how the comfort doth not appertain to them and also of the doubts that a tender heart will never move against it answering them lovingly where are to be shewed the notes of the vertue that is the foundation of the comfort

xviii
a caveat about the kindes and order of amplifications
it is not necessary to use all the kindes of amplifications but such of them as shall appear most convenient nor to use them all in order but so as shall be best to delight teach and move the hearer

xix
the conclusion of the uses how to be ordered
the conclusion of all uses is alike by an apostrophe wherein the most worthy things must be in some variety of speech repeated and urged upon every several soul with interrogations more or less earnest as the point requireth and if it may be the whole ended with some pithy apophonema or the like

xx
a necessary direction about the uses
all points afford not every one of those uses or if they do yet some one of them most principally which must be handled more largely and the rest more briefly delivered
and the minister must be sure to use as well instruction and comfort as reproof else the hearer will think hardly of him

propoundeth necessary caveats to be observed in this spirituall encounter

a christian must be carefull

not to be an hindrance unto himselfe in vanquishing his
not to cast away his armour or in any sort yeeld
to be wise in the application of scripture
to prepare for new contrary winds
to cry out against our lusts being overmastered by them
to beware of the false bed of security

to consider that all sinnes

have not the like proportion of labour in mortifying

neither to be too curious nor altogether carelesse of the first motions unto sinne
to aske pardon for secret sinnes
not to beleeve that the flesh is always mortified when it seemeth so to be
to continue in the practice of mortification
to be perswaded that faith in christ must precede mortification
to distinguish betweene naturall spirituall and carnall lusts
not to give over but fight even to the end

chap

are alive unto god
are freed from sinne
are new creatures
set themselves against every sinne
grow in grace
hate sinne

such is the dangerous estate of gods children here upon earth so many the tribulations of the righteous that as they themselves are compared to warriours

their

life termed a

alwayes working out their salvation with feare and trembling
above them below them behind them before them within them without them round about them on their right hand on their left hand in prosperity in adversity well or ill at home or abroad

do their many cruell malicious subtile and incessant enemies lay stratagems to worke their confusion

of those

the divell the world and the flesh are the principall agents

the devill

who as a roaring lyon continually goeth about

seeking whom hee may devoure

the world

which doth even think it strange that we run not with them to the same excesse of ryot speaking evill of us

the flesh which lusteth against the spirit

and is so contrary thereunto that we cannot doe the things that we would

every of those severally all of them jointly have sworne our destruction
them therfore are we so to oppose resist strive against

that the first may flie from us

and the third crucified by us

with this last as our domesticke enemy

our bosome traitor yea without whose assistance neither the devill could seduce us nor world intrap

us do we in the strength of the almightie in the name of our lord iesus christ in the grace and comfort of his holy spirit and in the light and direction of his sacred word cope at this time confining our selves for our further profit and more orderly proceeding in this combate unto the prosecution of these ten particulars

of every of which severally and in order at the pleasure of god

chap

the enemy to bee encountred with the sundry names wherby the same is expressed

the enemy to bee encountred is the flesh

with the affections and lusts thereof the old man with his deeds the law of sin in our members warring against the law of our mind and bringing us into captivity to the law of sin which is in our members

even our naturall corruption and pravitie which as a spirituall kinde of disease gall leaven and poyson dayly

diffuseth it selfe throughout our whole man so infecting the same that as thereby wee are made in our selves unapt to any good though most prone and ready to all evill so most bitter fruits are in us produced even inordinate motions of the minde will and affections which doe entice and stir us up unto sinne

and are now and then acted and executed by the body both inword and deed

this is in scripture made knowne unto us under divers names

which upon divers and different respects are appropriated heereunto as namely in regard of its nature its places of residence the time of its manifestation its continuance its power its effects its ayme and end and the like

its nature so is it termed


a secret sinne as in that of david

clense thou me from secret faults and that of moses

thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sinnes in the light of thy countenance the word in the former derived from a roote which signifieth hid

implying that our originall sin or corruption of nature is hid even from our very thought till it bee revealed by the law of god

as the latter from a roote whence undefined span alphabet which signifieth a young man or stripling is derived that as a young man abideth hid and unknowne till hee undergoe either the domesticke change of a familie or some publike office in the
so our originall corruption till it manifest it selfe by its inward stirring and outward acts of sin

is unto us wholly unknowne unto god onely knowne


sin as in that of paul

but sinne taking occasion by the commandement wrought in me all manner of concupiscence

even because it is out of measure sinfull yea the ground and roote of all other sinnes as iames testifieth

but every man is tempted when hee is drawne away of his owne lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin
to which purpose paul

let not sinne reigne in your mortall body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof


the lust of the flesh as in that of paul

make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof
and againe walke in the spirit

and ye shall not fulfill

the lust of the flesh
so fleshly lusts

as in that of peter abstaine from fleshly lusts which warre against the soule intimating

that as the same proceed from the flesh and savour of the flesh so are they marveilous pleasing to sensualitie and such as the flesh doth especially delight in


enmitie against god as in that of paul

because the carnall minde is enmitie against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be


the vanitie of the minde as in that of the same apostle

this say therefore and testifie in the lord that ye henceforth walke not as other gentiles walke in the vanitie of their minde having the understanding

darkned
all our fleshly lusts our inward motions and stirrings unto sinne they are but the vanitie of our minds how pleasing soever to us


earthly members as in that unto the colossians

mortifie your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleannesse inordinate affection members

because as in the fit and apt joyning together of the severall parts and members of the body the being of the humane body doth consist so doth our wickednesse consist in many particular disorders inordinate lusts and affections the joyning of which together doth make up the universall sinfulnesse of our nature wherby the heart is made no lesse

fit for all manner of sinne then by the members of the body the body is made fit for action

because they are no lesse naturall unto us then the members of our body beginning and growing in us with the beginning and growing of our limbs according to that of the psalmist
behold was shapen in iniquity

and in sinne did my mother conceive mee
because as the members of the body doe the actions of the body so doe these base affections doe the actions of the unregenerate part

because as the members of the body doe serve as weapons for the defence one of another so these as weapons of unrighteousnesse doe warre against the soule

because

they are as deare unto the heart as any member is unto the body its right hand

and right eye which without much adoe it will not part withall
earthly members

as being the signes of the earthly man and tend onely to earthly pleasures and contentments still carrying and drawing our mindes from an high valuing of heavenly things to a base esteeme of them and from a base esteeming of earthly things unto an high esteeme of them

its places of residence

so is it termed


flesh as in that of saint paul

who walke not after the flesh but after the spirit and againe

they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the

affections and lusts


because the flesh is the instrument by which it is propagated

because it is executed in our carnall and earthly members

because it is strengthened augmented and nourished by carnall and fleshly objects

because it is the end it drives us to namely to affect the same and fulfill the lusts thereof


the deeds of the body as in the chapter

if yee through the spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body ye shall live

because the body is the subject wherein they are and instruments wherby they are executed visibly manifesting themselves in the same



the desires of the flesh and of the minde
neither is it

any marvell that such as walke in the vanitie of their minde

having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindnesse of their heart it's no marvell say that such fleshly desires doe reside in their minds and are in like manner obeyed in their outward members

the time of its manifestation

so it is termed



the evill imagination of mans heart from his youth or infancie and childs age the word whence youth here is derived being spoken of moses when he was a babe exo
the same being in us from the very houre wherein wee are formed then especially

first shewing it selfe when we first begin actually to sinne


the sinne wherein wee are conceived and borne as in that of the psalmist

behold was shapen in iniquitie and in sinne did my mother conceive me and againe

the wicked are estranged from the wombe they goe astray so soone as they bee borne speaking lies
to this purpose isaiah

for knew that thou wouldest deale very treacherously and wast called a transgressour from the wombe

its continuance

so is it termed


sinne that dwelleth in one
now then it is no more that doe it

saith paul but sinne that dwelleth in me

if we say we have no sinne saith iohn wee deceive

our selves and the truth is not in us
to which purpose iames

in many things wee sinne all
our saviour for this cause directeth us dayly to pray and forgive us our sinnes

as a bold saucie quarrelsome inmate it will though but as a slavish gibeonite whilst we dwell here dwell in us


the old man

as in that unto the ephesians that ye put off concerning the former conversation the olde man which is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts and unto the colossians

lie not one to another seeing that yee have put off the old man with his workes
yet in other respects also it may bee thus termed

as
in respect of our state of corruption

which in the renewed estate we change so that our condition after calling is said to bee new and our disposition before calling to bee old

in respect of the effects thereof as well in the godly as the ungodly the godly in whom it waxeth old and withereth more and more daily by the power of christ in them the ungodly in whom it spends the strength and vigour of the faculties of their soules making them more and more withered and deformed in gods sight as in like manner upon their bodies it hasteneth old age and death

its power

so is it termed


strong holds for the weapons of our warfare are not carnall

saith paul but mighty through god to the pulling downe of strong holds
strong holds wee know are neither easily nor quickly pulled downe some one having for many months together stood out against the furious batteries of most puissant princes
such are our inbred corruptions words will not make them affraid and if cowardly or without our warlike engins weapons and armour we assaile them they will but flout us for our labour faith knowledge hope prayer teares sighes groanes will have enough to doe ere those holds be pulled downe



the sinne which doth so easily beset us and hangeth so fast on us whereof of our

selves we can no more be rid then a little childe is able to encounter a gyant which sticking as it were in our marrow and bones wee are as unable to shake off as the his colour or the leopard his spots

its effects

so it is termed



an uncleanething who can bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane saith iob uncleane as in its owne nature being contrary unto god who is holines and puritie it selfe so in respect of us who are defiled thereby according to that of our saviour

but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man



the body of sinne as not

onely being in it selfe a monstrous body in which respect the names of serpents

vipers lyons bears ravening wolves wild swine asses are in scripture ascribed unto those in whom there is nothing else but flesh and corruption but also daily bringing forth in us a monstrous brood of noysome lusts by all meanes provoking egging and inticing us to fulfill the same


the motions of sinne

as which are continually stirred up by corruption in the heart and in the minde and doe incite a man and as it were sollicite him to sinne which being in themselves sinfull and comming from sinne so they egge unto sinne

and beget workes which are sinfull hence saint paul describing simple women that are carried away as a prey by cunning seducers thus speaks of them

that they are led with divers lusts that is as the word signifieth acted and moved impelled and driven this way and that way by many evill motions and lusts



a warring law in our members even a law in our members warring against the law of our minde and bringing us into captivitie to the law of sinne which is in our members whereunto is agreeable that of saint peter

abstaine from fleshly lusts which warre against the soule

and that of paul unto the galathians the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the

spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other



the body of death
wretched man that am saith paul who shall deliver me from the body of this death

a body of death as being a deadly thing deserving both temporal and eternall death as working the death both of body and soule

as engendring and bringing forth a brood of deadly sinnes

being nothing else but dead workes as being a most deformed and misshapen body yea destined to everlasting death condemned to die

and to death must goe


the lust of concupiscence

as elsewhere evill concupiscence

as being the loathsome fountaine whence the filthy

streames of uncleannesse abundantly flow



the deceitfulnesse of sinne as unto the ephesians deceitfull lusts

as which in the end notwithstanding of all their faire shewes

and goodly pretences will certainely delude and coozen us if wee repose any confidence therein



a root of bitternes which springing up in us doth both trouble and defile us dayly producing in us much bitter fruit the corrupt fruit of evill



entising lust
but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his owne lust and entised saith saint iames
entising as well endevoreth no lesse to intrap us then dalilah did samson thamar iudah fishers

and fowlers by their baits fishes and fowles

its ayme and end

so is it termed

the law of sinne in our members as which would as a law domineere over us
so also the body of death as which would bring upon us death both the first and the second death corporall spirituall and eternall

this our naturall corruption those our inordinate lusts and affections under what forme soever by what name soever warring against us are wee valiantly to encounter

yea those very names ascribed thereunto do not a little further us in the discovery of the same as by our reviewing of them may thus appeare



if it bee enmitie against god

and the body of death then it is one of the three great enemies of god and mans salvation



if it bee sinne that dwelleth in one and the law of sinne in our members then it is a domesticall and so a more dangerous enemie



if it be a secret sinne the evill imagination of mans heart from his youth the sinne wherein wee are conceived and borne the old man sin out of measure sinfull then as there is no small skill to be used to finde it out so in like manner is not the same to be slighted



if it be the flesh the lusts of the flesh earthly members the deeds of the body the desires of the flesh and of the mind

then is the same pleasing unto flesh and blood after an especiall manner delightfull unto mans corrupt nature


if it be strong holds

the sinne that doth so easily beset us a warring law in our members then it is powerfull not easie to be overcome


if it be the motions of sin

and entising lust then will not it let us alone though wee would peaceably entertaine the same



if it be the vanitie of the minde the deceitfulnesse of sin deceitfull lusts

then how pleasing soever for the present will it in the end prove treacherous unto us


if it be an uncleane thing

a monstrous body of sinne then is it that whereof

wee are to bee ashamed and which is of us both to be abhorred and loathed



if it be a roote of bitternesse then as there is no true pleasure to be found therein and it selfe is the ground of all actuall transgressions whether in word or deed which are daily stirred up thereby so if it be not daily wrought upon and the branches therof lopt off by the axe of gods word the same will prove so hard and the branches thereof so many so great and so wreathed together that our will be but labour in vaine

thus of the enemie to bee encountred with the names of treachery tyranny crueltie sensualitie and guile so

plainly as it were in capitall letters written on its forehead that hee that runneth may reade them and accordingly avoid the danger and so of the first particular

chap
ii
that the flesh with the lusts and affections therof is to be encountred

no smal difference there is betweene our temporall and spirituall adversaries

with those wee both may and must be reconciled with these to admit of reconciliation is no lesse impossible then unlawfull those may love us and how soever we must love them these will alwaies hate us and we must alwaies hate them with those we may for

a long time live in peace howsoever carry our selves peaceably towards them with these wee both are and must be daily at deadly feud yea though wee would let them alone yet will not they let us alone and by our not encountring them doe we encourage them the more eagerly and fiercely to set upon us
such is the flesh a deadly daily trecherous tyrannicall domesticall guilfull enemy it daily and by severall waies would destroy us accordingly must we daily and duly desire and seek its ruine

casting downe imaginations and every high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivitie every thought to the obedience of christ

a dutie which is in the scripture both commanded and commended the true nature thereof being both largely and significantly pourtrayed therein as also the constant practise thereof under most exhortations unto repentance renovation regeneration mortification and the like implicitely urged

this is

to deny our selves

to make our selves spiritually eunuchs for the kingdome of heavens sake

to forsake all that a man hath

to be dead to sinne

to be baptised into christs death

and buried with him by baptisme into death

to be circumcised

with the circumcision made without hands

to hate our life in this world

to enter in at the strait gate

to make a covenant with our eyes

set a watch about the dore of our lips

rule our spirit

and take heede to our wayes

to be turned from darknes to light

and from the power of sathan unto god

to arise from the dead

to break up our fallow ground

to circumcise our selves to the lord

and take away the foreskinne of our heart

to wash our heart from wickednesse

to loath our selves for the evils which wee have committed in all our abominations

to rent our hearts

and turne unto the lord our god

to deny ungodlinesse and worldly lusts

to keepe under our body

and bring it into subjection

to suffer in the flesh and cease from sinne

to sell all that we have

and buy the field with the treasure therein

to forget our owne people

and our fathers house

yea such is the goodnesse of god towards us that under what name soever after what manner soever this our enemy commeth against us we are instructed how to deale with the same and avoid the foile
behold it commeth against us with its name written on its how readest thou

the evill imagination of mans heart from his youth

wee must not walke any more after the imagination of our evill heart

vaine thoughts must not be suffered to lodge within us

wee must cast downe imaginations and every high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of god

an uncleane thing

let us clense our selves from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit

perfecting holinesse in the feare of god

wee must bee sanctified and clensed with the washing of water by the word

wee must wash our heart from wickednes that we may be saved

we must get our hearts sprinkled our bodies washed with pure water

we must purifie our selves in obeying the truth throgh the spirit

secret sinnes

wee must call upon god to be informed thereof

and accordingly clensed therefrom

the sinne wherein we are conceived and borne

wee must call upon god to purge

wash and clense us therefrom

to beget us with the word of trueth that wee may be a kinde of first fruits of his creatures borne againe

borne of water and of the spirit

and so in christ new creatures

the body of sinne

the same must be destroyed

knowing this saith saint paul that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sinne might be destroyed that henceforth wee should not serve sin

the same in like manner must bee put

off as the same apostle writeth elsewhere

the motions of sinne

we must not lodge them

either slight them but according to the meanes of knowledge bestowed upon us oppose them lest wee become vaine in our imaginations

and god in justice give us up unto vile affections

sinne

we must be dead thereunto

wee must not let it reigne in our mortall body to obey it in the lusts thereof

either yeeld our members as instruments of unrighteousnes unto sin

we must wash our hearts therefrom

we must refuse to enjoy the pleasures thereof

sin that dwelleth in one

we must not consent thereunto

but so oppose it

that we may say with saint paul now if doe that would not it is no more that doe it but sinne that dwelleth in me

a warring law in our members

the law of our minde must warre against the same

that as the flesh lusteth against the spirit

the spirit may in like manner lust against the flesh

the body of death

we must be sensible therof and even long to bee delivered therefrom saying with saint paul

wretched man that am who shall deliver me from the body of this death

flesh

we must crucifie the same

we must not walke after the same

we must not live after the same

we must not make provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof

wee must not warre after the flesh

wee must not minde the things thereof

enmitie against god

wee must not favour the same either yet enter into any termes of reconciliation therewith

as which is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be

the deeds of the body

wee must through the spirit

mortifie the same that wee may live

the lusts of the flesh

wee must not fulfill them

we must crucifie the same

we must not be led away with them

wee must not be drawne away of them

wee must not bee allured

through them

we must abstaine from them

strong holds

the weapons of our warfare must not be carnall

but mighty through god to the pulling down of them

the desires of the flesh and of the minde

we must not fulfill them

as heretofore we have done

but enter into a covenant to seek the lord god of our fathers with all our heart and with all our soule

the vanity of the minde

we must not henceforth thus walke as other gentiles walke

but endevour to bee renewed in the spirit of our minde

transformed by the renewing of our minde

and changed into the image of god from glory to glory

even as by the spirit of the lord that christ may be formed in us

and as we have born the image of the earthy

we may also beare the image of the heavenly adam

earthly members

we must mortifie them

we must put them off

we must not yeeld our members as instruments of unrighteousnesse unto sinne

the old man

we must put off concerning the former conversation

the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts not contenting our selves till wee know assuredly

that our old man is crucified with christ

the lust of concupiscence

every one of us should know how to possesse his vessell in sanctification and honour

not in the

lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god

the deceitfulnesse of sin

we must exhort one another dayly

while it is called to day lest any of us bee hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sinne

the sinne which doth so easily beset us

we must lay aside every weight

and the sinne that doth so easily beset us that we may runne with patience the race that is set before us

yea wee must even resist unto blood striving against sinne

a root of bitternesse

we must looke diligently

lest any of us fail of the grace of god and this roote of bitternesse springing up trouble us and therby many be defiled

entising lust

we must be carefull not to be allured thereby

lest being of the same overcome of the same we be brought in bondage

in a word
we must alwaies walke so warily and circumspectly that in what kind soever after what manner soever under what name soever this our dangerous and deadly enemy shall assaile us wee may instantly oppose it resist it strive against it give it the foile
thus that the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof is to bee encountred and so of the second particular

chap
iii
by whom the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof is to be encountred

the persons which are to performe this dutie

and by whom alone the same is indeed performed are the children of god

whom of his owne will hee hath begotten with the word of truth

purifying their hearts by faith and bestowing upon them as well a true sight and sense of sinne as an unfained hatred and detestation

of the same they are such as have the spirit dwelling in them

through which they mortifie the deeds of the body
and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts

saith the same apostle they are such as having learned christ

and beene taught by him put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts they are such as have put off the old man with his deeds

and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him they are such as are already called to the knowledge of our lord jesus christ and to the beliefe of his glorious gospell men and women already sanctified

and in part regenerate

even those whose eares are already digged their eyes opened

and themselves turned from darknesse to light and from the power of sathan unto god must take uncessant and unwearied paines with constant and perpetualll endevours more and more to subdue beate downe mortifie crucifie destroy and vanquish all and every of these wicked sinfull and unlawfull affections lusts inclinations and habits that are in them till they have even pulled them up by the roots and cast them quite out of their hearts



it is manifest enough that there is even in the best and most holiest of gods children a great deale of corruption

an evill eye which must be pluck'd out

and a bad hand that must be cut off not a few spots and wrinkles infirmities and imperfections evill lusts and affections which must be done away while they are here on earth how farre soever they are proceeded in the new birth they doe but know in part

there is something lacking in their faith

so in their love holinesse humility and such other graces

even elias himselfe being subject to like passions as we are

and this the lord suffereth for the greater glory of himselfe disgrace of sathan and good of his own children
needs must it tend greatly to the praise and glory of god shame and disgrace of the devill that

the lord knoweth how and is able to keepe and preserve such weake and feeble vessels as we are against all the power of hell and to make them conquerers over sathan in that very flesh which is so polluted with sin and was once depraved by the divell
no lesse tendeth the same to our good god being pleased hereby to humble us and to exercise those gifts and graces of his spirit that hee hath bestowed upon us



it is no lesse evident that they are not to connive at their owne sinnes are not to beare with sin in themselves nay of all others must walke most circumspectly lest either through sinne they doe wound their owne consciences

or give occasion unto the enemies of god to blaspheme



its also without question that the lesse carefull they are in subduing their lusts the more they are by them sleighted they get the greater strength and put the saints to a great deale of trouble which they might have easily avoided



it is in like manner found true by experience that on them alone god is pleased to bestow the grace of mortification and unto them alone so to blesse the meanes tending thereunto that they become effectuall

true it is that as of old the philosophers by the very light of nature abstained from

most grosse sins out of their love unto vertue writing excellent bookes in the commendations therof by whose painfull labours though hereby they gained unto themselves not any thing else but humane applause or the commendations of men god of his mercy did much good unto others as the bees gather honey to the profit of others not their owne they in the meane time glorying in those vertues and condemning others better then themselves who notwithstanding never knew the inward working of chastitie temperance modestie humility gravity and the like vertues by themselves commended not unlike the pharisees whose life outwardly

seeming blamelesse as also their crueltie greedines and pride artificially covered under the vaile of outward preaching prayer almesdeeds phylacteries and such like wanted not they applause of the people howsoever inwardly they were wholly unmortified and uncircumcised in heart so there are now not a few whose carriage is outwardly commendable and their conversation unblameable especially at some times and in some companies yea who often outstrip even the children of god in bridling their tongue and restraining their passions of anger griefe and the like which notwithstanding are yet in their sinnes daily denying

the power of godlines wholly ignorant of their inward heart yea such of whom it may bee truely said that their oblations are vaine

their incense and sacrifice even their best and most pious workes abomination unto the lord

and except their righteousnes doe exceed the righteousnes of the scribes and pharisies they shall not enter into the kingdome of heaven


neither can it be denyed but that as the lord is pleased to bestow on them alone the grace of mortification and unto them alone

so to blesse the meanes tending thereunto that in them they become effectuall so they are the onely persons which labour and endevour for the

same in sinceritie and truth which by all meanes possible labour to obtaine this precious jewell and hid manna of inward grace the circumcision of the heart and are accordingly blessed in their expectation

they know that all the worshippers of god must worship him in spirit and truth

they understand that god is light and in him is no darknes who beholds all iniquitie especially inward whereof angels divels and men may be ignorant they have also that glorious knowledge

that christs spouse is all glorious within as accordingly must all the arrayed with the glorious garments of the of the spirit who shall bee presented

chast virgins to christ and who having fought hitherto against the evill one and kept their garments unspotted with the corruption that is in the world through lust as through grace they have begun in the spirit so through grace they shall end in the spirit and not in the flesh
how then can it otherwise be but that they should practise this duty of mortification but that being thus endued with the spirit of grace and of glory they should obey the good motions thereof inspiring them and knocking at the dores of their soules to the keeping especially of their hearts with all diligence

between them and the rest of the world grace hath made such a change as there is betweene

them that dwell in a faire house of great height

and full of many great lights and them that dwell in a low dark house whose windowes remaine alwayes shut those can discerne in a manner of every thing these not take notice or view any thing

so the saints through the abundance of the light of god in them can espie even a moate in the soule whereas the ungodly who will not permit the holy light of gods convicting reproving improving word to have passage in them abide still in darknes having their hearts haunted as it were with zim ochim

and jim in stead of more comfortable guests

the saints know that god

dwels in their hearts as his owne tabernacle with the sonne and holy spirit which therefore must be well kept clensed purified and washed by the blood of christ and water of his sanctifying spirit that uncleannes may not enter therein

to this end

as iehoiada the priest put a great guard of princes preists about young ioas that wicked athalia could not come at him to harme him

which made her cry out treason treason
so the saints left sathan should at any time get entrance into them get themselves garded by the word and spirit prayer repentance watchfulnes holy feare to offend god and grieve the spirit by whom

they are sealed unto the day of redemption

yea as the elders which sate with elisha in his house

at his command shut the dore upon bloody iorams messenger and held him fast thereat the sound of his masters feete being behind him

so the saints understanding that evill motions are as it were sathans messengers or harbengers to take up his lodging for him whom he immediatly followeth through grace they so resist the same that either they doe not enter or if they enter they get no footing and are compelled speedily to depart

in the wicked indeed hee getteth a renewed entry at his owne pleasure but not so in the saints hee seekes

rest but heere hee finds none
thus that the saints doe and are to encounter the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof and so of the third particular

chap
iv
why the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof is to be encountred
not without cause are wee to encounter this our enemie and doe what in us lyeth to oppose it resist it subdue it destroy it if either we consider it our selver or others

it

and that both in regard of the nature thereof and effects produced thereby

its nature vile odious abominable vgly and loathsome

like the vomiting of a dogge a sowes wallowing in the mire
the scripture doth accordingly decipher it by the names of filth

filthy garments filthinesse of the flesh and spirit
the worlds pollutions uncleannesse a defiling thing and the like
thus if a man should view it even as it is in its own proper colours he could not but loath and abhorre the same

its effects

both shamefull and hurtfull
shamefull as which maketh men and women its vassals and slaves for to whomsoever we yeeld our selves servants to obey

his servants we are to whom wee obey coozening and deceiving them at its pleasure

proffering as largely as the devill sometime did

christ

all these things will give thee if thou wilt fall downe and worship mee
but in the meane time not being able to performe any whit of its promises hurtfull

as whose pleasure is onely momentaneall but bitternesse everlasting yea which warreth against mens soules bodies posterity goods and good name
soules

by blinding their understanding reason and judgement and bringing them to a reprobate sense so that they will not bee brought to the knowledge of the truth

but are like the deafe adder that stoppeth her eare which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely

even who will not heare the law of the lord

so by taking away

their heart

and piercing them thorow with many sorrowes
so by destroying their soules

so by seducing the will and affections and making them worse and worse every unmortified lust being a wound in the soule a gash in the conscience so by inclining the soule to maintaine those sinnes whereunto they themselves are principally addicted so by distempering their soules that there's no peace therein they themselves disquieting themselves in vain

travelling in paine all the dayes of their life

sinne not suffering grace as it were to manifest it selfe in the least measure unto those but disturbing them by unnaturall thoughts as by the insatiability of that whereunto it inciteth

the sluggard must have a little more sleepe the drunkard a little more drink the covetous more money the lascivious more concubines
so by its importunitie which will admit no deniall forcing them oftentimes to commit what in their judgement they doe not approve
so by promising them contentment which notwithstanding they finde not there being indeede neither pleasure nor profit in sinne
so by galling their conscience after the commission thereof whether in adversity or prosperity as the examples of ahab about naboths vineyard

and belshazzar when he drunk wine with his concubins in the vessels of the house of the lord sufficiently imply

whereby it commeth to passe that they feare when there is no cause of feare

bodies both directly and indirectly directly

as which occasioneth bodily diseases and distempers as in like manner death it selfe

indirectly by affecting or inflicting the minde wherby the body cannot but be so disquieted that even in laughter the heart is sorrowfull

and the end of that mirth is heavinesse

for amerry heart doth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones as david found by experience

posterity as the examples of pharaoh ahab ieroboam iehu with others manifest according to that of moses from the lord

if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy

god cursed shall be the fruit of thy body
in hell when many both parents and children shall meet these may blame those as the especiall cause of their condemnation
goods both directly and indirectly

directly

as because of the whorish woman a man is brought to a morsell of bread whereof the prodigall sonne had particular experience

indirectly as which bringeth a curse upon the goods which they have painefully gotten by gracelesse children
unfaithfull servants costly tho fruitlesse physicke and such like
so that often

what they earne is put as it were in a bagge with holes

and what they painfully gather is heaped up to give to him that is good before god

yea sometimes it falleth out that a man to whom god hath given riches

and treasures and honour and he wanteth nothing to his soule of all that he desireth yet god giveth him not power to eate thereof but a strange man shall eat it agreeable to that of iob

though he should heape up silver as the dust and prepare rayment as the clay he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver

as a little before hee hath devoured substance and hee shall vomit it for god shall draw it out of his belly yea god maketh their table a snare unto them

good name according to that of the wise man
the name of the wicked shall rot

and that of iob he shall perish for ever like his dung

it makes them odious

both to god and good men
is not the flesh then with the lusts and affections therof to be encountred is not the same to be mortified as in regard of its nature so the wofull and dangerous effects of the same

our selves

first because wee have so promised and vowed in baptisme as also often renewed the same at our participatio of the lords supper even to forsake the devill and all his workes the pomps and vanities of the wicked world and all the sinfull lusts of the flesh
if then wee would not become forsworne and perjured persons as it were souldiers forsaking their colours casting downe their weapons and running away from their captaine we must

faithfully keepe touch in the performance of our covenant accordingly arming our selves to this battell

secondly because wee are called with an holy calling

as obedient children saith saint peter not fashioning your selves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be yee holy in all manner of conversation
because it is written be yee holy for am holy

thirdly because we professe our selves to bee the children of god and so consequently enemies unto our owne corruptions

which are enmitie against god

fourthly

because if wee live after the flesh we shall die but if through the spirit we doe

mortifie the deeds of the body we shall live

fiftly because at the length we shall be victorious against the same
god will so accept of our weake endevours that he will more enable us to hold on yea so strengthen us that through him wee shall do valiantly in crucifying this old man mortifying these earthly members subduing this body of sin and putting to death this body of death
we are weake indeed in our selves

but if god be with us who can prevaile against us not goliah against david our sinnes against us being under the almighties protection and clothed with the armour of god

sixtly because the more we

yeeld unto our lusts

the more will they insult over us being so unreasonable that they are never satisfied like the horsleech whereof the wiseman speaketh that the more it is given the more it craves and is never satisfied like the fire which the more is cast into it burneth the more yea

notwithstanding whatsoever corruption is in the world hath proceeded from lust yet is not contented but still desireth to corrupt more
if thou give it an inch it will take an ell if it can get but in its head it wil quickly wind in its whole body
if it once take possession of the soule it will not be an easie matter to dispossesse the same entertainest thou it in any measure it will quickly

force thee to give it good entertainment

others god

first because sinne is gods enemie
every lust hath in it the seed of rebellion and as it increaseth so rebellion increaseth

secondly because the same grieveth him as which opposeth his mercy truth patience love and every thing else in him

if we must not doe that which will grieve our earthly parents much lesse that which grieveth the god of heaven

thirdly because he enjoyneth us to performe this dutie whose commandements doe not admit of a dispensation yea binde our consciences and impose upon our soules

a necessity of doing what he commands

christ

whose death through our sinfull lusts is despised his worke of redemption vilified his most precious blood troad under foot and himselfe as it were pull'd downe from heaven and crucified afresh

the spirit

who is hereby extreamly both tempted grieved and quenched yea forced to withdraw it selfe as it were and to forbeare those comfortable operations which it did once worke for our good insomuch as at length wee shall have no feeling of it and scarce bee able to discerne

whether it bee in us at all yea or no

the holy angels

who rejoycing at the conversion of sinners doe therefore grieve at their impenitencie

the saints departed

as whose consummation of blisse is through us hindered for if wee belong unto god they without us cannot be glorified if reprobates our sinnes must be ripe and come to the height ere everlasting judgements shall bee inflicted on us till which time neither can they be perfectly glorified

alive

as who grieve at our impieties mourne for the abominations by us committed

the wicked

first because they walke after their lusts

whose lives are not fit patternes for our imitation

secondly because through our wickednesse they will be the more encouraged to goe on in sinne as the israelites by the evill example of elies sonnes

to which purpose the lord by the prophet ieremiah

why trimmest thou thy way to seeke love therfore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy wayes

the creatures

as upon whom judgements are inflicted for mens sinnes and which being for our cause made subject to vanitie

groane for the day of redemption when they shall be delivered

from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god

may adde

the devill himselfe

as who shall thus displease him gods adversary and our most deadly enemy
yea else

notwithstanding of our outward profession our religion is but vaine

for hee is not a iew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a iew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit whose praise is not of men but of god
thus why the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof is to be encountred and so of the fourth particular

chap

after what manner the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof is to be encountred

as in temporall warfare so in this spirituall skill is no less requisit then strength

especially having to do with such a cunning deceitfull and subtile adversary as the flesh is who for the most part prevailes more by secret cunning then open force
experience also shweeth that our mightiest enemies have received

most notable foyles of the weakest christians but else carefull and skilfull in the use of their armour

now that wee may know how to warre against the flesh we are first to take notice how the flesh warreth against us
whereby we shall be the better enabled both to defend our selves and offend it

how the flesh warreth against us

this may be specified especially in three particulars

first

that somtime its manner of warre is covertly and under colour of vertuous affections that thereby wee may be intrapt at unawares
so did the flesh deceive both the daughters of lot

and the said unto the younger

our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that wee may preserve seed of our father
a goodly bait to draw on incest
not unlike was nabals answer unto davids messengers

there be many servants now adayes that break away every man from his master
shall then take my bread and my water and my flesh that have killed for my sheerers and give it unto men whom know not whence they be agreeable hereunto was the ground of ahabs desire of naboths vineyard

give me thy vineyard said hee unto him that may have it for a garden of herbs because it is neere to my

house and will give thee for it a better vineyard then it or if it seeme good to thee will give thee the worth of it in money
herein doth the flesh resemble harlots

as they garishly attire themselves that they may draw affections so doth fleshly concupiscence garishly adorne and paint over the things desired

that by their seeming beauty as paul speaketh of a cloke of covetousnes they may bewitch us

and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise shee took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and hee did eate
oh how glorious seems wealth to a covetous eye it is the

way to reputation

the best of defence from wrongs the only condition here on earth
oh how goodly things are high places honours and dignities in the eyes of the ambitious no vitious desires doe so insinuate themselves into natures as those which are coloured and cloaked with the shew of vertues
goliahs sword lay hid under an ephod

as much wickednes doth under the pretence of religion

secondly

that at other times it saineth flight that therby for the present it may draw us into its ambushes and for the time to come into carelesnes security presumption throwing our selves into

occasions of evill and the like

the flesh indeed may seeme to bee mortified as when the occasion is removed when it is not violent but quiet when it is removed but from one sinne unto another when through terror in the conscience it is restrained from desired acts and the like but herein putteth it tricks upon us

and as josuah by his flight from the inhabitants of ai

and the israelites from the benjamites getteth no small advantage against us

thirdly

that when it cannot prevaile against us by any of the former wayes then as a roaring lyon setteth it upon us with all its force yea and at some times so prevaileth

that the very best and strongest of gods children are for a time brought into very great straits as paul instanceth in himselfe in the seventh to the romans

adde hereunto that

it's not in jest with us

it doth not drouzily or unwillingly fight against us its at no time idle neither through delay or negligence letteth slip any opportunity wherby it may in any sort get the mastery
it's not partiall see king the mastery over this man but in the meane time willingly vanquished by another yea it useth no small discretion in its fight seasonably laying hold of all opportunities as time place company complexion age

and such like
thus how the flesh warreth against us

how wee are to warre against the flesh

it must be sincerely impartially discreetly cheerfully forcibly seasonably and constantly
sincerely

both in respect of the qualitie

and quantitie of those things which wee are to oppose

qualitie we are not to mortifie actions either naturall or indifferent we are not to oppose the motions of gods good spirit we are not to strive against the meanes of grace but against our sinful and fleshly lusts quantity we must not oppose one alone

but as well all as one for whosoever shall keepe the whole law and yet faileth in one point hee is guilty of

all for he that said thou shalt not commit adultery said also thou shalt not kill yea who so alloweth of one cannot but allow of others howsoever one sin is enough to damn any though there were no more

impartially

not mortifying or opposing one which haply we like not in the meane time entertaining another some bosome sin by us respected but equally behaving our selves towards all being content as abraham at gods command

to kill his beloved sonne to mortifie our best beloved sins our agags our darlings

saul thought he had done well in sparing agag having killed the poorer sort of amalekites but through his disobedience

his kingdome was rent from him

discreetly

first in opposing and striving against our darling sins and then in crucifying the rest
goliah being killed

the philistims quickly fled
ahab being wounded how easie was it to have discomfited his hoast

if david had beene killed according to achitophels good counsell then would all the people have returned in safety unto absolon
as therefore the aramites directed by their king did especially set themselves against ahab

so must wee against our beloved sinnes

he that would rid his ground of trees doth not lop them for they would grow againe

but diggeth them up by the rootes root wee up our best beloved sinnes so shall our others as branches of a fel'd tree quickly wither

cheerefully

as who thus doe but what god requireth of us by whom we shall be assisted in the performance of the same and whereby we shall receive no small benefit to our whole man yea get a particular assurance that we are christs for they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts

forcibly

as which will not be driven away without force and violence you may rate away your dogge by a few angry words
but what careth our

flesh for words in dealing with it wee must be void of compassion the more cruell the better
thus being cruell wee have compassion on our owne soules
the more we spare sinne the more hurt we our selves the more wee favour our lusts the lesse doe we favour our selves david would have had absolon kindly dealt withall

but ioab thrust him thorow
thrust we sinne thorow so shall we not need feare its future rebellion
deale we with sinne

as with old agues harshly and roughly till it be gone
deale we with our lusts as the of old with the beasts to bee sacrificed cut their throats and so offer them up in sacrifice unto god which indeed

will smell sweetly in his nostrils
old wounds must have corrasive plaisters
so sinne before it can bee done away
it's the cutting off of our right hands the plucking out of our right eyes
either must we put violent hands on the flesh with the lusts thereof or it will upon the sudden rush upon us

seasonably

herein delay is dangerous when corrupt inclinations do even begin to stirre then are they to be resisted opposed striven against wee must not give our lusts any time of truce any rest at all though at first they may be easily overcome afterward they cannot so be

a serpent the older it groweth the more venome

it hath as a lyon the greater strength
a staine the longer it continueth the hardlier can it be washed out
a tree the longer it standeth the hardlier can it be pluck't up thus it is with sin
the first motions thereto are like lyons whelps let them continue a while they will be as young lyons let them have liberty to get out at the tongue they will prove ramping and roaring lyons
we must not dally or delay we must not take its word or expostulate therewith we must not give it any respite but instantly lay the axe to the root of the tree

its no repentance to leave sinne when it leaveth us

or to give it over when wee can

commit it no longer we must not let it alone till it die it self but kill it whilst it might yet live

constantly

as who must still goe on in the worke of mortification

proceeding day by day and houre by houre without intermission from one degree to another
there's no businesse so much concernes us as this which is therefore to be set before all others we must follow it as the doth his labour day by day not making so much as one loytering day
this worke is never at an end
though wee should live methuselahs dayes yet might we still employ our selves herein
we weed our gardens

and are ever weeding

sins are ill weeds and grow apace our hearts are a to goodnesse a naturall mother to vice and therefore as in that fruitlesse so in this too too fruitfull
the captaine that batters the enemies sort a day or two

and then gives over gives the more courage to the enemie and loseth his labour
so is it if we warre not unto the end if wee continue not our course of mortification

if ioash had smitten the ground five or sixe times then had the aramites beene rooted out so if we would be constant in opposing our lusts they would at the length give over

as sampsons haire being cut off grew againe so will sinne if we doe not dayly

ly keepe it under
wee must not with the hypocrits mentioned by isaiah hang downe our heads like a bul rush for a day

but constantly persevere in the practise of this duty
thus after what manner the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof is to be encountred and so of the fifth particular

chap
vi by what meanes the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof is to bee encountred

it is not enough that a souldier have skill or know how to encounter his enemy but also he must be so provided of armour and weapons both offensive and defensive that hee be not constrained with shame and losse to turne his back in the day of battell
as therfore we have learnd how to encounter this our spirituall

adversary so are wee in like manner to take notice by what meanes the same may be encountered

the meanes are not

first to walke carelesly and securely till wee shall experimentally find our selves to be encountered hereby as dreaming belike that either because it doth not as yet assaile us it will not assaile us at all or because wee meddle not therewith it will not meddle with us

secondly to connive thereat for a time till we shall judge our selves to bee better fitted and prepared for the encounter

thirdly to consent thereto though but in shew as if thus

wee should be quickly freed therefrom

fourthly to put in execution any of those deeds of the flesh wherunto we have consented as if we should not be troubled with any more

fifthly to fulfill the desires of the flesh obey sinne in the lusts thereof and for a time goe so farre therein as the swinge of our corrupt heart would carry us as if our yeelding unto sinne would make us loath it and the tast of the pleasures of sinne in action did not increase our naturall thirst after iniquitie

but they are either extraordinary or ordinary

extraordinary

fasting and vowes whereby extraordinary sinnes especially

which possesse us as so many devils are expelled
have sworne and will performe it saith david that will keep thy righteous judgements

and againe

said will take heed to my wayes that sinne not with my tongue

with him also it was usuall to fast as in like manner it was with st paul

who accordingly chargeth husbands and wives not to defraud one another

except it be with consent for a time that they may give themselves to fasting and prayer

ordinary

consisting as in the avoiding of such things as may further our lusts so in the attaining of such as may represse the same

things to be avoided

excesse even in things lawfull

we must not goe to the utmost of them for if we doe it is a thousand to one we shall exceede from the utmost confines of lawfull liberty ther's but a small step to the border of unlawfull delights wherein how easily may a man fall that comes so nigh them

as he that would not fall into a ditch must not come nigh it and he that would not be drowned shunne even the rivers brinke so that we may not be drunke that we may not prophane gods sabbath that we may not be lascivious ambitious covetous or the like we are in respect of these outward things to abridge our selves of our lawfull

liberty being sparing in meat drink attire sports ease

sleep and the like
oh said david that one would give me drinke of the water of the well of bethlehem that is by the gate neverthelesse the same being brought such was his moderation that he would not drinke thereof but poured it out to the lord
the like was abrahams

in refusing the king of sodoms offer touching the spoile by him recovered
the like saint paul who had learned in whatsoever state he was in therewith to be content

knowing both how to be abased and how to abound every where and in all things instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need yea as excesse in

things lawfull is dangerous in respect of our selves

so it is also in regard of others as is implied in that of saint paul

but take heed lest by any meanes this liberty of yours become a stumbling blocke to them that are weake for if any man see thee which hath knwledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is week be emboldned to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy knowledge shall the weake brother perish for whom christ died wherefore if meat make my brother to offend will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest make my brother to offend
as therefore daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himselfe with the portion of the kings meat

nor

with the wine which he dranke so must wee resolve not to abuse our christian liberty

but so to rejoyce as though we rejoyced not and to buy as though we possessed not and to use this world as not abusing it

the approving liking

entertaining and harbouring the causes of our inordinate lusts and affections viz

ignorance

whereby we become alienated from the life of god

of which the lord by his prophet

my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge

pride when men think it a disgrace to shew forth the power of religion

the contrary whereof we read in king david

who would yet be more vile then he had seemed to michal and would

be base in his owne sight the same being before the lord and to set forth his praise

hardnesse of heart

a main cause of impenitency
but after thy hardnesse and impenitent heart saith saint paul treasureth up unto thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgement of god

carnall confidence

whereby man makes flesh his arme and trusts in it

infidelity

when men will not beleeve in god doe not perswade themselves of his perfection and as neither of his mercy truth or other his attributes

the occasions of sinne yea

the very appearance of evill
haply we may fall into an

occasion

as one sailing by sea meet with a storme or one travelling by land be assaulted by a robber but we must not seeke an occasion for he that willingly runs into danger deserves to pay for his rashnesse
even the priests were to abstaine from wine or strong drinke

when they went into the tabernacle of the congregation
and the nazarites

not onely to abstaine from wine and strong drinke but also they were to eat nothing that was made of the from the kernels even to the huske
to this end were the israelites as to eat unleavened bread seven dayes

so even the first day to put away leaven out of their houses
lest haply the having of it in their houses might have

beene an occasion to make them to break the commandment

so soone hath the heart given a secret consent to the defire of evill doing as it consents to adventure on the occasions of evill doing
the withdrawing of a mans selfe from these things is a pulling of the fuell from the fire as the adventuring upon them doth blow the coales and admister fuell also
those are divers as

evill company

depart from me ye evill doers saith david for will keepe the commandments of my god

enter not into the path of the wicked saith solomon and goe not in the way of evill men
and againe be not among

among riotous eaters of flesh as

a little before

he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of fools shall be destroyed
he himselfe found it by experience

his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father

evill places

by reason of the evill company as sodom unto lot

the judgement hall unto peter

pharaohs court unto joseph

ramoth in gilead unto jehoshaphat tavernes alehouses and unto many

tempting objects

as was barsheba to david the wedge of gold unto achan the painted beauty and garish attire of whores to many

good joseph

would not stay alone with his mistresse and holy david prayed

to turne away his eyes that he might not behold vanity
as in like manner

job made a covenant with his eyes

want of a calling

for those who have nothing wheron to imploy themselves the devill usually useth to set on work

want of diligence in ones calling

for a man is never in better temper then when by a conscionable walking in his calling he keepeth himselfe closest unto god



unwillingnesse to enter the lists with this our spirituall adversary which is indeed for the most part occasioned partly through the sense and feeling of our weaknesse

partly through the supposed

force and strength of our adversary partly through our feare of the foile and conceived impossibility that wee shall not prevaile partly through the paines and diligence which wee must use herein and partly being loath to forgoe the pleasures of sinne



lazinesse and cowardise security and carelesnesse as whereby this active and vigilant enemy receiveth more courage and in like manner more easily vanquisheth us

things to be attained


faith as which purifieth the heart over commeth the world and is a shield whereby we may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked yea whereby christ dwelleth in our hearts


love

if yee love mee saith our saviour keepe my commandments


feare

both of god and our selves god according to that of solomon

by the feare of the lord men depart from evill and that of saint paul

let us cleanse our selves from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit perfecting holinesse in the feare of god implied in that speech of abraham unto abimelech

thought the feare of god was not in this place and they will slay me for my wives sake and that of joseph unto his mistresse

how can doe this great wickednesse and so sin against god

our selves

as where by we shall keepe on our harnesse have our weapons in readinesse

bee alwayes on the for the discovery of our approaching enemy yea this feare will make us distrust our selves deny our selves renounce all carnall confidence in our selves and be the cause of our safety
thus alwayes fearing shall be alwayes blessed

pendleton the proud cowardly yeelds and forsakes christ making shipwracke of a good conscience whereas on the contrary fearfull sanders stands for the truth sacrificing his life for the same in the midst of the fire



fervent and frequent prayer unto god at set times as at other times upon occasion of some idle thought tempting object or evill motions unto

sinne frequent ejaculations or short meetings with god both are of dayly and continuall use and will prove no lesse usefull unto us then they must be usuall with us

as nehemiah by occasion of king artaxerxes his question why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart secretly prayed to the god of heaven was graciously heard
so being fearfull of our lusts

afraid of our naturall inbred corruption if we doe but pray unto god through christ questionlesse we shall be comforted yea may truly affirm that hereby especially we are daly kept from the execution of our corrupt and evill inclination
whoso

cannot pray

neglecteth prayer or prayeth not in faith is at all times under the dominion of sin in bondage sla· very to his lusts daily runing into the very excesse of riot



a daily renuing of our covenant with god and that both in respect of our outward members and inward affections calling every of them as it were to an account and both shewing them wherein they have violated their allegiance unto god and directing them how to oppose the flesh and conform themselves to gods will



wisdome in the constant practice of the contrary to that evill whereunto we are incited as to strengthen a crooked staffe it must be bent backwards

thus being tempted to gluttony we must fast to covetousnesse be liberall to intemperancy be sober to revenge love our enemies to prodigality be thrifty and so in other particulars

walking in the spirit that we may not fulfill the lusts of the flesh

this is to crosse and thwart our fleshly inclinations which abates corruption and blunts the point even of satannicall temptations
neither will it be amisse at some times to turne away the bent of affection to another object though haply not the contrary as who must be brought on by degrees so far to deny our selves and curbe our corrupt nature as to do the very contrary unto that it commandeth yea

herein also shall we manifest our wisdome in subduing our lusts

and preventing sinnes to come if we doe punish our selves by fasting giving to the poore or otherwise for sins already committed


watchfulnesse

as well over our inward affections as outward members as well over the motions that arise within as the words deeds that come forth
this is to consider our owne wayes

a looking to our hearts eyes eares tongues hands feet and whole man
this is to marke what we think say and do whether we goe to what end by what warrant and upon what calling
this is to keep the heart and so the whole man with all diligence
hereby shall wee exactly know what corruptions

we are troubled with

what things hurt us what doe help us whether we grow stronger or weaker whether corruptions decay or increase whether our soule fareth well or ill
had david beene watchfull over his eyes

when he beheld bathsheba he had not with her committed adultery had he been watchfull over his eares

when he heard ziba's treacherours report he had not so rashly condemned innocent mephibosheth had he been watchfull over his heart

he would not have so vented the pride thereof in bidding joab goe number the people

had lot been so watchfull as he should his daughters had not so couzned him

had peter not beene too

confident of his own strength he had not denied his master when we presume most of our own strength

then are we in most danger when we are most distrustfull most suspicious of our selves then are we in most safety

the more gates a city hath the more wayes the enemy may enter the more windowes a house hath the more wayes may a thiefe breake thorow and therefore the more care and watchfulnes is required for prevention
our little city hath store of gates our house store of doors and windows we must therefore be watchfull over them lest ruine come upon us ere we be aware


spirituall joy and gladnes

in the worship and service of god and the things which concerne his glory when the soule rejoyceth in god it opposeth whatsoever displeaseth him

when wisdome entreth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soule discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee to deliver thee from the way of the evill man from the man that speaketh froward things to deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with her words
protest by our rejoycing

which have in christ jesus our lord saith paul die daily


spirituall and holy medition that
of gods nature


of gods word
of christs sufferings
of heaven it self

gods nature

that he is not a god that hath pleasure in wickednesse neither shall evill dwell with him
the foolish shall not stand in his sight he hateth all workers of iniquity

that the ways of man are before the eys of the lord and he pondreth all his goings

that there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight all things being naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to doe

who will render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in seeke for glory honour immortality and eternall life
but unto them that are contentious and doe not obey the truth but obey unrighteousnes indignation and wrath
this is the will of god

even your sanctification and therefore

as he which hath called you is holy

so be ye holy in all manner of conversation

gods word

as being the power of god unto salvation quick and powerfull and sharper then any sword

piercing even to the dividing asunder of soule and spirit and of the joints and marrow a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
gods sword which doth most wound satan and kill the body of sinne which in like manner through the assistance of gods spirit shaketh the very foundation of mans corruption
doth it incite us unto covetousnesse what saith the word

the love of money is the root of all evill which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith

and pierced themselves thorow with many sorrows unto whoredome what saith the word

whoremongers and adulterers god will judge
unto wrath and envy what saith the word

wrath killeth the foolish man and envy slayeth the silly one unto falshood what saith the word lying lips are abomination to the lord

unto drunkennes what saith the word

who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath contentions who hath babling who hath wounds without cause who hath rednesse of eyes they that tarry long at the wine they that goe to seeke mixt wine unto theft what saith the word

thou shalt not steale
the like might be instanced in every other particular

besides the word containeth a twofold catalogue the one of blessings for the penitent the other of judgements for the impenitent
moses in the
of deuteronomy laying downe as it were a briefe of both as more briefly saint paul unto the romans

tribulation and anguish upon every soule of man that doth evill of the jew first and also of the gentile
but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile
the due meditation of either with the certainty as well of the one as the other serving not a little to further us in our mortification

christs sufferings

an especiall furtherance unto mortification

for as much then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh saith saint peter arme your selves likewise with the same minde for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god
hereof the same apostle informs us in the second chap
who his owne selfe saith he bare our sinnes in his owne body on the tree

that we bring dead to sinnes should live unto righteousnesse

heaven

who so looketh for christ from heaven cannot but lead an heavenly life for our conversation is in heaven saith saint paul from whence also we looke for the saviour

the lord jesus christ
so unto titus

teaching us that denying ungodlines and worldly lusts

we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour iesus christ
thus moses
hee chused rather to suffer affliction with the people of god

then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproch of christ greater riches then the treasures in egypt for hee had respect to the recompence of the reward

finally that wee may indeed mortifie our lusts deale wee with them as ioseph did with his mistris and pharaoh with the israelites
for ioseph


being tempted by his

mistresse to lye with her

he gave her at the very first a flat deniall


hee yeelded sufficient reasons for his refusall as well in respect of his master her selfe as god


though shee spake unto him day by day yet hearkned not he unto her to lie by her or to be with her


when being occasionally alone in the house with him shee had caught him by his garment saying lye with me he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out

so being tempted by our lusts and entised

doe we flatly refuse to yeeld unto them render we also reasons of our refusall that therby they may appeare the more unreasonable

as from the duty which wee owe unto god the injunctions which wee have received of him the variety of blessings whereof through his blessing wee are dayly made partakers
the unexpressable joyes in heaven laid up for mortifi'd persons the severity of gods justice to be showne on the impenitent the filthinesse and pollution of sin with sundry the like
but if yet they will not bee gone supposing to weary us with their importunity wee must bee as resolute in refusing as they in urging even stopping our eares at their insinuating perswasions
yet if at any time having some advantage they make use of it and lay hold on us leave wee

our garments with them and get us gone rather then they shall force us to yeeld and to become defiled be wee content to forgo goods good name friends yea our very lives that wee may bee presented chast virgins unto christ

for pharaoh

he made the israelites

bondslaves


hee wisely compassed their destruction in the death of their children when they were first borne


hee commanded that the should be drowned
so

make we bondslaves of our lusts as which then will quickly be gone from us


do we wisely compass their death

even at their very conception at the furthest

their birth being then weaker then afterward crushing the viper in the very shell not suffering the same to come in though knocking at the dore of our hearts


cast them in the sea drowning them by the teares of true repentance

object
obj
but may some say here's a great stirre indeed much about nothing
god thank thee

that am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers
finde not my selfe troubled with evill motions and fleshly lusts as are others never had such evill thoughts or have been at any time assaulted with strange temptations as such and such complain themselves to have beene doubt not

but that may spare the pains that are heere required and doe well enough

an&sw ans
thy condition is not unlike unto his

who being desperately sicke is notwithstanding perswaded that hee is in good health or the fool's which conceiveth himselfe to excell in wisedome
the more insensible thou art of thy lusts and of thy spirituall bondage under them the more art thou in bondage unto them the more is thy whole man under their slavery

naturally wee are in respect of other mens corruptions but purblind in respect of our owne being hereof even willingly ignorant

whom the divell hath once captivated and

marked for his owne he suffereth to walke according to their hearts desires not troubling them as it were any further as being already his owne in full possession

neither indeed careth he which way he bring men under provided hee may in thrall them one way or other

unlesse thou oppose thy corruption and use the meanes here prescribed for the killing of thy lusts undoubtedly they will in the end kill thee and bee the everlasting destruction both of thy body and soule

ob
but thus should here live uncomfortably obj
as even those doe which notwithstanding truly endevour to mortifie their lusts according to the rule of gods word


it's only at some times an&sw not at all times as especially when they doe first begin to mortifie their lusts or god is pleased to visit them by some great crosse or temptation

mortification hath in it indeed paine and sorrow sin having a strong heart and so not soone killed the same sticking as fast in our nature as a tooth in our head or our soule to our body which will not be driven away without force and violence

though weeping may be in the evening

joy commeth in the morning though our afflictions are many

yet doth the lord deliver us out of them all

the sunne is somtimes eclipsed sometimes darkned by clouds wait a little while it will shew it's

light
our life seemeth uncomfortable it will not bee long ere we shal abound with comforts
imagine we that any of us should fall

and thereby breake a leg or an arme though in respect of the pain we could wish our selves in a manner out of the world yet being well set and carefully drest and dayly growing more more in strength we live in comfort that all shall be well we are contented to sow in teares

even to indure the painefull dressing thereof that we may reap in joy by enjoying the use of the same as aforetime
not unlike is our condition in this world but much more comfortable as being more certaine

this world is not

our place of mirth and in us sorrow must needs precede joy

verily verily say unto you saith our saviour that yee shall weepe and lament but the world shall rejoyce and ye shall be sorrowfull but your sorrow shall be turned into joy

ob
but if through christ we obtaine salvation obj
what need wee taske our selves to this duty of mortification why may wee not live as wee list


because christs sufferings are available unto no other an&sw but such as mortifying their lusts and affections live religiously and holily

because it's the voyce of christ himselfe

if any man will come after me let him deny himselfe

and take up his crosse dayly and follow mee


that hee gave himselfe for us that hee might redeeme us from all iniquitie and purifie unto himselfe a peculiar people zealous of good works

ob
but many have heere in this world used divers and sundry meanes to bring their body under as by watching obj
fasting scourging of themselves going and barelegged many miles together who notwithstanding have had no comfort here in the assurance of gods favour neither by all likelihood shall see the face of god with comfort hereafter

it's no wonder an&sw
because mortification as it consisteth not of some of those externall

shewes of at all

as to weare scourge ones selfe goe on pilgrimage and the like so it consisteth not wholly in the others watching fasting and the like but especially in the crucifying of the inward lusts and affections which doe even reigne and domineere in them

because they perswade themselves that by those they doe merit at the hands of god the forgivenesse of their sinnes with life everlasting then which what can more crosse their present and future well being
because god hath thus in justice dealt with such sorts of persons from time to time

even that by forsaking the fountaine of living waters

they should dig unto themselves rotten cisternes

ob obj
but the wickednesse of my heart is such the inordinate lusts and affections proceeding therefrom so many that know not either how to avoid such things as are to bee avoided or attaine such things as are to be attained for the constant performance of this dutie so hard whorish crooked blind proud covetous rebellious and stubborne is this heart of mine that dayly to my great disquiet and no small vexation am tempted to innumerable evils yea often times so strange monstrous and unnaturall that do even tremble thereat

neither can be free therefrom in any place

at any time or in any condition the same even at prayer in the church at the publique or private reading the word bending its forces against me to withdraw my mind from gods service and subject the same to its slavery so that what to doe or what course to take that those motions may not be turned into actions am even at my wits end

thy condition is such an&sw as doth even befall the dearest saints of god here on the earth the lord in wisedome suffering those thornes of the flesh to remain in them for their further humiliation yet are they not to bee contemned though usuall in the saints but by all meanes to

be opposed abhorred loathed encountred wee must not feede them either by meditation or occasion our hearts being of a disposition whom a very spark of opportunity inflames and sets all in a combustion
now the meanes

whereby as well the former meanes become unto us effectuall as our dayly lusts how great soever kept under and further and further weakned proceed not indeed from our selves though dayly shewing their efficacie in us but from the good spirit of god
through the spirit doe wee mortifie the deeds of the flesh

as saint paul implieth
no man can mortifie sinne unlesse by the spirit

as no man by ordinary

means vanquish a strong armed man without weapons
we are as able with our little finger to shake the foundation of the earth as to shake off one sin by our owne strength

pavl may plant apollos water but god alone giveth the increase though our hearts were never so willing and our paines in subduing our lusts both continuall and extraordinary yet if the spirit doe not accompany us all is nothing worth as through whom alone the meanes are blessed and worke together for the best unto us

que&st

but hovv doth the spirit worke towards the mortifying of sinne

an&sw
by detecting and discovering

sinfull thoughts and actions

by stirring up an hatred of them and griefe for them

by kindling fervent prayer to get strength against them

by bringing to mind sentences of the word which are as a sword to cut downe sin

by making us watchfull against sinne to avoid all occasions of it and use all sanctified meanes against it

que&st seeing the assistance of the spirit is of such absolute necessity

what means are there to be used for the obtaining of the same

an&sw
some things are by us to bee avoided as others to bee performed

things to bee avoided


resisting the spirit as did the

iewes

yee have alwayes resisted the spirit saith st stephen as your fathers have done so do yee
this is when men by arguments reasons and ocular demonstrations laid before them are convinced in their consciences of the truth yet knowing that they are truth will notwithstanding set downe their resolution not to doe it


grieving the spirit that is the commission of any thing that makes the spirit to loath the soule


quenching the spirit that is carelessnesse in the using of the means of grace whereby the spirit is increased or not cherishing the good motions thereof in the practice of such duties as the spirit moveth us to doe

things to bee performed


we must out of a sense and

feeling of our owne weaknesse acknowledge our inability either in abstaining from that which is evill or performing that which is good

we must get an assured knowledge of the excellencie of the spirit and allsufficient operation herein

wee must even hunger and thirst for the spirit

we must by continued prayer bee earnest with god to bestow him upon us as is manifestly implyed in that of our saviour

if yee then being evill know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that aske him
wee must cherish every good motion of the spirit in our hearts either

to pray or to heare or to meditate or to praise god not suffering the same to lie without practice thus by what meanes the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof is to be encountred and so of the
particular

motives or encouragements unto this spirituall combat

as the weapons of our warfare are not carnall

but mighty through god to the pulling downe of strong holds so fight we not as uncertainly

not as beating the ayre but in the assured and certaine hope of a glorious and fruitful victory

many are the arguments whereby a soldier may bee stirred up to fight desire of revenge fidelity to his king and countrey

love to his captaine and an ambitious desire of honour feare of present danger and future shame if the enemy be not resisted the equity of the cause ignorance of the enemies strength and forces an enemies weaknesse and cowardise remembrance of former victory with sundry the like but with most this is the main even the love of gaine the hope of an ensuing rich booty probability of a goodly spoyle the very same is the christian soldiers condition
many motives we have to induce us to mortifie our concupiscene whether habituall or actuall

the flesh with the inordinate lusts and affections thereof as have already shewed at large but not any

allureth us more if so much then the hope of profit an assured expectation of many rare sweet excellent and comfortable fruits ensuing heereupon
to this end let me here offer a brief of them unto your view



we obtaine unspeakable peace and quietnes of soule even that peace of conscience that passeth all understanding

being at warre with our corruptions we are at peace with our own soules yea most friends to our selves when we are most foes with our corruptions
as warre abroad

is found to be a present remedie against civill dissentions of subjects so warre with sinne is the cause of our tranquillity with our selves
a bloody warre doth

often occasion a settled peace by warring against our lusts wee reape this benefite
did wee consider that nothing causeth the god of heaven to srowne upon man but sin that he is a consuming fire

and an everlasting burning that it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living god that a wounded spirit none is able to beare

that with the ungodly even the stones of the field as in like manner all other creatures are at variance would wee harbour within us any thing that might displease god would wee not cut off if it were our right hand and pluck out our right eye yea part with our very lives at his command

how much more war against our earthly members

thereby to be reconciled to him did we but consider the excellencie utility sweetnes and worth of peace whether outward or inward spsrituall or corporall with our selves or others god or man wee would not thus serve our lusts and pleasures we would scorne to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season we would willingly renounce if it were the whole world rather then deprive our selves thereby of gods favour and the comfortable fruits of the same
doe we warre against our lusts we are not at war with our maker
warre wee against our lusts our soules dwell at rest our consciences void of terror amazement disquietment
crucifie wee

the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof wee shall have little or no leisure to take causlesse unkindnesses to pick needlesse quarrels and to provoke others against us by our injurious carriages yea

our wayes thus pleasing to god even our enemies shall become our friends



wee have daily experience of gods powerfull presence accompanying us whereby even we of our selves poor silly weak creatures doe maintaine warre against such potent adversaries yea further and further grow upon them and put them to the worst
what made the iudges whom god raised up to defend his people to fight so valorously against the enemy but the certainty they had

that god went along with them doth not the captain of the host of the lord still accompany us to fight for us

by the lord have not wee run through a troup and by our god leaped over a wall doth not god gird us with strength and make our way perfect maketh he not our feet like hinds feet and setteth us on high places teacheth not hee our hands to warre so that a how of steele is broken with our armes and should we not then be encouraged to fight

is it not wonderfull that such weake and silly creatures as wee are should so prevaile over sathan that powerfull prince of darknesse as not to yeeld to the smallest motion of sinne with pleasure but as the

marriners of the sea by pumping cleare the ship of the water

it draweth lest by the neglect therof the same further and further encreasing the ship should sinke but earnestly to oppose it expelling the same partly by not yeelding thereunto or if upon the sudden wee yeeld by repenting thereof and refusing to yeeld obedience therunto yea doing the contrary with pleasure and thanksgiving to our gracious god through whom wee are thus inabled in some measure to subdue our lusts oh the joy and gladnesse abounding in our hearts when our god strengtheneth our hands to war by degrees to overcome those invvard beasts serpents

cockatrices young lyons and dragons

assure my soule that iael rejoyced no more in taking the smiths hammer and therewith fastning a naile in sisera's temples

and david in cutting off goliahs head with his owne sword then the people of god boast of gods power and rejoyce in his name vvhen they overcome the wicked one by quenching his temptations which are like fiery darts to slay the soule they rejoyce say in that power of god inabling them like iudah as bold as lyons to resist their enemies

and defend their right

when others like issachar couching under burdens are slaves unto sathan and their owne lusts

somtimes indeed the saints are wounded and blacked with these fiery darts

but they are never wholly nay even from hence doe they through gods goodnesse reap no small advantage

have they lien among the pots they rest not till they be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her fethers with yellow gold
find they themselves in any sort defiled they run to the fountaine opened to the house of david for sinne

and for uncleannesse
yea as great soldiers when their blood is once drawn are the more inflamed with desire of revenge so are they further incouraged unto a swift pursuit of sathan that they may bruise his head and of themselves to take an holy

revenge for their security and negligence in suffering the presence of god which is to them as the nazarite haire unto sampson to bee taken from them
doth sathan watching his time take them at unwares as the philistims shaved off sampsons locks whilst hee was asleepe

doe they at any time fall through lack of circumspection through grace they lay the same to heart and so redouble their forces that they may overcome and tread downe that prince of darknesse

being perswaded that the god of peace shall bruise sathan under their feet shortly
through grace do they profit by their haltings not to halt any more being carefull in the meane time

that their haltings may bee healed

therefore lift they up the hands that hung downe and the feeble knees and make strait steps for their feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way
they learne wisedome by experience as david did when he perceived the falshood of saul his father in law he ever suspected him thereafter and laboured alwayes to avoid those snares which hee laid for him

and samson when he took the dores of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them prevented the treachery of the philistims by whom once before he was deluded which laid wait all night for him in the gate of the citie gods saints say by their holy

feare watchings experience of sathans deepnes and their owne vveaknesse learne to be more circumspect
oh the loving kindnes of god

vvho hath reveiled all the wiles of leviathan the peircing and crooked serpent his cruelty his importunity his vvatchfulnesse the divers vvayes whereby hee hideth the nature of sinne that the bitternesse thereof be not discovered as also the naughtinesse of our owne hearts ready at all times to give him entertainement if through his goodnes we did not watch over the same with all diligence
what a good god have wee who not only fighteth for us but also advertiseth us of all the enemies of our salvation

much vvas the king of israel obliged to the prophet of god

for revealing unto him the king of arams purposes against him

as vvhereby he did more then once avoid the danger but much more are vve to our gracious god for reveiling unto us by his faithfull embassadors sathans manifold guiles vvho is at all times and in every place and with every lust ready to deceive us standing at our right hand to bee our adversarie yea for our sakes fiercely rebuking him

and the lord said unto sathan the lord rebuke thee sathan even the lord that hath chosen ierusalem rebuke thee js not this a brand pluckt out of the fire though wee at some times feare to be

overcome though wee may doubt that vve are indeed overcome though vve may be as it were at the very last cast even ready to faint and give over yet through the power of god are wee so preserved that not any shall pluck us out of his hands yea

as the dew revives the withered herbs the meditation of foregoing comforts shall so revive us that our youth shall bee renewed like the eagles
oh for pitty

that our god should thus by his powerfull presence accompany us and out of his affectioned love towards us be ever arming us by his counsels comforts exhortations threatnings and yet that wee should at any time give place to the divell in making

provision for the flesh

to accomplish the lusts thereof


no small glory doth redound unto god

he that made the withered stick of aaron to bring forth fresh flourishing almonds

and made the poore mans withered hand to become whole

to the glory of his name and in like manner opened the eyes of the blinde

even the same powerfull god by our dayly mortification and the subduing the remainder of corruption wherewith we are diseased defiled wounded getteth glory to himself as who not only forgiveth our iniquities

but likewise healeth our infirmities
to vvhat end were wee created but to set forth the glory of god delaying to mortifie our lusts

we delay the performance of that duty for which we came into the world

would wee but consider that howsoever sathan with his adherents hath done vvhat in him lieth to hinder us from the remission of our sinnes from renovation in christs blood from sanctification of the spirit as in like manner he hath gone about to hinder the power of the word and blessing powred upon the sacraments and the blessing that accompanieth the sanctified fiery fornace of affliction out of which the children of god come like purified gold yea and would hinder deaths sting to be taken away and so us from lying downe void of sinne pure chast virgins for christ and

yet that hee is letted in every of those his designes would we by denying to mortifie our lusts thus rob god of his glory

as the men of iabesh gilead answered nahash the ammonite requiring that he might thrust out all their righteyes and lay it for a reproch upon all israel
give us seven dayes respite that we may send messengers into all the coasts of israel and then if there bee no man to save us we will come out to thee
so might we sathan endeavouring by his continued and reiterated temptations to draw us unto sinne that if we should not be succoured we were unable to withstand him

but as they were delivered on the seventh day so inasmuch as herein sathan aimeth at the eternall

reproch of our gracious god and of his deare sonne iesus christ and holy spirit with the shame of the holy angels our attenders and our owne who are the israel of god seeking to pierce our soules and bodies thorow with the speace of sinne

as saul cast a speare at david to have nailed him to the wall
our gracious god who is jealous of his owne glory will undoubtedly by inabling us to oppose this our spirituall nahash and our sinnes his ammonits thus glorifie himselfe
his head is already broken in the person of our saviour at sundry times also he hath had notable foiles given him by christs members being no more able to prevaile against them then goliah

against david the egyptions against the israelites the canaanits against ioshua and his successors what remaineth but that we should still continue the warre untill in the full and finall mortification of our lust to the everlasting praise of gods glory hee be trod under foot as naamans servants unto him

my father if the prophet had bid thee done som great thing wouldst thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash and be cleane so may unto you
if the lord would for the glory of his owne name require us to part with our goods good name lives yea even the salvation of our soules we ought willingly to assent thereunto much more when for our further and

more co~fortable fruition of those requireth us but to mortifie our lusts


through our remnant of corruptions mortified by grace

wee obtaine continuall feare through sense of continuall weaknesse on our owne part for certaine it is that if the lord should leave us but for a time the very smallest temptation were of force to overcome the strongest christian

the least fiery dart of sathan which hee taketh out of his owne quiver being indeed extreamly venimous crooked and deceitfull
the wine that noah drunke deceived him who notwithstanding was not purposely excessive therein
hee had strength no doubt to have overcome a stronger temptation

if god had not left him for a season what a meane temptation was davids looking on bathsheba the damosels questioning of peter dalilahs feigned teares unto samson the sins confesse in which the saints fall thereby as also the dishonour of gods name and the churches dammage through the same bee not small yet the lord that brought light out of darknesse

doth even hereby worke for the good of others as who learn from the same that even the best are unable to stand by themselves and that if even the strongest sort of gods giants bright shining starres in the firmament of god have notwithstanding now and then slipt yea fallen into grosse and great sins

they themselves weake babes in comparison of the other must be somuch the more watchfull over their owne wayes working out their owne salvation with feare and trembling

they are daily practised in the work of mortification doe not with cham and shemei scoffe or raile at the falls or miseries of the saints neither with the filthy flies feed upon the sores of the beast leaving his whole parts

neither as those that vvould goe into a chyrurgions shop and take a profitable instrument seruing to the cntting away of dead flesh and therewith kill themselves doe they enter into the great book of gods scriptures so wresting every thing that the word of life becommeth unto

them the savour of death and christ a stone of ease to his own

a precious stone and a sure foundation becommeth unto them a stumbling stone and a rock of offence and the threatnings of the word which to the godly are terrours to terrifie them and are said in the proverbs to be the corrections of the lord

are scoffed at and counted but winde

an eccho or sound of an hill but taking notice of their owne corruption and how easily they themselves may be thereby intrapped they walke warily alwayes taking heed lest they also fall
oh how many out of the faults of others gather poyson and not honey with samson out of the lyons belly

the iewes in the dayes of christ justified themselves

in comparison of those on whom the towre of shilo fell but were willed of christ in like manner to repent
others have fallen how soone may wee he that thinketh he standeth

must take heed lest hee fall
too too many there are which imitate the falls of the saints

as sauls after the evill example of his master did in the like manner slay himselfe

as saul killed himselfe with his sword wherewith he had foughten against his adversaries

so are there not a few which use the falls of the saints as swords to run their soules thorow falling by their example as though god would be as mercifull to them in their presumptuous fearfull falls as to

those who fell through the violent flood of forcible and suddaine temptations or as though it lay in their hands to repent as those extraordinary persons who had extraordinary repentance given them of the almighty that they might be examplars of repentance hereof though the wicked make these ill uses or rather abuses yet are gods children like good husbands

they profit alwayes both by the vertues of the saints and their infirmities as good husbands will make good use even of dongue
they learne say hereby to worke out their owne salvation with feare and trembling

they learne also to take heed they fall not when they suppose themselves to stand yea they

also see a thousand infirmities in themselves which they would never have marked if both they themselves had not fallen in some and observed to have fallen in the like


we obtaine hereby a passage to slay our outward and actuall sinnes

for when the cockatrice is crushed in the shell how shall it come to be a fiery flying dragon

when the leakes of the ship are stopped and the water which came in thereat emptied out how shall it sinke and if the defects of an house be repaired it cannot ruine

it is much more easie to quench the first sparkles of fire then vvhen they have increased into great flames
through curbing our inbred

corruption we prevent many actuall rebellions

let wee the fire burn within even give way unto our inbred lusts how well soever vve looke to the outside impossible it is but that the flame vvil burst forth in some one or other fleshly lust

for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and the corruption that is in the world is through lust

object
they that outvvardly lead a good life cannot but be well reformed

an&sw
if indeed their life be truly good comming like good fruit from a good tree then as the same is pleasing and acceptable to god so doth it necessarily imply the hearts reformation but being onely

good in appearance and show the sundry sorts of vertues wherewith it is covered or rather hypocritically coloured doe but make the same more detestable to god
when the fountaine is polluted

can the streams be wholsome because the apples of sodom are outwardly goodly and beautifull must it needs follow that they are not dust within because the scituation of a citie is pleasant

must it needs therfore be granted that the water is not naught or the land barren who will call the froth of the sea good for the whitenesse thereof or a foule wall pleasant because overcast with lime or a faire though farded all over where there is inward

sanctification there is indeed outward reformation but this without that is meerely counterfeit in which regard worse is by farre the condition of hypocrites then that of atheists as to whom many woes belong

woe woe woe with a witnesse


we shall have lesse to doe in the end of our journey

if all our dayes we be breaking up our fallow ground
oh how comfortable is this if wee would duely weigh it in the just ballance of the sanctuary if we have from time to time taken a particular accompt of our own wayes

if we have at the least twice every day censured the false deceitfull treacherous heart and her dolefull traine of earthly members

if we have arraigned the traitor and her followers the eye the eare the tongue the hand the foot if wee have demanded them in gods steed whether they have beene all the day gathering or scattering for god or against him upward or downward glorifying god or dishonouring him at home working in our fathers service or wandring with dinah from our fathers house

when the answere comes as in the presence of god it will either be accusing or excusing or deceiving if wee be not the more circumspect and jealous over our selves upon consideration of deceitfulnesse or
now we as said before being in the roome of of god must give and pronounce

a right and just sentence

every day and night for as it is with them that justifie the wicked

and condemne the righteous both are abomination to god so to condemne our selves that day when gods spirit hath bin working with us in every good worke and dutie though on our part in great weaknesse and infirmitie as well in abstaining from evill as performing of that which is good is no small injury to god as vvho hereby hides his manifold benefits bestowed upon us and thus either in censuring the dispensation of his grace because it is not according to our wishes or according to our sense and feeling or as we have received of his majestie in times past

or as others receive or not acknowledging the same with thanksgiving

thus say to judge our selves as it is dangerous so is it no lesse unprofitable neither furthers it our spirit in progresse to life eternall nor doth it provoke the good spirit of god to help us since his majestie getteth such an evill reward at our hand nor get we hereby our consciences pacified either yet obtaine our hearts desire
it were best then as is manifest by the light of the word and have found by experience deare bought to let our soules keepe silence to god and to thank his majestie every day for the least measure of grace

for indeed the least blast of the winde of the spirit is not onely

miraculous and above deserving but also above the highest measure of thanksgiving either in this world or in the world to come
let then murmuring depart and thanksgiving keepe her roome whereby we shall obtaine as greater peace of conscience so greater encrease of grace to gods both approbation and acceptation

againe

if after triall the conscience doth justly accuse us in such and such points of blemishes inwardly and outwardly unknowne to any in ward unknowne either to angels or devils outward unperceived even by the most judicious spirits for of grosse sinnes or such others as holy men of god would judge worthy of censure doe not now

speake wee are in no wayes to flatter or justifie our selves
in these blacks and blemishes would counsell thee poore soule not to flatter thy selfe but deeply to accuse thy selfe with great remorse
thus censuring thy selfe thus repenting for the sinnes of the day past yea the sinnes of thy best holiest and most zealous actions thou shalt goe to bed with the voice of joy and gladnes of praises and thanksgivings
after that thou hast felt and uttered that which ieremy speaks

it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions faile not they are new every morning thou liest downe with an assurance of pardon thou liest downe as it were without

sinne as who both grievest for thy sinnes committed and resolvest to lead a new life
hast thou performed this

joyfull will thy nights rest be unto thee god giving his beloved sleepe they certainly that have tasted this and of this wil say amen to it

but this tryall is yet to be abridged into a narrower roome

ere the evening come we may not onely forget the dayes wandrings as in like manner the good influences of gods goodnesse towards us but also wee may be many times hinder'd from this great necessary profitable and commendable triall what by our selves through sleepines and what by others it being likewise a maine policie of sathan

to make us put the same off from one time to another whence it commeth to passe that the worke becommeth more difficult this dongue requiring to be swept out every day and we unable to remember two or three dayes wandrings it is then most requisite for the good both of soule and body for the obtaining of that precious jewell tranquillitie of mind for the weakning and overthrow of the divels forces to turne dayes into houres as houres into minutes
if in praying reading conferring meditation hearing of gods word and the like wee be unfaith full

by the least delay of this and selfjudging sathan getteth too much advantage towards the

troubling of our tender consciences contrarily
if at all times in all places in all companies and upon every occasion out of our particular secret separate walking with god we shall take our selves to doe demanding of our selves as it were what we said what we thought whether we edified our selves and others whether wee glorified god or not whether we remembred our selves the church our end the great day our heavenly inheritance though but by one ejaculation or some pilgrims looks wee should quikly perceive the benefit much good would it worke to our selves and others
thus should we find vvhat good wee have received by others how we have been

affected with the company of the ungodly as whether wee have vexed our soules or not whether we have reproved sin with boldnes or failed herein in vvhat state our conscience standeth as whether or not wee have had mercy to keepe the same undefiled and the tendernesse thereof continued the same being in us both at home and abroad as a sweet companion
hereunto if we be attentive thus if wee doe employ our time gathering withall the good things vvhich wee have seene and heard abroad as in like manner making use of all good provocations to sharpen us though this sort of iron to sharpen iron is very rare the good which we shall reap hereby

by will much ease our soules and augment our spirituall treasure
thus if wee would doe will not boast or whisper that have exactly thus done yet others have with all their might endevored herein and mind through the assistance of gods good spirit so to doe unto the end of their christian race wee should thus doing get great aboundance of extraordinary christian joyes and ravishments as pledges or the earnest of the spirit given to us under the hope of the fulnesse of eternall joyes
if we have left off those glorious exercises not any wayes hindring either praying reading meditating or any other spirituall worke in the vineyard but rather

much furthering the same if say we have omitted them doe we blame our selves if vve have gotten dumb tongues in stead of open withered harts in stead of mollified dirt for gold blindnes for poverty of grace for riches beggerly cloathes for rayment of white linnen for a feasting a troubled conscience a shew of godlines for the power therof small mire and dew in place of great waters senslesnesse for watchfulnes and tender feelings
if this be thy state dolefull is thy change fearfull this desertion
thou must repent in time getting thy heart and endeavours inlarged mightily and sincerely renewing thy covenant with god vvhereby thou shalt at the length perceive

why the lord hath absented himselfe so long and againe enjoy his sweet presence and the glorious tokens of his affectioned love



we obtaine hereby a further further hatred of sin an higher and higher detestation thereof with all the severall sorts of the same
in the ceremoniall law the same was shadowed under leprosies uncleanissues uncleane birds beasts foules leprous garments as also by the uncleannesse of men and women

vvhosoever was defiled by any of those was to be purified from his uncleannesse
in the verity are all these figures accomplished let us cast off the work of darknes saith the apostle and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof

he saith not cast off the worke but the workes of darknesse not the lusts but the lusts of the flesh
so elsewhere hee saith not purge out one part of the old leven but purge out the old leven

that is every part the remnant crummes thereof like to that where he saith that may present you as a chaste virgin to christ

will the lord iesus look upon any uncleane person shall it bee perfected where it was not begun so the same apostle

put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is not a part of sinne but all the old garment thereof as men when they goe to bed put off all their cloaths or those that cast away an old ragged torne and worne garment whereof they are ashamed

and never intend to put on againe and put on that new man which after god is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse

even all the parts not one part alone of the garment we are to abstain even from all appearance of evill

and to bee so sanctified that our whole spirit and soule and body be presented blamelesse unto the comming of our lord iesvs christ wee must abstaine even from the garment spotted with blood

as the nethinims left not in the temple of solomon any uncleane thing not swept away so must every one of us be a spirituall nethinim in our owne soule to sweepe away all uncleannes yea the least idle thought

for it is not a king like solomon

that comes into this temple but one in every respect greater then solomon the soveraign of the whole world vvho neither will nor can abide any uncleannesse
his house

his bed his garden his tabernacle his temple a christian soule is all those cannot be too neatly and cleanly kept
deserveth not such a guest who is purer then the heavens and abideth not where impuritie is entertained deserveth not he say to dwell in a pure heart peculiar to himselfe yea so jealous he is that hee cannot indure that any other should come there and being the great high priest himselfe with the seven eyes cannot bee deceived with a shew of puritie but unlike

unto the jealous husband in numb knoweth both when how

and by whom his bed hath beene polluted
if our saviours first comming required preparation of his way in our hearts

and his continuall presence vvith us namely since he vvent to heaven and married us to himselfe

in mercie truth and compassion the like how then should we think to bee arrayed who are continually called to the marriage of the lamb if this standing continually by the preaching of the word and sacraments benefits promises corrections requireth such preparation deserveth not his last comming greatest preparation of all

when the elements shall be dissolved and the

earth burnt with fire which notwithstanding never sinned but was subjected to vanitie for our sinnes what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godlines alasse for pitty wee weigh not such counsels and directions prescribing us to cast away all our idols as rachel leah

and the family of iacob gave them to be buried ere ever they went to bethel
alas say and so may we all wee have journyed to gods bethel vvith our idols of abomination taking hold on the horns of the altar vvith hypocriticall adonijah

and bloody joab yea which is worse we think to come to the bethel of bethels gods holy house in heaven notwithstanding

we reserve yet some idols not cast away which are of us secretly vvorshipped putting as it were a wall betweene god and us as did the idolaters mentioned by ezekiel

if such were their secret how great think wee were their open abominations

strange policie of the prince of darknesse by whom thousands are brought through the wicked imaginations of their heart under that fearfull woe even who call evil good

and good evill that put darknes for light and light for darknes that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter how are they deceived with the false arrogant and perverse opinion of their owne heart about true repentance inward and outward

dreaming be like that actuall abstinence from actuall sinnes is sound and sincere repentance

what availed it herod to abstain from many actuall sinnes in the meane time retaining one idol his sinne of adultery or incest

what availed it the jewes to continue their sacrifices observe the new moones and sabbaths offer incense in the mean time living in hypocrisie could the lord away with the same were not both themselves and their whole worship abomination in his sight

neither is it enough to alledge the intention of the heart if in the meane time their conversation be sinfull

such wisedome commeth from beneath
he that abhors one sinne will abhorre all

and they that rightly have respect to one of gods commandements as they are gods commandements will have respect to them all as hee that breaks one breaks all for the commandements are so linked together that if one be broke all will dissolve except that one be repaired

and as they that broke one of the acts of the medes and persians though unrighteously decreed were put to death

and they that maintaine any one rebell

are accounted of as if they had maintained all the kings enemies as accordingly abimilech the priest with all his fathers house were slain by saul

for his supposed conspiracie with david in giving him of the and goliahs

sword and they that break any one statute are as well liable unto the kings censure as if they had broke them all

as shemei found by experience through his going out of ierusalem contrary unto solomons direction so are all those liable unto the severity of gods justice

which doe wittingly and willingly maintaine in themselves any one raigning bosome sinne
may not an house set on fire in any one part bee at the length burnt to ashes as well as if it had beene set on fire in sundry places will not one cord as well hang a thiefe as many may not saul be as really slain by his one one sword

as hee had beene if every philistim had given him a stab with a

severall one nay further may not a naile in the hand of iael as well destroy sisera

as baraks sword or speare could have done a stone out of a sling no lesse fell mighty goliah to the ground

then his owne sword cut off his owne head may not a man as well bee drowned in a pond or pit of water as in the middle of the ocean may yet descend lower
may not an haire throttle one a flie choke one a crum of bread occasion a mans death it is thus with sinne with every sin with the smal lest sinne even the least wandring thought the least idle word the smallest sinne if any can be so truely termed deserveth hell fire


we doe hereby attaine unto

a true hatred of sinne

not so much for the punishment thereof as for it selfe
for even reprobates though they hate not sinne as sinne or because it is a transgression of gods law yet may they hate it in respect of the punishment ensuing thereupon and so in outward appearance seeme haters of sinne
but sathan herein howsoever with the painter he draweth the colour of the fire yet cannot he paint the heat thereof

though his instruments seeme haters of sinne yet are they not so in truth but for by respects
they doe not hate sinne for sinne as the saints do in heart and outwardly testifie in word and deed

this precise mortification answers very prettily

to the figure of circumcision as all the was put away so will not the lord have any one sinne to remaine in his saints unmortified which they are not accordingly to oppose hate and persecute unto the death
this sort of true repentance as it is prophecied in the person of the penitent idolaters

so is it verily accomplished in all penitent sinners to whom our god makes all sinne and that for sinne so odious and detestable both inwardly and outwardly that they cast it away like a menstruous clout crying against their sinnes hence away in token of their extream indignation therat
we understand that the jews in signe of that inward hatred

that they had at our lord and saviour without a cause cried away with him away with him

we out of this should gather an infinite and endless hatred against sin

as through which our lord taking upon him our sinnes suffered all this
we must even so hate it as to cast it out to afford it no entertainment and from our very hearts to cry against it hence away away with it yea dayly and hourly to run unto god by prayer for the assistance of his spirit against the same

that if those pricks of the flesh may not wholly be removed and we wholly rid of this old man during our abode heere in this vale of misery

yet that sinne may not so reigne in our mortall bodies

that we should obey it in the lusts thereof

thus ye see that howsoever our good god is pleased to leave even in his dearest saints some dregs of corruption as the canaanites were left in the land

for the further triall of the israelites yet as out of the belly of the lyon samson had honey

so even out of them and in the dayly mortifying of them the saints gather no small store of fruitfull benefits and heavenly comforts sweeter then the honey and the
thus of the motives or encouragements which wee have unto this spirituall combat and so of the seventh particular

necessary caveats to bee observed in this spirituall encounter

as in temporall warfare it is ordinary for the generall of the army to direct his soldiers how to behave themselves in the battell

when where how and against whom to fight what weapons to use what courses to take to daunt the enemy how to discerne and make use of advantages against whom especially to bend their

forces how to prevent the enemies stratagems and so in other particulars no lesse requisite is this course in this our spirituall warfare

skilfull david may venture too farre to the endangering of his life

wary uriah may step into the forefront of the battell and fall when as another standing had been fitter for him

the captains of the king of syria may mistake jehosophat for ahab

amaziah may provoke iehoash to his owne overthrow

the israelites may so relye upon the arke of god comming amongst them as if assuredly they should bee saved from their enemies that as wel they themselves shall be vanquished as if taken by the enemie

benhadad with his two and thirty kings that helped him may be drunk

not dreaming in their jollity that an handfull of israelites shall vanquish both him them and their populous armies
thus may it befall us in encountering the flesh
caveats therefore being prescribed accordingly must wee follow our prescriptions

the caveats are these



wee must not through our worldly mindednesse or unnecessary employment of our selves about the things of this world be lets unto our selves in vanquishing our lusts as esav deprived himselfe of the blessing through his wearisome hunting

and the gadarens bad christ depart out of their bounds

and the wicked jewes caused god to depart frm the temple

how can those vanquish their lusts which doe not so much as to this end set the least time apart



wee must not cast away our armour or in any sort yeeld but still keep firme our confidence in god for if any man draw backe his soule shall have no pleasure in him

whereunto that of the psalmist agreeth
for loe

they that are farre from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that goe a whoring from thee



we must not apply unto our falls of infirmity such places of

scripture as are to be understood of theirs that sinned presamptuously as that of eli unto his sonnes

if a man sinne against the lord who shall intreat for him or such as are spoken of reprobates as that unto the hebrewes

it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift if they shall fall away to renew them againe unto repentance
and againe

if we sinne wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinnes but a certaine fearfull looking for of judgement and fiery indignation which shall devoure the adversaries
so that of peter

for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the

knowledge of the lord and saviour iesus christ they are againe entangled therin and overcome the latter end is worse with them then the beginning



we must prepare our selves for new contrary winds to hinder us in our spirituall sailing to heaven though already we have been assailed by divers neither must those so daunt us as that we are not to imitate christs disciples

who when through the vehemencie of the tempest their ship could not saile endeavoured notwithstanding to row
though wee cannot goe on in the course of godlines so swiftly as we would we must notwithstanding go on tho in a smaller degree



when wee perceive our selves to be over mastered by any temptation and even forced as a forced woman

then must we with thamar forced by deceitfull amnon in the privie chamber of our heart openly cry out against the devill with a penitent heart that the lord may avenge our quarrell

as absolon was stirred up to bee avenged of amnon



we must beware of the false bed of security and deceitfulnes of sin notwithstanding our experience of gods former presence lest any wayes delighting therein

wee bee driven to seeke christ but lose our labour
justly doth the lord punish this sinne of security by desertion then which what can be more

grievous to the saints grievous undoubtedly it was unto david

when being thus chastised he cryed unto god make me to heare joy and gladnesse that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoyce
cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold mee with thy free spirit
jonah was asleep but the stormy tempest and stinking belly of the whale awaked him
david was asleep but the sword awaked him
noah was asleep but chams scorning awaked him

in this bed lay the israelits but
years captivity awaked them
oh if wee could learne wisdome by their folly and their after repentance

stirre us up unto repentance if god thus punish his owne children for their securitie

what shall be the portion of the wicked that are in a dead slumber how sudden and strange how fearfull and terrible how horrible unutterable shall their wakening be such was cains achitophels pharaohs indasses sauls abimilecks belshazzars and divers others how fearfull they were here their ends shew how lamentable their last shal be when at the blast of the trumpet they shall rise out of their graves

that of the foolish virgins may declare woe woe woe wofull is their condition when they shall behold the terrible judge comming in flaming fire to render

vengeance unto all such as know not god

neither obey the gospel of our lord iesus christ
if the beginning of their sorrows be so terrible what will the end be who can expresse the the thousandth part of that which they shall then feele if their entrance into hell be so fearfull what are the fire worme blacknesse of darknesse perpetuall separation from god his angels and children and whatsoever might afford them any comfort then shall not we repent that god hath beene pleased heere to awake us by his gracious corrections and mercifull visitations out of the bed of securitie then shall our mouths bee filled with laughter for our deliverance out of the captivity

of babylon
then shall not we forget to sing our perpetuall hallelujah when we shall experimentally feele an actuall difference made between the wheat and the chaffe the gold and the drosse the good fishes and the bad the good ground and the evill the fruitfull tree and the barren the sonnes and the bastards the sheep and the goats the good figges and the rotten the womans seed and the serpents gods children and sathans
then shal we with one mind and voice blesse the glorious trinitie that as our wakening differed from the wickeds so also our portion
oh blessed bee our god

wee shall behold his face in righteousnesse and shall bee satisfied when wee awake with his likenes



wee must not thinke that all sins have the like proportion of labour in mortifying the greatest is to bee imployed about our inward inbred corruption as being our greatest and most deceitfull enemie opening the dore to all the rest

as when the gates of jerusalem were made open for nebuchadnezzar all his nobles servants and souldiers in like manner entred thereat ruining as well jerusalem it selfe as the temple of god which was the beauty thereof
so if our hearts shall once admit that cruell nebuchadnezzar the devill such a rout will also enter in that thereby as well the powers of the soule as body shall be captived and more hardly

used then those kings whom adonibezek kept in slavery

when this is by sathan misused defiled or polluted complaine wee unto god as gods people did of antiochus epiphanes for polluting their materiall temple

god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy temple have they defiled they have laid ierusalem on heapes
so shall wee finde that as antiochus notwithstanding of his power and craft was in gods good time severely punish'd his pride abated the pollutions of the temple clensed idolatry abolished images broke in pieces the blood of the saints revenged the temple and gloriously adorned so sathan shall bee

dispossessed and wee set at liberty

as christs entry into the temple of ierusalem was powerfull to the casting out of the buyers and sellers and overthrowing the tables of the and seats of them that sold doves so shall his entrance be into our soules to the ejection of sathan who hath stollen thereinto
then shall satan with greater shame be excluded together with the whole rabble or divellish host of wicked thoughts by him brought in

then azariah was shut out of the temple by the lords priests for presuming to offer incense in the house of the lord

oh shameles impudent spirit who hath beene thrust out of heaven

and compelled to depart

out of men whom thou hast possessed

and when we were dead in sinnes and trespasses wast through gods mercy cast out of us

and since the first time of our conversion art hated and abhorred of us and when the fiery flames of zeale and love were strong in us we speake it to gods glory hast beene often vanquished by us and beene forced to flie from us yea through the power of our pittifull god and his blessing on our prayers watching fasting reading meditating on the sweet word of life conferring retirednes whence have proceeded unspeakable joyes yea rather unutterable ravishments when wee could have said with peter

it is good for us to

be here and which wee could aboundantly discover if it were not lest the sense of the now want of them might wonderfully discourage us or that others the saints of god should think that we glory in our selves and such like heavenly exercises hast even trembled and quaked how darest thou now thou caitife thou hel hound thou damned wretch thus usurp the seat of god or defile his holy temple even this shall add unto thy torments
now seeing that the full and absolute possession of the heart is that whereat sathan mainly aymes it must be your care deare sonnes and daughters of god to keep the same with all diligence

but if haply he hath already got

possession you must by all means endeavour to get him dispossessed and thereafter still to be clensing and washing the same from the filthines he hath left behind which being but a little neglected will put you to a great deale of trouble and as a root of bitternes quickly manifest it selfe in its pernicious fruits



touching the first motions unto sinne in us getting grace to resist the same indeed though not without great griefe of minde wee must neither be too curious neither yet altogether careless thereof
too curious in a substantiall and deepe triall of them most of them being so vaine and idle as we cannot

imagine whence they should arise in us

thus to do were to goe about a worke both harmfull impossible unprofitable and cumbersome harmfull as whereby we hinder our peace of conscience and put off a better exercise even the true triall of our heart with the sincere circumcision of the same impossible as who shall never bee able to comprehend their number no more then wee are of the starres of heaven or sand which is by the seashore unprofitable inasmuch as when wee have done all that we can doe they are inevitable not the holiest men of god extraordinary persons being freed therefrom cumbersome as which would continually

employ us so that we should not performe any other dutie how comfortable or profitable soever the same being indeed as sudden so through gods goodnes no less swiftly flying away

altogether careles as which proceed from an heart in part unsanctified
by reason of them our tender consciences must at some times deepely lament even that the house of the soule which should be filled with the glory of god is any wayes filled with such smoke as ariseth from the fiery fornace of the heart not wholly reformed

that they may be restrained the stone must bee put on the wells mouth our hearts enclosed as a fountaine not else to be

opened but when some springs of heavenly waters are to bee drawne from thence to refresh the thirstie soule

as jacob when rachel came to water her fathers sheep removed the stone from the wells mouth and after they were watered put it on againe



wee must not in any case neglect to aske pardon for our secret sinnes which we drinke in whereof wee are not aware and which seldome come to bee remembred of us
as wee are to pray for the pardon of presumptuous sinnes of the sinnes of our youth of sinnes knowne so are we to pray to be clensed from secret faults

sinnes unknowne though unknowne to us they enter in

yet as jacob upon labans complaint that

his gods were stollen suspected no doubt that some of his had them

and so could not rest satisfied till they were delivered unto him and hee had buried them

so may we suspect that wee are guilty of no small number of them and accordingly pray to be forgiven them



we must not conceive that the flesh is indeed mortified when it seemeth so to be for seemingly it may bee when indeed it is not as when the occasion of sinne is removed when it is not violent when its act is removed from one sinne unto another when through the feare of judgement it is restrained when the strength of nature is spent our evidence must be sounded then

in those else it is but very slender



having aswell to our own as others thinking mortified our lusts our worke is not then at an end
the heart is not so mortified but there is still sinfull corruption in it which requires continuall mortification



we must not conceive that first wee must be moritfied and then lay hold on christ for remission of sinnes for till wee be in some measure assured of the pardon therof through christ we shall never soundly slay the same

mortification being indeed a fruit of faith



in opposing our sinfull and fleshly luste wee must carefully distinguish betweene them and others for all are not carnall but some naturall as others

spirituall
those from these may be thus differenced

they are ever immoderate they are for the most part unsavory and loathsome they are unto flesh and blood marvellous pleasing and give corruption a marvellous measure of contentment
they leave nothing but vanitie and vexation of spirit behind them


howsoever after many a fiery dart throwne at us wee meet with many others haply old ones made with a new devise or it may bee new ones wherewith wee were never before either acquainted or assaulted

yet must not wee give over but after the example of pavl and other worthies fight the good fight

not being at any time weary of as who in due time shall reape if we faint nor
had

wee but grace thus to lay the matter to heart that if wee fight not we shall live in slavery under the divell the world and the flesh of all others the greatest or rather the onely slaves but if we fight manfully and persevere therein wee shall bee conquerors over all those and as victorious kings trample sathan under our feete we would seeke to prevent our own misery and get an assured possession of glory gather courage in our decayed spirits and lustily goe on
did we but call to mind how often the lord hath beene pleased heretofore to help the same

would be as ebenezer unto the israelites to encourage us against our spirituall philistims
as the israelites in after ages reading how

joshua had once before discomfited amalek

and of the altar which moses did then build calling it by the name of jehovah nissi that is the lord is my banner could not but be encouraged hereby to have warres with them

so is it with gods children calling to mind their former spirituall victories of whom it may be more truely said then david did it of saul and ionathan

from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of ionathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty

they have greater joy and gladnes with more pleasure and contentment in striving against their corruption of nature which by degrees they still lessen and weaken

then the greatest souldier hath to glut his sword with the blood of his enemie
strive wee against these beasts our beastly lusts as paul fought with the beasts of ephesus

those were outward but these are inward beasts
if those had prevailed they would only have killed the body if these should they would destroy both body and soule those might have beene overcome with bodily weapons these no otherwise but by the whole armour of god faith hope repentance the word prayer with the other pieces yea in fighting against these gods power is after an especiall manner manifested
quit we our selves then like men

so dealing with our lusts as samson

with the philistims even by slaying moe of them hereafter then heretofore wee have done as hee moe at his death then in his life yea

as saul should not have spared any one amalekite but utterly destroyed them all so doe we destroy the whole brood of our sinfull and fleshly lusts not sparing any one of these cursed amalekits
thus of the caveats to be observed in this our warfare and so of the
particular

chap
how to discerne when we prevaile against the flesh with its inordinate lusts and affections

an enemie is not alwayes vanquished when he seemeth so to be

ioshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before the men of ai and fled by the way of the wildernesse yet was it meerely out of policie to draw them out of their citie

as afterward the israelites to the same end used the same stratagem when they discomfited

the benjamites
it is thus with our lusts they may seeme to bee mortified when indeed they are not but only wait their fittest opportunitie to doe us mischiefe

how then we should judge of them many or few great or small strong or weak violent or peaceable conquerers or conquered discerne wee by these signes



they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts and they that are in him walke not after the flesh

but after the spirit

art thou in christ then thou art a mortified creature else not


how shall know whether or not am in christ

a
if thou walkest in the light

if thou walkest as christ walked

if thou keepest his commandements

and hast his spirit in thee if thou perseverest in the knowledge and obedience of the cospel

if thou art fruitfull in good workes

if thou art a new creature teh art thou in christ



they that walke after the spirit walke not after the flesh

walkest thou after the spirit then walkest not thou after the flesh but art a mortified creature



how shall know whether or not walke after the spirit

a
if thou walkest after the spirit then livest thou not according to the motion and guidance of the corruption of nature but according

to the motion and guidance of the spirit of grace and sanctification
thou earnestly desitest both to know and walk in the good way
thou doest in every thing runne unto god by prayer that he would guide and direct thee
thou resolvest in every thing to please god
thou preferrest his will unto all things else profits pleasures preferments yea and thine owne life too
thou walkest carefully warily and circumspectly alwayes ordering thy steps with discretion lest thou shouldst in any sort tempt vexe grieve or quench the spirit



they that are indeed dead unto sinne are alive unto god

through iesus christ our lord
they doe really and truely partake as well of the vertue and efficacie of christs death unto mortification as of his resurrection unto newnes of life
being on the one part mortified persons in whom the death of christ hath broken the force of sinne that it cannot reigne in whom the vigor and force of sin which is the life thereof is crushed and extinct in whom sinne cannot bring forth such bitter fruits as it was wont to do before sanctification

who therefore even as men who have so lost their bodily strength as it cannot be recovered are said to be dead while they live how soever sinne doth still remaine in them are truly said

to be dead thereunto because the power and strength of sinne is sore abated and dayly lessened and weakened so on the other part are they quickned and moved by the holy spirit to doe what is pleasing and acceptable in gods sight

it's so in nature confesse as it is in grace hee that is corporally dead doth not corporally live but hee that is spiritually dead doth spiritally live he is dead indeed unto sinne but alive unto god yea his being dead unto sinne

doth argue that hee is alive unto god as his being alive unto god that he is dead unto sinne


they that are dead are freed from sinne

they that are

spiritually dead by mortification

they are freed say from sinne not in regard of its infection confesse nor in regard of its corruption which cleaveth to their nature as skin to their flesh or as flesh to their bones nor in regard of the temptations unto sinne

the godly being subject unto all these whilst they are in this life but in regard of the guilt and punishment of sin which is forgiven them through christ as also in regard of the authority dominion rule command and compulsion of sinne from which they are freed so that although they doe sin yet are they not led or ruled thereby
art thou thus freed from sin then art thou spiritutually dead a mortified creature



how shall know whether or not am thus freed from sinne

a
if thou hast no purpose at all to sin but determinest with david to keepe gods righteous judgements

and so in all things to please him
if thou art affraid of sin and with ioseph resistest the inticements which may provoke thee thereunto

shunning every occasion of sinne and curbing even thy sudden motions unto evill
if thou dayly callest upon god to strengthen thee against the power of sinne
if sin dayly decreaseth in thee so that thou findest its force and vigour more and more abated
if thou art truely grieved at thine owne and the sinnes of others
if thou rejoycest

at thine owne

and the spirituall freedom of others loving thy deare saviour which hath freed thee

and tendring the glory of him thy deliverer above thine owne salvation
thou art thus freed from sin and so spiritually dead indeed a mortified creature



they that are new creatures are mortified creatures

old things are past away if all things are become new
the more renewed thou art the greater thy reformation is both in heart and life the more dost thou prevaile against thy corruption the greater is thine encrease in the practise of mortification

whether dost thou not finde in thy selfe an absolute change and alteration from that thou

wast heretofore hast thou not now new eyes

leaving with delight to behold vanitie covenanting against lust and searching into the wonders of gods law hast thou not now new eares stopped against the entisements of the serpent

and open to heare what god will speake hast thou not a new tongue

not to sing the old ditty of nature to lye sweare backbite flatter and the like but to sing a new song to the praise of gods name hast thou not new hands

not to smite with the fist of iniquity nor to pull in with rapine and robbery but to distribute unto the poore casting thy bread upon the waters and giving the right hand of fellowship to

every good action within thy reach

hast thou not new feete not to bee swift to shed blood but to run the way of gods commandements art thou not renewed in thy nature

having new gifts knowledge faith repentance humility prayer new delights in the word

sacraments prayer meditation on gods works and the like
new sorrowes for sinne

for displeasing god for the afflictions of gods people as in like manner new desires

after the purity of nature pardon of sinne softnesse of heart the presence of god audience in prayer and such like

art thou not new in thy obedience both in regard of the manner of it of the matter

of it or end of the same performing gods commandements willingly diligently uprightly universally carefully at all times and in every thing ayming at gods glory

art thou not new in thine affections renewed in the spirit of thy minde

hast thou not now a new heart for a stony a fleshy heart for an whorish a chast heart for a covetous an heart weaned from the world for a proud an humble heart for an hypocriticall deceitfull and false heart a sincere plaine and honest heart for a darkned an enlightened heart for a stubborne perverse and rebellious heart an obedient and willing heart

art thou not renewed even in thy outward gestures being affable

and courteous to all and walking circumspectly towards those that are without if so then art thou a new creature

a mortified creature a conquerour over the flesh with its affections and lusts



they that are in some measure truely mortified doe not approve or connive at any one sinne in themselves but to set themselves against some as that in the meane time they are in like manner watchfull over all others
settest thou thy selfe against all sinnes canst thou not indure to give way unto thine owne heart in the entertainment of any one makest thou it a matter of conscience as to abstaine from publike notorious scandalous grosse sinnes so to abstaine

from the least secret sinne every idle word or wandring thought leavest thou not any one amalekite alive that thou canst come at canst thou so farre deny thy selfe as to forsake all and follow christ renouncest thou dayly even thy bosome sinnes thy darling sinnes thy best beloved sins of profit pleasure preferment

canst thou not away with adultery fornication uncleannesse lasciviousnes idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envying murders drunkennesse revellings with such like workes of the flesh whether lesse or more manifest thou art a mortified creature

as in nature death seiseth on all the members of

the body till which time who can be said to be truly dead so in grace mortification must take hold on all our earthly members else it is but unsound and frivolous

as in nature a man may live though he cut off one of his limbs so may a man in sinne though he cast away not one but many sinnes the examples of ahab iehu and herod are pregnant to this purpose

they that doe dayly grow in grace doe dayly mortifie sinne

yet the more they doe grow in the one the more doe they mortifie the other

as davids house did dayly waxe stronger and stronger but sauls weaker and weaker so being endued with the grace of mortification grace

will overcome nature vertue vanquish vice faith repentance holinesse humilitie love prayer encrease when as thy lusts will decrease
growest thou not in grace thou dost
how will it appeare

thou lovest grace thou labourest for grace thou highly prisest grace thy thoughts words and works relish and savour of grace thou canst not away with any thing that may in any sort hinder grace thou art further and further enamoured with the love of grace thou still hungerest and thirstest for more grace and canst not be satisfied with that thou hast already
thou art every day more and more carefull to avoid sinne more and more desirous to vanquish

thy corruptions more and more carelesse of the things of this world
thus indeed appeareth it infallibly that thou growest in grace and dayly prevailest against thy corruptions



they that doe truely mortifie their lusts and in some measure prevaile over them have anextreame hatred and detestation thereof wrought in their hearts
loathest thou sinne dost thou truly hate and abhorre it questionlesse thou prevailest over it
qu
how shall know whether or not doe truely hate it

a
if thou lovest the lord thou hatest sin

if thou canst not indure to speake a good word of it or for it if thy

dayly actions tend unto its ruine if thou grievest exceedingly whensoever thou fallest thereinto taking on thy selfe an holy revenge for the same if thou hatest it not so much in respect of its effects or punishment ensuing thereupon as its very nature being a breach of gods law if thou grievest when it seemeth to have the better but rejoycest when it is put to the worst then dost thou hate sinne and so prevailest against it by degrees vanquishest the same


they that doe truely mortifie their lusts and prevaile over their owne corruption having once escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust

are exceeding carefull to avoid relapses therein not againe to be entangled therewith
a burnt child dreads the fire beasts that have fallen into ditches or pits will beware of them afterward
the bird that hath escaped out of the fowlers ginnes will avoid them another time
so the saints remembring their former misery and dangerous condition whilst they were slaves unto sinne are so much the more carefull to keepe it under to this end shunning the occasion of sinne and abstaining even from all appearance of evill
hath peter denied his master he will doe so no more
hath david beene an adulterer he will bee so no more
hath noah beene drunke he will

be more wary in his drinking after
but if god for their leaving of him or their want of watchfulnesse and improving his graces shall be pleased to leave them unto themselves for a time even after their knowledge and acknowledging of the truth so that they yeeld unto violent temptations and fall into the very sadnes of their unregenerate condition though they fall into the acts thereof they fall not into the love thereof
they doe what they allow not what they would not what they are heartily grieved for
thou art carefull to avoid all sins but especially thine own sins thy formerly dearly beloved sins herein appeareth it that thou art a mortified creature


they that have a true sight and sense of their sinnes doe in some measure mortifie the same
art thou acquainted with satans stratagems art thou not ignorant of his wiles discernest thou the deceitfulnesse of sinne observest thou the subtilty of the flesh and how cunningly it would insinuate it selfe knowest thou its traps and tricks its ginns and snares its baits and allurements thou canst not but in the like manner avoid the same
thou wilt not willingly run headlong unto destruction


as before bodily death there is for the most part sicknes and at the time of death both unwillingnesse to undergoe it and

painfulnesse in undergoing the same

so before this death unto sinne there is deepe humiliation and dejection through the sense and apprehension of gods wrath wrought in us by the law of god

the soule being brought thereby as it were unto the very gates of hell
there is also no small unwillingnesse in us to undergoe it the flesh having a strong heart and so loath to die as in like manner no lesse paine then to pull out our right eye or cut off our right hand
hast thou beene thus spiritually dejected and affected thou art a mortified creature


as on those that are corporally dead neither alluring objects flattering speeches golden promises hope of pleasure feare

of danger

or such like doe worke at all so if thou art indeed dead unto sinne thou wilt neither be terrified by threats

nor tickled with pleasures nor shall any allurements withdraw thee from god but still thou keepest fast hold on god though at some times in great weaknesse and continuest at deadly feud and open defiance with thy flesh and all its ad herents thus how to discerne when we prevaile against the flesh and so of the particular

the application of the foregoing matter

having discovered the enemy to be encountred shewed that it is to bee encountered laid open by whom it is to bee encountred set forth the reasons why it is to bee encountred declared after what manner it is to bee encountred described the meanes whereby it may bee encountred made knowne the motives or encouragements whereby we may bee stirred up to encounter it propounded such necessary caveats as are to

bee observed in this spirituall combate as also manifested by what signes we may discerne when wee prevaile against it what remaineth but that as the lord encouraged moses to fight against og the king of bashan feare him not

for have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt doe to him as thou didst to sihon king of the amorttes which dwelt at heshbon and moses encouraged ioshua from the lord

be strong and be of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which sware unto them and will be with thee as the lord himselfe after the death of moses

be strong and of a good courage bee not affraid neither

be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest and ioshua the captaines and men of warre that went with him

come neere put your feet upon the necks of these kings

feare not nor be dismai'd be strong and of a good courage for thus shall the lord doe to all your enemies against whom you fight and deborah barak to fight against sisera

up for this is the day in which the lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand is not the lord gone out before thee and the philistms one another to fight against the jsraelites

bee strong and quit your selves like men ye philistims that ye be not servants unto the hebrewes as they have beene to you quit your selves like men and fight

and iahaziel the sonne of zechariah a levit did encourage judah the inhabitants of ierusalem and king iehosaphat

be not affraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battell is not yours but gods

feare not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for the lord will be with you
so sending every one of you to fight the lords battels by warring against your own lusts should in his name the more to incite you hereunto and further incourage you herein conclude all with a word of exhortation

what argument might not be used for your encouragement

necessitie

what more needfull doth not god command it whose will both is and must be a law unto us is not the flesh still plotting our destruction are we not the further endangered the more we yeeld unto it shall not our lusts be snares and traps unto us scourages in our sides and thornes in our eyes if wee make any covenant with them are wee not thereby further and further defiled doe we not thereby further and further grieve the good spirit of god is not our communion familiaritie and acquaintance with god further and further

interrupted are we not therby further and further drawn to the commission of grosse and grievous sins will not this root of bitternes dayly produce in us most bitter fruits will not god be angry at our continuance herein can it be otherwise but that hee should inflict upon us heavy and fearfull judgements by reason of the same

if wee live after the flesh shall we not die shall we not both here and hereafter be punished as perjured persons rebels against the god of heaven contemners of his admonitions despisers of christs death and treaders under foot of his most precious blood grievers of the spirit breakers of the hearts of gods children stumbling

blocks unto the ungodly

equitie

what more just or lawfull is not sinne gods enemie is it not a murtherer of the lord of glory doth it not daily lust against the spirit is it not one of the maine enemies of our soules salvation doth it not dayly provoke and stirre us up to the breach of gods lawes is it not a meere coozener and deceiver will it not beguile us in the end shall wee not utterly misse of our hopes if we trust to its offers and follow its allurements will it not requite us with losse in stead of profit torment in stead of pleasure shame in stead of credit paine in stead of ease

misery in stead of happines and hell in stead of heaven

utilitie

what more profitable doe we not hereby obtaine tranquillity of minde and dayly peace of conscience have we not hereby dayly experience of gods powerfull presence accompanying us doth not continuall glory redound unto the majestie of the most high hereby is there not maintained in us an holy feare and suspition of our own weaknesse whereby wee are doe we not by opposing our inward corruption prevent and stay many outward actuall sinnes shall not have lesse to doe in the end of our journey if all our dayes we be breaking up our fallow ground shall wee no hereby

by attaine unto an higher and higher detestation of sinne shall wee not hereby make conscience even of the least of the smallest sinnes as being breaches of gods law shall wee not hereby be assured of gods love towards in christ as well in the pardon and forgivenesse of our sinnes as our continuance in the detestation and mortification of the same

credit

what can procure more shall wee not hereby be esteemed of god reverenced of the angels honoured of all good men may adde

that as herod bare no small respect unto iohn the baptist a patterne of the doctrine of mortification which

hee urged upon others so even the wicked will in their judgement whatsoever they doe in their practise approve of one that is throughly mortified
thus shall it be done to the man who mortifyeth his lusts hee shall be honoured of all as in heaven most of all

undoubted furtherance and helpe from others

new strength and courage put in ourselves

what the lord said unto ioshua touching his enemies

there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the dayes of thy life as was with moses so will bee with thee will not faile thee nor forsake thee
saith not he the like unto our soules touching our

lusts that they shall not stand before us hee will goe along with us hee will not faile us or forsake us doth not hee goe along with us doth not hee fight for us hath not that great lyon of the tribe of iudah bound that strong one

and spoiled him

setting us at liberty

lusteth not the spirit against the flesh on our behalf are not also the angels ministring spirits sent forth for our good

do not they pitch their tents round about our tabernacle have we not in like manner the benefit of the prayers of all gods people yea more particularly as uriah said unto david

the ark and israel and iudah abide in tents and my lord ioab and the servants of my lord are encamped

in the open field

shall then goe into mine house to eate and to drinke and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soule liveth will not doe this thing there are some which doe even sympathize with us in this warfare joyning with us as it were hand in hand and setting their foot unto ours being no lesse carefull of us but rather more then we are of our selves which do even dayly humble themselves before god on our behalfe crying calling praying knocking begging interceding

and with moses stedfastly lifting up their hands that we may prevaile against our spirituall amalehites

certaine victory

not any

duly and truly mortifying the flesh with its lusts and affections either heretofore hath beene or hereafter shall bee overcome thereby

god that cannot lie hath promised

that if we doe through the spirit mortifie the deeds of the body we shall live
as ioshua unto the people

one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you
so may say unto all such as shall in truth war against their iusts though you had ten thousand of them in you you shall chase them away for the lord your god fighteth for you

it was the angels speech unto gideon the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour
it is no lesse true even of the weakest christian

that doth in truth oppose his lusts who may therefore triumph in the words of david

through god wee shall doe valiantly for hee shall tread down our enemies and of paul if god bee for us

who can bee against us

heaven it selfe

have fought a good fight saith paul have finished my course

have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for mee a crowne of righteousnesse which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me onely but to them also that love his appearing
oh the promises of great reward if we shall fight lustily and persevere therein

whatsoever wee have beene

heretofore set we our selves now against our lusts
the foregoing time of our ignora~ce

god hath graciously winked at but now commaundeth he all men every where to repent
some know are men yea mighty men of valour others babes in christ his young and tender lambes let not those waxe carelesse but go on in their might that they may be saved from their spirituall midianites and let these labour for strength and courage casting all their care on god who careth for them

jerusalem

wash thine heart from wickednesse that thou maist be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee

oh let us clense our selves from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit

perfecting holinesse in the feare of god

let not sinne reigne in your mortall body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof
neither yeeld yee your members as instruments of unrighteousnesse unto sinne but yeeld your selves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousnesse unto god

the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darknes and let us put on the armour of light

let us walke honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkennesse not in chambering and wantonnesse not in strife and envying but put ye on the lord iesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof

this say therefore and testifie in the lord that ye henceforth

walke not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkned being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindnesse of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousnesse to work all uncleannes with greedines

mortifie your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleannesse inordinate affection evill concupiscence and covetousnesse which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of god commeth on the children of disobedience
jn the which ye also walked sometime when ye lived in them

put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts and be renewed

in the spirit of your mind putting on that new man which after god is created in righteousnes and true holines

for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodlines and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world

take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evill heart of unbeliefe in departing from the living god but exhort one another dayly while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sinne

lift up the hands which hang downe and the feeble knees and make straight pathes for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather bee healed looke diligently lest any

man faile of the grace of god lest any root of bitternesse springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled

for as much as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arme your selves likewise with the same minde for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sinne that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousnesse lusts excesse of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they thinke it strange that you runne not with them to the same excesse of riot speaking evill of you

dearly beloved beseech you as

strangers and pilgrims to abstaine from fleshly lusts which warre against the soule

having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speake evill against you as evill doers they may by your good workes which they shall behold glorifie god in the day of visitation

finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might

put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devill for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darknesse of this world against spirituall wickednesse in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye

may be able to withstand in the evill day and having done all to stand
stand therefore having your loynes girt about with truth and having on the of righteousnesse and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospell of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying alwayes with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance
thus shall our corruption bee weakned our flesh subdued our old man crucified the body of sinne destroyed our consciences quieted gods commandment

obeyed himselfe well pleased our selves both in soule and body here and hereafter really and truly blessed

now unto him that is able to keepe us from falling and to present us faultlesse before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the onely wise god our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power now and ever
amen

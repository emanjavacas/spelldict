the kings's letter

dated monday iune the
delivered at fulham on thursday being the of the same iune in the afternoon by mr atterbury the messenger

james right reverend father in god we greet you well

whereas we have been inform'd and are fully satisfi'd that dr john sharp rector of the parish church of st giles in the fields in the county of middlesex and in your diocess notwithstanding our late letter to the most reverend fathers in god the archbishops of canterbury and york and our directions concerning preachers given at our court at whitehall the th of march
in the second year of our reign yet he the said dr john sharp in contempt of the said orders hath in some of the sermons he hath since preached presum'd to make unbecoming reflections and to utter such expressions as were not fit or proper for him endeavouring thereby to beget in the minds of his hearers an evil opinion of vs and our government by insinuating fears and iealousies to dispose them to discontent and to lead them into disobedience and rebellion
these are therefore to require and command you immediately upon receipt hereof forthwith to suspend him from further preaching in any parish church or chappel in your diocess until he has given vs satisfaction and our further pleasure be known herein

and for so doing this shall be your warrant and so we bid you heartily farewell

given at our court at windsor the day of june
in the second year of our reign

by his majesties command
sunderland

the bishop of london's answer

sent by dr sharp to the earl of sunderland then at upon fryday iune
who could have no answer
to the right honourable the earl of sunderland lord president

my lord

always have and shall count it my duty to obey the king in whatever commands he lays upon me that can perform with a safe conscience but in this humbly conceive am oblig'd to proceed according to law and therefore it is impossible for me to comply because tho his majesty commands me only to execute his pleasure yet in the capacity am to do it must act as a iudge and your lordship knows no iudge condemns any man before he has knowledge of the cause and has cited the party
however sent to mr dean and acquainted him with his majesties displeasure whom find so ready to

give all reasonable satisfaction that have thought fit to make him the bearer of this answer from him that will never be unfaithful to the king nor otherwise than

my lord your lordships most humble servant london

on sunday after dr sharp carried a petition to windsor which was not admitted to be read
which is as follows

to the king's most excellent majesty the humble petition of iohn sharp clerk sheweth that nothing is so afflictive to your petitioner as his vnhappiness to have incurred your majesties displeasure which he is so sensible of that ever since your majesty was pleased to give notice of it he hath forborn all publick exercise of his function and still continues so to do
your petitioner can with great sincerity affirm that ever since he hath been a preacher he hath faithfully endeavour'd to do the best service he could in his place and station as well to the late king your royal brother as your majesty both by preaching and otherwise

and so far he hath always been from venting any thing in the pulpit tending to schism or faction or any way

to the disturbance of your majesties government that he hath upon all occasions in his sermons to the utmost of his power set himself against all sorts of doctrines and principles that look that way and this he is so well assured of that he cannot but apprehend that his sermons have been very much misrepresented to your majesty

but if in any sermon of his any words or expressions have unwarily slipt from him that have been capable of such constructions as to give your majesty cause of offence as he solemnly professes he had no ill intention in those words or expressions so he is very sorry for them and resolves for the future to be so careful in the discharge of his duty that your majesty shall have reason to believe him to be your most faithful subject
and therefore he earnestly prayeth that your majesty out of your royal grace and clemency would be pleas'd to lay aside the displeasure you have conceiv'd against your humble petitioner and restore him to that favour which the rest of the clergy enjoy under your majesties gracious government
so shall your petitioner ever pray

herbert

the lord bishop of london appeared and the lord chancellour spoke to him as follows

ld ch

my lord you are not ignorant suppose of the

king's letter which was sent to the clergy my lord of canterbury has communicated to you
you are here charged not to have observ'd his majesty's commands in the case of dr sharp whom you were ordered to suspend for going against the orders of that letter

my lord am much surpriz'd at what your lordship tells me and hope have not disobeyed the king's commands
your lordship cannot believe did this without advice and if my counsel have me hope my own ignorance of the law will plead so far in my favour as to render my fault if any very excusable

ch
my lord you know ignorantia iuris non excusat


but if have not offended willingly it may palliate at least

ch
my lord we are not here to discourse but to examine why you did not obey


humbly beg a copy of the commission and a copy of my charge

ch does your lordship think my lords are not very well satisfi'd upon what account they sit and that they have power to judge your lordship a copy is a thing never done should we grant you a copy all that come before us would have the like for we must do equal justice to all
besides it is to be had at every

my lord this is a new commission cannot tell how to inform my self whether any thing that relates particularly to my case may not be found there
it is a matter of high concern
besides am here under such circumstances as ought to make me very cautious
am a peer am a bishop hope your lordships will take all into consideration and at least give me leave to read the commission

ch
you need not doubt but your quality station and family will be considered by their lordships but if you insist upon seeing the commission you must withdraw
after a small respite of withdrawing the bishop and the commissioners were call'd in again

ch

their lordships have consider'd of what your lordship desir'd and are of opinion that you shall neither have

a copy of nor see the commission neither will they give a copy of the charge
the commission is upon record

my lord must submit but it will be hard to carry my charge in my head may mistake

ch
it is a short question you may easily remember it why did you not obey the king's commands


it is a short question but may require a long answer
must beg time to advise with counsel and to have them plead

ch god forbid else
but what time does your lordship desire


your lordship knows better than that it is the deadest time of the year every body is out of town with their tenants in the country about their private affairs

ch
my lord the town is never so empty but there will be counsel enough unless you can be satisfied with none but those that are abroad
but what time would you have

considering the time and that there is not one civilian in the commons hope you will give me till towards the term

ch
my lord twill never be you cannot expect so long a delay


know not whether there be any appeal from this court
if therefore am to stand or fall at this blow your lordships will in justice allow me the longer time to be fully prepar'd

ch does lordship expect that this court will tell you whether there lyes an appeal from it or no


did not ask the question only suppos'd it

ch
what answer at present occurs to encounter your reasons for longer time is that the king's affairs will not suffer long time
but since you propose no less time will propose what think you of a week


can do nothing in a weeks time

ch
not to trouble your lordship and the company to withdraw again will ask my lords whether it be not a sufficient time he asked them one by one and they all agreed in the affirmative


must submit but hope your lordships will not be surpriz'd if am forc'd to desire longer time when wait upon you again

ch
their lordships will not capitulate

my lord only leave it with you and hope there will be some consideration of my family's and my own sufferings and constant loyalty that it would not be an easie matter for me to be thought to question the king's commands where can obey them
their lordships adjourn'd till munday aug

aug

the bishop of appear'd

ch
my lord are you ready to give an answer to the question

my lord do assure you have employ'd my time as well as possibly could but find that for the reasons formerly mention'd it was too short for me to prepare my self

ch
has your lordship nothing else to offer


do humbly offer this as my request that your lordships would give me longer time for writ to several considerable counsel out of town none of which are come up and those few that are here the thing is so new to them that they could not thoroughly consider matters in so short a time

ch
what time would you have


will not be unreasonable a

ch
be pleased to withdraw
after this the bishop was call'd in again

ch
my lord we have consider'd of your request and their lordships are resolv'd to give no time for pleading to their jurisdiction they are well appriz'd by what authority they sit here
if your lordship has been told that any court will admit of a plea to their jurisdiction they have deceived you therefore if that be your meaning they will allow no time

that is not all am not fully instructed for an answer to the question know not yet in what manner to answer

ch
we do not insist upon forms and manners if your lordship want nothing that is material


am sorry did not so clearly express my self want time to prepare for a material answer

ch
my lord come hither on purpose for this business and every body knows at this time where my health obliges me to be


protest have no design to trifle with you for am really not ready and must therefore beg more time if it may be allow'd

ch
well my lords are willing to grant you a fornight you will therefore be pleas'd to be here on tuesday come fortnight at eleven in the morning
here it must be observ'd that the bishop did in this time send his proctor to their register for a copy of what orders and other minutes they had set down concerning his business but it was refus'd tho his counsel told him it never was deny'd in any court
tuesday aug


ch
my lord are you ready to give an answer to the question



my lords have taken the best care could in so short a time to be ready with an answer to your lordships question tho must confess it was a very great surprize to me to find my attacqu'd with so quick and sudden a return by a citation in a matter concerning that letter which the whole world can bear me witness have been this whole summer endeavouring with all the power and skill had to enforce to the strict observation of my clergy
but before can offer an answer to the question beg your lordships leave to offer my plea to your jurisdiction for am told it is a right every one has to make use of when he finds it for his advantage
would not hazard being so impertinent as to offer any thing upon my own head your lordships gave me time to advise with counsel and they that are learned in the laws of

the land advise me to plead to your jurisdiction and will be ready to argue it

ch
my lord told you before my lords would hear nothing to their jurisdiction and therefore if you have any thing to say to the question be pleas'd to let us know it

my lords shall offer nothing that is undutiful to the king or disrespectful to your lordships and beseech you to correct and pardon me if unwittingly any thing should fall from me that is liable to censure
am far from disowning any part of the king's supremacy acknowledge it and am so bound to do in its just extent over all persons and in all causes what have to offer in plea to your jurisdiction is that conceive this commission you act by is not good as being contrary to an act of parliament upon which point beg my counsel may argue

ch
your lordship knows my lords minds in this matter


if then your lordships me must beg leave to protest to my right in this or any other plea that may be for my advantage
the bishop of london plea which he would have given in if the lords commissioners would have suffered it to be argued

henry bishop of london do declare and acknowledge that the kings majesty is the only supream head and governour of this realm and all other his majesties dominions and countries as well in all spiritual or ecclesiastical causes as temporal
nevertheless the said bishop by protestation not acknowledging any just or legal authority in your lordships otherwise than as by law am bound to question or censure me in any matter or thing ecclesiastical whatsoever do offer and shew to your lordships that at the parliament of king charles of blessed memory late king of england holden on the
day of november in the sixteenth year of his reign a certain act and statute was made entituled a repeal of the branch of a statute primo elizabethae concerning commissioners for causes ecclesiastical setting forth that in the parliament holden in the first year of the reign of queen elizabeth there was an act made and established entituled an act restoring to the crown the ancient iurisdiction

over the state ecclesiastical and spiritual
and abolishing all foreign power repugnant to the same
in which act among other things there is contained one clause branch article or sentence whereby it was enacted to this effect namely that the said late queens highness her heirs and successors kings or queens of this realm should have full power and authority by virtue of that act by letters patents under the great seal of england to assign name and authorize when and as often as her highness her heirs or successors should think meet and convenient and for such and so long time as should please her highness her heirs or successors such person or persons being natural born subjects to her highness her heirs or successors as her majesty her heirs or successors should think meet to exercise use occupy and execute under her highness her heirs and successors all manner of iurisdictions priviledges and preheminences in any wise touching or concerning any spiritual or ecclesiastical iurisdiction within these her realms of england and ireland or any other her highnesses dominions and countries and to visit reform redress order correct and amend all such errours heresies schisms abuses offences contempts and enormities whatsoever which by any manner of spiritual or ecclesiastical power authority or iurisdiction can or may lawfully be reformed ordered redressed corrected restrained or amended to the pleasure of almighty god the increase of vertue and the conservation of the peace and vnity of this realm
and that such person or persons so to be named assigned and appointed by her highness her heirs or successors after the said letters patents to him or them made and delivered as aforesaid should have full power and authority by virtue of that act and of the said letters patents under her highness her heirs or successors to exercise use and execute all the premises according to the tenor and effect of said letters patents any matter or cause to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding
and setting forth likewise that by the colour of some words in the foresaid branch of the said act whereby commissioners are authoriz'd to execute their commission according to the tenor and effect of the kings letters patents and by letters patents grounded thereupon the said commissioners have to the great and unsufferable wrong and oppression of the king's subjects used to fine and imprison them and to exercise other authority not belonging to ecclesiastical iurisdiction restor'd by that act and

divers other great mischiefs and inconveniencies have also ensued to the king's subjects by occasion of the said branch and commissions issued thereupon and the executions thereof and therefore for the repressing and preventing of the aforesaid abuses mischiefs and inconveniencies in time to come it was by the said act made at the said parliament of the said king charles the first enacted that the aforesaid branch clause article or sentence contain'd in the said act of primo elizabethae and every word matter and thing contain'd in that branch clause article or sentence should from thenceforward be repeal'd annul'd revoak'd annihilated and utterly made void for ever any thing in the said act to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding
and it was thereby also enacted by the authority aforesaid that no arch bishop bishop nor nor any ordinary whatsoever nor any other spiritual or ecclesiastical iudge officer or minister of iustice nor any other person or persons whatsoever executing spiritual or ecclesiastical power authority or iurisdiction by any grant license or commission of the king's majesty his heirs or successours or by any power or authority derived from the king his heirs or successours or otherwise should from and after the first day of august in the year of our lord award impose or inflict any pain penalty fine amerciament or imprisonment or other corporal punishment upon any of the king's subjects for any contempt misdemeanor crime offence matter or thing whatsoever belonging to spiritual or ecclesiastical cognisance or iurisdiction or shall ex officio or at the instance or promotion of any other person whatsoever urge enforce tender give or minister unto any or other person whatsoever any corporal oath whereby he or she shall or may be charg'd or oblig'd to make any presentment of any crime or offence or to confess or accuse himself or her self of any crime offence delinquency or misdemeanor or any other neglect matter or thing whereby or by reason whereof he or she shall or may be liable or expos'd to any censure or punishment whatsoever upon pain and penalty that every person that shall offend contrary to this statute shall forfeit and pay treble damages to every person and the sum of to him or them who shall first demand and sue for the same which said treble damages and sum of a
shall and may be demanded and receiv'd and urg'd by action of debt bill or plaint

in any court of record wherein no priviledge essoyn protection or wager of law shall be admitted or allow'd to the defendant
and it was thereby further enacted that every person who should once be convicted of any act or offence prohibited by that statute should for such act or offence be from and after such conviction utterly disabled to be or continue in any office or employment in any court of iustice whatsoever or to exercise or execute any power authority or iurisdiction by force of any commission or of the king his heirs or successours
and it was thereby also enacted that from and after the first day of august no new court should be erected ordain'd or appointed within this realm of england or dominion of wales which should or might have the like power iurisdiction or authority as the said high then had or pretended to have but that all and every such commissions and grants made or to be made by his majesty his heirs or successors and all powers and authorities granted thereby and all acts sentences and decrees to be made by virtue or colour thereof should be utterly void and of none effect which said act of parliament made at the said parliament of the said king charles the first the said bishop of london do plead and object to and against your lordships iurisdiction and pray your lordships iudgment whether your lordships will think it fit or ought to proceed any further herein against me the said bishop of london


have another thing to beg your lordships advice and judgment in
have right as a bishop by the most authentique and universal ecclesiastical laws to be try'd first before my metropolitan precedent to any other court whatsoever

ch
this is still to the jurisdiction


it is so confess but yet so as to have a more particular relation to my case

ch
their lordships are fully satisfy'd of their authority in this point
besides your lordship knows there have been presidents for this


only challenge the right of law and shall plead to it by counsel if you please

ch
my lord if you have any thing to say to the question you may be pleas'd to give your answer


if am in this must beg your lordships patience in one plea more your lordships in this commission after the general words are directed to proceed according to the tenor of the letters patents which say that you shall first proceed against all persons offending for matters done or to be done by censures and other lawful ways in the next place you are to enquire of and search out and call before you all ecclesiastical persons of what degree or dignity soever as shall offend and them and every of them to punish by suspending
now conceive in the capacity am you are only warranted to try me for offences after the date of the commission

ch
there are general words which give authority sufficient to look back


but my lord in matters of severity the most favourable interpretation is to be given and know your lordships will rather foregoe the extending the jurisdiction to such

ch
is this all your lordship hath to offer


if may not plead to any of these points desire to put in my answer

ch
your lordship be pleased to withdraw


desire to leave my answer

ch
be pleas'd to lay it down here and withdraw
here the answer was given in
after a little while the bishop was call'd in again

ch
my lord their lordships have considered of your several pleas and are fully satisfied of their jurisdiction and their authority to judge your lordship and therefore they desire to know what you have to say in answer to the question


desire my answer in writing may be first read

ch read it

mr bridgman read the answer which was this

to the question that was propos'd to me by your lordships viz
why did you not obey the king's command in his letter concerning the suspending doctor sharp henry bishop of london do answer that immediately upon receipt of his majesties letter from my lord president the tenour whereof follows
viz

right reverend father in god we greet you well
whereas we have been inform'd and are fully satisfi'd that dr john sharp rector of the parish church of st giles in the fields in the county of middlesex and in your diocess notwithstanding our late letter to the most reverend fathers in god the archbishops of canterbury and york and our directions concerning preachers given at our court at whitehall the of march
in the second year of our reign yet he the said dr john sharp in contempt of the said orders hath in some of the sermons he hath since preached presum'd to make unbecoming reflections and to utter such expressions as were not fit or proper for him endeavouring thereby to beget in the minds of his hearers an evil opinion of vs and our government by insinuating fears and iealousies to dispose them to discontent and to lead them into disobedience and rebellion
these are therefore to require and command you immediately upon receipt hereof forthwith to suspend him from further preaching in any parish church or chappel in your diocess until he has given vs satisfaction and our further pleasure be known herein
and for so doing this shall be your warrant and so we bid you heartily farewell

given at our court at

windsor the th day of june
in the second year of our reign

took the best advice could get concerning of doctor sharp and was inform'd that the letter being directed to me as bishop of london to suspend a person under my iurisdiction was therein to act as a iudge it being a iudicial act and that no person could by law be punish'd by suspension before he was call'd or without being admitted to make his defence
thought it therefore my duty forthwith humbly to represent so much to my lord president that so might receive his majesties further pleasure in that matter nevertheless that might obey his majesties commands as far as by law could did then send for doctor sharp and acquainted him with his majesties displeasure and the occasion of it by shewing him his majesties letter but he having never been call'd to answer any such matter or make his defence and protesting his innocence and likewise declaring himself most ready to give his majesty full satisfaction therein in order thereto advis'd him to forbear preaching till he had apply'd himself to his majesty and at his request made him the bearer of my letter to my lord president waiting for his majesties further orders to proceed against him iudicially in case he should not at that time give his majesty the satisfaction requir'd and the said doctor sharp hath not since preach'd within my diocess

henry london

ch
has your lordship any more to say

my lords what shall say my self will be very short only a little farther to explain my meaning in this answer
the words of his majesties letter are liable to two constructions

the first is a legal and strict sence of the word suspend must have suspended doctor sharp ab officio because preaching alone does not come under that censure
in this sence it was that understood the king's letter and was advis'd by my counsel that it was a judicial act and by consequence could not be comply'd with unless had first cited the party and heard the cause and in this should have committed a fault
it is most excusable upon these two accounts by all the practice and rules of ecclesiastical laws the charge of malice or wilfulness is taken off from the party in case he has this to say for himself that what he did was iuris peritorum consilio quibus cum in hac parte communicavimus
now consulted with the most proper person sir tho exton my chancellour with whose advice wrote my answer
but in the next place it is the constant rule in all the books that in case the prince write to a judge and this judge thinks he cannot lawfully obey the command he is to rescribere reclamare and in so doing tantum ut principi deserviat quod is maxime serviat
and the rule goes further that in case the prince be not satisfied with the answer the judge is not to apprehend a charge of contempt for his refusal but has a right to except iussio secunda by the prince's rescript because in common equity no man in such a case is to be judg'd obstinate before a second refusal
had no rescript but up at the first rebound

the other sense this word suspend might be taken in was at large for silensing
in this confess did not apprehend it because my counsel turn'd my thoughts another way
but to shew that was resolved to pay all the duty could to the king's letter which am advis'd by my counsel was as strong admonition as could be given considering the purport of the letter and besides advis'd him not to preach till he had endeavoured to know his majesties further pleasure which advice from a judge the learned in the laws tell me is tantamount to an admonition and that if he had not submitted to it could have censur'd him for his disobedience so that if this last was his majesty's meaning have in effect obeyed the

letter which is all shall say at present and beg my counsel may be heard to clear the matter in point of law

after a short space the bishop was call'd in again

ch call in my lord of london counsel
which was dr oldish dr hedges dr brice and dr newton

dr oldish
my lords the question before your lordships is whether the bishop of london has been disobedient to his majesty's command concerning which it must be considered

st
what was commanded

what he has done in obedience to it

what judgment ought to have been given by him

it is apparent by the letter that the king did not take cognizance of the cause for the words are being informed that dr sharp
so that it could not be an absolute suspension for that supposes a proof of the crime charged upon him
then let us consider the words themselves that you suspend him from preaching
now my lords we have not such a thing in our law so that the meaning must be only silencing of him
where there is an absolute suspension there ought to have been a citation form of proceedings judgment and decree
to act otherwise is contrary to the law of god of nature and of all nations in all ages and was never known in the world

ch doctor am loth to interrupt you but must tell you this is an unnecessary harangue we know that it was not an absolute suspension
but the question is whether the bishop could suspend him from preaching

dr oldish

then my lord have gain'd that point
if it were only a silencing of him the question is whether the bishop did not execute the king's commands think he did it and in such a method as is observed in our courts
when any eminent person is accus'd the judge sends to him by a letter and if he appears and complies with the judges order the law is satisfied

iudicium redditur in invitos non in volentes
the bishop did send for dr sharp shew'd him the king's letter advis'd him not to preach till his majesty had received satisfaction in which he promis'd to observe his lordships command and has not preach'd to this day so that his majesty's command was in effect fulfill'd

my lords there are the like proceedings in the for if an attorney takes a man's word for his appearance and he doth appear tis the same thing as if he had been arrested and there he has no action against the attorney

ch cujus contrarium est lex
there lies an action of escape against the attorney

dr hedges

my lords the matter of fact has been stated
and the question is whether the bishop hath been disobedient to the king's command it appears that he has not because upon receipt of his majesty's letter he required the doctor not to preach and he hath obeyed him
that which the king commanded viz
to suspend him the bishop could not do the act of suspension is a judicial act the king writes to him as a bishop to suspend as a bishop and a judge which could not be done before a hearing of the cause
if a prince sends to a person that is not a judge but only a ministerial officer that officer is to execute his commands but when the king commands a judge he commands him to act as a judge
this is no light matter which the dr is accus'd of tis for preaching sedition and rebellion which requires severe censure and if the bishop as a judge had suspended him he had began at the wrong end for this had been judgment before process in this case there ought to have been a citation
our books give many instances which would be too tedious to your lordships
will give this one
the emperour proceeding against the king of sicily upon information that he had receiv'd and giving him no citation the king appeal'd to the pope who declar'd the proceedings to be void and that it was against the law of nature which is above all positive laws to pass sentence before citation
this is the method of procceedings in all

courts and humbly conceive it is and will be the method of this court for otherwise the bishop needed not to have been cited before you
the bishop has done what was his duty he was bound to return his reasons to the king why he could not do that which was commanded and to expect his farther pleasure which was done

affirm if a prince or a pope commands that which is not lawful it is the duty of a judge rescribere which is all he can doe

dr brise
the question is ut supra a citation is iure gentium and can never be taken away by any positive command or law whatsoever
the bishop has obey'd the king so far in that he did rescribere expecting his majesties further pleasure
if the bishop could have suspended him it must have been in foro but in regard twas only silencing him which was requir'd it might be done in a private chamber
the advice of the bishop is in some sence an admonition which is a judicial act and this was given by the bishop and obeyed by the doctor

dr newton
my lords the question is ut supra the bishop has not been disobedient as in nature no man can be required to do that which is impossible so no man can be oblig'd to do an unlawful act id non fit quod non legitime fit this rule obliges all men in the world in all places and at all times

the charge against the doctor is of a very high nature and he desir'd to be heard before he was condemn'd
my lords the bishops are custodes canonum and therefore must not break them themselves
affirm that the bishop was fo far from being disobedient that he was obedient to the king
for when he did rescribere and heard not the further pleasure of the king returned he ought to conclude that the king was satisfied with what he had written according to his duty and that the king had alter'd his commands
a citation as your lordships have heard is according to all laws in all places in all judicial acts there is something to be done according

to law and somewhat according to the discretion of the judge
and for that reason as well as others the offender ought to be cited to appear before him
that which was in the bishop's power to do that he has done and it was in effect what the king commanded to be done

ch
has your lordship any more to say


have but little more to say
suppose my counsel have satisfied your lordships that in the severest construction malice or wilful disobedience could not be imputed to me
but as my lord chancellor has now explain'd it to doctor oldish that the king's meaning was only to silence they have made plain to your lordships that have effectually obeyed his majesties commands and if in any circumstance have been wanting am ready to make reparation by performing that likewise and to beg his majesties pardon

ch withdraw
after an hour and better stay the bishop was called in again and appointed to attend their lordships on monday following in the morning being the of september

my lord before go would beg the minutes may be read for fear of any mistake

ch
their lordships will do you no injury nor take advantage


it is not out of distrust of your lordships but since you proceed in a summary way and ex tempore there may happen some slip of a pen that may more easily be corrected now than afterwards

ch
my lord know no minutes they keep

monday sept


after waiting near two hours mr bridgman was at last sent out who in less than half an hour brought the sentence under seal
then the bishop was called in

ch
their lordships have considered of what your lordship said last day and what your counsell urged and have proceeded to sentence

will you give me leave to say something

ch
no my lord you must first hear the sentence read
then mr bridgman their lordships register was ordered to read the sentence to the bishop as followeth

the suspension
by his majesty's commissioners for ecclesiastical causes
whereas henry lord bishop of london hath been conven'd before us for his disobedience and other his contempts mention'd in the proceedings of this cause and the said lord bishop of london being fully heard hereupon we have thought fit after mature consideration of the matter to proceed to this our definitive sentence declaring decreeing and pronouncing that the said lord bishop shall for the said disobedience and contempts be suspended during his majesty's pleasure
and accordingly we do by these presents suspend him the said henry lord bishop of london peremptorily admonishing and requiring him hereby to obtain from the function and execution of his episcopal office and from all episcopal and other ecclesiastical iurisdiction during the said suspension under pain of deprivation and removal from his bishoprick

given under our seal the of september


postscript starts here this is a true copy

william bridgman register

ch withdraw gentlemen

have your lordships any further service to command me

ch no
the bishop would have spoken before the sentence was read to have recapitulated the heads of his case and to have offered full proof of his compliance in silensing dr sharp and to have desired since their lordships had hitherto been his accusers and judges they would at last according to the usual custom have been his counsel and ordered their advocate to lay down the nature of the crime the law it offended and the law it was to be punished by that he might have given in his exceptions
but no speaking was allowed till the sentence was read and it had been a folly to speak afterwards

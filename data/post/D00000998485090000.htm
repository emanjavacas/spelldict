Which Hee {reversed semicolon}in the Dayes of his hath setfourth as Similitudes and mysticall Sayinges.
[Figure: will open my Mouth in Prouerbes or Similitudes, and the Actes which haue ben don of olde.
To the Children of Loue and the vpright Disciples of Iesu Christ, it is geeuen to vnderstand the Mysterie of the heauenlie Kingdom: But to Such as are it is not geeuen.
These are the Prouerbes and mysticall Sentences of HN. which Hee {reversed semicolon}in the Dayes of his hath spoken or nakedlie and vncouered, before the Children of the Kingdom and Howse of Loue.
But before such as are in Similitudes or secreat Sayinges.
IN the Begining A] of the Creation of Heauen and of Earth and of the Garnishing of thesame and of the Man Adam, God opened or declared the First of his true Light, vpon the Earth: and ther was not in Heauen nor on Earth nor with the Man, anymore but one Onelie Beeing of God: and thatsame, knew by the Man but Good same also but Good and did also but Good.
But now besides thissame, the Man tooke on him to knowe that which hee knew not to see, that hee sawe not and to doo, that hee did not.
And thatsame which was nothing, was the Euell or Vngodlynes which the Man, in his Fallingaway from God, also, thesame Knowledge wrought in the Man, the Euell or That which is vngodlie because hee knewe or vnderstoode not Thatsame which is nothing, as Nothing and sawe not into it, as Nothing: but accepted thesame for Somthing and vnderstood or conceaued thesame Knowledge, partlie for Good and partlie for Euell.
And through thesame Science or Knowledg, the Man intermixed his Beeing and Memorie {reversed semicolon}which were in all, Good; with the Nothingnes or That which was nothing, being voyde of Beeing and Life which also was nether Nature nor Elementish nether had it any Memorie or Vnderstanding.
And That was the Euell or Vngodlynes, {reversed semicolon}or besides; ye Good or that which is Godlie the Death, insteed of the Life the Lye, insteed of the Trueth the Darknes, insteed of the Light and the disobedient Knowledg which the Serpent requireth, insteed of the Obedience which God requireth: and thesame disobedient Knowledg, is the false Light wherthrough the whole Worlde, is so becom repleanished with Falshod and wherwith also the Man {reversed semicolon}as consubstantiated; hath intermixed himself and which also hath opened his Eyes, to his owne and hee is becom seeing, of that which hee yetnotwithstanding sawe not and knowing also, that which hee knew not: and euenso through thesame false Light of the disobedient Knowledg, Adam tooke on him {reversed semicolon}against God and the Requiring of his Woord; to be wyse and knowledgfull himself, as God: and euenso {reversed semicolon}according to his Knowledg; hee knew both Good and Euell: hee sawe also Good and Euell: hee did likewise Good and Euell: and broughtfourth also good and euell Children.
See ther was with the Man, vpon the Earth Darknes, as Light sowell Falshod and Deceit, as Singlemyndednes and Faithfulnes and Disobedience, as Obedience: So that by that occasion ther was on the Earth, Death, as Life: and the Children of Adam partlie singlemyndedlie and obedientlie, in the Light and were inclyned to the Good: and partlie also subtillie and deceitfull, in the Darknes and were inclyned to the Euell: And those were the Fruites of the Good and of the Euell wherthrough the Iniquitie hath so multiplyed itself among the Children of Men.
Howbeit the Good Fruites increased them continuallie, in the Light and in the Obedience which God requireth: and the Euell Fruites increased them continuallie, in the Darknes and in the disobedient Knowledg, according to the Requiring of the of the Serpent.
But the Euell Fruites augmented or increased them into many Multitudes vpon the Earth: So that the Euell Fruites became in the Darknes then the Good Fruites, in the Light.
And so in the Euell Fruites with the subtill Knowledg in the Darknes, to them the Dominion and vpon ye Earth.
WIth Noe God declared vpon ye Earth, B] the Seconde of his true Light: and made with thesame Light, a Seperation, betwixt the Good and Euell Fruites and betwixt Those that liued according to the Institution of Seth, and were of the right Stocke of the good Beeing of God and Them which had corrupted the Waye of the Fleash and liued after the Lustes of their Concupiscence and were of the Stocke or Rase of the Wicked.
Likewise, at thesame time of Noe, the Lorde destroyed all Fleash that had corrupted his Way, in the Euell and in the Darknes.
And so it became knowen and manifest that the Feare of God, was or rested with the Good Fruites in the Light.
and that ther was nothing but Feare of the Euell, with the Euell Fruites in the Darknes.
And it proceeded, that the Euell and the Degenerated fro~ their right Stocke, enterprised to and sought their Honour and Preseruation through the Workes of their owne Handes.
But God was the Strength and Preseruation of the Good.
And the Euell or Degenerated from their right Stocke, multiplyed them againe into many Multitudes and into manifolde Generations vpon the Earth.
And the Lorde with his Good Frutes, reserued or kept vpon the Earth nomore but one Stocke or Generation that feared Him and liued according to his Lawe: and that was the Generation of Sem, out of Noe.
WIth Abraham God declared, ye Third C] of his true Light vpon the Earth: and made with thesame Light, a Disseuering or betwixt Hys People {reversed semicolon}which Hee chose vnto him as peculiar, to an holie People; and the of People and Generations of the Heathen.
And God set his Couenant betwixt Him and his People and made therwith a Difference, betwixt his People and the vncircumcised Heathen: and God increased and multiplyed his People {reversed punctus elevatus}the Seede of Abraham {punctel} into twelue Generations or Trybes: and they dwelled in the Lande of Egipt, wher they were by the Wicked.
And it had euenso his till vnto Moses, which releassed the Seede of Abraham, from that and lead them out of the Lande of Egipt.
WIth Moses God declared, the Fourth of his true Light, vpon the Earth.
and also manifested therby, which were his Ordinaunces Lawe and Rites, wherin his People had alwayes liued and who were the right Ministers of the of hys Lawe.
And Hee made euenso {reversed semicolon}with thesame Lights a cleere Vnfolding, who they were that loued God and his Lawe or Ordinaunce and beleeued Him. and who dispised Him his Lawe or Ordinaunce and beleeued not.
And it had euenso his Fourthgoing, till vnto Samuel, Dauid, and Salomon {reversed punctus elevatus}the kinglie Seate of the godlie Maiestie{punctel} and till vnto Gods holie Propheates, vnder the Obedience of the kinglie Lawe of the Maiestie of God and of the Ordinaunce of thesame Priesthod.
WIth Samuel, Dauid, and Salomon D] {reversed punctus elevatus}the kinglie Seate of the godlie Maiestie{punctel} and with Gods holie Propheates, vnder the Obedience of the kinglie Lawe of the godlye Maiestie and of ye Ordinaunce of thesame Priesthod, God declared the Fifth of his true Light, vpon the Earth.
And Hee made knowen and manifest with thesame Light, ye Seate of his godlie Maiestie: Also euidentlie expressed, who should buylde a Temple or Howse of hys Dwelling, for Him and his Name and should possesse the Seate of his Maiestie, on the Earth: and who were meete for to minister the and to his Woorde and were sent of Him to that ende: and who were not meete for to minister the and for to the Woorde of the Lorde sent of Him.
And that had euenso his till vnto the Destruction of Ierusalem, of the Temple of the Lorde and of the kinglie Seate of the godlie Maiestie vpon the Earth.
WIth Zorobabel in Babilon, God declared the Sixth of his true Light, vpon the Earth.
And made with thesame Light a cleere Diuersitie, by whom his Vision of Peace was wherthrough the Citie of Ierusalem and the Temple of the Lorde, should be buylded and the People of ye Lorde brought againe and by whom the Vision of Peace was hidden and to whom the Darknes or Blindnes was com wherthrough the People were from the Vision of Peace from the Temple of the Lorde and from their {reversed semicolon}ether Heritage; of God.
as also were in Babilon, and liued in a confused Intanglement: in that they {reversed semicolon}by that occasion; were scattered so in the forraine Regions that they were not all brought againe, to their of God: but many of them remained dispersed in the straunge Countries wheras they could not beholde the holie Citie Ierusalem, nor the Temple of the Lorde the Stoole or Seate of the godlie Maiestie or bring their Oblation and Guiftes to ye Lorde, in his Sanctuarie nor sing their Songes of Sion.
And it had euenso his till vnto Iesus Christ, in the of his Suffering and Death of the Crosse, to the Entraunce into his Glorie at the of God his Father, in the heauenlie Beeing: from whence Hee his holie Spirit on his Disciples To thende that they {reversed semicolon}through thesame holie Spirit; should be his Witnesses and euenso publish to the People of the Lorde, their Releassing and the of the godlie Maiestie. and that thesame was for to com vnto them {reversed semicolon}from the of their God; vpon the Earth.
as also that God {reversed semicolon}at thesame time; wolde iudge the whole Earth with Righteousnes.
WIth thesame Iesus Christ and hys E] Witnesses, God declared the Seuenth of his true Light, vpon the Earth: and made with thesame Light, a Diuersitie or sencible Notice, with whom the vpright Faith of Abraham, and the Annointing of the holie Gost, was: who were the right Children of Abraham: and who acknowledged Iesus Christ, to be their Lorde King and cheef Priest as also Him, vnder the Obedience of the Beleef: And Hee manifested euenso through thesame Beleeuers, that Hee {reversed punctus elevatus}the God of Heauen{punctel} wolde {reversed semicolon}in the appointed Daye of the Comming of Iesus Christ; iudge the whole Earth with Righteousnes and reueale and againe the of his godlie Maiestie, vpon the Earth.
And these Beleeuers in Iesu Christ, and those that in confesse or acknowledg Him according to the Trueth, are the true and holie catholicke Church of Iesu Christ, vnto the which all Heathen and sinfull Men {reversed semicolon}to Repentaunce for their Sinnes and to their Iustification from thesame; are called and bidden, through the Beleef or Fayth of Iesu Christ.
All which verelie {reversed semicolon}from the of the Apostles of Christ; to the Saluation of the Gentiles and of all sinfull Men, which beleeued in Iesus Christ, and repented them to theende that they mought constantlie perseuer {reversed semicolon}vnder the Obedience of the Fayth of Iesu Christ; in the Repentaunce for their Sinnes and so prepare them redie against the Comming of their Lorde Iesus Christ.
and that they mought euenso {reversed semicolon}in the tocomming Daye of the righteous Iudgment of God; be preserued vnto Godlines. and becom Coheyres {reversed semicolon}in the Promises and Testamentes of the holie Fathers; with Israel and Iuda.
And it had euenso his till vnto the of the Holyons of Iesu Christ.
AFter which of the Holyons F] of Iesu Christ, the false Christians together with all Iniquitie and Abhomination of Desolation {reversed semicolon}euenlike as the holie Propheat Daniel, and also Christ and his Witnesses, had forespoken therof; are besides the Church of Christ, vpon the Earth: and haue euenso vpon the Earth, vtterlie the true Holie of ye Church and of the Tabernacle of Iesu Christ.

And this hath had euenso his Fourthgoing, till that the Lord {reversed his mercifull Loue; the gratious Woorde, according to his Promises and elected HN therto, for to minister thesame, vnder the Obedience of his Loue to the Ree~recting or Restoring of his true Sanctuarie and of ye true Offering and Godseruice in thesame.
Through which gratious Woord and HN, God reuealed the Appeering of the Comming of his Christ, and the New Daye of his righteous Iudgment as also the of his holie Spirit of Loue, to the Awaking and Rysingvp of all his Holyons, the Sleape to their with Iesus Christ, and to an euerlasting Kingdom of the godlie Maiestie, vpo~ ye Earth according to his Promises.
hath God declared with HN, G] the Eight of his true Light, vpon the Earth wherin the Lorde {reversed punctus elevatus}the God of Heauen{punctel} restored the former Kingdom with his Garnishing together with all that which God hath spoken from the Beginning of the Worlde, through the Mouth of his holie Propheates and of the Euangelistes of his Christ: and thesame Eight of the true Light of God vpon the Earth, is the New Daye to the Renewing of the Life which God hath appointed, to reueale thesame in the last Time for to iudge in thesame, the universall Earth with Righteousnes to the Condemnation of all the Enemies of God and Christ, together with all the Enemies of the godlie Life and Blaspheamers of his holie Spirit and Seruice of Loue. and to the Erecting of his true Sanctuarie {reversed punctus elevatus}the Seate of his Maiestie and the vpright Gouernment of his Holyons, vnder the Obedience of his Loue{punctel} vpon the Earth and also for to declare euenso vpon the Earth {reversed semicolon}in the same true Light of the New or Eight Daye; the Mysteries of God and Christ, euen from the Be ginning of the Worlde the Ende.

Whosoeuer then doth the Tyme of Grace {reversed semicolon}wherin men may obtaine ye Life of Peace; and respecteth not the same Tyme, with his of Grace {reversed semicolon}whylst that it is yeat present; Hee neglecteth much Good and forsaketh the purchasing of great Riches: and falleth euenso at the last, into manifolde Miseries and into great Paine or Smart of the Heart.
But whoso letteth himself be infourmed and counsailed to the best, by the Wisdom hee may well be comforted.
THer are Many to be found which vtterlie E] contemne ye needfullest Riches {reversed semicolon}wherthrough they mought attaine to the good Dayes;: and applye them to compasse the Slyme of the Earth wherthrough they pluck vpon their owne Neckes, great Pouertie and extreame Miserie.
And albeit that they liue in all Pouertie and Miserie yet are they notwithstanding {reversed semicolon}in that their Miserie; of and and becom thrto very subtill and craftie, in allmaner of Wikednes and Falshod.
Man may also finde many People, which dispise no Riches of God and which also wolde gladlie enter into the Kingdom of God and Howse of Loue and wyan or procure thervnto: But ther are Fewe that prepare themselues vprightlie thervnto. and yet many fewer, that do {reversed semicolon}before all; indeuour them obedientlie, for to becom fruitfull in the holie Worde of Loue and then euenso, to wyne or allure to the Loue and so to increase the Kingdom of the Loue, in all Concorde and Peace.
or a foolish Man {reversed semicolon}whether that hee haue much Knowledg or little; is a poore ignorant Creature that is without God in this World: and whosoeuer will not be counsailed by the Wisdom, through her Seruice of Loue hee in his Good thinking.
When reprooueth a or F] good thinking Man, of his Foolishnes and wolde euenso teach and infourme him aright as also stirre him forward into the right Waye of Life then smyteth and hee also frowneth murmurth and against his Maister or Teacher, all Poyson Bitternes and false Testimonies: but whoso proyseth him in his Follie him doth hee commend for a
haue seene with myne Eyes that ther was a wise Man in the Place and that hee also laye {reversed semicolon} to a Footewispe vnder euerymans Feete: and very fewe receaued his Testimonies and tooke his Contempt to heart.
But saw him with the Righteous and that hee appeered in the Glorie of the Lorde: and became therin so mightie, that all was constrayned to submit itself vnder him.
THe Worlde with her Children and A] Wyse, haue among them Three deceaue able Thinges vnto the which they or exceedinglie: and yet notwithstanding, they fall oftentimes, into great Miserie and and are greeuouslie seduced therby:
The One is that they beleeue vnnatural Thinges or som to without ye right Course or Ordinaunce of Nature or which is not in the power of the Elementes or the Nature for to doo.
And those manifolde vayn Foythes, cause such Variaunce Diuision among the People and do breede also with Many, a false Opinion and great Errour.
An Other is that they indeuour them to obtaine and hunt or labour after somthing, which to themselues and that also is not {reversed semicolon}in their Goodthinking or Opinion; to be attaynedvnto of them.
The Thirde is that they afflict themselues with sorrowe for that they are not able to get those Thinges, which they {reversed semicolon}out of their Goodthinking; or but must misse or thesame.
This is assuredlie, a deceitfull Thing that Men {reversed semicolon}for those vayne Thinges cause; bring themselues into great and into much Miserie.
And thatsame worketh at the last {reversed semicolon}through Infidelitie and Doubtfulnes; a greeuous and Estraying of Mindes, among many People.
Haue seene vpon thissame Earth, that B] ther were wicked Men which bruted or defamed the good and singlemynded Men as likewise the godded or illuminated Elders in the Seruice of Loue, with of Wickednes: and made vnto themselues a Pretence or Shewe of Iustice.
Thatsame is surelie a great and haynous Falshod vpon the Earth.
haue also seene that wicked Men themselues {reversed semicolon}with false Matiers; against ye Righteous and their iust Matiers or Causes: and haue euenso {reversed semicolon}with false Matiers; pleaded their cause in the Lawe, against the Righteous and their iust Matiers: and oppressed euenso iniuriouslie {reversed semicolon}with subtill Prudentie, in ye Lawe; the righteous Men and their iust Matiers.
And sawe that the Iudges themselues did not perceoue tooke they the Matiers to heart.
And thatsame is among the Children of Men, a detestable Abhomination.
Ther are likewise to be found vpon the Earth, many Wrooters which haue ye nature of Swyne and do alwayes {reversed semicolon}resembling the Swyne; with their vnwashed Srowtes, wrooting or moyning ouer the Earth and couet very gladlie, whersoeuer they can finde or sent any Dirt or Filthynes; to wallowe in the Dirt and Filthynes: yea and generallie, they also desire to continew them in thesame Nature.
For although they should be washed or that one desired to wash them yet regarde they not {reversed the Fairnes but wallowe euen againe in the Dirt and Filthines.
Ther are also found vpon the Earth, Highflyers C] which {reversed semicolon}resembling the Eagle; will euen to the Skye: and so {reversed semicolon}through their high Flying; they gather many deadlie Windes: and bring euenso {reversed semicolon}with their Winges; thesam noysom and deadlie Windes, on the Earth wherout manye Men are brought to death and so dye therof in their Sinnes and perrish with the Vngodlie of the wicked Worlde.
And yet those Flyers perceaue it not: nether do they likewise vnderstand what is most requisite or needfull for the Children of Men {reversed semicolon}vpon the Earth; for to
haue seene moreouer, that the Feathers of many of those {reversed semicolon}as from their Tyle vpward towardes their Head; and that they could not {reversed semicolon}with their Winges; laue or make Winde, wherwith to flie but whiuered or fluttered nigh vnto the Ground and were {reversed semicolon}in their Flying and Gathering of Winde; altogether without might: and remained euenso creaping and flapping with their Winges, vpon the Earth.
Wherthrough many lost their on the Earth and could not preiudice or indamage the Men anymore, with their deadlie Windes.
Ther is a vehement and blustering Winde from Heauen, euen vnto the Earth wherthrough all such as dwell vpon the Earth, are greatlie striken with Feare.
Yea the Lyons in the Wildernes are therthrough with exceeding great Feare: so that by that occasion, all their Might and faileth them and they haue not Lust, to deuour any liuing Beastes: but they feede with the Oxen and eate Strawe.
THe Wisdom and the Loue {reversed semicolon}which haue D] the smallest Estimation and are regarded on the Earth; practised their Skyll, vpon the Earth and prepared against the last Tyme {reversed semicolon}wherin all Destruction and Falshod itself; an vncorruptible Arke vpon the Earth to an euerlasting Preseruation of ye Generation of Mankinde [namelie for the Remnant, the Righteousons] in the Perrishing of the last wicked Worlde which is full of Iniquitie and shall be consumed with Fyre.
Which vncorruptible Arke, is not made of Wood with Pitch, for that it mought therby fleete or swymme on the Waters was the Arke {reversed semicolon}in the time of Noe; when the former wicked World perrished: but it is made and prepared of the Golde for to assemble and all Soules of pure Heartes and to reserue them to a Remnant vpon the Earth, in the Perrishing or of the last wicked World which shall be consumed or burnt with the Fyre.
For that cause now (namelie to the Preseruation E] of all vpright Heartes, in the Perrishing of the peruerse Worlde) hath the Wisdom and the Loue, very cunninglie made or prepared thissame Arke, of the Golde To thend that thesame and all Such as enter or are comprehended therin, may {reversed semicolon}without damage; from the Burning of the Fyers Vehementie, wherthorough the last wicked Worlde shall perrish.
THe North Windes arose with a great and boysterous Tempest and fell with great Force into the Sea and vpon the Earth: in that the Sea was {reversed semicolon}aboue measure; exceedinglie troubled, with thesame Windes: Yea so troubled and chafed, that the Waues of the Sea arose and beate so mightelie against that all the on the Sea, fead {reversed semicolon}with their Shippes; to the Lande for to sucker or preserue their Lyues on the Earth.
Howbeit, with thesame North Windes and great boysterous Tempest ther became Seuen hellish Dragons {reversed semicolon}with great Might and Dominion; soring or whiuering ouer the Earth and spetfourth ouer all Landes, much terrible Fyre with many cruell to the Destroying of the Men which dwelt vpon Earth.
This terrible Fyre with his cruell Fyreflames, F] made such a dreedfull Burning and a terrible Cracking of burning.
and all Men Foules and Beastes, made so great a Chritch and horrible Crye that many on the Sea, were so exceedinglie astonyed and striken with feare that they durst not approch to any Countrie of the whole Worlde: but chose to suffer Shipwrack in the Sea and so to perrish then to turnethem to that great Calamitie and Miserie of the Earth and so to be through the terrible Fyre of the hellish Dragons.
This is {reversed semicolon}doubtles; the extreamest Woe {reversed semicolon}in the Sea and vpon the Earth; of all the Woes that shall fall ouer the Vngodlie in the dreedfull great Daye of the Lorde and of his righteous Iudgment.
ISRAEL and IVDA were in tymespast A] so bewtifull Virgins that the great King {reversed punctus elevatus}the Lord of all{punctel} tooke them vnto him in Wedlocke to his beloued Wiues: and set euenso all his Loue and on Them.
Hee adourned them with all costlie Iewels Bracelets wrought of of and with the Pearles and pretioust Stones: and made them euenso very gorgeous and glorious, aboue all the Women and Virgins of the Heathen.
Hee begat also by them many faire Children: They likewise vnto him exceeding faire Daughters which Hee and set by: so that Hee also promised to geeue vnto them in Mariage, his onlie Sonne which sa vpon his Seate with Him and raigned with Him in his Kingdom and which also was his Hyre in all his Riches If they behaued themselues honestlie and turned not themselues to of Whordom.
And according heervnto, so were the Daughters of Israel and Iuda {reversed semicolon}in these Promises; nourrished and in all Honestie and
and were likewise daylie, very earnestlie warned, to beware of all Fornication as also infourmed with Wisdom, that they should {reversed semicolon}in their pure maydenlie Bodies, from all Pollution of the Whordom till that they were meet to be maryed and that their promised Brydegroome ioyned himself vnto them.
But they now were thus broughtvp B] in all Honestie and good Discipline and became mariageable. and were wooed and by their promised Brydegroome (for whom they were so for to be maried then were they much to prowde or statelie and to in the reputation of their Honestie for to submit them to their promised Brydegroome and to geeue themselues vnto Him in Mariage: and refused euenso for to com to their promised Brydegroome.
They wolde not moreouer {reversed Hee shewed himself vnto them in all Humilitie; knowe nor receaue Him for their promised Brydegroome: For Hee came vnto them and and they haue euenso {reversed semicolon}for his Humilitie and Meekmindednes cause; dispised Him and determined with themselues to tarie for som Other: and haue euenso remayned for a long time, without any Brydegroome.
NOw when that thissame Sonne of the great and mightie King, was thus refused of his beloued Frindes (Nea {reversed semicolon}which yet was more; they hated Him and draue him awaye from among them) So turned Hee him then {reversed semicolon}or cast his fauour; to the Heathen which liued in all and in Whordom and whose Bodies also {reversed semicolon}euen from the Head to the Feete; were altogether polluted and full of vncleane Spottes.
Euenso verelie, was this and renowmed C] Sonne of the King, inforsed to forsake those his elected, Frindes {reversed punctus elevatus}the bewtifull and modest Daughters of Israel and Iuda{punctel}: and Hee wooed the polluted Daughters of the Heathen to see if peraduenture they wolde receaue Him into their Loue: To the which louelie Proffer of His, the polluted Daughters of the Heathen gladlie consented: and they began euenso, to turne their Loue {reversed semicolon}with submitted Hunalitie great towardes Him.
And euenso, in this of theirs this Sonne of ye puissant King turned his Loue to the Daughters of the Heathen and chose to take them vnto him in Matrimonie.
And thatsame caused Hee to be published {reversed semicolon}through his Messengers; vnto them, to a ioyfull Message: and also to be signified vnto them that Hee wolde purifie them and make them bewtifull Virgins also throughlie purge or {reversed semicolon}with his pure and healthsom Water; all the Filthines and Spottes of their Bodie and so take them {reversed semicolon} to a pure immaculate Bryde; vnto him in Mariage: Conditionallie, that they should {reversed semicolon}for their part; goodwillinglie turne them away, from all their Whordom also haue a stedfast Beleef or Confidence {reversed semicolon}to the Purging of their Whordom; on Him and to Him and therto an vpright Testimonie of Repentaunce, that they leftof their Whordom. and euenso an vpright ought to deale toward her right Husband) altogether cleaue or vnto Him alone So wold Hee then likewise {reversed semicolon}in all faithfull Loue; keepe him vnto Them.
At which Message, the Daughters of the D] Heathen were exceeding ioyfull and gaue great Laude and Thankes {reversed semicolon}with all Humilitie; to the great King {reversed punctus elevatus}the Father of thesame Sonne{punctel} for the great Grace and mercifull Loue which happened and was extended towardes them: And they receaued euenso thesame {reversed semicolon}with intire and plaine Intent; to heart with purpose to doo euenso: and applyed them {reversed semicolon}with all Diligence; to accomplish all that which was told them by their Brydegroome and by his Ministers, before them: in that this Sonne of the great and mightie King, had {reversed semicolon}in all their Diligence and Feruentnes to accomplish his Will; a in them and with great Lust and Loue towardes them.
Hee heald himself also with his Loue, whollie to them for that they mought be throughliepurged.
Hee decked them with all kinde of costlie Attire of golden Iewels and with of fyne and pretious Stones as also with the Pearles: so that they {reversed semicolon}in Bewtie and and in all costlie Riches and triumphant Glorie; excelled and passed the Daughters of Israel and Iuda.
Now when these and bewtifull E] Daughters of the Heathen, were thus {reversed semicolon}in all Loue and Faithfulnes; maried to this Sonne of ye King.
and that they became euenso {reversed semicolon}like as an vpright with her Husband; of with Him So brought they fourth then vnto Him, manye faire Virgins and chast Daughters and they brought them vp for Him in all and Honestie: and it was in promised vnto them all {reversed semicolon}in their honest or verteous that they should also haue thesame noble ritch Sonne of ye King, to their Lord or Husband.
HOwbeit, many of ye Daughters of the Heathen, did not vprightlie vnto the right Coniunction with that noble Sonne for to keepe themselues constantlie {reversed semicolon}with faithfull Loue; vnto Thesame, their promised Brydegroome.
They fayled not to chalenge vnto them the Name and the Honour, that they stoode with the noble Sonne and walked in his Doctrine or Discipline: but ye Deede {reversed semicolon}to thapproouing of their singleminded Obedience and Faithfulnes; grew {reversed semicolon}in veryemuch diminished.
And they now heard of the and which the Sonne of the King, bare towardes their Mothers.
and that Hee {reversed semicolon}for their Loues sake; had forsaken his deerest Louers {reversed punctus elevatus}the Daughters of Israel and Iuda {punctel} So waxed they then somuch the statelier and arroganter bragging veryemuch of the Grace or Fauour which was shewed vnto them: so that they became therthrough verye to a more Extolling of themselues in their Disobedience and Presumption: and dispised euenso the sorrowfull and or desolate Daughters of Israel Iuda: and vpbrayded them {reversed semicolon}with of the Indignation and Desolation, into the which they were fallen.
Moreouer in this their Presumption and F] Pride, these Daughters of the Heathen beganne to forget and to neglect, to keepe themselues pure or chast from all Fornication and to remaine faithfull to their Lorde, to whom they had promised all Fidelitie: and turned them eue~so to straunge Men: and receaued into their Howses, the Enemies of their promised Brydegroome: and committing adulterie with thosesame, they brake ye band of Wedlock, which they had vowed vnto him: and reioyceing them in their Whordom, they bragged still neuerthelesse of their Lorde {reversed punctus elevatus}the Sonne of the great King{punctel} that Hee was their Husbande and that They, were his elected Wife.
And euenso {reversed semicolon}vnder that Couering of Bosting, of the Name of that noble and renowmed Husband, that Hee was their right Husband. and They, his right Espowsedwife; they committed incessantlie fornication {reversed with of straunge Men: and did not once thinke, to turne them therfrom or to vpright Fruites of Repentaunce for thesame: but became euenso {reversed semicolon}in their Whordom; the lenger the more, polluted defiled.
NOw when that these desolate Daughters of Israel and Iuda, perceaued the vncomblie and shamefull Fornication of ye Daughters of the Heathen and how that they greatlie polluted themselues with all Straungers So could they not then in be perswaded, that the of the Daughters of the Heathen {reversed semicolon}of whom they so bosted; was the right Sonne of the great and mightie King which was promised in Matrymonie vnto them: but haue therfore {reversed semicolon}in their Ignoraunce; dispised that noble Sonne of the King and iudged Him to be false.
and that Hee was a Louer of Whordom and of all Vncleanenes. and could not by any meanes beleeue, that Hee was the right Lord or Husband of the Daughters of Israel and Iuda.
And the Daughters of Israel and Iuda remained euenso {reversed semicolon}in this Vnbeleef; as Orphantes, without Father as desolate Widowes, without any Husband and as contracted without a Brydegrome.
And in all this and Heauynes, G] they hanged or cast downe their Heads also sighed and prayed.
But as they sawe not rightlie into their Offences acknowledged wherfore they were forsaken so were they not pityed nor yet of their Lorde and King.
BVt when as now these vnfaythfull Daughters of the Heathen, had thus {reversed semicolon}a liued and walked in all maner of Whordom and Vncleannes.
as also estraunged themselues so vtterlie from the honest Matrimonie and faithfull Loue of their Husband. and yet heald them still neuerthelesse by their high Bosting, that They were the right So became they at the last {reversed semicolon}in their Whordom and Vncleanenes; diuided into many Partes and fell euenso to sharpe contention one against about the right Husband (namelie who should haue Him to be their Lorde or Husbande and which Sort or Sect was his right and euenso (lie as all Whoores and vse to doo) they vbrayded with their Adulterie and discouered among themselues Shame and Vchastitie: Though each Sort manifested their Owne, with the of their adulterous Deedes vncircumcised false Heartes.
And although now that nether of these diuided Sectes or Partes of the adulterous Daughters, was purged from their Whordom and Vnchastitie had any vpright Fruites of Repentaunce Yet bosted and bragged notwithstanding each Sect that they {reversed semicolon}in their Whordom; were the right of the Husband: and that All ye other, were Straungers therfrom.
THissame continued and had {reversed semicolon}in suchsort; H] his with ye Daughters of ye Heathen till that the Time was fulfilled, that {reversed semicolon}out of the Loue of God the Father and out of the Seruice of thesame Loue; the Cleernes of the vpright Matrimonie of the promised Sonne of the King and the vpright Fourme of his right was witnessed, declared, and euidentlie signified {reversed semicolon}through HN, Gods elected Minister; on the Earth.
and that the Lorde {reversed semicolon}vnder the Obedience of his Loue; became mercifull againe vnto his People: and euenso {reversed semicolon}with his Loue and with the Loue of his deere Sonne; called and inuited the Generations of Israel and Iuda, together with all People and Heathen {reversed semicolon}which confessed their Faultes and Whordom and had a Lust to the right Matrimonie; vnto the right Mariage: and euenso they all {reversed semicolon}which beleeued his Woord of Grace; became renewed in their Vnderstanding and were brought againe, in the Obedience of ye Requiring of his Seruice of Loue as also established in the Faithfulnes of his Loue.
WHo that shall iudge the A] Wisdom be able to interprete her mysticall Prouerbes seeing that Shee her Prouerbes are knowen nor iudged of but of the Children which are borne out of ye Wisdom? For those knowe Her and can interprete her parabolous Sentences.
and the Loue vttereth her Vnderstanding, to her Louers to thende that they should heare and vnderstand thesame in secreat and then tell it fourth againe openlie.
THe God of Heauen {reversed semicolon}as the Father himself; is and Hee bringeth {reversed semicolon}in the Seruice of his Loue; Himself, with his Christ and and with all that which with Him is Gods, vnto his obedient Man HN.
And goding thesame with Hym, Hee hath manned hym with thesame: and his Will is, that now in the last tyme {reversed semicolon}through his Seruice of Loue; all People or Generations of Men, which are goodwilling to his Righteousnes, should assemble them vnto Him and his godded Man: and euenso likewise with them, all that which is manlie To thend that they all should becom with Him and his godded Man and so be all named Gods and Children of the Mosthighest.
For euenso, in thesame and [namelie God, with all what is Gods and the Man, with all what is manlie] it all what is not Gods nor Manlie, becometh through God and the Man, vtterlie condemned.
Beholde That is now in thissame Daye, Gods Iudgment and the Iudgment of the conioyned Man vnto his God, according to the Righteousnes.
And the Publishing of thissame Iudgment vpon the Earth, is a ioyfull Message and good Tydinges, vnto all goodwilling Men for to applye them to thesame Coniunction: and it is also to a Life and Ioye in the Godlynes, vnto all such as beleeue that the God of Sion, is {reversed semicolon}in suchsort; becom King vpon the Earth.
THe Man is {reversed semicolon}in his Estraunging from B] God; sayled or so farre {reversed semicolon}in the Shipfaring of his great Knowledge; in the mayne wilde Sea that hee is altogether or wandereth and fayleth to be directed anylenger by the true Course of his Compasse: but sayleth at aduenture now heere and then theare, in the vncertaine places.
And hee supposeth to haue found a good Land, to his Preseruing so perceaueth hee then that hee is vtterlie deceaued therin and that hee hath not yeat attayned to the right good Lande.
Now when the Man hath gotten a great Lust, for to inherit the Promises of the Blessing and to com into the good Lande, wheare Honye and Milke floweth so vpp then in the Man, a for to be made an Heyre in thesame Blessing.
Out of the ther the tryed Knowledg of the Mans Vnabilitie and Vnwisdom for to attaine as out of his owne Selfnes.
Out of the tryed Knowledg of the Mans Vnabilitie Vnwisdom, ther Two Parties, one against another.
The One Partie, is the Vnbeleef and Dispaire, C] for to be able {reversed semicolon}by to thatsame at Gods handes, which the diligent Man so seriouslie
The Other Partie, is the Beleef Hope, to obtayne thesame by Gods Grace, through the Almightines of God and his Christ: For the Beleef knoweth that all {reversed semicolon}what is vnpossible with the Man; is possible with God.

And out of the Disobedience vnto the holie Woorde and his Requiring, ther aryse the manifolde goodthinking Wisdoms of Men and the of false Expoundinges or Interpretations of the holye Scripture together with ye lying deadlie Gloses.
But out of the Beleef and Hope, ther aryseth the Obedience vnto the holie Woorde and the Requiring of his Seruice of Loue.
And out of the Obedience to the holie Woorde and to the Requiring of his Seruice of Loue, ther aryse the Consolations of Men, in the for the Lorde, in their

At that time ther is found by the Beleeuers D] and Obedientons, the Trueth and Loue and all Concorde and Peace.
But with the Vnbeleeuers and Disobedientons, not but Wisdoms together with all Contention Schisme and Partialitie and all Falshod Deceit and Faynednes: wherwith they intangle or snare of them and so remaine without the good Lande of Promise.
And euenso {reversed semicolon}through these of becom these Two Parties seperated the one from the other like as the Sheepe fro~ the Goates.

That Those which will speake much of the C] Trueth will not yet themselues once heare the Trueth nether can they thesame?
That Those which were Disciples, vnder the holie Vnderstanding themselues as Maisters of the holie Vnderstanding. and take vpon them, to and teach the holie Vnderstanding and to iudg thesame according to their owne Minde?
That the Needie and such as haue no Bread themselues in their Spences or Bynnes, go and call Com fetch Bread Com fetch Bread wee haue aboundaunce therof?
How cometh it, that the hungrye Bellyes after the Bread, suffise them with the Winde and Fame of Bread: and euenso {reversed they had eaten indeede and were satisfied; holde themselues contented?
From whence haue ye Presumptuous {reversed semicolon}which are themselues the Church of Christ, and haue neuer seene nor knowen any one Stone of thesame; taken such an Arrogantie on them, that they will the Stones vnto them also cowch and dawbe them together with deceitfull Morter and so a Church of Christ: and do not once perceaue, that their Worke auayleth not nor cometh to perfection?

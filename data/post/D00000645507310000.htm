but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ

the penman of this epistle is specified in the first chapter and first verse thus peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ
the persons to whom this epistle was dedicated to such as from free grace had obtained like precious faith with them that were of the privy councell the apostles by the righteousnesse of our god and saviour jesus christ verse the first even to such contemned condemned poore scattered ones through

pontus galatia cappadocia asia bythinia as in

the scope is to forewarne them of dangerous dayes and perillous times approaching in which many will endeavour to pervert their life and subvert their faith even to the making shipwracke thereof whereby they might prove as ignominious to themselves so inglorious to the gospell of jesus christ he therefore in the precedent and in this present chapter reminds them of divers and dangerous positions and practices of men that forewarned forearmed and walke as pilgrims and strangers warring against whatever will endanger their precious soules holy faith or godly life not knowing when the day of the lord comes nor with what speed nor dread by a convincing interrogatory he winds up their faith to an exact pitch of the power of godlinesse and holy conversation verse
seconded by variety of arguments ver
that they may keep themselves from being plucked away with the errour of the wicked either undefined span alphabet or undefined span alphabet which to prevent he prescribes my text as an antidote
as the last words usually best

remembred so but grow
the words containe a needfull direction for all christians scattered to and fro throughout the face of the whole earth
if any aske the question what is required in the text tis answered to grow in what in grace and knowledge of whom our lord and saviour jesus christ in what order here the method in grace and knowledge from which might be raised these three observations

first tis our duty to grow in grace
ob&ser

secondly tis our duty to grow in ob&ser knowledge

thirdly tis our duty to grow in grace ob&ser and knowledge

shall insist on the first only

tis the duty of christians to grow in grace
in the handling of which

shall according to my usuall method first open the termes of the doctrine grow and grace secondly prove the point by the undefined span alphabet of scripture and undefined span alphabet of reason and thirdly make the use and application and the strength and blessing of the lord be in and on us all

to grow is a metaphoricall expression and may fetch its illustration from

plant trees flowers corn which from small spires sprigs seed augment spread enlarge themselves so may be said to increase grow this the word undefined span alphabet signifies as these grow deeper bigger stronger higher so must a christian sprout flourish waxing stronger and stronger in the strength of the lord and power of his might or to grow may send forth an understanding to us of the duty by observing of our naturall or civill growth as we desire to manifest our selves by our long trading to be richer wiser better so by our longer continuance under the breathings of the spirit in shew ye your selves to have received an increase of more light life zeale love knowledge this is to grow in grace
conceive the grace in the text is not that grace of graces free and perfect displaid upon a soule by the infinite riches of wonderfull mercy that admirable free full grace of justification
but by grace here the graces of gods holy spirit through the word with power and life conveighed into the beleevers soule by the holy ghost which may therefore fitly

be phrased the fruit of the spirit

which are thus in apostolicall account enumerated love joy peace gentlenesse goodnesse faith meeknesse temperance
these are graces of gods spirit and this grace in the text includes the graces of this kind in which we must endeavour to grow to which knowledge is added in the verse even that distinct understanding of divine truths revealed in the word concerning the knowing of god and christ whom to know aright is not lesse then life eternall

the summe is that little grace of gods spirit in thee thou must be sure to act that it increase more and more that as to men there is evident a growth in your body so to god and men you may make it apparent there is an increase in your soule in the gracious exercise of a conscience and conversation void of offence before god and man
this conceive with submission to better judgements the sence of the terme of the text
proceed to the point to be proved

tis a christians duty to grow in grace which growth may have a reference

to the number of graces or to the measure of graces in respect of both we must grow

this paul adviseth corinth

therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in love to us see that ye abound in this grace also a bundle of beautifull excellencies are here collected
and our apostle in the first chapter the fifth sixth and seventh verses and besides this give all diligence adde to your faith vertue and to vertue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godlinesse and to godlinesse brotherly kindnesse and to brotherly kindnesse charity
an addition increase and growth of graces in the number
is not this intimated in the parabolicall history of the lord and his servants concerning the expected increase of the talents in which the honouring encomiums speaking them good and faithfull that increased and multiplyed their two to other two their five to ten with an euge well done good and faithfull servant thou hast been faithfull over a few things will make

thee ruler over much enter thou into thy masters joy

for the growth of the measure of grace grow in it hath not christ given grace that wee should grow to a higher measure even to the perfecting of the saint and come up to the measure of the stature of christ the fulnesse of christ

paul greatly rejoyced hearing the faith of the thessalonians grew so exceedingly and their charity toward each other so abounded

to this paul expects in the

that as they had received of them that were dispensers of the so they would walke in pleasing god and abound therein more and more as in the place as man so god calls for more weight more measure to adde to the number and measure of grace grow
christians had need to looke to their growth non est bonus qui non vult esse melior hee that hath no care for the growth of his grace will soone bring the truth of his grace into suspition by an apostaticall revolt or levity in being removed from or wavering in the first and best principles

need we have to grow in grace from the undefined span alphabet to the undefined span alphabet

rea&s the lord hath more to bestow on thee than yet appears to be in thee what ever grace thou art enriched with god hath more yet in the granary of his goodnesse for a poor soule think not thy selfe more than a broken cistern plume not thy selfe to sing a requiem to thy soule as if thou hadst grace holinesse righteousnesse knowledge enough bee not deceived whoever thou art endowed with an admired competency of gifts and graces yet you need more than yet you enjoy that great measure of knowledge is not the least of that you are ignorant of should say be yee warm'd and filled and give not that which is needfull for the body it would little profit should preach grow in grace and not tell you god hath more for you than yet appeares in you lesse reason to be up and doing
but god is an inexhausted fountaine that both can and will bestow more upon every soule that truely desires the growth of grace aske thy soule if it had not need be better stocked and more stirre

up it selfe to lay hold on god if he wil not give further supply of grace and knowledge tis my happinesse know in my need how to be furnished it shall bee my reason therefore ile grow

therefore grow in grace the more rea&s grace the more strength the infusion of grace puts life and energy into the soule the addition of grace renewes the active faculties with greater strength that as of the heroick champions enroll'd in the eleventh chapter of the hebrewes of weake by the grace of faith they became strong strong to an unmatchable power so by the growth of grace the soule that was wont to be as water becomes to be as strong as steele it selfe the apostles witnessing the truth of this to the world
the want of saving grace hinders the want of saving knowledge that enlightens emboldens when heaven afforded many an advantagious opportunity to satisfie thy darkened judgement doubting spirit let mee appeale if thou hast not returned home likewise as came out the sad experience of our owne heart dictates

want of grace proudly kept backe that in many things we remaine as newborne babes poore weake creatures
the truth of grace christian quickens but the growth of grace strengthens thy soul that panoply of god makes the saints strong the breathing of the spirit of grace makes a stripling more puissant than the goliah's of the nations
tis recorded of father abraham being not weake in faith he staggered not at the promises of god but being strong in faith hee beleeved in hope even against hope

christians meet with principalities powers and the rulers of the darknesse of this world a terrible army how shall a poore soule encounter with this maine body when onely the strength he hath is little more than a forlorne hope let him strengthen himselfe with the graces of gods spirit and hee shall finde a power invincible none more need of strength than a poore christian the more grace the more strength whether


against sin that is not satisfied with a being in but would dominiere

over a christian or what strugling with secret corruptions as wrastling with too many corruptions hard to be subdued enforcing paul to cry out

oh wretch who shall deliver me from this body of death oh the sobs and groanes teares and feares of a weak christian when corruptions begin to discover themselves then they in apprehension the undone of all the world amaleck fights and sometime prevails the want of strength foiles the soule the height of grace upholds the soul the more grace the more strength against sinne

against suffering the church and people of god meet with opposition contradiction persecution who more it was the fathers appointment as the sonnes prediction

and this apostles the great doctor of the gentiles oft in sacred writ to passe by bad report hunger nakednesse prison tis difficult for some not all
when strongly growne in the grace of christ paul can conquer the apostles with admired resolution daunt their enemies when formerly all left he lord jesus christ and why they

were growne in grace and more grace more strength against suffering


against temptation our saviour would not have taught his disciples to pray lead us not into temptation had not he known the devill and an evill heart laid snates to tempt which of gods choisest jewels free not abraham job david not christ himself and canst thou expect or request to be above thy lord poor weak christian thou must look to be buffeted assaulted
labor for more grace so more able to resist for by the grace of god you may stand as withstand


against desertion the more grace the more strength
tis a condition gods people sometimes meet with and complaine of a bitter expostulation my god my god why hast thou forsaken faith and feare in a double combate whither in reference to david the type or the son of david the antitype the lord christ and may not your full tide ebbe your bright moon ecclipse your fair day cloud and your clear sun misten oh know ye that are dandled in the armes of an everlasting god may yet not be

ever danced in gods everlasting arms he may shoot bitter arrows against you and his everloving smile may frown it self to a momentary indignation as bitter as death as dreadfull as hell it self labour therefore for more grace so more strength to suffer all and endure hardship as the good souldier of jesus christ
so that either silently with aaron hold your peace or with david religiously language it is the lord let him do as seemeth him good
the more grace the more strength in all against all
ergo

the more grace the more comfort rea&s many that regard not to live conscionably yet are desirous to spend their years in prosperity and their daies in comfortable pleasures but as without grace little conscience so without true grace little true comfort the more sin in us the more opposition the more trouble griefe and fearefull horrour to the appaling of spirit and deading of heart
but let a soul reflect and in simplicity speak an increase of humility faith zeal love knowledge grace more comfort questionlesse not more rejoicing can a condemned malefactor

receive by the tender of a princes pardon than a poor soul comfort content in the truth and growth of grace were it not for the grace of god in them of all men christians were most miserable in the sad apprehension of many and mighty corruptions within them diverse and great troubles upon them and severall scandalous reproaches against them whither shall the soul search for comfort to whom fly for solid consolation can that honour that is fading that estate that is flying that name that is blasting that friend that is dying afford any alas miserable comforters all nothing so much as the least spark of divine grace and if a little will cherish what strong consolations will the growth added to the truth of grace afford view and review the instances of sacred writ and you shall find where most grace there most comfort therefore grow in grace

rea&s this comfortable evidence the sincerity and truth of your grace shew me your faith by works a dead faith no life in works the soule is barren and unfruitfull what is a body without a

soule a poor body what is a soule without grace a poor soul and what is grace without the growth thereof uncomfortable grace what advantage to have a name to live and want life what profit to have a forme and void of the power of godlinesse this will upon good ground witnesse to the world the truth of grace is in you when they see your light shine that they may glorifie your father in heaven and your light which was at first as the dawning of the day appearing as the sun heightned to the top of the zenith fairly discovers the truth of grace in you to men and to conscience an evidentiall sign of truth when that which flames as a fire begins to live to a never dying worm tis quenched and crashed by this my conscience bears me witnesse that though my beginning was small yet am encreased to a second a fift a tenth talent behold oh conscience did make bones of curse lye oath sabbath gospell ordinance hypocrisie pride passion secret impiety or open enormity in times past and do not dost not thou oh conscience oh

heart hate and abhor every false way dost not performe and delight to do what god pleaseth pressing hard to be found in the righteousnesse of jesus christ who in my infancy hoped to be justified by duties desires whence comes my love to god and his whence patience zeal faith more then in times past comes not my growth from my truth oh enemy be my judge speak righteously
and to god also when at the houre of death day of judgement summoned to appear disarmed of all hopes helps no more muse or burroughs to save or shelter this will witnesse for thee though thou hast been a poor comfortlesse one yet a true one behold lord thy talent hath gained multiplied tis encreased and grown though little yet good evidence the truth of grace is in thee when as on the contrary to man to conscience to god have no more grace now then from my infancy and day of youth this comes off with sin shame sorrow to the blacknesse of despaire it selfe therefore being the growth of grace evidences the truth of grace good reason we should grow in grace

according to my usuall method proceed to the use

learn hence the life of a christian v&se must be a life of action

tis shamefull impiety to practice when once enlightned graced from god with precious truths promises privileges nothing such a lazy devotion as brings in question the truth of grace grace will make us faithfull husbands wives servants as christians if man cannot endure a lurdan lozell god cannot endure a loitering idle christian nor in reference to the things of this life or that which is to come know not a christian as a man or woman but have or might have employment or in works of necessity or charity and as a christian man or woman hath to work out salvation a work hard enough to so far from thinking them idle drones that may spurre them to be as busie as the bee and all little enough to give a good account at the last day jacobs ladder is usually applyed here as angels some ascending some descending but none standing still to intimate so it must be in the church of god either looking up to god or into

the soul that admire god for his majesty glory mercy or humble our selves for our unworthinesse sin and iniquity
did not god set his adam presently after he had made him a living soule into the garden to dresse it so to become a labouring soule and why but to tell the children of adam that they must not be without motion action god gives no supersedeas for a christian to be idle or standing still nay he checks with a why stand you idle all the day long

tis here in the text required that he be doing thriving growing grow in grace this of the first use

v&se if a christians duty be to grow in grace try we then whither we have performed this duty or no
but how may know answer


they are grown more and better in duties grace is like ezekiels waters though little at first discovers it self by streames to run rivolets rivers to waters impassable or as fire that encreases in light heat more greater so grace in growth makes a christian in his duties more frequent whereas before he would court the lord in a

morning so bid him good morrow or complement with a goodnight he now begins to be more frequent grace acts him to morning evening and when occasion serves at midnight as at first seldome since he is grown more frequent


they are more fervent more zealous if not could question that truth as growth of grace though at first grace as fire of which comparatively we say tis a cold fire so a soul finds it self in the dutie of hearing praying receiving cold devotion in all chill almost stiffe but by that time encreased grown grown warme undefined span alphabet seething boyling hot the affections kindled to a flame a zeale as hot as fire


more conscionable what in times past was done in custome formality hypocrisie education selfe is now steeld from conscience he doth it and dare not but do it and delight to do it also he at first saw the observing the ordinances and sabbaths of god his duty now grown beholds them his privilege so that as in time past he acted them as a task now he performes

them as his delight and joy to think of his communion with the lord now he makes conscience and will not omit a duty as not commit a sin he makes conscience of all so doth a christian that is grown in grace discover it in his duties being more frequent at them fervent in them and conscionable of them try and enlarge the particulars in your meditations must hasten


the growth of grace discovers it selfe by the death and dwinging away of sin at first sin lives but when grace comes sin pines and graces growth is sins decay as the house of saul weaker and weaker and the house of david stronger and stronger so grace and sin in the soule
as tis in the body with nature and the humour if the humour prove predominant then nature decaies and soon man is gathered to his fathers but when nature gets the upper hand by degrees the killing humour lessens and abates to a perfect recovery so that the one walkes strongly and comfortably
this grace like his bloud runs through every veine actuates in every faculty of

the soule as the soule in the whole body now mortifying this now crucifying that corruption laying the axe of zeale revenge care to the root and so cuts down root and branch he leaves not a hoofe behind spares not the dalila the darling the sweet bit under the tongue or bosome sin in any corner of his heart nothing in his judgment understanding will memory affections but shall relate to grace the enemy thereof shall be brought and arraigned before jesus christ and cashiered for ever his precious gracious soule he is grown and acts to the utmost as fire heat and water moisten to the utmost so grace that dwinges sin to decay and dye the gallant adonijah shall not be spared the delicate agag not connived at nor the least of his sins if sin against god can be called little but shall be examined traduced and gibbited before the god of israel he spies the inside he views the outside what gracelesse thing is discovered is discarded he abstains from and abhors secret as open wickednesse so that no sin shall have a willing being in his soule but he is

sensible so sensible of their imperfection as a bone in throat or mote in eye never quiet till removed using all means to recover the health of the soule into the state of strength oh try which dwinge and decay grace or sin
so second triall


grown christians more boldly manifest the grace of god in them confidently they dare to speak and act upon the growth than they did upon the first truth of their grace the apostles would flie and deny christ before they would suffer or die but after the truth of their grace faith knowledge was strengthened then they feared not the synods councels of countermanding preaching jesus christ as you that are versed in the acts of the apostles can attest
a soule at first is like nicodemus it loves and would faine be with christ but a great deale of fearefull sin clouds the new inspired grace secretly it dare but appeare for feare of the jews wave quotations for that speak to or am much and mistaken christians but grown as daniel the children they are gloriously manifesting

their zeale for god and none but god though controled by soveraignty itselfe as a child that hath life in operari esse goeth but by this support and that assistance for but weak now new going when a few yeares a shame to hold by a finger chaire stoole but now strength encreasing hee goeth confidently by himselfe so a poore soule at first creeps cannot go but his grace strengthened renewed he ventures in nomine domini as david against goliah and dreads not when all israel is struck with a misgiving doubt if not panick feare
a grown christian manifests his grace by undanted profession in the hardest of persecution and middest of precious name disgracefull slander in a word by what contradiction soever of men opposition of the gates the power and wisdome of hell the poore christians grace is assaulted with it discovers it selfe void of feares as offence in the flames of a sacred love to god christian love to the saints of god in a steadfast resolution to walk up to covenant and gospell reformation and

in a christian deportment of themselves with the exercise of a good conscience before god and man here conceive is growth as truth of grace try oh try if it be thus with thee or not
must hasten time bids a dispatch


they can trust god with outward and inward estate also sometime in weaknesse he feared one sometime the other now steere over both knowing that god hath given the promise to godlinesse of this and that life which is to come
no distrustfull thoughts for things temporall christ hath commanded and his undefined span alphabet warrant for a growne christian

and assured for things of eternity to the truth as growth of grace that nor faint nor feare by which well may the soul relye on the lord for its outward and inward estate
abraham the father of the faithfull sometime doubted but after

try how this reflects on thy soule by a patient humble waiting till god answer


lastly they that are grown in grace grow and endeavour to grow in the knowledge of jesus christ more and

more in the undefined span alphabet undefined span alphabet thereof truly to beleeve god and christ in god and christ and to acknowledge the lord jesus by a separation from the goats and communion with the sheep of christ not only notionally to know and understand more of the history of christ but practically to doe for christ more then in times past that we may read in conversation one sanctified and strengthened in the grace of the lord and experimentally that god may have experience and the world also that their grace is a grace and knowledge of and according to jesus christ making them more humble

and more desirous to know and find more so the truly wise and knowing christian not to display the radiant beames of their vainglorious understanding but to discover the riches of gods free and infinitely full grace to their souls in looking upon them when blind in understanding and unsanctified in heart after this they presse to know more of themselves and more of christ to the praise of the lord their god for bestowing as truth so a growth in grace
try and by this comfortably

conceive growth of grace


now after triall the uses follow of terrour to some comfort to others exhortation to all
if not growne in grace come in come in have bitter things against thee yet shall this law condemne none before it heare him speake ask conscience then if growne in grace whence bleating of sheep lowing of oxen whence in the soule or family or congregation neglect of duties or if performed resting on duties how many cast the word of god behind their backs prophane the sabbath condemne the promises of the everlasting gospell whence is it men trust to and rest in their duties as the hypocriticall jews

rising to too lofty an expostulation in questioning the deity it selfe a nontimely answering regarding their prayers and performances how many as the pharisees vainly gracing themselves

a soule growne in grace would nor make it an idoll nor a slight yet how many of us thus guilty


the falling of too many from their first love like that ephesine

church in the second of the revelation and is not the love and zeale of many waxen cold in this day of affliction in the winter of our adversity when if ever god covenant church and kingdome had need of champions zealous for the glory of the one the renowne of the other the safety and honour of all now but woe and alas oh what cold dead spirits hearts are we possessed withall when at first zealous since remisse matter of humiliation and feare tis neither naturall nor supernaturall for either would make the nearer the center more life vigor and activity let conscience speak if thou didst not in time past better affect gods wayes worship sabbaths ordinances ministers people then now fear we may guilty we are


the pride of thy grace speaks the not growing of grace and how many plume themselves in this unhappy age with the vertue when they put off the grace into what assemblies shall we enter in what company shall we be but god shall be robbed of his glory by mans boasting of his grace grace keeps a

soule low and exalts the lord knowing whatever received received of god the apostle and the strong christian number not themselves with such as commend themselves and measure themselves with themselves for they are not wise

the more grace the more humility while men advance and exalt so as boast of zeale grace john it speaks us not grown


lastly the seldome searching of our hearts speaks no growth of grace if cast not up my account know not whither my receipts or disbursements be most feare a bad reckoning in this the lord be mercifull unto us we know not the windings of our hearts desperately wicked and deceitfull we try not search not how many nay how few sermon after sermon sabbath after sabbath moneth after moneth commune with their owne hearts to see in what this or that grace is increased since the reception of so many mercies when a man seldome looks into his heart cannot conceive how it should be discovered he is growne in grace but must passe sentence speak to wise men are they not blameworthy

and may not


when the lord hath graciously affoorded time and space it was a check severe he gave her space to repent and she repented not

and may not the lord say many a day and yeare have offered free grace stretching out my hand all the day long and ye despighted hitherto the spirit of grace goe gracelesse soule into gracelesse society sad sentence


yea when in that space cal'd and tendred all the means that infinite understanding conceiv'd conducible to the growth of grace no pruning dressing nor watering wanting judge pray betwixt me and my vineyard what could doe more tis heavens gracious condescending appeale oh england what shall doe unto you oh people how should intreat you your goodnesse yet as a morning cloud your grace so far from growing as tis the early dew dismist dispell'd when a father thus by a child or a prince thus by a tyrone the doome of death must follow
a harvest is set and at due time the axe must be laid to the root of the soule and the tree cut downe

what in

christ at his church and ordinance of his profession and not fructifie multiply increase and grow see

he takes away god and god takes away the firme influence of his spirit from the possession of his inheritance he takes away and then the soule withers and withers till fuell for everlasting burning
oh dismall when man endued with such a soul as an angel of god should so undervalue it in the neglect of grace and sleight of god the god of grace such a grace such a god vilifyed what can be expected lesse then the height of calamity and depth of misery to be inflicted while gods justice and satans tyranny shall remain but hoping better things of you and wishing better things to you wave the terrour and passe to the use of comfort

v&se to all such as grow in grace comfort for


thou art more then a naturall man then take comfort wert in nature only could not line or letter of consolation thus but daub with untempered mortar but intituled to or invested with grace true comfort indeed

when a parent sees a child outrun his extravagant courses to become a man and a man of god in the world is it not great comfort so for a beleeving husband or wife to perceive the worke of grace in each other joy to ravishment
nor can the minister be silent in this but when he beholds jesus christ formed in his congregation he must rejoyce with joy unspeakable full of glory for his people being filled with grace and is it not a joy for the church of god nigh you by you so let it be to thy soule also thou art more then a naturall man


art growne in grace herein is comfort that more shall be given thee to him to her that hath shall bee given

more given to you more done for you god himselfe will purge you that yee may bring forth more fruit

the lord seldome never meddles with a soule but it fares the better growes the faster a secret influentiall vertue distils it selfe to the flourishing in grace and duty and perfecting to every good worke this talent doubled thy grace blessed that more and more fruitfull and abundant

in the worke of the lord be comforted


ye can more boldly goe to the throne of grace the growne righteous man as bold as a lion so comfortably a weake babe cannot approach before the presence of a jealous god and consuming fire as one that with resolved exercise of sanctifying grace hath waded through the troubled waters of mortification and landed at the haven of full assurance jesus christ being our warrants it the apostle inferres it

for he by his one oblation for ever hath perfected them that are sanctified

he therefore exhorts and so comforts the saints as

and may not that comfort

but oh see other that younger more illiterate unlearned then have more grace and knowledge of jesus christ then therefore feare the truth the growth of grace and what can take of comfort

and what if so why soul shouldst thou be disquieted take heed of a curious eye when the hand of providence disposes as pleases him beware it displease

not thee lest you murmure and suffer it was none of joshua's vertues to exasperate moses for the prophecying of eldad and medad

but moses is for our imitation and blesse ye the lord that he adds to the number of his church and you behold others to magnifie the name of jesus christ
a grown christians eyes gush out with rivers of teares when men sinne against god and their hearts leap with joy at the conversion salvation of others seeing the gospell of jesus christ inlarged
goe ye and doe likewise ye and they shall have eternall possession be not overwhelmed with sorrow


the lesse ye have the lesse to answer for the lord requires no more then he gives if you have five talents five more will content if you have but two two more will satisfie the lord is not severe austere if you have not an oxe or heifer a goat kid or lamb nay a turtle pigeon god will not extort be but faithfull fruitfull in thy little and he will make thee ruler over much god looks to the truth of thy graces to the quality rather then the quantity so that if but a mite a cup of

cold water accepted rewarded be therefore comforted


thou that growest though but little and other more thou shalt never want thou shalt hold out tis to the happinesse of salvation and why not to the hearts consolation thy grace is gods grace he a fountain when thou beginnest to be dry know god can refresh renew in the prophets phrase end all thou shalt be as a tree planted by the waters whose root spreads out by the river thou shalt not see when heat commeth but thy leafe shall be green thou shalt not be carefull in the yeare of drought neither shalt cease from yeelding fruit


take this for thy comfort and am now dismissing this assembly

suffer but a word of exhortation

v&se first grow grow thrive and prosper in grace and knowledge of god let me crave leave to prescribe meanes to propound motives and have done


exercise of grace that little that truth of grace you have do we not direct use legs and have legs use memory and have memory actions intend habits stirre up and exercise that grace

of god in you and your morning dawning will appeare bright as the sun


unite to gracious company joyn to the assemblies of the saints withdraw not from such as speake to edification giving grace to the hearers the tongues that are tipped with the language of canaan will advantage to enlightning to greater heat and further growth sit not in the seat of the wicked that cooles discourse furthers the schollars studies good counsell helps forward to heaven tis sad because oft too late to say oh that had followed good counsell of such ministers friends parents had never come to this place of execution lest we repent too late use the society of the saints


beware of secret corruption as fame and credit wil keep a natural man from open scandalous transgression let grace and piety keep a spirituall man from secret corruption strive and pray against it as david in the nineteenth psalme
dust coales and such trash in secret will overthrow the stomacke and make the wholsomest food loathsome

so will sinne if we harbour with delight a close iniquity under our tongue it will nauseate all the saving truths of jesus christ gloriously held out in his gospell and hinder the growth of grace

lastly conscionably use the ordinances of god doe not as many for custome formallity but hoc age doe it in the integrity and simplicity of conscience the law and statutes of god

are beneficiall that which issues out of the sanctuary increases

when pray read receive exercise your selves conscionably and your benefit will be profitably discovered to all

the more grace the more exalt christ tis a soules burthen cannot live to honour christ for all his merit goodnesse truths and mercies labour then for more grace so speake more of his name and ye will be in life death to magnifie christ little lower then angels in their praises to their maker grace brings you higher and higher to these seraphicall spirits so you will chaunt the perpetuall hallelujah's with the quire of heaven of

whom christ is to be praised as of you to be honoured


grace makes the more eminent grace and fame are said to be companions as the righteous so the gracious is more excellent then his neighbour the world cleares this truth when the most debauched wretch would not but seeme gracious the strumpet lukewarme laodicea all outwardly as the pharisees yea the devill else why transformed into an angell of light but that with more credit to act in the children of darknesse and heires of light also but grace with god and christ a name better then of sonne or daughter


time may come need of more grace these are the plundring times and exercise the faith and patience of many a precious soule though blessed be god we heare it only with our eares and see it not with our eyes nor feele it to our hearts but a time may come one grace fits not for every temptation no more then one shooe for every foot or one garment for every backe the apostles harnesse in his panoply

that compleat sometime

a christian hath need of this grace sometime of another we know not which god will call us to exercise leave not a hoofe behind as in one grow in all and strengthen every one fearing and feeling the time bad to be worse be not unprovided consider the season and grow in grace


this will keep you true and stedfast to god to christ and the principles of religion that ye waver not in a corklike ventositie to the hazard of faith and a good conscience this will arme you against all delusions errours sinnes feares and keep you entire to christ till you come for ever to be with him where is the crowne of grace glory with which hee confirme you here and assure you hereafter for his owne name and glory sake
consider what have said and the good lord grant you a true understanding in all things that ye may grow in grace knowledge of jesus christ
to whom be glory for ever and ever

in whom we have redemption through his bloud the forgivenesse of sins

paul by the will of god separated to the gospell for the churches sake of the gentiles renders the worke of his ministry faithfull as to others to this church of ephesus which after his apostolicall salute in the first and second verses doth magnifie the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spirituall blessings in heavenly places in christ verse the third
amongst which precious excellencies this in the text for the consolation of the faithfull in christ is little inferiour to life everlasting this being the troublesome obstacle to a beleeving soule till it apprehend jesus christ in whom

it hath redemption

the text contains this truth fully to redeeme from sinne cost no lesse then the bloud of jesus christ or the bloud of the saviour is the redemption of the saints
that this is so why this is so and what use hereof are the three things shall burthen your memory and patience with at this time

that it is so appeares by the text
in whom that is in christ verse
in whom elected ver
predestinated unto adoption ver
in whom we are accepted ver
in whom redemption as in the text we the saints faithfull ver
blessed with all spirituall blessings ver
select paul elect ephesians in christ in whom we have redemption freedome full plentifull freedome the word in the originall having a preposition added speaks the perfection of the redemption to take redemption as in reference to the body or soule here body and soule hereafter no redemption but by christ in whom full redemption redemption is said to be fourefold

first by manumission as lords their vassels freely discharging so christ by

his grace freely justifying

secondly by permutation or change as in warres so christ himselfe bare our sinnes in his owne body on the tree

the wrath of the father went downe in the sonne to redeeme the saints he suffered in his body that we might be redeemed in our soules so a redemption

thirdly by violent ablation so abraham rcscued lot so christ redeemed his having spoiled principallities and powers blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us taking them out of the way

and through death destroyed him that had the power of death delivering them who through feare of death were all their subject to bondage

fourthly by price and ransome so slaves and captives are redeemed from the thraldome of cruell turks and the hands of barbarous enemies thus christ redeemeth his also captived under captivity yee are bought with a price

not with corruptible things of silver and gold but with the precious bloud of christ himselfe that immaculate lambe


in whom we have

through his bloud that is the shedding oblation of his bloud
as in the law the bloud of buls and goats sanctifyed to the purifying of the flesh so christ by the sacrificing of his bloud obtained thorow sanctification

and eternall redemption verse the tenth
in whom

the forgivenesse of our sinnes that is remission or as the word signifies retromission or sending backe againe from the soule to the first originall the father of all sinne a full remission from the defilement and destruction from the guilt and curse from the dominion and power by his bloud from the guilt of sinne and by his spirit from the power in a word from all that relates to or attends upon the blacknesse and darknesse of sinne
the forgivenesse of sinnes the forgivenesse not only by the bloud of christ have we redemption

or sanctification

but remission also as in the text so

in whom we have redemption by his bloud even the forgivenesse of sinnes
john in his revelation

confesses that christ washed us from our sinnes by his bloud and to fetch the record

bearing witnesse to this truth as high as heaven

the foure and twenty elders acknowledge thou wert slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy bloud out of every kindred tongue people and nation
agreeing to this is that of

and the bloud of jesus christ his sonne cleanseth us from all sinne
hath a poore soule need to be healed christ is a physitian to cure him doth thy soule parch and burne within thee christ is a fountaine to refresh thee art thou laden with the unsupportable burthen of thy sinnes christ is righteousnesse to ease thee if thou fearest the stroke of death he hath for thy poore beleeving soule the gift of eternall life and if thou walk mournfully apprehending damnation for sinne he hath redemption for thee from sinne as in the text
the reasons follow

christ only acceptable to god the rea&s heavens are not cleane in his sight he chargeth his angels with folly the quire of heaven and saints in earth are not in his sight distinct from christ he is the son of his love he the son of his complacency of his delight in whom only he is

and in the verse before my text he hath made us accepted in the beloved all the oblations legall and offerings ceremoniall had a redolent savour in the pure nosthrils of the almighty as they stood in reference to christ
without god none could please god saith ambrose whatever is presented to the father without the son is said to be unprofitable and unacceptable as the offered all in the time of the law so the lord jesus presents all in the time of the gospell without him nothing is accepted therfore of him the saints have all to and of redemption
this is the first reason the second followes

rea&s he only able to satisfie divine justice thousands of rammes ten thousands of rivers of oyle unsatisfactory to give the fruit of the body for the sinne of the soule and the for my transgression

it will neither be pleasing to god nor satisfactory to divine justice the leaprous person was to be cleansed by the bloud of the little bird

and the leaprous soule is to be purified and redeemed from all its sinne and uncleannesse by the bloud of jesus

christ that bird of paradise the coelestiall pellican that sacrificed himselfe to death to save his to everlasting life when sinne was to be remitted it was to be put upon another none must expect a satisfaction in or from himselfe the sinnes of the people were to be put upon the thus they were delivered

to teach us under the gospell our sinnes must be put upon christ to be the only satisfaction to almighty justice

two things are required of such as satisfie gods justice

first he that satisfies must be free from all sinne if any man under christ saith he have no sinne he deceives himselfe and the truth of god is not in him

christ in every thing like us sinne only excepted his enemies being judges he hath done all things well so he he only free from sinne can satisfie gods justice

secondly that which satisfies must be pure only pure in the offering and such oblations sacrifices poore mortals cannot tender to their god there is iniquity in their holy things they are unprofitable and come short of grace

now and must of glory for ever if the lord be not freely gracious in accepting as bestowing oh the wants and weaknesse in our hearing praying in our duties graces uncleane uncleane imperfect imperfect in all but christ a pure and holy offering unto the lord hence in the law when the went for an atonement he only entred into the sanctum sanctorum in the gospell christ trode the of his fathers wrath alone

and thats the second reason

rea&s thirdly that the glory of our redemption may redound to the praise of god in jesus christ whose is the worke tis fit theirs should be the honour hos feci tulit alter honores is injustice rich mercy full merit is the ground worke and foundation of all our excellency
the saints good and comfort ariseth from the free grace of the father and the full merit of the sonne and why to man or angell should the glory be given when scriptures speake any thing of this spirituall blessing redemption or forgivenesse of sins there is usually annexed a doxology or blessing as

with this in the text

as appeares in the third verse and thus of the third reason

that the type might correspond rea&s with the antetype the law and the gospell might answer one the other in the law the bloud was sprinkled round about the altar to intimate that nothing is of worth but by the force of christs bloud and as without bloudshedding no remission

so no forgivenesse of sinne but by the bloud of christ herein is a large field but hasten to the uses

instruction

if the bloud of the saviour be the redemption of the saint learne we first what an unhappy and cursed thing sinne is the forgivenesse whereof cost no lesse then christs dearest hearts bloud it deludes us to defile us it defiles us to destroy us that our poore yet precious soules should perish for ever without remedy but for christ in whom we have sinne dalilah speaks fairly acts friendly for her advantage but when opportunity serves then shall sampson smart for it adam bemocks himselfe to a being made immortall and doomes his selfe and posterity as low as death

and deep as hell when he had faire promises to be as god high as heaven lofty as eternity by eating the forbidden fruit fruit though pleasant in the taste bitter in the bowels as everlasting burning cursed sinne as a leaprosie and plague infects and overspreads all degrees faculties persons estates souls bodies insnaring millions to the eternall infernall tortures of devouring tophet as impossible to avoid as intolerable to endure without the bloud of jesus christ in whom we oh that the lord would enlighten our understandings to see sinne in its nakednesse then we would as purity it selfe hate it with a perfect hatred did we consider aright that christ is so long in sorrow as we are in sinne would we thus transgresse unhappy oath curse security unbeliefe sinne of what sort or condition soever crucifying the lord of glory unpardonable but by the alsufficient merit of jesus christ
what meant in the law an oblation of a hegoat for a but to teach us that sinne is of an odious sent and an ill savour in the nosthrils of the lord oh cursed sinne when not all the saints

on earth nor all the seraphicall spirits in heaven can expiate that sinne which notion called the least oh that the children of men and the sons of god would apprehend the lord speaking to a soule as once leah to jacob have hired thee with my sonnes mandrakes thou must come unto me
so the lord to our soules ye are mine you must come unto me by faith love obedience have bought thee with my sonnes teears sufferings and bloud precious soules set your esteeme on every sinne as is the redemption and it will speake you to remember how unhappy and cursed a thing sinne is when for the pardon thereof it cost no lesse then the unvaluable bloud of the sonne of god the lord jesus christ in whom we

is the bloud of the saviour the redemption u&se of the saints learne hence how deare and precious in the sight of jesus is the soule of the saints oh the tender love of christ to a poore christian as the relation speaks him a friend a brother a father a spouse a creatour each tearme speaks him ingaged to love so his love beyond measure so deare tender unparalell'd to be

admired not to be expressed greater love then this can no man shew
what greater then this could god declare his love engaged that piety be scourged and impiety by his stripes healed it was content wisedome it selfe be derided and folly passe unscoffed truth suffers and falshood triumphs justice is condemned and unrighteousnesse escapes free away mercy is afflicted for cruelty life resignes it selfe to death to preserve the damned from the sting thereof in a word god dyeth once that man might live for ever by right propriety he doth redeem the poor soul as his creature by right of propinquity redeems man as his he undertooke that which would have mouldred ten thousands of men to dust to have endured and attomed the myriads of angels to have suffered
oh the depth breadth length height of christs love speaking to the father in a loftier expression then paul to philemon concerning onesimus beseech thee for my sonne onesimus whom have begotten in my bonds formerly unprofitable to thee paul have written it with my owne hand holy father

beseech thee for this my poore soule whom by my gospell have begotten to thee formerly unprofitable unserviceable and yet unfruitfull enough but let me obtaine all his sinnes to be laid upon my shoulders tis thy beloved sonne that sonne in whom thou art well pleased have writ it and sealed it with no lesse then my precious bloud behold love love and admire was not was not rebeckah's love great to jacob doe as advise the curse be on me and the blessing on thee so jesus christ soule follow my advice doe as bid and all the blessings of thy father be upon thee and if any curse let it light on me for in me thou shalt have redemption oh see as to serve christ for his love and thy redemptions sake deare and tender when his life is not spared that thy sinne may be pardoned and soule saved in the day of the lord
you see then how deare a saint is to christ thus of the first use

deale faithfully ye beloved of the lord

and examine whether or no you can say in him we have redemption david speaks of the goings of god in his sanctuary the singers before and

the minstrels follow after holy happy progresse so may behold the soule going to and comming with pardon of sinnes try we first by what precedes and goes before then see what followes after remission of sinnes so may we apprehend terrour or comfort to a remitted or unforgiven soule this premise the foregoings of a pardoned soule are not to be looked on as causes though conditions or as kind of qualifications that support a soule to hopefull comfort


try and examine whether or no you sence your sinnes deeply cannot instance in whom sinne was pardoned comfortably that was never sensed deeply the experimentall christian knew once sadly as truly it lay a load upon his soule and a burthen upon his spirit that nothing but a secret support kept him from resigning up infinite mercy a load to a griefe a griefe and load with a witnesse and can it be lesse to thy soule when such a dishonour to thy god a curse to thy christ a grief to thy spirit a sadning to angels and a vexation to all the saints of god a deep sence as that reported of queen

mary were my heart unript you should find the losse of callice there so the soule were my heart uncased it would be knowne to men and angels and is knowne to the lord that knowes all secrets never any sorrow like this never any burthen to my spirits as this my unbeliefe my unprofitablenesse my deadnesse my unworthy walking to that high calling and rich mercy to which am called and which have received none like my sinne a burthen too heavy for me to beare if have not a supply from my christ in whom hope to have redemption try whether suffering or sinning most burthen thy soule tis that which is deeply sensed if hopefully to be pardoned


the soule before it comfortably can expect the forgivenesse of sinne feares dreadfully to this dread and feare the poore soule must needs step
when it senseth sinne deeply apprehends it rightly dismay terrour must appale the spirit and affright the heart when the soule looks on the sinnes many and mighty that every sinne is a crucifier of christ and not feare and not be troubled tis impossible when david apprehended

his sinne

there is no rest in my bones because of sinne ver
am troubled am bowed down greatly goe mourning all the day long feare and trembling make all my bones and every veine of my heart to shake if apprehending of judgement will make the quaffing belteshazzer shake and tremble what must the deep apprehension of sinne and judgement too when the malefactor perceives the sentence of death passed upon him oh what a shaking stupid trembling fals upon him so a poore soule receiving the sentence of death in himselfe oh what feare what amazement and horrour unspeakable the apprehension of sinne discovers the frownes of an everliving and father this troubleth a soule to astonishment the promise is god will come and save you the lord will come with recompence and vengeance oh sweet vengeance on thy sinnes recompence on thy poore desires but what goes before to whom is this salvation engaged to the fearfull heart

try hast dost feare sinnes curse heavens anger hope thy saviour is working a pardon for thee his saint

once more if thy soule be pardoned then it hath been throughly humbled will not experience tell you reason informe you when a sinne is deeply sensed a soule is terribly afraid and how can it then but be throughly humbled how should it lesse when the promises of the lord are engaged to comfort the broken contrite and humble soule and the lord of promises inhabiting eternity inthrones himselfe in such a soule

when the day of expiation was the soule was to be afflicted

why but to hint as god was ready to shew himselfe mercifull so the people ought to shew themselves humble
a childe when faulty or servant guilty expect no favour except they be submissive so a poore soule little hope of mercy till humble
repent for the kingdome of heaven is at hand that kingdome that affords the subduing of and pardon for sin to a poore penitent humble soul try hast bin humbled for every sinne as any sinne hast sentenced thy selfe to hell hast been afraid to come before god lying low in thy eyes worth nothing but confusion hast aggravated thy sinne against such a god

such a father faire hopes for a gracious pardon

lastly try hast sought dost seeke with all earnestnesse and intensenesse of soule and spirit making it the great request that the lord vouchsafe pardon and forgivenesse to thy poore soule when a man is in danger of the kings wrath will he not endeavour a composition and when a poore soule sees it selfe by sinne in danger of hell will it not seeke the lord while he may be found and call upon him while he is neare by and by the lord will abundantly pardon how earnestly will a condemned malefactor sue and cry good my lord mercy mercy my lord beseech you for christs sake even so the soule sentenced to the gates of death and chambers of hell hearing the god of sinners is a mercifull god in all duties upon all opportunities seeks for redemption the forgivenesse of their sins crying for christs sake to find grace the soule knowes well that prayer breaks downe the banke of sinne and makes a sluce for the streames of divine pardon to flow amaine to a praying soule
pray if perhaps the thoughts

of the heart may be forgiven was the advice of simon peter to simon magus

when a soule knowes it is blessed in heavens accompt if the sins be remitted

what can impead the soule from making out with such earnestnesse that neither lets it selfe nor the lord be quiet till a pardon be sealed by this time conceive the lord jesus discovers himselfe to the soule the one the only one in whom it hath redemption

these precedent foregoings for pardon experience will attest sure enough lets heare the minstrels which follow after

first the soule accepts thankfully who can expresse the gratitude the gladdest tydings and joyfullest newes that could be related to a poore drooping christian that all the day and night long crys out oh my sinnes oh my sins
how thankfull will a poor bedrid man be to his physitian that is instrumentall to his inlargement how thankfull a prisoner endungeoned for his freedome or a condemned person at the place and minute of execution to heare and see a pardon and what thanks

unutterable to the lord will a poore soule render what huggings and embracings what speakings and actings of thanks till obtained deep load dreadfull feare humble dejection and earnest seeking now an answer of peace enjoyed how thankfull higgaion selah can best expresse though farre beneath the thanks of a soule redeemed by the bloud of christ
try if thy soule hath gladly accepted joyfully received this unspeakable mercy by the returne of ineffable thanks canst thou in some measure subscribe to

or to

or this third verse to blesse god as for other so for this his spirituall blessing redemption forgivenesse of sinnes a comfortable signe
to proceed

secondly a soule pardoned will henceforth shun sinne carefully it well knowes there is forgivenesse with the lord that he may be feared the childe once flamed or gasht will feare the burning fire and cutting knife long after the prisoner coopt up to hardship and released will be fearfull of debts and sin againe and shall not a soule long fetter'd by

the hellish guilt and apprehension of sinne redeemed through the only worth of christs bloud dare to meddle with sinne the way to hell as hell it selfe the pardoned soule knowes there is only one physitian to afford forgivenesse to attaine his care and cure a worke and labour of highest difficulty nor can the sonne of man or daughter of jerusalem bee more watchfull over an unparalleld glasse than the pardoned sinner over his soul fearing if once broken hard if ever possible to bee repaired
the apprehension of this made one of the ancients to say till sinne hath done as much for me as god will have nothing to doe with the stoole of iniquity
try precious soule canst say have washed my feet how shall defile them gracious pardon hath cast off the ragges of sinne what have to doe any more with idolls shall such a one as flee have shed so many teares to the dimming of my eyes to the breaking of my heart have beene oft hurried as low as everlasting burnings to obtaine a pardon

for my sinne and hath infinite goodnesse enricht my soule in its forgivenesse and shall it be in vaine shall againe returne with the dogge to the vomit and with the swine to wallow in wickednesse god forbid ile shunne sinne hereafter carefully dost thou so desirest thou truely so a hopefull signe

thirdly a pardoned soule will live honourably if once thou gaine redemption through christ thou wilt live like a saint on earth yea a citizen in heaven yea thou wilt walke like the redeemed of the lord not as one imprisoned in a mierie dungeon but as one walking in a paradise of eden now as the prodigall in a new garment a vesture of righteousnesse not as the brat of hell but as heavens royall offspring not with the menstruous cloathes of sinfull adam but the candid stole of christs innocency daily invested with his apparell his conversation in heaven his vaine thoughts dislodged his frothy words checked his idle wayes

refrained the whole man hee is bought with a price hee will glorifie the lord with body and soule hee puts to his seale tis a sinne with a shame and curse to keep the labourers hire


a soule that sees his redemption in christ knoweth it cost his precious bloud should hee live any longer to himselfe to his former sinnes hee easily understands hee detaines his soule and body from christ the purchase of christ hee resolves therefore henceforth to know no thing no person unrelate to christ hee hath obtained his pardon his deportment shall be as coheire with christ and heire to god of eternall glory hee will live honourably
try if you so live and breath act and affect that your conversation may be sutable to your priviledge and all your endeavours answerable to this princely prerogative the forgivenesse of sinnes doest thou labour to exalt the lord and magnifie jesus christ above sin creature selfe comfortable signes if not contra

fourthly the soule pardoned walks more comfortably than ever a man long time confined to bed home or prison set free with what inward joy satisfactory content his soule is comforted experience can best expresse so a poore soule formerly plunged in ghastly feares and hellish apprehensions to dwell and live in everlasting darknesse for want of pardon now the lord by his spirit sealing as full as free remission no stranger can intermeddle to relate his joy unspeakable and full of glory pardon and peace remission and consolation like aaron and hur hold up moses hands support the pardoned soule goe in peace and be of good comfort thy sinnes are forgiven thee bee frequent expressions of holy writ
when by pardon of my sinne my soule beholds it selfe once a farre of now nigh by the bloud of christ how can but rejoyce the feares sorrow trembling horrour because my sinnes were unpardoned dispell'd must needs create inward joyes unspeakable for that

mine iniquities are forgiven
try what inward joy and consolation in some measure at some time gods word affords from christ in whom thou hast redemption
thus for the tryall

thirdly

this serves to reprove such as cannot say in him wee have redemption hath not pardon beene tendred free full long as the sinne the doome must bee thine if no redemption by christ thou art a captive to the power of thy lust and a bond slave to the curse of thy sinne to an ingenuous spirit it is misery to bee a prisoner to a superiour deep calamity to bee subject to an equall but a slave to his drudge vexation high little comfort left for the gallantry of bravest spirits but this they are enthralled by men and in that little comfort too but to bee enslaved under hels darling heavens scorne the soules everlasting shame and confusion sinne makes not onely the eare to tingle heart to tremble but dumbes because it doomes to that lake which

burnes with torturing fire and sulphurous brimstone whether the pains of sence or losse be sorest needs no determination either enough to fill a soul with the terror of black despaire well consider

the thoughts of a resurrection speakes the soule glad to returne to dust againe but hoping better things of you precious soules spare to reprove and passe to the fourth use

to all you that can say in any measure my saviours bloud is my redemption let your soules rejoyce and all within you blesse his name for

first thou art blessed as the sweet psalmist

in this happy enough happy in gods account what if deprived of earthly contents and enjoyments yet thou hast remission forgivenesse thats worth a thousand worlds deny not deare soule but that many have more of blessings without but thou hast that white stone that new name

affording such a consolation within as may fill thy soule with joy ineffable and full of glory

secondly by this assured of salvation it is the souls trouble the uncertainty of the reward so that it workes it out with little below feare and trembling the forgivenesse of thy sinnes distills with a sweet influence enlightning to salvation as by the heat know the fire burnes by the light know the sunne shines by the pardon of my sinne am confident of the salvation of my soule

thirdly in this comfort whatsoever god sends or suffers tis in mercy no affront from beneath no desertion from above no affliction without no temptation within but proceeds from a father as well as from a god jonathans arrowes were shot for david as at david the tender mother gives with a bitter pill closely sugar to sweeten so the lord though hee sometimes answers with terrible things yet hee is the god of salvation take comfort therefore

fourthly god will sanctifie thee as well as justifie thee thou shalt be partaker of his spirit as well as

of his bloud know thy soule longeth to bee sanctified it shall bee bee comforted where god pardons hee purges so runnes the covenant

seconded by the apostle john


but here a soule is ready to complaine there is nothing in me from me that should hope of the lords pardon to me

to this answer hast thou not as much as god looks for what had the infant the churches hierogliphicke

but bloud in it polluted defiled yet god pittied what had the prodigall yet his father freely pardoned and joyfully entertained him
feare not then for christs sake the lord will doe more than this in him there is righteousnesse grace perfection merit enough to redeem from hell the nethermost hell to save to save to the highest heavens hath not he offered himselfe a sacrifice for sinne for ever and will not he for ever perfect them that are sanctified and will the lord remember their sinnes and iniquities any more

be comforted therefore

and if this will not serve let god himselfe answer such an objection made


hasten to the last use labour to subscribe to this truth you that cannot say you have redemption through his bloud

meanes

first labour for a forgiving heart and a remitting spirit doe as you would bee done unto is the royall law

with that of



secondly labour for a truely humbled spirit a throughly humbled soul so that promise sealed to thee in the twelfth of zacharie the latter end and beginning of the thirteenth chapter

thirdly believe in christ entertaine him in all his truths his promises exercise thy faith in spight of opposition and


a faire instance



motives

god will then bee one with you mot

the first adam by his sinne lost you the second adam by his merit regained you no more a stranger from god or the covenant of grace his royall attributes are martialled while you are in the valley of teares to doe you good

mot this will make you passe through all difficulties whatsoever with comfort now thou fearest and art amazed loath to hazard this or ventare that for god or his gospell and why have not my sinnes pardoned were sure of this went through a valley of teares and shadow of death would feare no evill but with paul

challenge all persons and things that thus you may remaine faithfull and with comfort wade through a sea of bloud labour for redemption

lastly yee that can say with paul in the text we have redemption love him live to him and to none but him let your duties mercies graces lives bee praise to jesus christ you need not question gods love the favour of the royall

breast is knowne by mercy by remission hath the lord delivered mee from the power of darknesse and translated mee to the kingdome of his deare sonne and shall not his free grace bee magnified praise the lord my soule and let all that is within mee blesse his holy name for his christ by whose bloud have redemption the forgivenesse of my sins and let all that wish well to my soule for my soule say blessed be the lord for ever and ever
amen

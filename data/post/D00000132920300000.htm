the preface
it is a duty of high concernment unto christians to be searching the scriptures joh

one part as well as another all being given by divine inspiration and profitable to high and glorious ends
the last prophetical book would never have obtained the name and title of revelation if an understanding of the mind and will of god therein had been unattainable
nor would there ever have been such a precious promise in the front of it rev

blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophesie if it had been
who should share in this blessedness if none could arrive at the knowledge of what they read

neither should any take discouragement for this search because some have been mistaken in their computations of time for

they may as well reject the study of other scriptures on that account seeing many wise and learned men have been grosly mistaken about great matters of eaith or doctrines of the gospel

indeed the enquiry is the more necessary that at last the truth may be found out
am not peremptory in fixing the time but offer different epocha's with the grounds and let these or the event determine which is the truth and besides the mystical numbers there are other signs of the times as the sleepiness of virgins may speak that the coming of the bridegroom is not far off mat
and some events may discover what are next to follow as some former seals open'd tell us what were yet to come and some trumpets sounding tell us which are next to sound
also know that there are other matters besides the times yet to come to be enquired after even what is already past that we may discern what an answerableness there have been in events in the several ages to what is contained in the prophesies which is indeed the great scope and design of this discourse to give a discovery of

here we may see how prophesies have been turned into history
and there is enough

in this to recompence all the labour of any serious observer and enquirer and to fill him abundantly with admiration

here is matter not only knowable but of great importance to be known for receivers of the mark of the beast in the forehead or hand openly or secretly are severely threatned rev

they shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone for ever
a discovery of the enemies of the church accounted necessary else what followed would not have been established
confidently conclude the pope to be the second beast rev

who is the giver of this mark and so the least compliance with him as such is very perilous and desperately dangerous
that mark may not only be what have particularly mentioned but may extend to some other act or badge tessera sign of token which he giveth of their belonging to him

as to the first beast rev

think him not to be the pope or seventh head but another persecuting beast as have evinced
herein confess differ from other

interpreters yet account it the truth and this may be a salvo for their supposed mistakes about the mystical numbers some of them might be righter in their computations as to the end than themselves were aware of two things which have proved being considered


that the epocha of the months and days is to be fetched from a persecution of the first crowned beast rev

not from the pope nor from any apostacy of his or other romish corruptions some of which were too early to begin those days with thess


and others too late if they were to commence from the very first moment of time when rome lost the essentials of a true church and turned into the whore of babylon


that the months and days are not expressive of the whole time either of the beasts continuance or dominion it is a great mistake to think that immediately after the expiration of those days the beast must be destroyed or the churches trouble come to its end
it's true the sackcloth or then ended but after that the witnesses having finished their testimony there a is

war and the of the witnesses and their resurrection ensueth before the reign of the beast cometh to an end rev
to

as to the days dan


think they are not prophetical days years but natural days not only because expressed by evenings and mornings
but because they are limited and confined to the little horn which groweth on the
which is declared to be the king of grecia
and so that littlehorn was antiochus epiphanes who did grow out thence as
in the latter time not of the world but of the four kingdoms which sprang from the grecians or which that was split into as
and this antiochus did take away the daily sacrifice and cast down the sanctuary
and it being asked how long it should be till that was cleansed
the aforesaid days are given as the answer
and sutably was the event according to josephus and the maccabees which may be esteemed as other humane histories though not as scripture
for from antiochus first persecution in his own person in the year of the greeks to his death in the tear is about that time maccab


and macc


or from menelaus who intended to revolt to the religion of the greeks and had a license from antiochus to erect a place in jerusalem in the year to the time of cleansing the sanctuary in the year is about days joseph
lib

maccab



in vain therefore do many perplex themselves seeking the expiration of these days in the times of the new testament
and if they were so many years yet they could not begin before the vision it self which hath its first date at the ram dan


noting the kings of media and persia
and the first year of cyrus was about years before christ nor indeed could they commence before that little horn antiochus did take away the daily sacrifice and tread down the sanctuary
about ann

before the nativity of christ and the residue must come after and thus would not expire till about ann

but conclude that those days did begin and end with antiochus
would not absolutely determine that the conversion of the jews will be before the fall of rome but offer some reasons for it

this seemeth plain that the jews will not return to their own land or be called till the resurrection of the witnesses for as the time times and half and days so the three days and half of the witnesses lying dead are all of them times of the gentiles rev

and it is expresly said luk

they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down how long until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled
and they are not fulfilled till the death of the witnesses is over seeing the gentiles hold them under their death

if the tenth part that falleth at the witnesses rising or ascending should not be rome but another of the ten horns as some would have it then seeing there is but one blow more after that triumph rev
why may not rome be the babylon that cometh into remembrance at the seventh vial let the event determine

do not pretend to immediate revelation or such a spirit of prediction for the foretelling things to come but only compare scripture with scripture
did compose this

ann

and see no cause yet for variation in the substance only now have much abbreviated it with a few alterations and a little addition especially as to the number of the beast and this review added much to my confirmation and satisfaction in these things
the day of the lord is near let us exercise faith in prayer that if jesus christ should come at midnight yet we may be always found watching

the revelation unvailed chap
of the general scope of the revelation and the enemies of the church especially the dragon
it is a singular demonstration of the love of christ to his church that he hath vouchsafed the book of the revelation which affordeth not only useful moral observations but
conclusions of the great events from days of john until the end of all things rev

it is called a prophecy of what was shortly to come to pass and that until the general resurrection rev

when shall sit on his great white throne and the dead small and great shall be judged according to their works
here is a prediction of the state and condition of actions and passions doings and sufferings both of the church and people of god and also of their enemies during that whole time
and note there are


seven seals rev
six of which lasted

during the time of pagan emperours till after anno
see mr mede
and the seventh delivered it self into


seven trumpets rev
and
some of which began to sound judgment against the roman empire before ann


seven vials or lt plaguesÂ· rev
and
and all other dispensations are for time reducible to some of these

that the roman state or empire is the chief boundary of all these matters is evident seeing the description undeniably agreeth to that and no other place or state in the world for rome was that great city rev
which was built upon seven hills or mountains
and had seven heads seven several supream governments five of which were fallen in the days of john viz
kings

tribunes

dictators and it's said one is viz
caesars or emperours
and another was yet to come viz
popes and in that territory were the ten horns or kings viz that after received power as kings which in the days of john they had not
the principal enemies here described are four
a dragon rev


a tenhorned beast rev


a beast rev


a whore rev
seven heads and ten horns the dragon had and so the beast crowned and upon the beast the rideth rev

and therefore all of them belong to the roman empire

the church till after ann

is deciphered

by a woman clothed with the sun rev

and then the red dragon was her grand enemy

afterward she is described under the notion of two witnesses rev
and of sealed ones rev
and

and then her great enemies were the first and second beast and the whore rev and
the grand opposite to the true church is the whore of mystical babylon which therefore must be the corrupt church of rome rev
to
for who else can these characters agree to who else did sit upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth committed spiritual fornication is the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth and drunk with the blood of the saints who else hath sate upon the beast with seven heads and ten horns yea it is expresly said
the woman the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth which could not in the days of john be asserted of any other in the world but only the city of rome and so the romish church is here intended
for the right understanding or clearing of these prophetical mysteries shall lay down divers rulesÂ· with the proof of the
rule
that the dragon notifieth pagan rome persecuting or such as are not professedly christian

as a key to a considerable part of prophecy take dragon throughout the revelation for satan and by paganish

power or not christian
it cannot be the devil himself for the description here of his seven heads and ten horns rev

we have otherwise expounded of instruments of satan rev

as ezek
jer

and it aptly agreeth to heathen rome when there were seven crowns emblems of majesty supream power and soveraignty and these upon the heads
satan acted like a dragon by fierce and cruel persecutions against the church under ethnick emperors before ann

and not long after the christ not personally considered but mystically in his church and was brought forth by his captain general constatine the great notwithstanding all pagan attempts to destroy him or hinder turning from paganism to christianity
and several acts or works of the dragon or paganish powers are mentioned
as


a dragon war with michael with jesus christ whilst the empire was pagan rev

and there was war in heaven michael and his angels and the dragon and his angels

this war is before the rising of the beast and before the days begin as appeareth in that he had but seven crowns and these upon the heads
whereas upon the beast are ten crowns and these upon the horns rev

and in that in this war the dragon is overcome and cast out or down so as his place is no more found in heaven rev

whereas had he been then turned beast he would have been a conqueror rev
it was given to him

to make war with the saints and to overcome them and should after have had the same place in heaven as before
it is therefore a war that casteth the dragon down from his imperial throne and headship not from his acting in horns of the beast that is intended
it ushereth in a great triumph for the erecting or seting up at present another kingdom rev

now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down such a triumph is inconsistent with the sackcloth of the days and cannot be during the reign of the beast or till those days are ended and the sounding of the seventh trumpet rev


this war and triumph is before the woe to the inhabiters of the earth and sea rev

probably before the first second trumpets which fall upon the earth and sea rev

and so before the seal
and before the safe sealing rev

therefore this was that between constantine the great and the pagans wherein he had a glorious victory over maxentius maximinianus and and this admirably agreeth with or answereth to the sixth seal rev to the end and the rather because the dragon was enraged at his being cast down rev

knowing that he had but a short time for but one pagan more viz ju+lian was ever advanced to the enjoyment of the imperial throne and he ruled but two or three years some say less a very short timeÂ·

neither doth the mentioning a flying into the wilderness days before this war
argue that the war is after for often things are inserted by way of anticipation and that mentioned in a former place which was done after as divers matters rev
are not in time before those rev
and here is a special reason for it in the case in hand for having asserted that the dragon watched to destroy the and yet he was brought forth and was caught up to god and to his throne had safety power eminent exaltation and yet the woman flieth into the wilderness for so long a time
a question ariseth

how all this cometh to pass and how after such advanceme she cometh into the wilderness

he answereth by declaring that there is a war wherein michael overcometh the dragon and so the woman the church hath advancement but the dragon being enraged raiseth a persecution and driveth the woman into the wilderness
and so she was not there before and it is into her place into the place which god had prepared for her no necessity of its implying that she had been in that place before
and let it be observed what the provocation was to that persecution

and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman that brought sorth the
which argueth that this casting down the dragon from his imperial seat and the bringing forth the manchild by constantine were fresh in memory and

not many hundred years before as they must be if this war were towards the end of the days as some would have it

and seeing this war was before the rising of the beast and seeing the going into the wilderness which next ensued michael victory over the dragon is that going into the wilderness for a time times and half
hence that going into the wilderness for days is the going into the wilderness for a time times and half a time or these are the same measure of time

a dragon or pagan persecution after the empire became a beast driving the church into the wilderness rev

when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth he persecured the woman
the dragon now persecuted the church not by a headship which he was already cast down from but in the form of crowned horns of the beast divers of which at first were paganish as the goths vandals
and let it be observed that they then did not give their power to the second beast the pope who was not then up by way of professed subjection either to him or to the christian religion

a dragon flood cast out after the woman the church rev

a multitude of pagans as well as errors which were dried up that she was not drowned thereby


a new dragon war raised upon this against a remnant of the purest worshippers rev

shall it to consideration whether this was at the next persecution by the

horns after the woman was in the wilderness and the flood was over or by the sarracens and turks who the eastern churches and raised persecutions there and although they own god yet it is in so carnal a way as they deny him by their religion and not so much as professing christianity may be deemed paganish though not professedly pagans

thus we see the work of the dragon against the church both before the days and in that time

a dragon combination as one partner at the battle of armageddon rev

where dragon thinkÂ· is especially turkish power and infidels and so is distinguished from the beast and false prophet and the issue as to the dragon is rev
that he is bound years iÂ· restrained from former persecutions and at last is utterly destroyed

chap
ii
of the ten horned crowned beast rev

it is impossible to regulate our knowledge in these prophetical matters or our ensuing practice without rectified apprehensions in what state the roman empire must be considered when it became a beast
cannot concur with an eminent writer in thinking the first rev
to be the roman catholick visible churchÂ·

for cannot find that the claim of universal churchship was first before the claim of universal supremacy or headship to make a second beast
nor do the other characters

agree to that

if that were the first beast then who is the whore that rideth upon the beast rev

surely that is the pretended roman catholick church and so that cannot be the beast that is ridden upon
nor is the church one of the eight kings or seven heads
and so cannot be the first beast
nor is this first beast rome as under pagan emperours
for then it had but seven crowns and these upon the heads rev

whereas this first beast hath ten crowns and these upon the horns rev
because the ten horns assumed a supremacy and soveraignty which crowns are emblems of to themselves
and this beast is the dragons successor
and received a deadly wound in one of his heads
whereas although was wounded by constne the great yet the sixth head of emperours was not wounded much less unto death during the dragon or pagan state it was this beast nor wounded until the were upon the horns nor did pagan emperours continue forty two months as this beast doth rev


nor is the pope the first beast
am perswaded that the accounting him so hath caused divers mistakes in the matters of the revelation as seeking the of the prophetical days in

him which should be found in another as this first beast
grant that the pope is the second two horned beast rev

and antichristian but humbly conceive that there was a first antichristian persecuting beast up above two hundred years before the second beast arose and so before the pope became the two horned beast and seventh head

take my notion under this rule
rule
that the first ten horned crowned beast is a civil state of the roman empire as broken or divided into ten persecuting kingdoms

for
the first beast is distinct from the two horned beast or these are two distinct beasts and not barely a double power temporal and ecclesiastical of the same beast here are many notes of distinction
they have a different manner of rising
one out of the sea rev

the other out of the earth
the former is wounded in one of his heads
the latter is another beast

they are differing in shape the first hath ten horns crowned
the second hath two horns
nay the second beast exerciseth all the power of the first beast and that before him before the first beast and therefore they are distinct yet some part of the time exist together the second beast is up before the first is down else it could not be before him and hence it cannot be the same beast considered as wounded as the first

beast and as healed as the second beast for how could the second beast as healed exercise the power of the first beast before him as wounded seeing the wounded state as well as that before the wound is past when the healing time cometh and so it could not be before him if after the second beast were up the first were not up also
how can one act before another if both be not up together as distinct each from other even still in some respects and hence it is evident that it cannot be limited only to a double power of the same beast seeing whatsoever power the first beast hath the same the second hath also and so the first is in some degree subjected to the second if the first beast did exercise temporal power then so did the second also for the second exerciseth not only some but all the power of the first beast
from all which it is evident that they are two distinct beasts and that therefore the first beast cannot be the pope or seventh head
for there are but seven heads in all rev

chapÂ·

and if the pope be the first beast and seventh head how can another distinct beast come after and exercise all the power of the first without making eight heads and who should that second beast be after popes or seventh head if the pope be the first beast


he to whom the dragon resigned or gave his power throne and great authority about the time of crowning the horns he is the first beast rev

upon his horns ten crowns
and


the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority

now the pope had not from the dragon from pagan rome his throne power or military forces nor great authority he had the same seat before and at crowning the horns and therefore the pope is not the first beast but the crowned horns who had these as alaricus

that which was head of the roman empire after the rising of the first beast received a deadly wound which afterward was healed rev

saw one of his of the beasts as it were unto death
it was then one of the first beasts heads that was wounded and so in his time after he was up
and therefore the pope cannot be the first beast or the seventh head then for the head of as it was not up so early as the crowning of the horns so did not receive a deadly wound he was rather in a rising than a falling posture thence forward
but there was a manifest wound in the sixth head of emperours by alaricus about ann

and others afterwards till about ann

in augustulus that wound was so great that there were no emperours in the west or at rome till charles the great about ann

when the wound was after a sort healed again yet it had not the extent of the former empire
the manner and occasion take thus

alaricus took rome and set up a mock emperour

that he might bring the majesty of the imperial scepter into contempt and derision he proclaimed emperour one whose name was attalus and the same day they carried him up and down the streets in the habit of an emperour and the next day they made him serve as a slave
it's said to be occasioned thus alaricus having many places sent messengers to honorius declaring that if lands were granted to him and his to dwell in he would cease spoiling of the country honorius not knowing how to recover france and spain from the suevians vandals giveth alaricus power to go into france confirmed this grant with an oath
alaricus steering his course towards france against the covenant followeth him and made a great slaughter alaricus not the least suspecting it before hereupon the goths snatching up their arms and alaricus exasperated by this injury and violation of covenant turned back into italy with fire and sword and at last rome it self was taken by him

and whereas some grant that the sixth head of emperours was wounded and would have the popes obtaining headship to be the healing

confess understand not how a wound in one head should be healed by the rising up of another
think the wound is never healed unless the same head that was wounded recovereth again
but this is a granting the thing for it is not a head of the dragon but

a head of the beast that is wounded rev

one of heads therefore if it be the sixth head of emperours that is wounded then that first beast is not the roman state under the seventh head but under the sixth head of emperours


the first beast is the beast rev

saw a woman sit upon a beast

rev

now the pope is rather carried by the whore than the beast that carrieth her and therefore this beast is not the pope
nor is the turk this first beast for this whore doth not ride upon the turk nor is constantinople the city which in the days of john reigned over the kings of the earth nor did the turk arise the same hour with the crowning of the horns as rev

but hundreds of years after yet deny not that the turk may belong to the beast after he obtained some territories belonging to the horns of the beast
it is therefore a civil state of the roman empire


the beast is both an eighth king and of the seven heads rev

and rev

the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and the seven were but six when the did arise and the wound was of the sixth as have proved and so must the eith be some distinct new kind of government and if the beast rev

were popes and the sevth head at his first rising then the beast could not be the eighth and of the seven for ask what distinct kind of

government or state of the empire came after popes to make an eighth king

if it be said the christian emperours before the rising of the beast
add that it was the same state of government under pagan and christian emperours though the qualifications and actions of governours were different both were emperours
and seeing after the sixth head of emperours two beasts so different each from other are mentioned rev

it is to me a wonder that men should not seek a way how the other six might by these two beasts be made up eight kings
thus the first beast rev

hath ten crowns upon the horns or kingly government there which made a different sort of government from the other six and so may be deemed a seventh king or sort of government or an eighth if we will count it after popes who maketh another as pet


god saved noah the eighth person the meaning is that there were seven saved besides noah he was not the last of them in order but did make up that number
so rev

the beast is the eighth that is there are seven besides seven others and so with him there are eight
the beast is the eighth in number not necessarily that he is eighth or last in order hence he and of the seven he doth not say he is the so warily doth the apostle speak here

it is said of this beast it was is not and yet is rev

in its ten horns crowned before the deadly wound is not

in respect of perfect headship when wounded for the head is said to be wounded as it were unto death rev

and yet is when the wound was healed rev



the pope obtained not any civil supremacy over the empire till hundreds of years after the horns were crowned and so after the first beast was therefore the first beast rev

is not the pope or seventh head for the crowning of the horns or their receiving power as kings is the same hour or the first hour with the beast rev

all the former heads were civil heads as kings consuls and therefore so must the seventh be also
and indeed how is it possible that popes should be reckoned a head of the roman state or civil monarchy or succeed and come in the place and stead of the sixth head of emperors which was a civil head until they obtain a civil supremacy as emperors and others had his constituting boniface the third universal bishop anno
is evidence enough that the bishop of rome had not then obtained a civil supremacy but was under the head of emperors still seeing he was beholden to them even for his ecclesiastical supremacy and yet the first ten horned crowned beast was up long before this
indeed there is evidence that a long time after the crowning of the horns yet emperors were the supream head and the popes of rome subordinate or subject to them
bonifacius writing to honorius saith god hath given you the regiment of worldly things and the priesthood to

even the councils for spiritual matters were called by the command of emperors many years after as phil
morney knight in his mystery of iniquity hath largely proved
and claiming supremacy or aspiring after civil headship is no obtaining it any more than john bishop of constantinople his claiming and assuming the title of universal bishop about anno
did make him ecclesiastical head over the bishop of rome in that day
the temporal supremacy of the pope cannot be proved until a long time after and so he could not be the first beast
and to say that his ecclesiastical power made him the first beast and his temporal the second is to invert the order of rev

which ascribeth that to him as a second beast


all the other characters of the first beast agree to the civil state of the empire with ten horns crowned persecuting and so the complex body of them or as headed by emperours make that beast rev

when the wound was healed then all the world wondred after the beast
charles was called the great because then he was so much admired
and they worshipped the beast
to worship him is eidem subjici by civil subjection to him noted by worship gen

and

and

isa

saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him so early they admired the horns of the beast as the goths and vandals and their great power and others as attila king of the hunns who after the death of ecius grew so mighty that

he overthrew the imperial general and army took many cities and was held for the most powerful prince in the world and was so much feared that martianus the emperor sent to sue for peace and sent him presents

obj
it's a mark of perdition to worship the first beast rev

but it is not so to yield civil subjection to civil power
a
it is not made a mark of perdition
the text doth not shew the danger of worshipping the beast but describes him by the multitude of reprobates that are admirers of him
see brightman
civil subjection may lawfully be yielded to the civil power of those who are honoured by many who shall perish

if a corrupt religious worship must be intended which is not proved yet this agreeth to the first as a civil persecuting beast for it is a beast a cruel persecutor rev

warreth with the saints rev

a blasphemer of god
and divers of the ten horns in their first rising were such being either pagans or in pagan worship or arrians blaspheming his name and tabernacle jesus christ and it was a whoreridden beast rev

and to magnifie him in these corruptions or in that wherein he is a beast is pernicious yea compliance with him in persecution is an evident token of perdition phil


and thus it may be a mark of perdition though the pope be not the first beast

obj
there is but one beast mentioned rev

which is the interpretation of rev

a beast is a name common both to the first and second and so rev
may notifie the whole in distinction from rev
they are sufficiently diversified rev
and need not be so again in rev
when compared each with other they are two beasts differenced from each other by many notes of distinction but when differenced from dragon both agree in the common name of beast
as the roman monarchy from first to last is called a fourth beast dan


yet that will not deny dragon and beast to be distinct each from other part of its time
but their being two is implied rev

there is another and an eighth which agrees with the word king in gender and there cannot be an eighth king different government if there were not two beasts
in short beast without distinction may be taken promiscuously either for the first or second beast as the matter enforceth but it noteth most commonly the first beast or whole roman state after it ceased to be under dragon after pagan headship ended and may be understood either of its after headship or the complex body of the crowned horns comprizing the roman territory or provinces in east and west the same that the dragon had before

but beast when with distinction is usually taken for the first beast thus when beast and false prophet are distinguished the false

prophet is he that worketh miracles rev

which is the second beast rev

and therefore the beast distinguished from him must be the first beast

so when beast and image are distinguished rev
and

and

and

and

the first with ten horns crowned is intended by beast for it is an image of him that received a wound by a sword and did live rev

which was the first beast
not the second
it is the second beast which had power to give life to the image of the beast and work miracles and that in his sight and so he cannot be the beast it self whose image is animated and hath life given to it and in whose sight those miracles are wrought but the first
also when beast and woman are distinguished as rev
there signifieth the first beast at least till the rising of the seventh head and this in so many of the horns as were ridden by the whore of babylon after she arose

so when beast and dragon are distinguished rev

and

there noteth the first beast or so many of the horns as were professedly christian and were ridden by the whore and noteth such as were not professedly christian for we must note that all the horns of the beast were not of the same spirit or religion
about the time of their first crowning some were dragonish pagans rev

others professedly christian and corrupt some arrians as goths vandals

and towards the latter end of the beasts dominion some horns or provinces are dragonish not professedly christian rev


the turk has part of the territory of the first beast rev

others are popishly affected
by all which it appeareth that there is no necessity that the pope should be the first beast
and although herein differ from other interpreters yet am more for them than against them the matter being rightly stated especially seeing hereby extricate them out of many difficulties where they are at a loss for a ground in their fixing the epocha of the prophetical days on the pope which hereby prove should be taken from another beast viz
the first civil crowned persecuting beast

iii
of the beast the pope rev
rule
that the beast is the horn of ecclesiastical power is a false prophet by his second horn of temporal supremacy became the seventh head of the roman empire
this appeareth for all the characters of this second beast agree to the pope and to none else as


he arose out of the earth rev

not from heaven but from below from satan and carnal earthly men and means
not out of the

sea or confluence of people and nations as the other
but had a mean original from a poor bishop at last ascended to this dignity


he hath two horns like a lamb

so the pope usurpeth a twofold power temporal and spiritual
the first horn of ecclesiastical power arose in the time of phocas anno

under justinian by narses turning out the goths both italy and rome were annexed to the eastern empire
his temporal power and headship must have its first date either from the donation of rome to him which of old was the imperial seat or from his obtaining superiority either over the head of emperors or over some of the ten horns

which sufficiently evidenceth that the

pretended donation of constantine the great was but a fiction they belonging to the eastern empire till now they were usurped by the pope who made himself prince of rome and afterward pope zechary deposing childerick set up pipinus the french king who in requital compelled aistulphus king of the lumbards to restore all the towns and lands which he had taken and by his donation bestowed on him the exarchate or princedom of ravenna and pentapolis and a very large dominion and possession which afterwards were confirmed by others with additions as by charles the great anno

all which argue that now the pope was become not only a temporal prince by the dukedom of rome by getting power over some of the crowned horns and opposing and overtopping emperours so as without their consent by degrees they had their elections and swelled in their power till at last they disannulled the inauguration placing and displacing emperours at their pleasure
this appeared most manifestly in hildebrand or gregory the seventh ann

who not only excommunicated henry the emperour but deposed him and gave away his kingdom to rodolphus duke of suevia
and now emperours had their confirmation from popes whereas of old the popes had confirmation from the emperours
whether this were the first of his being regnant as some assert or the time of his being triumphant in the temporal power leave it to others to judge


he spake as a dragon so did hildebrand and other popes not only in their excommunications and depositions but also in those they call hildebrands dictates or canons and decrees as that no book may be accounted canonical without his authority
that he ought to be judged of none

he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth to worship the first beast rev

this the pope doth by letting none be emperours without his confirmation deposing emperours and sending the imperial crown to others as rodolphus setting up persecuting emperours at his pleasure and causing the earth to obey their decrees by influencing the horns to persecute as pope martin perceiving the gospel prevailed in bohemia stirred up the emperour and german princes to making war against the bohemians and thus exercised the power of the first persecuting beast and caused earthly men to worship him

he doth wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven and deceiveth the earth with his miracles rev


so the pope as a false prophet pretendeth to miracles
one saith that the garments of hildebrand or gregory after his death wrought miracles

cardinal benno who lived at the same time saith of hildebrand that when he list he would shake his skirts and fire would come out like sparks and by such miracles he abused the eyes of simple people and therefore when

the devil could not persecute publickly jesus christ by painims he disposed himself fraudulently to destroy his name by this false monk under the shew and colour of religion

what this is it is a great question it must be an not of the second but of the first beast that was wounded

but a representation or resemblance of him yet such as the false miracles were to win credit and honour to this image
saying that they should make an in making is when once made the beast
or that he had made it and he urgeth worshipping of it upon pain of death

this is not image worship for images are dead things but this is living it can speak and do

therefore this must be either the pope himself or some new constitution of his or else the german empire
it seemeth not to be this second beast or pope himself for he maketh it and so is before and is not it that is made unless it noteth his exciting or causing others to give imperial honour and dignity to him

it is said then berengarius was driven to a recantation others say he never

and that having his fathers name on their foreheads in opposition to their foregoing more latent state for before though the church did not utterly fail as rom

yet it was more private
it was a horrid time of darkness as to religion in the world some

hundreds of years till after ann

but then about thirty or fourty years after there began the first open restoration of the church when they had the name of god upon their foreheads publickly openly and as in they were called berengarians so the beast by marks differenced his from these

also it's said that in alexander the third his time an oath of fidelity was imposed on bishops by which they did swear obedience to the papacy to maintain the church of rome in all councils in all times and places was not this a mark in opposition to the waldenses and that lateran council further saith the catholicks that taking the badge of the cross shall give themselves to the exterminating of hereticks shall injoy they decree to subject to excommunication the believers and receivers defenders and favourers of to be admitted to any publick offices or councils nor to chuse any to such or to be a witness and let him not have power to make a if any after such a mark by the church shall contemn to avoid them be smitten with the sentence of excommunication
what is the meaning of all this but that none shall have commerce buy or sell without being marked by the beast
he hath the number of the beast
rev

various interpretations hereof differing each from other yet agree to the popeÂ·

ireneus would find the meaning in the numeral letters in the name latinos but some answer this is too cabalistical and agreeth to heathen rome as well as antichristian and to many other names as mahometes gensericus titan is there any warrant to take other numeral letters making up the same with undefined span alphabet and then conclude them synonymous

cannot assent to the way of learned and ingenious mr potter making the square root of the beasts number for few christians are such arithmeticians as to find out the mystery by the extraction of roots nor are they obliged to be such whereas all christians are bound to count and apply this number so as to avoid compliance with the beast or being of his number here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count
and that we may find out the true meaning of this difficult text observe it is the number of the beast not only the number of his name which some confound with it but of the beast himself which is distinct from the name rev

victory over the beast is one thing and over the number of his name is another
and it is known by computation let it must then be found out by reckoning or counting and so is a real number
and it is the number of a man commonly in use among men as rev

the measure of a man is that which man is wont to use and so it must not be a mystical prophetical number a day being put for a year as elsewhere in this prophesy but the very number

it remaineth then that it must according to scripture denote either the number of persons the followers of the beast or else a number of his years a time

if it be a description of the beast by the number of his followers it is applied to him not as if they were precisely so many for it is known they are many many more in nations kindreds tongues and people but as an opposite number to that of the lamb rev
and there is fixed on not for its own sake but for the sake of as the basis of it for it is not imaginable that every tribe parcelled out rev
had exactly
but is befitted to all the concernments of the lamb both great and small all matters of faith and worship are measured by the doctrine of the apostles hence so many things run upon

there angels gates answerably the number of the beast is chosen for the sake of six which is diametrically opposite to the number of the lamb and can neither by multiplication or division be reduced to the apostolical number the beast some observe had six books of decretals and his matters great and small in faith and worship are not squared by the rule of the scriptures or the apostles and so run upon six an opposite number

but may be a number of years of this second

beast yet cannot denote the whole time of his duration for have evidenced that he hath already been up longer than so in both his horns of spiritual and temporal power

some refer it to the time of his beginning others to the time of his end
of the former sort mr stephens finding that the pope had his title of universal bishop ann

looketh back years before christ when the romans subdued the church of the jews to make up the number
but cannot assent to it for as cannot find any scripture where numbering applied to any person referreth to the beginning but to the end as dan


god hath thy kingdom and finished it so see no warrant for faith to count from that epocha of the romans or pompey

is none of daniels numbers nor is there a syllable in the revelation putting upon counting thence rather the contrary rev

the things were to come therefore it is wholly groundless
if it must note the time when the beast began should much rather take the epocha from the time of john writing the revelation in patmos about ann
and add
it bringeth us to ann

about which time some think the pope obtained from pepin king of france his second horn of temporal power and began to be an earthly prince and so became a beast

some referring it to the time of his fall had raised expectations on the year
supposing that john left out the millenary number

but time hath confuted this that year being past and he not fallen unless you will begin either at the passion of jesus christ or the time of writing the revelation which yet is ungrounded

rather think it referreth to the time of his end for the reason aforesaid from dan


and that the epocha of the when it beginneth is not from the first rising of the beast but from his first marking time from the beasts making war with the first reformed churches or first causing his followers to receive a mark in their forehead or hand a note of distinction of the bestians from the opposite party appearing against him openly with the lamb in mount sion
none that know of have observed this notion yet methinks the text it self giveth great countenance to it for immediately after he had mentioned causing those that would not worship the image of the beast to be killed rev

which is by his warring against them and his causing all his to receive a mark in their foreheads or
immediately it follows here is the number of the beast count from this time of his open marking his followers to difference them from others and thence to the time of his fall or of receiving some deadly blow will be years

and further to confirm this as the next thing after mentioning the mark and number of the beast he subjoineth or addeth by way of opposition as of the same time that an oppo

site party were visibly openly marked for christ rev

and looked and lo a lamb stood on mount ion and with him
having his fathers name written on their foreheads
so that this referreth not to the time when a few but a vast number appeared for christ even and not privately but publickly in sion in the church with the fathers name upon their foreheads and not when they were first sealed but when they made the first open separation from the beast and appeared for the restoration of the church
it is when they rejoice with singing for redemption from and victory over antichristian pollutions
which plainly must be at the beginning time of pouring out the vials for then a like song of moses and the lamb is sung upon the same account rev

for victory over the beast his image and mark and the number of his was then after some getting out of spiritual egypt
so that the imposing the mark of the beast and the churches first restoration by the fathers name on their foreheads in an open profession are of the same date beginning at the first vial and thence the number of the beast is years to the time of his fall

and the first vial think began about the time of berengarius whose opinion was condemned by popish councils at vercellis and rome about ann
or therefore his was before how many years

and these were precisely three and this doth not lessen the number of horns or reduce them to seven but giveth him more power at rome
or mr parker thinketh they were three mahumetan kings viz solyman in asia cassianus in syria the egyptian caliph in judea which were subdued by the pope who raised the war and this was one of the greatest acts that ever he did and these are precisely three and properly subdued by him and these were of the ten horns or their territory belonging to daniels fourth beast

of the first rising of the beast

that the first rising of the ten horned beast in all probability was in the time of valens however before ann

it is a great mistake that a knowledge of the day of his birth will give a certain knowledge of the day of his death for he may not so early be in that work which giveth the first date to the prophetical numbers and he surviveth some of these viz the months which many would have to be the whole of his time yet seeing he must be up before he can act it is of great importance to enquire after the time of his first rising and take it thus

when the roman state or empire became like a troubled sea after the dragons downfal then did the beast arise and this was before ann
saw a beast rise out of the sea rev

sea is the gathering together of waters gen

and rev

are people and multitudes and nations and tongues

ammianus who lived at the very time of valens and valentinian and was a souldier then useth these words

at this time as if the trumpets had sounded the battel throughout all the roman world most fell and savage nations rose up in arms and invaded the next limits to them the alemanes wasted at once both gaule and the and quadi made spoil in pannonia both the one and the other
the ticts saxons scots and allacots infested the brittains with continual troubles the anstorians and other manrite nations made rodes more fiercely than they had wont into africk certain bands of gothick brigands and rovers rifled and ransacked thracia the king of persia laid violent hands upon the armenians thus far he lib

and now judge whether the roman empire was not at this time like a troubled sea and so whether the beast did not rise out of it especially seeing some of the horns were crowned in this time of valens about ann

when the body of the roman empire was changed from its ancient form of provinces into the form and shape of crowned horns then the beast was up for it's said in the days of john rev

they have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour or the first hour with the beast
the rising then of the beast and the crowning of the horns are about the same time
this beast is differenced thus from the dragon that he the beast hath his crowns emblems of soveraignty upon his horns rev

and from the two horned beast that he hath more than two even ten and upon his horns ten crowns

not that they must all be up first so as the rising of the tenth horn should give the first date to the beast for they are all horns of the beast and therefore speak a beast up for them to grow upon and they receive power as kings one hour with the beast rev

not the beast one hour with them intimating the beast to be first in order rather than otherwise
but as the dragon is said to have seven heads rev

when as the seventh head of popes was not up till dragon pagan power was down so as well

may this be called a ten horned crowned beast rev

before all the ten were crowned because there were to be so many principal ones and ten may not be taken precisely neither more nor fewer but indefinitely for many as numb

the dragon gave him the beast his power undefined span alphabet strength or force distinguished from authority and so it is outward strength or military power his throne the city of rome or a government there

now all this was given before or soon after ann

that received not only power but authority in the roman empire
might mention other leagues as between the emperour honorius and the goths and so with theodosius and others
all this argueth that the beast was up before ann



when the deadly wound was given to one of the heads then the beast was up for it was a head of the beast that was wounded as it were unto death rev

and so the beast must then exist and be up to receive the wound
now this deadly wound was made when alaricus sacked rome and perfected at augustulus
indeed this act was after ann

but it presupposeth the beast to be up and so we may reckon that he did rise before ann

and here note


it is not the pope but this ten horned beast who in respect of his first state is said to continue a short space rev

for it is not said the seventh head but undefined span alphabet another another of the eight kings with whom the word agreeth not another head
there were eight kings and but seven heads this was another king or state of government when the empire was so broken and changed from its antient form and shape of provinces into crowned horns and this was but a short time before it was wounded even unto death whereas the seventh head the pope hath continued a longer time than any of the other heads if compared with them
and further to confirm this he immediately

addeth the different states of the first beast
was and is not and yet is as before
and so was is before wounding this short space is not is when wounded yet is is after healed


if the first beast be the man of sin thes

then the which hindred not meerly his rising but his revelation must be imperial power which was removed by the aforementioned breakings and woundings of it
but if it be the second beast then the undefined span alphabet is their imperial authority and it was removed when popes and assumed power over emperours as hildebrand and others
rule
that the eastern parts belong to the first beast as well as the western
this is denyed by some but seeing it conduceth to the clearing up of truths and some material points shall give these grounds of it

the same dominion which the dragon pagan emperours had the same the beast hath compare rev

and

he is successor to the dragon with the same number of seven heads and ten horns all the constitutive parts
and seeing undenyably the dragon had the eastern empire as well as the west so must the beast have the whole territory also


there were crowned horns in the eastern parts as is undeniable and this differenceth the beast from the dragon compare rev

and

and

that crowned horns the eastern empire and endangered constantinople is before proved and these acted in persecution the work of the beast


the east and west made but one undivided empire till after horns of the beast were up in valens time though valentinian was associated with him yet the empire was one till divided between arcadius and honorius and diverse horns up

saith fox acts and monuments vol

and then were dissevered from them

but it is objected against the grecian empire belonging to the beast as followeth
obj
the greek empire was up long before the deadly wound out of which the seventh head with ten horns arose and so that cannot be of the ten
answ
this laboureth with or is built upon a double mistake viz that this beast cannot be up before the deadly wound whereas it was the beast that was wounded rev

and so must be up before to receive the wound
another mistake is that the seventh head did arise at the same time with the ten horns which deny see rule
obj
the ten kings receive power the same hour with the beast but the greek empire arose near years before and so is none of the ten

ans
when the roman empire in its other parts changed its antient form and was divided into

crowned horns then the same hour the grecian empire was changed from what it was before now it had a new distinct soveraignty of its own without dependence on the rest of the empire as formerly and so thence might be deemed one of the ten horns especially seeing some of those horns made such incursions into the eastern parts as is before discovered
if the alemanes arose ann

why might not another be up a little sooner some of them received power as kings the same hour with the beast and that is enoughÂ· rev


obj
the greek empire often withstood the pope of rome and so did not give his power to the beast rev

answ
this first beast proved is not the pope but a civil persecuting beast and the eastern empire had its share in the work of persecution as anastasius and others
yea the greek churches we heard did for some time give their power to the pope of rome
and further in the time of the lutheran reformation many churches were planted in germany england scotland france flanders denmark switzerland poland hungary so that diverse of the western princes and kingdoms withstood the pope of rome yet that will not prove that they never were of the ten horns the like may be said of the grecian empire

and further as the ten horns are said to hate the whore and burn her with fire rev

when onely some of them do it not all for there are others who committed fornication with her that lament her burning

rev
which seemeth to intimate that those who destroy her had not lately committed fornication with her
however it argueth there is no necessity that every horn should give power always to the beast and the greek empire may be of that number which also answereth the next objection

obj
if the greek empire were among the ten horns then it must last years whereas it came into the hands of the turks before it had been up such a time
answ
no necessity that there should be precisely ten horns neither more nor fewer and that every one of these should last years either in the same place rule or religion as at first
it is sufficient that the body of them or some continue so long in the work of the beast persecution
the goths ruled a long time in italy and then were expelled thence yet that is one of the ten horns still at first some of the horns were pagans others arians others since popish others became protestants fell off from rome did not continue
some of the horns at last must be of another spirit so opposite as to hate and destroy the whore rev

in short the whole roman dominion as of old in east and west make the boundary of the ten horns and so the grecians make one horn though the greek empire be at an end yet those that are or rule there make the horn

the conclusion then is that the quondam eastern empire or eastern parts belong to the ten horns some of them may be found

there and so those three horns dan


might be there and persecutions there may make the epocha of the days and some eastern powers though not under the notion of a grecian empire as before may hate the whore and burn her with fire rev

which otherwise would have remained very dark now plainly is a prophetical year two years and half a

year as dan


which is the same with years
and the beast also having months assigned to him for like work rev

it strongly proveth that all these are equal numbers and of the same date


that they are not taken indefinitely for an uncertain or long time but definitely for a certain determined time for though round numbers as
may be indeterminately used yet such broken numbers cannot be so taken for an uncertain time without special reason enforcing it
and seeing three several expressions are used five times rev

and
to set forth the same space of time and all of them broken numbers it must be a certain definite time else why is it and not days or months rather than or
or time times and half rather than four times and what difference were there between the and the days dan


or how could a head of account be laid down

how long shall it be to the end of these wonders if they were an uncertain number which no account could be made up from


that they are not natural or common days or months but prophetical every day noting a year as numb

which last are weeks of years reaching to the messias when natural days are intended there is a note of distinction as of evenings and

mornings dan


which concern the
the king of graecia
but those in the revelation cannot be natural days or only three years and half for the beast is of long continuance and hath been hundreds of years in the work of the months treading down the church rev

and his wounding and healing rev
and the earths wondring after the beast and his being ridden by mystical babylon so as to have all nations drunk with the wine of her fornication rev

hath been hundreds of years and the churches state very long these things cannot be confined to natural days but must be so many years

many have been mistaken in their computations and therefore would not be too positive therein but in probability those days and months began before ann

this appeareth diverse ways


the months and days must begin after the utter dethroning of the dragon or casting down pagans from their imperial seat and worship for upon that provocation and the triumph the beast as his successor driveth the church into the wilderness for such a time rev

they cannot begin upon his first overthrow by constantine the great but so as his was no more found in heaven
and therefore not till after julian who was the last professedly pagan emperor and reigned ann
or not long after and these days must begin after this and not before for the horns were not crowned and in the work

of the beast till then yet before ann



the days had their beginning soon after the first rising of the crowned beast for the months are assigned or allotted to him rev

power was given him to do months he being of such a savage nature
like a leopard a bear a lion would take the first opportunity offered for being in his work there is no evidence that he delayed till the deadly wound was made much less to the time of healing which was hundreds of years after
his receiving his power and throne and great authority
whence ensued the worshiping him
is mentioned before the deadly wound but that wound being given soon after his first rising that is the reason why so little of his work is mentioned till after that yet doubtless he was found in it soon after his first rising or before ann

some say that the days probably must so begin as daniels days may expire or end with them and so begin in likeliness before ann


daniel hearing of a time of unparallelled trouble and that then his people the jews should be delivered dan


enquireth
how long shall it be to the end of these wonders the answer was in two branches the one by a gentile number of time times and half
which is the same with days
daniel not understanding enquireth again after the end
and hath an answer again
in two branches the former is

by days which discovereth when the time times and half were to end else it were no explication thereof seeing they are different times cannot begin and end together
and whether they end with the days or not yet he giveth a direction when those days are to begin
from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up shall be daysÂ·

now this must be either the epiphanean or a roman abomination there is no third imaginable to make the epocha

cannot think that the epiphanean
when antiochus epiphanes prophaned the jewish temple
years before christ is intended for the abomination of desolation in daniel is mentioned as to come mat

in words agreeing not only to dan


but as aptly to dan


where the time times and half to be explained clearly refer to the fourth monarchy
and it is as rational that he should look back to another vision given to himself as to another third monarchy from the fourth
and if we begin the days at antiochus epiphanes they must end about ann

where was no suitable event for their expiration some would have it to be the first revelation of antichrist
but it is an answer to daniels question which twice was not concerning the beginning or revelation of him but the end of those wonders
and besides the revelation of antichrist was long before ann

if not ann

yet to be sure

when eerengarius and others openly witnessed against him an

neither should the days then usher in blessedness as
but great persecution

it must then refer to a roman abomination not at titus and vespasian about an

mat

compared with luk

for then not only the
but also the were expired long ago and yet the blessedness entailed is not come
it remaineth then that it must either be from the antichristian abomination viz from the taking away of the true and setting up the abomination of babylon making desolate rev

and

and this seemeth not to be intended for daniel using that phrase two or three times never applieth it that way nor doth he or john assign any such number as days to her or to the beast that carrieth her yet if other accounts fail this must stand because god is true

or it must be the julian abomination those days cannot begin since upon any jewish account for there hath never been any jewish temple since to sacrifice in or at and to be taken away
also that stupendious dispensation in the time of julian seemeth to many sutable for the days a jewish not a gentile number to begin with for he armed the jews against the christians demanded why they did not use sacrificing seeing the law commanded it when they answered it was permitted to them only to sacrifice in one

place the temple
then suddenly he commanded the temple to be rebuilt and by terrible earthquake thunder lightning and fire the foundation stones of the temple till that day unstirred were thrown out of their places and their tools and instruments burnt up so as cyril bishop of jerusalem then remembred the prophesie that there should not be one stone of the temple upon another matth

see socrat lib

or
ammianus marcellinus who lived in the very time of julian lib
saith that certain flaming balls of fire issuing near unto the foundations and making many terrible assaults consumed sundry times the workmen and made the place unaccessible
now to attempt to a jewish temple purposely for jewish worship and sacrificing in gospel times and that in direct opposition to christ and christianity thereby to take away the true and worship was a heighth of abomination and such as in a miraculous way brought desolation and although there be no account of any sacrifice then offered yet it was designed and the temple then being made utterly desolate hence the daily sacrifice which depended upon the temple dan


must needs be taken away also
and though julian was not personally or with an army in the holy place or city yet then he perfected the desolation begun in the time of titus and vespasian by his edict about the third year of his reign
am
marcell lib



and this is still the more considerable in that the abomination of pagan worship being set up about the second year of his reign the lord made it desolate also by a miraculous earthquake or fire the ethnick temple in delphos was overwhelmed and burnt down when julian had sent a legate to offer sacrifice therein and to consult with the oracle of apollo there of the event of the persian war

on the
day before the kalends of november
of october the most stately temple of apollo daphnaeus which antiochus epiphanes that ireful and cruel king built together with the image therein of jupiter clympicus equal in bigness to the patron it resembled by sudden violence of fire was burnt
and the abomination of heathen and jewish worship being attempted to be set up by julian as another antiochus epiphanes were made a desolation near the same time viz between an

and

and indeed there was a sutable event about the time of their expiration for ann

there was a preludium of israel salvation whose deliverance was the thing enquired after
if julian act was a little after an

often god doth cut short his work and omit small numbers as gen

in a great number
and according to mr brett narrative by the leave of the turk and the king of hungaria there was octob


a council of the jews consisting of about and spectators near to enquire after the

messiah whether he were come or not whether christ were he or not

after seven or eight days conference some of the roman clergy mentioning the use of images and praying to the virgin mary brake up in disorder yet it's said the jews agreed upon another meeting which was to be three years after and in syria
but if the days ended there then whether more will make up the days and usher in the blessedness of their deliverance let the event determine

the days must begin about the time when there were two wings of the roman eagle for the woman the church to flee by into the wilderness rev

when the empire the ensign whereof was the eagle was divided into so it was between arcadius and honorius about an

helvic

the days must begin before the dragon poured out his flood to drown the woman rev

for this flood was cast out
undefined span her or upon her back and therefore the was upon her journey going into the wilderness or gone gotten thither when this flood was poured out but the earth swallowed up the flood
and the dragon was disappointed

now many think it was a flood of corrupt doctrines called heresies and about an

and after these did swarm the eastern churches were even with arianism yeaÂ· in the west the barbarian persecuting vandals turned arians so there were nestorians pelagians

eutychians which earthly men civil emperours by calling councils did in some measure dry up

cannot say that this was the flood considering that the chiefest of these corrupt doctrines viz arianism did prevail in the time of constantine and constantius before the beast was up before the womans going into the wilderness and emperours themselves did countenance arianism as constantius and after him valens who were arians and persecutors
think it was a dragonish paganish flood for it is out of the mouth of the serpent
and in this book are expounded to be rev

people and multitudes and nations and tongues
let it then be a flood or multitudes of barbarous people and that not every inundation of them wherein they prevailed against the empire but some particular overflow of them after the beast was up wherein their design was chiefly against the woman or christian church and wherein they were unsuccessful the earth helping the woman they are swallowed up as
and where we find this we may conclude that the woman was now going or gone into the wilderness and so the days did begin a little before

now this flood of barbarians was either at the attempt of eugenius and arbogastes or else at rhadagaisus or both which actions shall here add and judge whether they do

not aptly answer to all that is said of this flood

it must be remembred that about this time the contest was afresh about pagan worship which constantine had thrown down and saith calvis
an

gentiles petunt restitui romae cultum ethnicum ambrosius resistit obtinet
and an

he saith eugenius cum suis claustra alpinm contra theodosium munit minitatur{que christianae religioni exitium si victor rediret the like say others
it is apparent then that the very design of eugenius was against christianity and to restore paganism in the roman empire and having usurped the supremacy in the west parts of the world theodosius the civil emperour after spending the night in prayer to god waged war with him and though the enemy were so many that it seemed impossible to encounter them yet there arose so violent a wind and tempest as the like never had been seen by any man then living which without annoyance to the emperour's people did turn the darts of
eugenius souldiers to light in their own side that theodosius obtained a compleat victory
see socrat
oros
funccius
and thus this dragon flood cast out purposely to drown the woman the church was swallowed up not by ecclesiastical councils but through divine concurrence by the earthly civil or military power of theodosius

also rhadagaisus with two hundred thousand for the restoration of ethnick worship came into italy thracia illyricum

noricum with fire and sword made great devastations the romans affrighted hereat called in the help of uldinus and sarus earthly pagan men with an army of hunns and goths and partly by hunger partly otherwise that so great a multitude was destroyed few escaped cent

and if this be the dragons floud then the woman must be in the wilderness an

and so the days began before


the days must begin upon a persecution raised by the revengeful overthrown dragon in the form of a beast by which the woman the church was driven into a vvilderness condition this persecution thus limited take to be the clearest firmest and most signal character of all for the discovering when the days and months must begin and yet not insisted on by writers suppose from their mistake thinking the first beast to be the pope and so making an apostacy of his to be the epocha whereas he is the second beast and there is another first beast which those months and prophetical days are to begin with and that at a persecution as all the three chapters where those days and months are mentioned do clearly evidence as rev

the holy city shall they the gentiles tread under foot months
that treading down importeth subjection great sufferings by enemies insulting over them with contempt and also the witnesses being in speaketh the like

so rev

the woman fleeth into the days
it is an allusion to the flight of the israelites from an enraged enemy persecuting pharaoh with such a flight which importeth tribulation mat

do the days begin and therefore with persecution and expresly
he persecuted the and this is mentioned as the very cause of her fleeing into the wilderness
for a time times and half a time for daysÂ· what can be more plain than that these days do begin with or by a persecution

the third place is rev

power was given him undefined span alphabet to do another version hath it undefined span alphabet to make war months and the warring with the saints is expresly mentioned with the same word

and note it is not every persecution that doth make the epocha it is not any till dragon pagan headship was cast down and so not any of the ten persecutions not any till after julian but after the first beast with crowned horns was up
which was many years before the sixth head of emperours went down
yea it is a persecution raised in way of revenge for the dragon pagan overthrow rev

the dragon when he saw he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the
it was then a fresh persecution upon that provocation his casting down
and note it is not every warlike irruption as that of alaricus which maketh the epocha but a persecution and such

as driveth the woman into a
which noteth not a change of place so much as of stateÂ· answerable to that of the israelites in the wilderness
it mporteth a solitary afflicted yet safe condition full of wants dangers trials temptations and yet having divine protections provisions and preservations

and hence none need be stumbled at the seeming or real godliness either of some emperours or popes after the beast was up for if the head of emperours did not persecute yet if some of the crowned horns did though others did not yet it may be deemed a persecution of the beast
often an action of a part is reckoned to the whole as achan to israel josh

compared with rev

so whether head or horns some of them persecute the church into the wilderness and this giveth the first date to the days
the great question then here is when did that persecution begin by the dragon in form of a beast with crowned horns out of revenge for his overthrow whereby the church was driven into a for at such a persecution or at the churches being fully in the wilderness thereby we must begin the months and days
and upon a diligent search into history it is to admiration that the event should so aptly agree to fix the epocha before ann


for such persecutions there were about that time by the head of emperours and by crowned horns as goths vandals hunns destroyed the churches and were feared every where

it must be remembred that theodosius the first caused the pagan temples to be destroyed which constantine shut up tripart

and being decreed to be plucked up by the roots this occasioned the fleeing of many into the wilderness by their persecutions both in east and west

take their and others words


the church in the west was grievously smitten because of publick saith sozomen for very many barbarous nations rushing chiefly into the roman regions have vehemently afflicted the churches as jerom maketh a great complaint of the thing
how many matrons how many godly virgins and comely and noble bodies were to those beasts he speaketh of barbarous nations the bishops taken and divers orders of the clergy slain ubi{que lucuts ubi{que gemitus plurima mortis imago
in these people the chief were the goths and vandals whereof seeing part were strangers to christianity and given to the superstition of the gentiles taking some occasion they did not only extreamly persecute christians but also endeavoured utterly to abolish them but part although in profession they were numbred among christians yet because they were

infected with the poison of arius they also did no less sharply oftentimes afflict the church
there is every where a meeting of pagans there are heard roarings and blasphemies against the christian faith complaints of the neglect of the religion of their forefathers therefore so great evils hung over them because omitting the ancient rites of sacrificing and rejecting their father's gods many imbraced therefore leaving all things they consult of reiterating their sacrifices of repairing of altars and restoring wholly all the idolatry of the ancients and devise to abolish christianity every where

about the same time the churches also of france sustained great persecutions for the vandals destroying france overturned many both cities and churches and made many famous godly men martyrs see also jerom epist ad geront
also the churches in spain experienced their calamities and afflictions for the vandals about
honor occupied spain and when some of them were arians and others gentiles catholicos more suo afflixerunt see more cent

and now judge whether the woman was not in sackcloth and the holy city trodden and persecuted by a revengeful dragon turned into a beast with crowned horns at that day and so whether the months and days were not begun


the church also in the east empire under arcadius sustained like persecution about the very same time cent

gainus a barbarous cruel and military man of the nation of the scythians troubled the church before an

being by profession an arian desired one temple of the emperour within the walls chrysostom told the emperour it must not be to blasphemers gainus did get an army he going by thracia destroyed all as he went constantinople was in eminent danger
a little after chrysostom saw the most corrupt state and dissolute discipline of the churches and began the correction of these things he was deposed and twice banished and at last died in banishment presently after he was gone out of the city there was a great fire which they laid to the charge of chrysostom followers they take and imprison many some were carried to chalcedon prison and neighbouring places and others carried beyond sea to divers islands being first vexed with divers torments others governour because a pagan and out of hatred of that religion took great pleasure in the misery of christians many had great tortures and were tormented unto death and not only in the city but in other places was trouble
the friends of chrysostom could not communicate with his enemies and therefore a great persecution was raised against the churches of god by the instinct of atticus and there was a law made for their lb cent

out of sozom
nicephor

and since there hath been a continuation of the persecution of the beast by its heads or crowned horns
as

the cruel vandals passing out of spain into africk under genserick their captain an arian about an

as calvis or as others being one of the crowned horns raised a sore persecution against the christians they wasted and destroyed all before them with fire and sword but especially raged against the churches the bishops and ministers they destroyed with many kinds of he had taken carthage all the ministers were thrust into ships and so banished all in the province were despoiled of all their substance and turned out of their genserick his son hunnerick succeeded who also used tortures and became a great persecuter he banished into the wilderness of bishops ministers deacons and other members of christ an edict in one day he caused all christian churches throughout africk to be shut up giving to the arians all the goods and churches of the some of them were told that they should be banished into the wilderness
he also sent abroad through all africk his cruel tormentors so that no place no house remained free from lamentation screeching and

these things and many more are written by victor bishop of utica who lived at the same time and was himself a sufferer under

this persecution
and it is remarkable that the suffering is once and again expressed by being in the wilderness which is the very notion it is under rev


as if it were literally to be fulfilled

attila king of the hunns when he wasted both empires did also not a little trouble the church virgins were made martyrs and many others cent

so anastasius emperour about ann

raised great persecutions
see cent

it were almost endless to mention the under emperours and crowned horns
but whether any acts of either aforementioned or some other acts did give the first date to the days must leave to others to judge
am comfortably perswaded that these days of their state are come to their period and end some years since
as a small act ishmael mocking might be the epocha of the years gen

so some less obvious act possibly might begin these prophetical days

chap
vii
of what ensueth after the days are at an end

it is confidently concluded by many writers that exactly and immediately after the perioding of the months and days there is an end of the dominion

of the beast and of the sufferings of the saints whereas am confident they are mistaken in both another event was to be expected
it's true then the witnesses come out of their but soon after they pass into a worse state as will appear under the next rule

rule
that after the expiration of the days and finishing of the testimony there is a war the death and resurrection of the witnesses and a great commotion before the sounding of the seventh trumpet
this appeareth for it's clear that daniel little horn continueth after the time times and half dan


the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his dominion to consume and destroy it to the end
therefore his losing his dominion and his destruction will be by a consumption after those times which are the same with days are ended
yea he is prevalent thinketh to change times and laws how long
until the ancient of days the saints possessed the kingdom until the seventh trumpet
and further to confirm this after the time times and half it is added dan


and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished viz daniel people the jews shall be delivered

so then the accomplishing to scatter the power of the holy people is after the time times and half are expired
and seeing we read not of any new scattering of the jews and this belongeth to the fourth monarchy and is a gentile number it may possibly refer to gentile christians and be in part expressive of the way of slaying the witnesses by a scattering them and their after these times or days are expired

also john in the revelation clearly placeth what concerneth the death of the witnesses after the days are ended revel


undefined span alphabet when they have finished their and not before doth the war begin
had rather render it so in the time past being in the aorist than when they are about to finish
and their testimony was not finished till the days of their prophesying expired seeing the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophesie rev

so long as they prophesie though in sackcloth it is not finished either for time or work
and not only the import of the word undefined span alphabet but the nature of the thing maketh that war and death subsequent
for during the days of their prophesying the witnesses are overcomers and their enemies are killed
rev

if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their he must in this manner be this in the days of their

whereas the issue of this war is the witnesses

are overcome and killed
the overcome and kill them rev


yea the prophesying state in the very mentioning of it is inconsistent with the deathstate and the death far worse than the prophesying though in sackcloth so long as they prophesie they are alive not dead
neither do the witnesses in the time of their lying dead torment the as they do in the time of their prophesying
the conclusion then is that the finishing of the testimony however the war and the death of the witnesses are after the months and days are expired and at an end
for the further discovering who are the witnesses and what their death how where and when they are to be slain taken seven propositions
prop
that the two witnesses are faithful ministers and pure professors or churches

for they are two candlesticks rev

which are interpreted churches rev
the seven candlesticks are seven churches and they are two olive trees which is but an allusion to zech

and cannot be confined to magistrates and ministers seeing they are never called a candlestick and pure professors and churches are anointed

john

pet


yea these are such as prophecy cor

rev

and that rev

not only making a profession at large but bearing and finishing a testimony for christ and his kingdom against the beast as
so as he becometh their enemy and maketh war with them
the two testaments are their testimony and so cannot be the witnesses however it cometh to the same in effect for if these or magistrates and ministers lye dead then so will such pure professors and churches also and so are to be deemed witnesses

prop
ii
that the death of the witnesses is an extremity of suffering or it consisteth in an unparallell'd cessation of testimony and deprivation of means and comforts of life

the various phrases of overcoming and killing them may intimate its being attended with much bloodshed but it is not chiefly a corporal death for then such must be the resurrection or recovery out of it and that under the sixth trumpet rev

whereas the corporal resurrection is not until the seventh trumpet
and their enemies behold them with pleasure three prophetical days or years and half which they could not do if it were a corporal death
it must then be a metaphorical death by the churches being in a state and condition full of extremity of affliction and suffering which often is called

a death cor

and

psal

and

isai

ezek

rom

it will not only be a civil death by deprivation of publick ministration and employment as to the exercise of office but also a spiritual death by an unparallelled cessation of testimony for they dye not meerly as men but as witnesses they lose much of their witnessing spirit rev

their state is far worse than in their prophesying time possibly by military men having power over
and forcibly disabling of them for former actual witnessing work and thus it will be not only their sin but their suffering that there is a failing of their testimony
and although spiritual life it self will not utterly fail yet they will in an extraordinary unpresidented way be cut short of external means for the support of it so as they are deemed as dead corps
and their restauration or recovery is by the spirit of life from god entring into them which importeth a precedent want of it
as the of the jews or israelites ezek
importeth not only the ruin of their city destruction of their temple despoiling of them of outward comforts houses lands relations
the profaning of the solemn worship of god the trampling under foot his ordinances the casting down from or work and subjecting them to the wills of merciless men and their own drawing up despairing conclusions
our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts

and the restoring of them is a recovery out of this condition to

so the death of the witnesses importeth the like an unparallelled unwonted loss of a witnessing spirit deprivation of the external worship and ordinances of christ and by scattering loss of communion and all aggravated with the triumphant blasphemies of enemies and insultations over them rev

and their own despairing conclusions from their seeing no visible possibility of coming into a better condition afterward all which will be attended with a variety of other afflictions and sufferings rendring their conditions so deplorable as is hardly to be of before experienced
prop
iii
that it is by a latter victorious war of the first beast that the witnesses are slain
rev
beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome and kill them

where note it was not by the dragon not by any of the ten persecutions in the first three hundred years after christ under pagan emperours but by the beast who was the dragon's successor he is the slayer of the witnesses and not the second beast the pope though it may be by his instigation but by the first civil persecuting crowned beast for it is by him which ascendeth out of the bottomless pit compare

rev

and


and it is by a war not a meer worldly literal war but a spiritual mystical war by a difference stated between the witnesses and the bestians and so not where the power of the beast hath wholly prevailed but where christ hath a potent party to make opposition
and not any war soon after the rising of the beast or during the days but when the witnesses have finished their testimony as to time and work and are overcome and the war ended and hence this death of the witnesses was not by any national distresses and calamities which equally betide bestians and the true witnesses nor could the death of the witnesses be before or at the smalcaldian war nor at the council of trent ann

nor at the massacre at paris ann

for from the rising of the horns to those times the days could not be ended or testimony finished and so the war was not then so much as begun

but if it be an act of favour here securing them from utter destruction yet it is a very publick business the sadness of their condition is notoriously known to those of various nations and kingdomsÂ· by the dead witnesses being personally present there

nor are they the same with the days for who can imagine that so many days should signifie no more than three days and half in the same breath and besides they are different states the one of sackcloth the other of death
neither are they dead when they begin their testimony as that would have it nor till they finish it
it remaineth then that the time of the witnesses lying dead is three years and half not to be counted from the first beginning of trouble that is longer for the war bringeth trouble but from the end of the war when it can be said now the witnesses are overcome and killed are able to make no more considerable opposition against the bestians but are spiritless their power is gone thence begin those days

this second step followeth not long after their reviving a resurrection

afterwards they have an invitation or call into a more honourable condition
and they heard a great voice from heaven saying come up hither
it is not the highest heaven for the call thither is not till the end of the seventh trumpet but the church is the heaven they are called up to which they were greatly cast down from during the time of their death now they are called to publick exercises again in a church state of exaltation and advancement and they ascended their resurrection is immediately after the half day but their ascention may be some time after more gradual and in a cloud with a great multitude as heb

mark


so after the resurrection of the witnesses at first hand not only those that have kept the watch and by edicts and acts in the time of their death sought to hinder their rising are struck into a pannick fear but as well many friends and witnesses may be filled with great trembling fear and amazement at the first hand by the and terrible dispensations
the rising of the witnesses at first may not be obvious to eminent christians so as to deliver them from fear or great workings of unbelief but at their ascention their exaltation by that call is so eminent and publick that then the enemies of the witnesses only fall under astonishing fears

and observe that whilst the witnesses lie dead there is a remnant that is secured from that death all the witnesses in all places do not die it is not so general god hath a reserve in that day of a number that shall bear some testimony and not suffer at the rate that others do where the stage of this tragedy is in the time of lying dead for those that lay dead all of them for ought know are called up into heaven into a state of exaltation rev

and therefore there are others who give the call and not those that lay

dead these do not call themselves but are called therefore there are others who did not fall under that death but these witnesses or friends who are reserved shall not appear so eminently till about the time of their ascension then the witnesses had that call and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud

prop
that there is an or stupendious alterations to the desolating a famous tenth part of the city about the time of the witnesses restoration rev

and the same hour or day as in some copies there was a great at the same time with the witnesses resurrection possibly as a means of their rising it alludeth to mat

or at their ascension
there was an earth quake commotions or wonderful alterations in the face of things as rev

and would hardly be called a great if it did not extend to many nations and kingdoms
this seemeth to be a turkish for it is closed thus rev

the second woe is the sixth trumpet is over which sounded by the turk as is generally granted and proved in that all matters of it aptly agree to him
so that this is a sure direction to tell us where we are at the witnesses ascension viz at the conclusion of the sixth trumpet

and it is very observable that the fifth

trumpet is closed thus rev

one woe is past but when he had mentioned much work of the sixth trumpet he doth not end the chapter in the same manner but suspendeth and deferreth that till he had mentioned some other eminent occurences chapÂ·
and then addeth
the second woe is past the witnesses being risen ascended and the over now the turks have done their work of the sixth trumpet the punishing the romanists for their idolatry worshiping images of gold and silver rev

now the turks will cease to be a woe as formerly to them no more famous exploits of theirs against papists are to be expected
the turks then may lose their dominion or much of it though their utter ruine and destruction may not be till afterwards and that upon the mountains of israel ezek

but they will be much concerned in this earthquake as the last part of their work against the romanists

now this is signalized by the destruction of a vast number of dignitaries either of the turks or romanists rev

and in the were slain of men
names of men men of name and office many more than of enemies of the common sort possibly parallel to rev

and by the repentance of some rev

and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the god of heaven and especially by the destruction of a famous tenth part and the tenth part of the city fell
to

is to be ruined overthrown destroyed made desolate as rev

this tenth part which falleth some think to be one kingdom where the witnesses did lye dead which is not proved and is unlikely seeing their death and the effect of their ascension reacheth other kingdoms
it is then either constantinople or some other famous kingdom belonging to the turks as hungary or greece
seeing the turkish woe now soon passeth and loseth ground before the seventh trumpet or else seeing it is a tenth part of the city think it rather is rome it self not upon mr too curious notion of that being but a tenth part now of what it was of old but as being emphatically the undefined span alphabet and because its fall is an immediate of the seventh trumpet rev

there is a triumphant song that the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of the lord a of his christ which is the same that is the destruction of the whore of babylon and by the same persons compare it with rev


and hence rev
is an explication not of the fifth vial but the sixth and the rather because after the witnesses restoration a remnant repented rev

and so their rising cannot be under the fourth or fifth or seventh vials for then they repented not but blasphemed god rev

their resurrection and ascension then must be under the sixth vial

it must be before the seventh vial at armageddon for at the seventh vial the whole fourth kingdom of the beast falleth whereas at the rising of the witnesses it is but a tenth part that falleth and that upon an under the sixth trumpet rev

after which there is another and the greatest earthquake under the seventh trumpet
whereas the seventh vial is the last of the last plagues and bringeth the greatest rev

and so cannot be that at the rising of the witnesses for that is not the last nor greatest
and further after the destruction of the whore there is an interval for the lamentation of some of her friends which survive rev

and for the rejoycing of others her enemies and making themselves ready rev

when the great supper at armageddon by the seventh vial is to come ver

only we must distinguish between the destruction of babylon at rome which is at the near the rising of the witnesses under the sixth vial rev

and the perdition of babylon as extending into the nations or the whole compass of the roman dominion which is not till the at the seventh trumpet rev

and at the seventh vial when the cities of the nations fall rev

and then great babylon cometh into remembrance to give her the fiercest wrath but babylon at rome was destroyed before rev

some not observing this distinction run

upon mistakes either to think that rev
belongeth to the seventh vial which is the last wrath whereas that rev
cometh after or else say that the turks and constantinople are the babylon mentioned under the seventh vial which dare not think they being no where called babylon in the apocalyps but rather belong to the beast or dragon and it is untrue for the beast carrieth the whore of babylon rev

whereas the beast never carried the turks nor did the corrupt church of rome ride upon the turks neither was constantinople the great city which in the days of john did reign over the kings of the earth
but rome was that city and stretching into the nations so it is the babylon mentioned in the seventh vial

and here observe that this slaying or lying dead of the witnesses three days and half cannot be successively in one kingdom after another for at their resurrection or ascension the tenth part of the city falleth rev

the sixth trumpet passeth
and soon the seventh trumpet soundeth
that notion would make divers slaughters resurrections and falls whereas the scripture maketh but one slaughter one resurrection one one fall of the tenth part neither can the sixth trumpet pass or the seventh sound in one kingdom after another for when that soundeth not onely one kingdom but the kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ

prop
vii
that the death of the witnesses ann

was not past but to come

there are various thoughts among learned men whether this black and dismal day of the witnesses death be past or yet to come think it is near approaching not only because the days of their sackcloth in all probability are finished and the warring time seemeth near at an end but because the sixth trumpet hath sounded a long time above years if it began when the turk obtained constantinople ann
therefore the conclusion of it cannot be far off

do not think the church to be the proper subject which the trumpets sound judgment against but the civil state of the roman empire and clearly the seventh bloweth good to the church rev

shall refer the reader to mr mede and others to see how and when the several trumpets sounded
all things concerning the sixth agree to the turk and if the hour day month and year rev

notifie the time allotted to the turkish tyranny then the end of his work is hastening for the time must be counted not from the time of their being but of their being to do the work of slaying the third part of men
this loosing of four angels or sultans seemeth to be before ann

for then they fell into one ottoman family however taking a day for a year as elfewhere the time for that woe will expire

within a few years which is after the witnesses resurrection and ascension

but my opinion is that the death of the witnesses is yet to come should be glad herein to be mistaken my grounds are these
until the days and the warring state be at an end their is not come for it is after finishing their testimony that the beast maketh war with them and killeth them rev

so long as their testimony is not finished and the war not ended so long they are not dead nor the three days and half begun and therefore ann

their death was yet to come
it's true in the time of their death there may be edicts or acts as after the death of christ sealing the to hinder the witnesses resurrection but till there be a suppression of their testimony they are not dead
ii
the condition of the witnesses since finishing of their testimony hath not been for three years and half far worse than it was before by a greater suppression of testimony and other unparallelled sufferings therefore ann

their death was not past but to come
the consequence is clear because the deathstate is far worse than the as death is far worse than life though in a mournful condition this hath been proved before
prop

iii
whatever the death of the witnesses consisteth in some recovery out of that is the immediate issue of the three days and half for else they

must be longer dead whereas rev

after three days and half the spirit of life from god entred into them
this standeth in opposition to the and no medium between them no moment wherein they are not either dead or alive at the expiration of these days before the fourth day they live
if their death consisteth in an unparallell'd cessation of testimony then there is some recovering into witnessing work again before four years be expired and so whatever else their death may be placed in

but no such recovery out of that which is their death or no removal of that wherein it doth consist hath been the immediate issue of three years and half of any supposed time for their death already past and so that is yet to come
see no scripture evidence for a gradual reviving or resurrection yet there may be a gradual ascension

iv
there hath not been such a triumphant state of for freedom from former torments which they felt by the witnesses prophesying as answereth rev

they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented was by their prophesying and praying as elias did that they tormented the bestians carnal earthly minded men and whilst the witnesses lye dead the are in a very prosperous flourishing condition keep a jubilee with more than ordinary signs of joy

as the variety of expressions intimates and this for freedom from their former torments

but no such triumphant state of earthdwellers hath been experienced in the time past since finishing their testimony
therefore their death is yet to come
the like might be said of the nations kindreds and tongues not seeing their dead bodies so as to hinder their burial

immediately after the reviving of the witnesses from their there is such a restitution to their former posture as is to the great affrightment of spectators rev
fear fell upon them which saw them
but this is not yet experienced by friends or enemies and so their is not past but yet to come

there hath not been ann

such a great earthquake or commotion as ushers in the consequents of the witnesses resurrection
and so it is not past but yet to come
rev

the same hour there was a great there is not yet a fall of that famous tenth part of the city nor the slaughter of
a vast number of men of name nor the repentance of a remnant so as to give glory to god nor is the turkish wo yet past as
therefore the death resurrection and ascention of the witnesses cannot be yet past but to come

the seventh trumpet hath not yet sounded therefore the witnesses are not yet ascended

for then that cometh quickly rev

though not the same moment with their resurrection yet very speedily after their ascension and so their death could not be at the time many fix upon as at the council of trent are past above years past

it's true the great reformation about the time of luther hath its place in the words of this book so as one of the seven vials think the fourth vial was then eminently poured out but that was not the sounding of the seventh trumpet
there are invincible arguments to prove that the seventh trumpet hath not yet sounded
for when that doth begin to sound the mystery of god is finished rev
as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
and what can this be or is called so in scripture that it can be applied to but the conversion of the jews rom
and it is evident the jews are not yet converted and saved
and further the second turkish wo is not yet past they do not yet cease to be a wo to the roman idolaters which must be before the sounding of the seventh trumpet rev

and there is a resurrection and ascension of the witnesses before the sounding of the seventh trumpet rev

after which it can never be proved that they shall pass under a death any more or such an extremity of suffering as they are under at this day in france and elsewhere

and once more immediately after the sounding of the seventh trumpet not only a jewish nation but the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of the lord and of his christ rev

and that so as he reigneth for ever and ever
and therefore after the sounding of the seventh trumpet antichrist shall never recover to regain any of the kingdoms to submit to him again as he hath done since the reformation
therefore the seventh trumpet hath not yet sounded and consequently the witnesses are not yet ascended

have wondred that this seventh trumpet beginneth thus and not with terrible dispensations but possibly the aforementioned great earthquake rev

did much of the first destructive work so as to usher in this triumph
and so the first sounding of it is with praises and much of the wo of the trumpet is reserved to the latter part of it

chap
viii
of the seven vials and that they are not all under the seventh trumpet

as the seven seals were several degrees of judgment upon rome dragon or pagan and the seven trumpets sounded an alarm of judgment upon the civil state of the empire so the seven vials are several degrees of judgment coming upon it after its papal state

and also upon other enemies of jesus christ at last

rev relateth to the time of the vials for there is the song of the lamb
which answereth rev

it referreth to a time of visible separation from antichristian pollutions and victory over the beast and his mark rev

so the vials rev

it relateth to the time of witnessing against and crying down babylon rev

babylon is fallen if any man worship the shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god and it is under the vials that there is this victory over the beast rev

it concerneth a time wherein an angel hath power over fire rev

and this is the angel of the fourth vial rev

and it mentioneth a harvest and vintage rev
to the end which must relate to the latter vials rev

and

and so rev
declareth the work of the angels or how they pour out the vials as well as the condition of the church under them

as to rev
take it to be no prophesie of what shall be accomplished before the vials begin to be poured out but it giveth a compendium or general view of matters relating to the vials from the beginning to the end like the contents of a chapter set before it and it discovereth the state and condition of the church and people of god during the time of the vials in a general way
it containeth

a description of the virgin saints
by their conquest over the beast and triumphant song for that victory and a subsequent privilege the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened
not before but after vial judgments

and the vial angels more particularly are described

by their place from which they come not out of the world but the church out of the temple
by their qualifications clothed in pure and white linnen by the instruments given them
golden vials by the persons from whom they receive these vials
by a token of a divine presence during the vials
some think that none of the vials are yet poured out others are otherwise minded for clearing this matter take a rule or two
rule
that the seventh trumpet doth not contain all the seven vials
some say that none of the vials are poured out till the resurrection of the witnesses is past and that all the vials are under the seventh trumpet
on the other hand am perswaded that most of the vials are poured out before the witnesses resurrection and that only the latter part of the sixth and the seventh vial do fall under the seventh trumpet and that upon these grounds


the consummation of the mystery of god

the jews conversion is at the beginning of the seventh trumpet rev

rom

rev

therefore before the beginning of the seventh trumpet most of the vials must be poured out for the conversion of the jews is not till latter vials as the sixth
and indeed by vials the kingdoms of the world must be brought off from the beast else they cannot become the lords and his christs


there have been storms of wrath upon and remarkable decays of the papal kingdom answerable to the vials as will be proved in the next rule therefore some vials are poured out whereas the witnesses are not yet ascended and the seventh trumpet hath not yet sounded rev


all the wrath of the seventh trumpet is contained in the sixth or seventh vial rev

the anger of the nations lightnings voices thundrings earthquake great are found under the sixth or seventh vials rev
to the end

there is no that all the vials must come under the seventh trumpet without which the supposition is groundless the contrary seemeth to be asserted for before the witnesses death or seventh trumpet they have power to turn waters into blood rev

which is the work of the second and third vials and to smite the earth with all plagues which reacheth other vialwork

it's true the seventh seal delivereth itself

into seven trumpets as its work rev

but so doth not the seventh trumpet deliver it self into seven vials that hath much other work of its own and men must not coyn such a method there without a divine warrant

the fine and white linnen speaketh their purity and freedom from antichristian pollution and their having the righteousness of the saints rev

but this is no way unsutable to the witnesses in their rev

their having harps in their hands and rejoycing under the vials rev

is not inconsistent with the witnesses for they may have sometimes and cause of rejoycing there philip


hab

rev

although the highest rejoycing is reserved to the latter vials
rev
to
and

that the seven vials are the seven last plagues is no proof that all of them must come under the seventh trumpet that differenceth them from the seven seals and seven trumpets there were no more seven distinct dispensations to succeed or come after and indeed the seventh seal was opened and divers trumpets had sounded before the first vial was poured out and so they may well be called the seven last plagues though only the wrath of the seventh vial should come under the seventh trumpet

obj
then there are two wo's in the second wo one by the vials the other by euphrates

angels and the subject of the second wo and of the vials differ

a
no absurdity if there be two different dispensations of wrath in the time of one wo viz and as it's undeniable under the sixth trumpet there is great wrath rev
to the end and yet also another great earthquake rev

yea it must be so if all the vials came under the seventh trumpet for then there would be there the wo of that trumpet and also of all those vials

they may contemporate and yet the subjects of the second wo and of the vials differ what should hinder this a trumpet may blow wrath to the roman civil empire and yet at the same time vials may pour out wrath upon the roman papal state
but the grand objection is obj
the seven vial angels come not out of the temple till it be opened rev

but the temple is not opened till the seventh trumpet rev

and so on vials poured out till then

a as to rev
it is an epitome or general view of as of all the seven angels coming out
which they never did together but at several seasons and mr observeth that the complutens edition readeth not come out of the temple but out of heaven
some think rev
speaketh only of an opening of the temple of the tabernacle
noting an unsetled condition or mixture of tabernacle and temple sutable

to the former vials before the was ended answerable to which the song is mixed of moses whilst yet in the wilderness exod

and of the lamb
and that it doth not refer to the opening under the seventh trumpet rev

of the temple which concerneth a new jerusalem state of settlement and so it's far from proving that all the vials come under the seventh trumpet
my answer is


the seven angels come out of the temple before that opening of it under the seventh trumpet rev

that opening is not to let vial angels out but to let a vast number in and to give the highest and most glorious discoveries of jesus christ and his matters and not till the seventh vial the temple of god was opened in heaven and what was the effect of it there was seen in this temple the ark of his testament which was a most eminent symbol of his presence
this opening was to give the choicest manifestations of his presence it noteth the unloosing or opening the most hidden and glorious mysteries of all even christ himself
it cannot be proved that this opening is before any angels going forth to pour out vials but rather after the seventh vial was pouring out

then there cometh a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done rev

and this is when the new jerusalem cometh down from heaven for there the like phrase is used rev

it is done and
the gates of it shall

not be shut at is an opening at the seventh vial the new jerusalem standeth open in opposition to some shutting in the time of former vials
then the lord maketh highest discoveries of his glory
and

they shall see his face


say therefore there is a double opening of the temple one before the vial angels go forth to let them out rev

another after the vials are poured out rev

joined with judging the dead and rewarding the saints
or often things are spoken absolutely which are to be understood comparatively and so he doth not deny absolutely that there is any opening of the temple till the seventh trumpet but comparatively
at the former opening before the vials few in comparison enter rev

no man could enter till the seven plagues of the seven vials were fulfilled till the latter vials few entred but at the latter opening many enter rev

the kingdoms of the world are the lord's and his christ's and this is not before the seventh vial

chap
ix
of the vials and how many are already poured out

the seven vials are so many dispensations or tempests of divine wrath not upon the saints but upon the papal and antichristian world upon the worshippers of the beast and those

that receive his mark rev

upon such as shed the blood of the saints
upon such as blaspheme the lord

hence earth sea rivers sun cannot here be taken literally for that would bring as much hurt to the true church as to the antichristian party but mystically for that which in the papal or antichristian world beareth a resemblance unto earth sea rivers the natural world and so the beast's earth is the subject of the first vial his sea the subject of the second vial
and observe that none of the vials are poured out until after the second beast the pope was up rev

for till then the image of the beast was not made nor worshipped
it was he that caused all to receive a mark

and the very first vial falleth upon those that had the mark of the beast and did worship his image rev

and he was not up in his first horn till phocas ann

and had not his mark till after ann

as have proved and seeing seals were opened and divers trumpets sounded before this time hence they are much mistaken who think that the first seal and the first trumpet and the first vial do contemporate and so of the rest

also note that the former vials do alter but do not utterly destroy the subjects of them and therefore it is not to be wondred at if after these have been poured out yet the beast hath recovered again and seemed to regain what he lost for even the fifth vial is

not said to destroy the seat of the beast but to fill his kingdom with darkness and only the sixth and seventh vials do destroy the subjects of them

rule that we are under the latter end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth vial
have before manifested that we are in the latter end of the sixth trumpet and how many vials are already poured out cometh now to be considered
shall briefly declare when the vials as conceive began to be poured out and thereby it will appear that now ann

we are either under the latter end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth vial
the first vial was poured out upon the earth the popish earth rev

is the most gross inferiour part air of a more subtile nature and so must either be the grosser doctrines of popery or the common popish people those earthly out of which the beast ariseth rev

hence the effect of this vial is
a noisom sore upon those that have the mark of the beast and worship his image they are filled with inward torments and vexation and also rendred noisome and very loathsome unto others as those that are full of grievous and filthy sores

this vial began to be poured out by berengarius peter bruis and others who witnessed some say ann

others about ann

and after against the grosser corruptions of

rome as transubstantiation adoration of the host bowing the knees before it and called the church of rome ecclesiam magnantium concilium vanitatis sedem satanae leonem pontificem sed pompisicem at{que pulpificem dictitabat

yea an anonymous author mentioneth their conventicles in tours who denied the substance of the bread and wine to have transmutation into the body and blood of christ so that here was the first visible or open separation from rome and a very great multitude in divers nations imbraced their doctrine and were drawn off from romish errours by their means whereupon the gospellers were called berengarians and they opposed antichrist not in one place only but filled most noble countries matth

and this alone may argue that the beastmarked ones and his were now smitten as with a noisome sore for the pope and his party were so tormented that it's said they condemned the opinion and the fautors of it as hereticks seeking their extirpation warning princes to take heed of them and banish them out of their territories they called councils against berengarius one at rome by leo ix about an

ib and bertold
const

the recantation of berengarius if he made any cannot hinder his being instrumental in pouring out this vial seeing he disowned his recantation and there were many others besides him that firmly taught the same true doctrine and many thousands in several nations stedfastly owned it and couragiously opposed those corruptions of the romish church to their great vexation
as aaron and peter had their falls their blemishes so may pourers out of vials for the hardening of their enemies and humbling of themselves which here intimate once for all
and conclude that the first vial was poured out by these berengarians and because this was the first eminent storm of wrath upon the worshippers and marked ones of the beast or the first rising out of the dregs of popery the first remarkable open separation from rome and is answerable to all that is said of that vial


the second vial was poured out upon the sea rev

upon the popish sea and the effect is it became as the blood of a dead

man without spirit corrupt filthy and deadly for every living soul in the sea died many in or that were maintained by the popish sea could no longer live and breath there

this must either be the whole papal religion and corrupt doctrine wherein they trade and traffick about the souls of men rev

with all their corrupt ecclesiastical constitutions forms ordinances and worship taken together
or else is the whole compass of the papal society the nations people kingdoms and provinces of the papal dominion or jurisdiction thus waters are taken rev

and sea is a confluence or the gathering together of waters
the explication of this second vial and the manner of its pouring out is found rev

and it reacheth to many nations kindreds tongues and people

this second vial was poured out by the albingenses and waldenses for after the berengarians they were the next which were famous for making opposition against and separation from the pope and corrupt church of rome and in them all that is spoken of this vial was exactly fulfilled for waldus being converted about ann

he preached sound doctrine as rev

fear god and worship him do not worship images he and others called off from the idolatry of rome some called it the new gospel the in opposition thereunto called it the everlasting gospel or possibly in opposition to what was falsly so called

for matth
paris
about an

mentioneth a wicked book made by the jacobin entituled
the everlasting gospel the design of which was to suppress the gospel of christ teaching that the state of grace did not proceed from the law of the gospel but from the law of the spirit for so they called their dreams and revelations
indeed this book was so pestiferous that platina saith alexander iv caused it to be burnt but it's saidÂ· this burning it was secretly and by constraint for he banished willÂ· de amore who complained of it

whether be the whole papal doctrine or the papal society made up of many nations either way these waldenses poured out a vial upon it shewing the corruptness and deadliness of their religion and worship in the complex body of it and this in many nations of the papal kingdom whereby many thousands were converted and durst drink no more of those corrupt doctrines than of the blood of a dead man and many that traded in the papal sea and had dependance upon it lost their livelihoods and so died civilly as may be seen in the histories of them
yea even literally it was in part fulfilled for when they raised wars against these waldenses multitudes of the papal party perished it's said that in the siege of avignion were destroyed by famine pestilence and drowning more than two and twenty thousand of the french souldiers acts and mon part

and many more died elsewhere though afterward by various

ways they did sorely persecute those faithful creatures

reinerius a writer about their time and an extream enemy against them yet is driven to confess this of them that the sect of the leonists hath a great shew of holiness in that they both live justly before men and believe all things contained in the creed only they do blaspheme the romish church and hate it ib
and he and others do conclude these leonists to be of all other sects as they call them most pernicious to rome and that for three causes

because of longer continuance

because more general almost in all lands

because of a shew of piety
so that this was upon the papal sea even the papal party themselves being judges

it was never more sharply oppugned than by the waldenses their doctrine saith he differeth but little from the now protestants non per galliam solum totam sed etiam per omnes penÃ¨ europae or as disseminarunt nam galli hispani angli scoti itali germani bohemi saxones poloni lithuani gentes aliae eam ad hunc diem pertinaciter defenderunt
so that nations kindreds tongues and people received the pure gospel and forsook the deadly roman see by their means
they spread into picaray whence they were called picards by persecution they did flie into germany and alsatia where they spread their doctrine they had goodly churches in bulgary croatia dalmatia and hungary
clarks martyr
where also see what their doctrines and opinions were as

that the mass was an abomination the host an idol and purgatory a fable they declaimed against popish holy oil with baptism canonical hours auricular confession adoration of imagesÂ· indulgences
praying for the dead and many others even the see of the romish corrupt doctrines and made it as a dead sea and so was the second vial


the third vial was poured out upon the rivers and fountains of waters rev

which come from the sea and return thither again
and if sea in the former vial be the confluence of corrupt doctrine as watersÂ· signifie doctrine ezek

isa

and

then the rivers are some particular corrupt doctrines or some doctors or emissaries of the romish church
or if sea there was the confluence of nations and kingdoms making up the papal jurisdiction as waters signifie rev

then rivers and fountains denote some particular nations or kingdoms within the papal dominion

and the effect of this vial is that these rivers rev

become blood they become bloody much of the blood of the papal party is shed there as
thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy
and there is a double attestation of the righteousness and equity of it the lord is declared true and righteous in his twice over
thou art righteous thou hast judged are thy judgments
which being the same cry that will be in giving glory to god at the great destruction of babylon

rev

hence take this vial to be as a sessions or a preludium as it were a type and that fall of babylon rev
like a great assize
and therefore this third vial is notified rev
babylon is fallen is cannot be the great fall of it for after this several other angels have vial work to end whereas after the great fall of babylon rev
there is only one vial to follow at armageddon rev

this third vial was poured out by the wickliffites and hussites and jerom of prague and others about ann
and after for then there was a distinct gust of wrath upon the papal party and doctrine as the next remarkable blow after that of the albingenses and waldenses and this was answerable to all that is said of this vial which falleth only upon the rivers and fountains not upon the popish sea
in that dark time they did famously witness for christ against the pomp avarice of the pope to the bringing multitudes off from his corruptions
they held such doctrines as these that the substance of bread remained in the sacrament after the words of consecration that the people should have it in both kinds they declared against popish pardons indulgences and corporal unction as a sacrament

a council at constance was assembled by the emperour sigismund and pope john
ann

where a sentence of condemnation was given out against the doctrine of john wickliffe and his bones ordained to be raised out of his sepulchre

and to be burnt
also notwithstanding the emperour sigismund sent for john huss to the council and promised him safe conduct yet they condemned john huss and though the nobles and lords of bohemia did challenge the safe conduct yet they condemned and burnt him and jerome of prague was burnt also

and cannot without admiration observe how answerable the event was to the effect of this vial as rev


which may further confirm it and render it undoubted that now this vial was poured out

for a nobleman named zisca being sore grieved for the death of john huss and jerom of prague minding to revenge the injuries which the council had done greatly to the dishonour of bohemia he gathered together a number of men of war and subverted the monasteries and idolatrous temes pulling down and breaking in pieces the images and idols driving away the priests and monks having gathered together about men took towns obtained the city of prague where the number of the reformers was increased sigismund the emperour besieged that city but lost many menÂ· and was forced to raise his siege and after had a great overthrow by zisca in that conflict were slain fourteen noblemen of the moravians and hungarians and others a great numberÂ· zisca took many places destroyed monasteries in the territory of pelzina put the emperour to flight
he with his power entreth again into bohemia with a great army

but the emperour afraid of zisca fled again and many of his nobles were slain
zisca pursuing the emperour a days journey and having obtained this victory would not suffer any image or idol to be in the churches nor priests to minister with copes or vestments
the reformed obtained another great victory many nobles of their enemies slain and common souldiers
in the epitaph of zisca it is said that he was a severe punisher of the pride and avarice of the clergy that eleven times in joining battel he went victor out of field
see acts and mon vol
out of aeneas silvius

after the death of zisca sigismund the emperour which burned huss and jerom is fain to intreat for his kingdom
pope martin then perceiving the gospel to increase daily more and more sent into germany to move them unto war against the bohemians whereunto also the emperour did assist
there were three armies provided which joined together but when the news came that the reformed had gathered an army and came with all speed towards them they fled before they saw their enemies leaving great prey
the cardinal meeting them in their flight marvelled at their cowardliness and intreated them to turn again to their enemies but all in vain the bohehemians coming upon the rereward and then their flight was more disordered and fearful than before neither did they leave flyingÂ· before the bohemians left following the host of the bohemians was greatly enriched
sigismund

the emperour having news of these things gathered new help also pope martin sent into germany and a new expedition is decreed against the bohemians and several bishops as of mentz trevers and cologne their aids
the bohemians made ready but there fell such a sudden fear amongst all the papists throughout the whole camp that they began most shamefully to run away before any enemy appeared in sight and by all the intreaties of cardinal julianus would not return
thus the reformed by the fear of their enemies made the more bold and couragious pursued them and had great prey and spoil and the bohemians prospered so long as they could agree among themselves

and now judge whether these acts of zisca and other bohemians upon a reformed account so wonderfully prevailing against the popish party were not the pouring out of the third vial upon the rivers and fountains and the effect thereof whereby they became blood rev

and the angel of the waters giveth glory to god for judging thus rendering this reason
for they have shed the blood of thy saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy
so
it was for shedding the blood of the saints john huss and jerome of prague and others that these wars were raised by zisca and the bohemians and here the lord gave the popish party who are the proper subjects of this vial of their own blood to drink and therefore doubtless here was the third vial poured out

have the more insisted upon it because it is given by the holy spirit as an emblem or lively resemblance of the great destruction of babylon at rome rev

these exploits of zisca and the bohemians am apt to think were a lively picture or representation thereof even in the very manner of it viz by some purely professing commander like zisca upon a religious account for injuries offered to the saints and so as the mighty romish armies shall be struck with consternation or a pannick fear and flee before the sight of their enemies


the fourth vial was poured out upon the rev

the effect is power was given him to scorch men with fire
that which in the antichristian world resembleth the sun in the natural world must be the subject of this vial and therefore the pope is this upon which the wrath of this vial falleth for he is the greatest most illustrious and glorious light there which they say so derives light to the very scriptures that they are counted authentical and their sense received doctrine worship councils decrees only as they borrow light from him for their ratification and therefore he is this sun
yea as if it were purposely to intimate so much the emperour writeth to the pope and saith we are both appointed of god as two great lights sleidan
comment
and after innocent
iii maketh the bishop or priest much more excellent than the other
look what difference is betwixt the sun and the

moon so great a diversity is there betwixt the office of a and a kings office ib li

upon this the pope did luther and other worthies about ann

and after pour out such a vial of wrath as never any did the like before papists themselves being judges
he writ a book wherein he saith that the see of rome is nothing else but the kingdom of babylon and the power of the strong hunter nimroth when they burnt luthers works he burnt the bishop of romes law and the decree then lately published openly
ib
so calvin melancthon zwinglius and many others as well as luther scorched men with fire as rev

and this is a sure direction when this vial was poured out viz when men by their preachings writings disputations denounced fire and brimstone and the greatest torments against such worshippers and so it is explained rev

if any worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his openly or in his hand secretly
the same shall drink the wine of the wrath of god poured out without shall be tormented with fire and brimstone which was clearly fulfilled in luther and calvins time
how many countreys and kingdoms by such preaching fell off from rome and took up reformation as desiring to preserve themselves from that fire which therefore scorched the papal party

after a disputation religion was reformed not only at bernes but also proclaimed by magistrates in sundry places thereabouts masses altars images abolished in all places
they wrote the day and year wherein they forsook the popish religion upon a pillar in golden letters that it might be an everlasting memorial to their posterity

likewise they of geneva did imitate them of bernes wherefore the bishop and clergy forsook the city in anger
then the reformers began to be called protestants of whom there were seven princes
the protestants made a league that if any did stand in danger for religion one might help another ib li
another symptom of its being then poured out is the great following persecutions raised by the bestians being incensed by the torment of this fire as rev

here is the patience of the saints here at this time is the tryal of their patience that even death it self shall be desireable
blessed are the to which in the fourth vial it is said rev

men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of repented

all which was manifestly accomplished for after luther and calvin and others had proclaimed fire against the worshippers of the beast they repented not witness the council of trent wherein they sought to establish their abominations and then followed the great and sore persecutions in most kingdoms of the

beast in the west as france spain germany bohemia england all which give evidence that then the fourth vial was poured out


the fifth vial is poured out upon the throne of the beast rev

and the effect is his kingdom is full of darkness and they have anguish and indignation gnawed their either is the government of the beast his soveraignty and authority as psal

psal

and if it be taken thus then this vial might be poured when the popes supremacy was cast off by protestant princes as hen viii
edw vi eliz
duke of saxony brandenburgh when popish orders and branches of that government were rejected
the german princes told the popes ambassadors they acknowledged not his authority in such matters and elizabeth would not suffer them to come into the land
sympson of the church
or the throne of the beast most properly is the chief place of his residence wherein he appeareth in his highest majesty and glory
and this vial was poured out upon germany or the german empire since ann

especially by gustavus adolphus

know many think the city of rome to be the throne of the beast which this vial falleth upon but the city of rome is the woman rev

or whore of babylon which sitteth upon the beast
and so cannot be the throne which the beast sitteth upon
and the more improbable is it that rome should be

this throne for when a vial cometh upon that it is with an utter destruction rev
and so it is by the sixth vial whereas the fifth vial doth not destroy but darken the kingdom of the beast
it will be hard or impossible to prove that the throne of the beast the pope is intended here and if it be of the beast then although the throne of the dragon was given into his possession yet he made it not as his throne for when the beast was very young the emperour did not take up his residence at rome but at ravenna sigon de reg ital
speaking of ravenna saith postremo honorius eam sibi at{que occidentis imperio sedem urbe rom relicta constituit quod institutum successores quo{que illius tam imperatores rom quam reges gotthorum custodierunt

that as honorius was enthroned not at rome but at ravenna so other emperours till augustulus ann

and then there were no emperours in the west or at rome till carol
magn
ann

neither have the emperours ever since to this day made the city of rome their seat or throne but germany and there are seven electoral heads and ten horns or provinces in the west as the beast
let the throne then upon which this fifth vial falleth be germany especially seeing the event doth admirably answer there to all that is said of this fifth vial

for the case was thus as it's said
some seeds of division being sown by the proscribing and forcing donawerdt on the occasion of

a tumult at a procession there and mastering gulick the german protestants received the alarm and assembled at hall and the catholicks at wirtsburgh
this quickly did fly like filled all germany and involved all europe in a prodigious war some compare it with that of zisca and the bohemians

shall give some short account of it out of parival
history of the iron age and shall refer to the book it self for a larger and fuller discovery of it
he speaketh much in favour of the papists but declareth himself in this manner
abhor to begin the discourse of the longest and most cruel war that ever was in christendom and which drew more blood more altered the christian faith and caused more ruine and desolation than all that ever were in europe ib li

and ann

gustavus adolphus king of sweden invited by the germans incited by france england venice the united provinces as also by his own peculiar interests entered germany with an army was sure of his allies and of the inclination of all the protestants whose cause and religion he came to defend
king gustave takes francfort beats the imperialists cleansed pomerania
ambassadours of the princes imperial towns and protestants states treated an alliance with king gustave
these sparkles encompassed all germany with a fire which lasted till the year
ib cap


gustave worsted tilly before the fort of

werbern being joined to the forces of the electors had a great battle with tilly the emperours general at leipsick
this battel wherein were hazarded the caps of two electours the liberty of the princes of germany the conquests of so many years and the whole hope of the roman catholicks was very bloody and the old bands which had never been seen fly gave gound here ib
king gustave hath the victory and tilly with the imperialists were put to flight an army of four and twenty thousand captains that is old souldiers were broken in the plain and open bloody battel was sept

which was called a day of changed the countenance of the affairs of germany
and the news of this rejoiced not only all the protestants but also all such as to whom those glorious eagles seemed too proud and too much undertaking ib

the first post which arrived at vienna brought news of the defeat of the saxons the second that of tilly which disturbed the joy and the third filled the whole court with sadness and made it think of a way how to repair this great loss
if the africans much amazed to see them the romans before carthage so to say the truth the bishops and the roman catholicks were not a whit less by the destruction of this army which had always been victorious and by means whereof after the gaining of one battel they hoped to see the mass and the imperial authority restored

throughout all germany
a flock of sheep is is not more scattered when it sees itself environed by wolves and without a shepherd than were the ecclesiasticks by this accident for terrour having thrust it self in amongst them they betook themselves all to flight some to the other side of the danube and others by the rheyn to cologne ib

italy was alarmed by the report of so great the swede still goeth on though not without some checks and even after the death of gustave yet often had great successes and prevailed much against the german emperour and at last forced him to stoop to such terms as he could make with him
and now judge whether the fifth vial was not here poured out upon germany as the throne or chief kingdom of the beast for this war was stated between the beasts party of the one part to the striking great terrour into the hearts and overthrowing so many thousands of them and the as the other party
and seeing this is a distinct storm upon that party after four vials had been poured out what can this be but the fifth vial and the rather because all things answer to it even as to effects
as

the whole kingdom of the beast was darkned as rev

even by that one blow given by gustavus adolphus did it not suffer a greater eclipse of its esteem and glory at that day than ever before even at jankow battel

march

there was a most sensible defeat to the imperial party forÂ· it left bohemia as a prey and opened the passage into moravia and the emperours hereditary lands as far as the danube
every one thought that the emperour was lost if the swedes chanced to pass the danube
they were in great amazement to see the swedes at one and the same time at the gates of vienna copenhaghen and bremen every where treading down their enemies part

this therefore was the fifth vial which seemed to have spent its greatest strength and to be drawing towards a conclusion when the pacification was made in germany or peace ann

but some effects may have continued since

neither will this deny it to be that vial that the effect of the german war fell as heavy upon god's people there as his enemies
for at the first hand here was a great distinction between the people of god and others
and however in some of the first plagues in egypt to which the vials allude the lord made no distinction between the israelites and the egyptians till exod


and further the effect of this vial is rev

they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed repented not
which argue the indignation vexation rancour and extremity of rage which the beasts party shall be filled with by the pouring out of this vial upon them and so they not only persist in their evil way without repentance blaspheming god but like distracted

they seek to revenge their own quarrel by falling upon and raising bitter persecutions against the protestant party and therefore this is but an expected issue of the darkness and pain an event of this vial and so rather a confirmation of its being then poured out

neither will this deny that german war to be a vial because the empire is yet standing
for see no that any vial except the or do bring a total destruction upon the subjects on which they fall for if the beasts earth sea rivers and fountains had been utterly destroyed by the three former vials there could have remained nothing for several other vials to be poured out uponÂ· these comprising the whole antichristian world
and this fifth vial doth but darken not utterly destroy the kingdom of the beast rev

and so the german empire may be yet standing after that vial is poured out upon it as egypt was darkened before pharaoh and the egyptians were destroyed
and immediately before that vial which destroyeth the whore she fitteth as a queen saying she shall see no sorrow rev

and how could she sit in such pomp if former vials had caused an utter destruction of what they fell upon

in short either rome cannot be the throne which this fifth vial is poured out upon seeing then they repented not rev

or else it cannot be the tenth part rev


for then they repent
and if the fifth vial was poured out in germany then we are under the latter part of that or the beginning of the sixth vial

that which followeth is mostly hereafter to be fulfilled or in a great part to come

the sixth vial is poured out upon the great river euphrates rev

the effects of it are the drying up the waters thereof and preparations to
the subjects of the other vials are not literal but mystical or metaphorical and therefore euphrates is not to be understood literally here of that very river especially seeing all the seven are or vials of the wrath of god rev

and the drying up that river is no such plague neither is the wrath of god kindled against it more than against any other river
therefore the river euphrates here must notifie either that which is the strength of mystical babylon as euphrates was of literal babylon or else the people inhabiting about euphrates which are the turks
the event will be the best interpreter of the prophesie

if euphrates be the strength of mystical babylon then as the drying up literal euphrates by cyrus was the means of taking literal babylon so the drying up here importeth the great means of the desolation or downfall of mystical babylon
and being multitudes people nations and tongues rev

hence the drying up of these is by the

conversion of many and their coming into the kingdom of jesus christ rev

or by some great destruction or desolation and wasting of people about vienna and austria the strength of mystical babylon and this may be a provocation to the nations that they are angry
and make preparation against christ
and the triumph for the ruin of babylon being and being the immediate of armageddon rev
the preparation to which is in the close of the sixth vial rev
to the end
hence it seemeth that the desolation of babylon at rome is by that sixth vial and before the seventh else there must be two earthquakes under that one seventh vial viz one at that and the exaltation of the witnesses under the sixth trumpet rev

and another the greatest under the seventh
rev


or else euphrates must be the turks the people that inhabit about euphrates which is but once more mentioned in this book rev

and there referreth to the turks
the are as rev

people multitudes nations and

by this vial these waters are dried up wasted consumed vast numbers great multitudes of the turkish people are destroyed or many nations fall off from the turks so as they lose much of their power and dominion and cease to be a wo to the romanists when this cometh to pass the sixth vial is pouring out
by what ways and means this will be whether by intestine discords or some exterraneous

enemy the event must determine
the angel that poureth out this vial cometh out of the temple as well as others and is clothed in pure and white linnen rev

and so it seemeth not to be primarily or only by intestine discord nor by the antichristian romanists as vial angels but jesus christ may imploy these in the destructive work dashing enemies as potsheards one against another as a fruit of the prayers of saints

as the former vials were much poured out by preaching so the two last by prayer
a vial angel out of the temple solliciteth jesus christ the angel on the white cloud to thrust in his sickle and reap a harvest by cutting down his enemies and he doth it as a return of prayer rev

and this think doth contemporate with and is an explication of this sixth vial
and thus the angel is in white linnen under a pure profession who poureth out the vial in a way of prayer but it is referred to jesus christ to do the work and he may and oft doth make enemies executioners of his wrath upon one aner
the drying up this euphrates is the way of the kings of the east may be prepared

by kings of the east many understand the jews and near this time they shall return and be converted else how should they escape the wrath of the seventh vial and they shall come not only from the east but from all quarters isai

and

jer

zech

and then the import of it is that

the drying up of euphrates either of mystical babylon rome or the consuming of turkish people and power it is to this intent it is designed for this end to make way for that ancient people of god the jews to return to their own land and unto god
the kings of the east that the jews may be reduced god in ruining rome or wasting the turks prepareth a way for the jews
and as god dried up the of old to make a passage over for his people so what if the lord should dry up the very river euphrates to make a passage for the jews to come to their own land isai

and thus indeed it might be a judgment or wrath upon the turk letting in an enemy upon them for their destruction

but let it be considered whether these kings of the east or as it may be rendred from the rising of the sun may not be meant of those enemies dragon beast and false prophet seeing the very next thing mentioned is a preparation of them unto armageddon rev

and that out of all parts of the world from the rising of the sunÂ· which noteth the greatest distance as isai

and

mal

and then it importeth that the ruine of rome or wasting the euphratean people the turks will provoke all the enemies of christ to make a combination against him
the return and conversion of the jews the first setting up the kingdom of jesus christ will be such a grievance to enemies that they which were at variance before

shall reckon themselves so concerned that all shall joyn their forces against christ to their ruine rev

whether these three dragon beast and false prophet shall be gathered together in three parts or places or only in one place viz about jerusalem time will manifest

the seventh vial is poured into the air rev

air is universal and so noteth that this vial bringeth general wrath upon the dragon beast and false prophet all tast of the wrath of this vial
one adjunct is a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done the mystery of god is finished rev

the jews are converted or the new jerusalem throne is now set as rev

where we have the same throne and the same voice from it it is done now is the new heaven and new earth
not yet consummate and in the fulness of its latitude and glory but inchoate in the beginning
it
prepared as a bride adorned for her sband now is the preparation as rev

the effects are
voices and thunders and a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the face of the earth great commotions and alterations in the nations
and
the great city was divided into three parts

the is the whole jurisdiction of the ancient roman empire is divided and so overthrown think the three parts are

those before mentioned
possibly rendevouzed in three several places
some shall belong to the dragon be pagans or not professedly christian others to the beast horns others to the ecclesiastical men or belonging to the pope

and the calamities of divers are pointed out
the cities of the nations fell they of the nations who engage and lend assistance here against christ are overthrown or experience great desolations
and great babylon came into remembrance before some think that the destruction of rome is not till this seventh vial because of this expression
but there is babylon at rome and babylon in the nations
the former falleth by the sixth vial as proved the latter by the seventh vial after the gathering together to armageddon
with the greatest earthquake
by which the cities of the nations fall
which cannot be till the armageddon battel yet that there is a rejoycing for the desolation of the whore of babylon rev
which this opinion would leave no room for

therefore say there is a double remembrance of babylon one under the sixth the other under the seventh vial
the former bringeth wrath upon rome and causeth the nations to lament her burning and stand afar off for fear of her torment rev

the latter cause the nations to feel what before

they had feared they fall which before they did not
the former is a particular desolation at rome this more general rev

the former is a partial this a total or an utter destruction
the former brought but this under the seventh vial bringeth fierceness of wrath as at armageddon rev


and thus the distinguisheth rev
to the end
the fall of babylon at rome is the harvest the utter extirpation of babylon at the seventh vial is the vintage which will quickly follow the other as the vintage doth the harvest
the out of heaven rev

denotes the more immediate judgments of god on the enemies at that day
the conclusion of all then is that we are to wait by faith and patience for those great things which are yet unfulfilled for the great day of the lord is near
and the things that are still unaccomplished and yet to come an
and so to be expected are such as these that follow
the of the witnesses their resurrection and ascension rev
to

their death is signalized by various characters aforementioned especially by the darkness blackness and gloominess of the day with the loss of a after finishing their testimony
this is the comfort that it will be short and the issue glorious
their recovery is notified by a great earthquake

or commotion
we may know they are risen if after that there be a fall of a famous tenth part of the old roman jurisdiction and the ruine of a vast number of dignitaries officers men of eminency and renown by the earthquake and the repenting of a remnant so as to give glory to god


the wasting and diminishing of turkish power so as it ceaseth to be a wo to the idolatrous romanists rev

the second wo is is an immediate issue of the witnesses ascension not only in vision but in execution for the fifth or former was concluded in the same manner with respect to the event and also it is added expresly the third wo cometh quickly

not that the utter destruction of the turks or of his whole dominion every where will be at the ascension of the witnesses no that is not till afterwards at the seventh vial as shall evidence but they shall abundantly lose ground and suffer a consumption of a vast number of people by revolt or otherwise not only in europe in hungaria but in africa or in asia near the river euphrates where they were first loose and did the nations to the killing a third part of men rev

and this wasting or destroying their power and dominion about euphrates this drying up that deluge of inhabitants there isÂ· rev

that the way of the kings of the east may be prepared either as an occasion for enemies combining against christ or that a

passage may be open for the jews return to their own land isai

which they stood in the way of isai

they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines towards the west they shall spoil them of the east together those that have been enemies to the people of god as the philistines were shall march towards the west and spoil the turks of the east so as to make way for the jews repossessing of their own land
whether these philistines shall do it intentionally or accidentally god so by his providence as their spoiling of the turk shall give advantage to the jews return wonderfully removing all impediments and hindrances that were in the way of it this shall not here determine

all the twelve tribes shall return from all quarters
from assyria from moab and the children of ammon shall be subject to them
and when the turkish power shall be thus wasted either in pathros and egypt or about euphrates or both then shall expect the speedy rising or restitution of the jews


the downfall of mystical babylon at rome rev

rev

babylon the great is fallen is fallen so throughout the chapter
not only her superstition and idolatry her corrupt offices orders ways worship merchandize there will be destroyed as a mercy but the city it self of rome for her sins will irrecoverably fall under sudden and unavoidable divine wrath as a sore judgment utter desolation

shall be burnt with fire so as the people of god are to avoid her plagues
and even her friends shall be afraid of her torments is threatned with the ceasing of the voice of mirth of the bridegroom and of the sounding of the milstone and of the shining of light
which phrases generally note an utter desolation as jer

and

and

isai

and it is expresly declared rev

where we have the way and means of her ruine and destruction
the ten horns shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her with fire
some of the ten horns who abominate her idolatry shall make her desolate whether some in the eastern parts or in the west or both time must discover others adhere still in their spirits to and make lamentation for her rev

even those that committed fornication with her and are thus distinguished from those who make her desolate

now the symptoms and signs of romes approaching ruine are such as these the aggravated sins of babylon her plagues come rev

for her sins have reached unto heaven her hainous evils as new invented her ruine especially the hand she hath in slaying the witnesses rev

their death presage her ruine
as well as her own triumph rev
behold sit a singing a requiem to her self
also the lord's raising up

suddenly some famous instrument in the world to appear for his interest rev

so as the earth will be filled with his glory
also christ's appearing in his regal dignity in greater splendor purity brightness and glory than heretofore on a white cloud rev

with a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle and here is speedily a out of the temple out of his pure church applying it self to christ having not only an expectation of but an extraordinary spirit of prayer crying to him for the reaping the harvest of babylon and it was done accordingly
so that this is an immediate forerunner of her ruine


a triumphant song among the saints for the ruine of rome or babylon there rev

this seemeth to be about the latter end of the sixth or beginning of the vial near or in the time of preparation to armageddon rev

and it must ever be observed that the effects of one vial do oftentimes run into another vial or last and continue after another vial is begun to be poured out like the scales of fishes one partly covereth another

the restauration and return of the jews and israelites together with their conversion as well as others

ezek
under the emblem of dry bones living is signified the restitution of the jews and by two sticks one for ephraim the head of and often put for the ten tribes and another for judah or the two tribes

is represented the recovery of all the twelve tribes of israel and bringing them to their own land
and this was never yet accomplished for when it is saith the lord
will make them one nation upon the mountains of israel and one king shall be to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all
so that when this is made good all the twelve tribes the body of them are so as they shall never be separated any more and one king shall be over them david
and that is jesus christ for david was dead long before this prophesie
few here yet know where the ten tribes are and the two are still scattered so that this never was accomplished to this day and therefore it must hereafter be fulfilled because god is true
this then is certain that all the twelve tribes of israel shall have a possession of their own land again and be under conversion there some think they shall not be converted till after they are there isai

ezek

so rom

he saith the fulness of the gentiles shall come in and so all israel shall be saved
so that in after breaking off the jews for unbelief yet there is a time when all israel shall be saved
and this will be compleated at the beginning of the seventh trumpet rev


the way and means of israels return and conversion will be partly extraordinary by

impressions from the lord like wind breathing upon them which will be to them as life from the dead ezek

it will be a sudden unexpected thing a nation to be born in one day isai


their call will be partly by ordinary means the preaching of the gospel jer
by watchmen on mount ephraim isai

isai

thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles rom

the deliverer shall come out of sion by ministers out of gentile churches so he will turn away ungodliness from jacob
and the faith of the gentiles shall provoke the jews to jealousie and emulation
possibly at the rising of the witnesses rev

their first conversion will not be by the personal appearance of jesus christ for that is not till the seventh vial rev

behold come as a mat

when they shall welcom him mat

whereas they are converted before under the sixth vial
and prepared as a bride before the seventh rev
to end
as to the time some say before the salvation of israel the pope and turk shall be overthrown and destroyed
and indeed a partial fall of the turk will be by the sixth vial but their total destruction is not till the seventh
and the mistake that the fall of rome will be by the fifth vial have disproved
as to that great question

whether rome shall first be destroyed before the calling or conversion of the jews

would not absolutely determine but consider the first triumphant song for judgment upon babylon is with various hallelujahs rev
and rev

which is an hebrew word never before used in the apocalyps and so importeth that the hebrews are concerned and ingaged in the first praises for the fall of rome and therefore the hebrews seem to be converted before without which they could not rightly shew forth these praises isai
and this is in order of time after those things concerning its destruction
and the next thing is the lamb's wife which especially must be the jews maketh her self ready rev

yea the angel which filleth the earth with his glory near the downfall of babylon rev

seemeth to be the very same with that at the first restoration of israel ezek

and so why may not the jews have some hand also with others in the ruine of rome dan



zech

know the idolatry and abomination of rome have been agreat in the way of the conversion of the jews
but the special gospel manifestation and divine drawings rending the veil upon the heart will be enough to remove all these cor

joh

act



and that rev

is not to be understood absolutely as if none entred into the temple

or pure churchÂ·state till all the vials be poured out for all the seven come out of the temple and with pure and white linnen
and so there was then a pure temple that some yea many entred into but it must be understood comparatively few enter in comparison of what shall enter at the latter vials


a general combination of enemies against jesus christ and his interest to their own destruction after the fall of babylon some will survive to lament her burning rev

and being of the same spirit they were hence the witnesses after their rising rev

in such places may have trouble and sufferings from their hands and the watchword and warning to keep their garments intimate danger then of spiritual drowsiness mat
and of however enemies will be exasperated so as all will conspire against jesus christ and his members rev

dragon beast and false prophet but the issue is their destruction
was a partial destruction before but the total destruction is reserved to this seventh vial at armageddon
the tenth part fell before but the beast the fourth monarchy continued and the little horn till now
at the seventh vial and not before the beast is slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame dan


and then is seen one like the son of man in the

so john telleth us of the end of the beast and false prophet the first and second beast

they are then cast into the of the fierceness of the wrath of god rev

cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone

as to the the turk and all pagan powers those that are not professedly christian what become of them they are wasted by the sixth vial and their power destroyed by the seventh to an utter subjection rev

the dragon is cast into the bottomless pit and he bound a thousand years
a wonderful restraint is laid upon him that he may not hurt the church as heretofore
and vÂ·
after that he must be loosed for a little season and go to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog
and these being the dragon loosed at the end of the thousand years it plainly telleth us what is the gog and magog at the beginning of the thousand years ezek
and
even the same they are principally the turks and their associates at armageddon or the remains of the enemies of christ from all parts for the description agreeth to the turk and his confederates ezek

he is the chief prince of meshech and tubal tubal be the spaniards and italians yet meshech may be the moschici or cappadocians
and the turk hath a vast number of horsemen asÂ·
is a bitter enemy to israel
and hath a situation northward or in the north country as
and ezek

yea he hath syria under him which denominated the seleucians kings of the north dan



the attempt of this gog and magog the turk and his adherents will be speedily after the restoration or return of israel and dwelling safely in their own land ezek

ezek

when all the twelve tribes shall be newly gathered out of the nations after their long scattering

and it will be a very dreadful and terrible destruction by the fierceness of the wrath of god ezek

by a general or commotion by setting every mans sword among the men of gog against his brother by pestilence blood and immediate judgments fire and brimstone
so as they shall be a long time in burying the dead and burning the instruments of war ezek

and therefore it will be before the thousand years for it is not like there will be such a space after the end of them to the end of time rev

and this great destruction of gog or the turk will not be in hungaria though he may before have great losses there but especially in the land of canaan his great and last utter ruine and destruction shall be there ezek

thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel

this is further confirmed from dan

where the kings of egypt are called kings of the south and those of syria kings of the north till both were translated to the romans and then even in order of story it is said
and a king shall do according to his being but one king because both egypt and syria were under the romans till they

divided and split again that the saracens obtained egypt and became king of the south and the turks obtained assyria
and so became king of the north
all the description of the king of the north there agree to the turk as he in the latter days hath egypt under him and the precious things thereof
and so he is the king of the north

therefore the turks shall hear tidings out of the east and the northÂ· and shall go forth with fury to destroy and then he shall come to his end
the last signal thing of it is
and he shall plant his aphadno the tabernacle of his palace or tent for this war between the seas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him
none hath obtained especially from daniel that title of renown glorious holy mountain but or the land of promise dan


zcch

and that is between the seas
jerusalem is situate between the egyptian sea on the west and the or the on the east
also samaria hath the westward and the eastwardÂ· also the territory of assur and zabulonÂ· are between the sea of galilee on the eastÂ· and the phoenician syrian or on the west
when gog or the turk shall plant the tabernacle of his palace or his tent for war in judea or about jerusalem and shall go forth furiously to destroy upon the mountains of israel then he shall come to his end and none shall help him


a time of general and stupendious alterations in the world when all those enemies shall conspire against christ as rev

ezek
it cannot but be a time of trouble every where especially seeing it will be attended with such astonishing mutations mat

the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken
and this referreth to the same time for as the next thing
then shall appear the sign of the son of man in jesus christ himself explaineth this luk

there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity mens hearts failing for then they shall see the son of man coming in the for their relief and succour

these universal commotions will occasion a very great consternation and affrightment yet jesus christ giveth them as a comforting cordial to the faith of the saints like the budding of the which evidenceth that the summer is near

so these terrible things argue that the redemption of believers draweth nigh
generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled

this generation cannot be meant of that wherein this wasÂ· spoken by christ on earth for that and many generations are passed since and yet the things are unfulfilled but in

other evangelists especially luke it is applied to the parable of the that generation
when the shall begin to put forth by these distresses of nations and mens hearts failing for fear of those things which are coming on the earth this generation wherein these things begin shall not pass until all be fulfilled till the kingdom of god shall come
till they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud
all shall be accomplished in the very same age or generation wherein they have their beginning
those things will have a terrible aspect even to the saints yet they will issue in their redemption
and the blow will fall upon enemies in their great destruction ezek

and

rev

so that this will be the greatest trouble to the enemies of christ and his church

it seemeth that the greatest trouble to the jewish nation will be over before this for it is said mat

immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be then shall appear the signs of the son of

this foregoing trouble is applied to the jews
and is expresly declared to be their greatest tribulation
for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be
so then the eclipsing of all earthly glory by distress of nations about the time of armageddon is not before but immediately after that greatest tribulation to the jewish nation

is over and at an end
it began at vespatian about ann

that was their greatest in respect of the severity and sharpness of it the history is very tragical many hundred thousands of the jews perished and were made miserable by famine sword and captivity their houses and streets were filled with dead men women and children so that those alive could not bury the dead that it was unparallelled it passed any plague formerly sent by god joseph
lib

and lib

then might be fulfilled zech

and that is their greatest tribulation in respect of duration it hath lasted above years and the jews are not yet delivered

it is hard to conceive that any future trouble of theirs should exceed that which is past and especially seeing there are so many promises that after their return they should have no more such sorrow and captivity as before jer

ezek


zeph

zech

am

they shall no more be pulled out of their land and so they shall not again have their houses rifled and women ravished nor go again into captivity as zech

and if so then their greatest trouble mentioned dan


must be begun at vespatian and is almost expired the worst of it is over for there cannot be two greatest troubles to them and christ saith there shall never be like to them mat

it is usual for the prophets in a few lines to express that which is fulfilling many hundred years and so here in a verse or two may decipher the great and

long tribulations of the jews and also their deliverance and reach even to the last resurrection

in short those words and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation may come in by a parenthesis discovering what shall intervene between israel rejection and michael standing up for their deliverance even a long and sore tribulation
or else they must refer to this general commotion which will be unparallelled in respect of astonishment and affrightment but they will be more afraid than hurt for then at that time they shall be delivered

the setting up of the glorious kingdom of jesus christ the new jerusalem or the glory of the church here a thousand years rev and
and
the rise or first state of this kingdom will be speedily after the resurrection of the witnesses and the first conversion of the jews rev

and before the thousand years begin
this is the kingdom of the stone dan


whose beginning will be small and its way unpeaceable and troublesom conflicting with enemies yet prevailing against and breaking of themÂ·
so that this is not begun so long as the enemies of christ are the prevailing party every where

the second state of this kingdom will begin next after the battel at armageddon this will be more peaceable and glorious isai


mic

the church will enjoy great liberty for her grand enemy the dragon will be under a wonderful restraint will be bound a thousand years rev

it cannot note the state of the saints to come in heaven upon the judgment of the great day for after that satan will be loosed no more whereas after this
he shall be loosed for a little season to deceive the nations after which will speedily follow that last day of judgment
but of that day and hour knoweth no man mat


and it cannot be past for the dragon hath never been bound a thousand years hitherto
the first three hundred years of christ he he was loose ruling by pagan emperours rev


and since hath been loose sending forth not only papism but mahumetism out of the bottomless pit after an

rev
which continue to this day therefore he is not yet shut up in the bottomless pit and bound there as rev

and consequently the thousand years are not yet begun
and besides when the thousand years are expired satan is loosed again and his party is destroyed in an immediate way by fire from god out of heaven
and he is cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are
therefore the beast and false prophet must be destroyed before the thousand years begin else how could the dragon be cast into the lake where they were if they had not been there before and they are not there as yet and so that time is not yet begun
they

cannot be cast in during the thousand years for satan is bound all that time whereas he is loose till they be in the lake and immediately before the beast and false prophet were cast in the dragon was not bound there but assisted them at the battel at armageddon rev


and so that time of a thousand years is not yet begun

and this thousand years will be a glorious time not absolutely as if sinless but comparatively or compared with any former state of the church since the fall of adam so it will be a state of blessedness dan


possibly it may be ushered in by a personal appearance of christ in the clouds but cannot say that it will be by the personal presence and continuance or reigning of christ on earth
now will ezekiel city and temple be erected ezek to the end of that book the glory of which will be that the name of it from that day shall be jehovah shammah the lord is there ezek

this is the time of finishing the mystery of god in the seventh trumpet rev

and
here will begin the state of the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven rev
and is not by our going up to heaven
here will be such a new face of things as if there were a new heaven and a new earth
rev

and great changes for the better in the civil and ecclesiastical state great purity of administrations and ordinances and a glorious divine presence

then there shall be given to christ as danÂ·


dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him and his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed

an appendix
all aforegoing except in two lines had written long since but some of late have affirmed pagan rome to be the first and second beast and the subject of the seals trumpets and vials yea to be the whore of babylon which fallingÂ· they say the years began also they deny the conversion of the jews
if these things be true then much aforesaid were false so as this necessitateth a considering those matters


whether pagan rome was the first and second beast and the whore or mystical babylon rev
and rev a negatively it was not for


there is a of the roman empire which falleth at the rising of the first beast for the dragon giveth the first beast his power throne and great authority rev

and so the beast is the dragon's successor and doth not get up until the dragon be cast down from his imperial throne and dignity rev


hence it is impossible that pagan rome should be both beast and dragon neither was there any state before pagan rome to make the seeing it was pagan from the first


rome whilst dragon had a vastly different form and shape from what it had under the first beast in its it had only seven crowns and these not upon the horns but upon the heads rev

but at the rising of the first beast there were ten crowns and these upon the horns rev

for the goths vandals obtained a soveraignty setting up in the empire for themselves whereas in the days of john they had not received power as kings rev

all then though some were named kings mat

luk

act


being under the headship of and in subjection to emperours but were to be crowned about the same time when the roman empire turned beast were not so crowned under pagan rome therefore that was not the first beast

after crowning the horns one of the heads of the first beast was wounded as unto death and healed again rev

this cannot be proved of pagan rome and so that is not the first beast

the first beast had power to continue or make war months rev

if they were literal months pagan rome was idolatrous and persecuting the church much longer even hundreds of years
if they be taken for months of years then pagan rome did not continue half so long and so cannot be that first beast


it doth not appear that the ten horns after crowning did hate pagan rome and burn it with fire rev

and so that was not the first beast nor was it the whore of babylon for rev
speaketh not merely of the destruction of some corruptions as of paganism but of an utter desolation of a city it self compare it with jer

so that if it had been rome pagan it would not have left that as a city after paganism for the papacy to reign in

the reasons urged for pagan rome being the first beast and the whore of babylon are not cogent but easily answered for they are mostly built upon that common mistake viz
that else rome papal must be the first beast whereas have proved that first beast to be a civil persecuting state of rome distinct from and up long even hundreds of years before the second beast which is papal did arise in his first horn of ecclesiastical power about ann

and so most of the reasons are enervated or evaded at once
hence the pope is not the head or king
it is usual for to signifie not a particular person but a species of government or a race of many successively dan


and

and

and so rev

cannot intend particular persons for five pagan persecuting emperours were not fallen in the days of john and there were more to come than would make up the or for there were ten persecutions therefore it must be five species of government that then were fallen
if the short space


be not meant of the state of the first beast before the head of popes did arise but of it then it may intend the pope from the time of his becoming the head by obtaining civil supremacy emperours and then his continuance may be but a short space comparatively with the whole time of emperours

obj
it is idolatrous persecuting power that the text describeth and none persecuted but emperours
a
not only the emperours but the beast by crowned horns also persecuted however it is not said that all the sevenÂ· heads did persecute but that state did it which hath these
and often that is ascribed to many which is acted not by all but by some or a few of them as rev

compared with rev

obj
evince that the six pagan governments were heads of papal rome
a
in describing one roman monarchy which hath various dynasties no necessity that all which is affirmed of it should be verified under one of them daniel beast comprehendeth all its various states mentioned in the revelation under both dragon and beast state
so the six pagan governments were heads of the empire which now is papal but all the six not in being when papal
objÂ·
as to the seven sorts of government kings conls decemvirs evince that six were suprean
powers at rome before popes

consules vener at translato imperio livii lib

and others who speak of dictators and tribunes


kings cannot be denied to be supream as romulus
consuls were created in the room of kings regibus urbe propulsis creaverunt pro uno rege duo hac causa creati diacon lib


dictators the romans smitten with fearÂ· dictatorem creant cujus auctoritas potentia consulem praeiret

oros lib


tribunes were of two sorts tribuni militum were of consular authority
paul
diacon lib

emperours are known to have had supream authority

popes have emperours as hildebrand or pope gregory vii and others
obj
but the supream power was in the senate and that is made none of the six
a
it's said that romulus the king first constituted the senate at rome yet he was supream still centum senatores creavit quos patres auctoritate nuncupavit
messalae corvini lib eutropii historia cum diacono
the number was increased afterwards

it's true there were contests after between

the senate and emperours and the senate had a hand in making decrees but emperours had the supream power in the administration of the government of rome or in the executive part of the law for who will say that there were two supream powers at the same time there and those who make the objection by their asserting particular emperours to be the seven heads rev

and rev

they must unavoidably grant not the senate but emperours to be supream

obj
the pontifex maximus might as well be named as one of them
a
its denied for pontifex maximus was first instituted by numa pompilius a king who had supream power over him
see messal
corvin
libel

afterward it was sinfully annexed to him who had the supream power viz to the emperour as one of his titles
after julius caesar all emperours assumed that wicked title pontifex maximus even constantius the emperour gratian and he did forbid to be called by it
see dempster and rosin and zosimus

it's against rev

for if pontifex maximus was one of the seven which were the five fallen in the days of john how can the number seven be made up obj
shew that the beast that was and is not is meant that it is not now nor ever was but shall be and when the pope falleth shall not be
and
where the whore sitteth where she shall sit hereafter

a
it may be as difficult to answer if the pagan empire were the beast for that in the days of john yet it is said and is not


it is usual in a prophetical strain to mention things as past or present which are to come hundreds of years after because they shall certainly be future as rev

fallen whereas it was not fallen in the days of john no although the pagan empire were the babylon intended which it is not
thus dan


his dream was of what should come to pass afterward yet in vision it was as if present or past to
so dan

to
to the end and dan

such reasoning then does but darken truth with many words
and as to rev

the apostle interpreteth it the beast was before wounding is not what he was when wounded unto death yet is when healed
also the gowned and literate tribe of pagan rome could not be the second beast rev

for various characters thereof do not agree to them as
they did not exercise all the imperial power and authority of the first beast nor did they so much as pretend to work miracles
they do not make fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and so they are not the second beast
take this rule
a correspondency or agreeableness of some matters or events unto a prophesie will not prove its accomplishment if there he disagreeableness in other things

thus some observing great sufferings of churches at divers seasons about three years and half have concluded these for the times of the witnesses death rev

and yet have been mistaken as before evidenced
so others finding pagan rome to answer some characters in rev

as being great and a mother of harlots and abominations have groundlesly concluded that to be the woman or whore of babylon
whereas pagan rome was down as have proved before the beast was up which carrieth her
and before the ten horns were crowned
and so that cannot be the babylon here intended

but as to the whore of babylon rev
all the characters of her agree to rome papal and so we may conclude that to be it
rome undeniably is that great city which in the days of john reigned over the kings of the earth rev

though now it is not of the same magnitude as then yet it is the same city that now is the seat of the papacy
and her bad qualifications of spiritual fornication or idolatry and cruel persecution
do now notoriously and undoubtedly agree to rome papal and therefore rome papal is the whore of babylon and think antichristian
if the name antichrist be not in this book yet the thing is
it is not against it if her riding upon the beast was not until pope gregory vii or innocent iii or the council for there is no scripture evidence that the rising of the whore of babylon was as early as the first beast much less

her riding upon him that might not be until the rising of the second beast hundreds of years after especially seeing babylon is first mentioned in this book rev

with the image and mark of the second beast rev


but how unimaginable is it that almost the whole book of the revelation should be spent about pagan rome in the first three hundred years after christ's nativity and that all the great events should be passed over in a deep silence which have been for many hundreds of years since and this when they were so remarkable to the church and do so clearly and exactly answer the prophesie which yet certainly extendeth to the end of time even to the day of judgment rev
might add that as this prophesie of the casting down the dragon rev
tended greatly to the consolation of christian jews and gentiles in the times and here is a triumph on that account so jesus christ hath tenderly provided for the consolation of christians in the latter days for here is another a new triumph for victory over the beast and the destruction of babylon rev
this after two beast had been up and persecuted rev
and after some trumpets had sounded and vials were poured out upon enemies rev
and
the first of which vials
spake the beast up before
so that here is a double rejoycing one a long time after another and the latter upon the downfall of babylon

here must add that it is unscriptural to say as some do that the three days and half
should amount to as much as days or be the same with the months as if the three days and half were first to be turned into prophetical days years and then every day in those years to be turned into years again such doubling is wholly unwarrantable
we are not to teach the spirit to speak there is a mystery in the broken numbers so often repeated else the three integrums might have been more and so the days might have been or
and surely there is curiosity in adding half a day or year to three years of the witnesses lying dead rev

it intimateth that there will be some reviving in that half year or before a prophetical day is come about
if a long time would be required for the strange feats of the antichrist talked of by the romanists yet they who have so long persecuted why may they not at last slay the witnesses in such a short time the way being prepared before and why may they not in some street of the great city by a spirit of life from god suddenly be revived again

to conclude this in all the days of their the witnesses prophesie rev

and so are alive whereas during the three days and half they are in a deathstate
and therefore the three days and half are no part much less the whole of the days

have proved divers vials to be poured out

long before the rising of the witnesses and to the vision of the vials we must refer that vast change of affairs in the papacy by the late reformation
quickly after passing of the second wo the kingdoms of the world become the lords
rev

or then cometh the years rev
in which do not assert a l'ersonal reign of christ upon earth during that time but a more glorious state of the church than before and then cometh the day of judgment

quest

whether the years rev
must commence or begin from the fall of pagan rome at constance and expire at the ottoman empire
ann

a negatively the years cannot take date from the fall of pagan rome for
the beast and false prophet are cast into the burning lake at the beginning of the years rev

seeing the dragon at their expiration is cast into it where the beast and false prophet are therefore they were in before


the dragon is bound during the years that he doth not deceive the nations rev

whereas during the years from the fall of pagan rome about ann

the dragon was not bound but loose and did deceive the nations into the corruptions and abominations both of the papism even in the height of it witness hildebrand dictates and others and also of mahumetanism which overspread and deceived the nations in the times after an

and before an

yea not only

so but a whore in that time persecuted the church witness the sufferings of the albingenses and waldenses and bohemians




whether the restoration and conversion of the fews and ten tribes is still to be expected a affirmatively assert that the restoration and conversion of the jews and the body or great numbers of the ten tribes is still to be expected
if the prophesies and promises hereof had the beginning of their aomplishment in the primitive times if then there were the first fruits of them yet the principal the chiefest part the compleat fulfilling of them is yet to come for
all the tribes the dry bones must live the two sticks shall be one stick one nation and that in their own land under david their king jesus christ when they shall be no more two nations neither shall be divided into two kingdoms any more at all ezek

and they shall be converted
will put my spirit in you


this speaketh not of a union of believing jews and gentiles under jesus christ but plainly of the twelve tribes of israel for one stick is for judah and the children of israel his companions
and the other for joseph the stick of ephraim and for not only but the house of israel his companions this must comprise the ten tribes and these must all be united become one nation
in the land in the mountains of israel and one king shall be to them all
and this is jesus christ
david my servant shall be king over them and they all shall have one shepherd jesus

christ for david was dead long before and david often is put for christ ezek
with joh

isai

with act


hos


whereas they never yet were thus united under christ in their own land but are a divided scattered people to this day
therefore there is a time yet to come when they shall be thus united under jesus christ for god is trueÂ· and no tittle of his promise shall fail
the like is declared in many other prophecies

all israel shall be saved rom

and not only the elect the spiritual israel but plainly the jews that israel in distinction from the gentiles
and after blindness or hardness happened to the jews so as they were cast away and broken off for their unbelief
therefore the conversion of the jews of multitudinous number of that israel is to be expected
it will be such as will be greater riches to the world to the gentiles than their fall was
how much more their fulness there is then a time coming when there will be such a fulness of the jews as will usher in the conversion of a far vaster numbers than in the first ages of the gospel as the how much more doth evidence
obj
but there is no probability that all or most of the common people of the ten tribes were transplanted but only the rulers and rich and military men

a
think every individual person or family was not carried away yet it is apparently untrue that

only such a small number of them were transplanted
see king



and

there were such vast numbers removed to various distant places
as it is said
there was none left but the tribe of judah only see
they bear the name of israel
and such multitudes were brought from far to people the country and be placed in the room of them as are called

let it be granted that there must be a return answerable and the conversion of such a multitude as were transported and we need not desire more
obj
all the ten tribes were in the dominion of cyrus and had liberty to return
ans
dr lightfoot saith when cyrus gave leave to the jews after the years captivity to return to their own country multitudes of them found themselves so pleasingly seated and by continuance of time rooted in babylonia that they would not remove their habitation but fixed there
there in time they grew to so great a nation and distinct a people that they had a prince of the captivity of their own blood over them and three famous universities nehardea pombeditha and lot fell his epistle to the dispersed jews in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithinia harmon


they did not so return as to answer the prophesie ezek
for then they must now be in their own land
which they are not some of the ten tribes joined with judah
chron


when yet they were undoubtedly

two kingdoms
and they are as really two kingdoms still as they were of old against
yea in gospel times we read joh

of the dispersed among the gentiles
therefore there is yet a time coming wherein they shall return to their own land and be converted

obj
but the two nations or sticks became one under zorobabel as a type and mystically under christ and so ezek
was fulfilled
ans
that ezek
had any part or beginning of its accomplishment under zorobabel is an assertion wholly groundless and so a bare denial of it is sufficient till there be proof of it
by david often is meant christ and not a type of him so as the first accomplishment of it was in the days of the messiah long after zorobabel was dead
the twelve tribes or two nations were never united under zorobabel that can find there might be some of them as there was chron


when yet they were two kingdoms but the body of them returned not zorobabel was not their prince for ever as ezek

there will be a time when they shall be in their land and their children and their childrens children for ever

ezek
was not fulfilled in the first ages of the gospel or at the first coming of christ for as mr greenhill well observeth then the scepter should not have departed when shiloh came gen
if the messiah were king in israel king over both houses united into one the scepter did not depart but was advanced
this will appear further by their being still scattered as here followeth

obj
the epistle to the hebrews and that of peter and james are directed not to the two tribes only but to the twelve tribes that are scattered abroad

ans
this very objection evidenceth that even multitudes of the twelves tribes were still scattered in those gospel times when the greatest number of jews and israelites were converted that hitherto have become christians and they have had further scatterings since which sufficiently proveth that the prophecies aforesaid and many others of like nature were not then accomplished they were not then united in their own land therefore there is a time yet coming wherein he that scattered israel will gather him jer

ezek


those epistles concerned not the twelve tribes in those primitive times only or chiefly in that age and the time now past but those epistles to the hebrews and of peter and james are directed to all the tribes and will be of use to them in the times yet to come when they shall be converted
obj
many of the jews were converted in the primitive times act


and in constantine's time and so rom

was fulfilled

ans
the conversion of jews in those first ages of the gospel do not answer rom
for that was the time of their fall and blindness not of their fulness those myriades then are but few in comparison of the time when all israel shall be saved
also as then there were great destructions of the jews by titus and adrian so christ telleth us luk
that wrath should be upon them and they should be troden down of the gentiles how long

until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled and they are trodden down by the turks until this day all which evidence that their conversion and glory could not be in those primitive times but the time is coming when they shall say as mat

blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
but their conversion is such a mystery as it will be as life from the dead rom

hardly any first fruits or appearances of it before hand yet dry bones shall live and jerusalem appear in her glory

and now we see scripture grounds still to pray for the downfall of babylon and the coming of the glorious kingdom of christ and the restoration and conversion of the jews yea of all the tribes of israel and we do not take the name of god in vain nor deprave the christian faith but discharge an important duty therein

a postscript
the title of my book is the revelation unvailed because it tendeth to free it from the aforesaid misinterpretations which eclipse and darken this sacred prophecy

know many are discouraged for searching into these mysteries by observing the mistake of writers in the computation of times
whereas account that one of the smallest matters in it self only it may prove great by its ill influence upon a mans own spirit in the disappointment of his confidence and ones enemies who seeing others to time may promise themselves

immunity from threatned judgments and so may be hardened to their ruine and destruction know the expectations of some eminent men are raised high of a destruction of the beast or rome about four or five years hence supposing that then will be the expiration of the days whereas think those days expired some years since but that this was not the event to be expected upon their expiration
if those worthy men should suffer a frustration of expectation yet there is no cause for a prostration of their spirits or for enemies triumphing do modestly not confidently hope for some glorious events within in this age if not within few years but it is upon other grounds as


from the number of vials already poured out indeed the accomplishments of foregoing prophesies are indications of what events are next to follow and a sure guiding thread for our direction to discover where we are


the state and condition of the turks when the turks cease to be a woe to the roman idolaters to scourge whom they were raised up rev
to the end then the second woe passeth rev

and then the next revolution will be the jews will appear and
the kingdoms of the world will become the kingdoms of the lord and of his christ this must be either by a peace with the turk which may delay the work or else by losing much of his dominionÂ· and if rev

denote his time of prevailing a month in the revelation being days then if we begin their empire with oguzians ann

then his time allotted

to slay the third part of men expired ann

since which time he hath been losing ground and it is hopeful his further fall may be approaching leonicus chalcoconditos


especially the death of the witnesses by the darkness and dreadfulness of itÂ· together with their resurrection and the consequences thereof are the most sure prognosticks and most signal marks of the approaching glorious state rev

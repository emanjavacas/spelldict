of blood you sacred crowns and triumphs gain they would no more contend who best might claim priority but yield it to your name

to the king's most sacred majestie

dread sovereign

your majestie's most gracious acceptance of this poëm when it wanted all ornament both of the press and pencil hath emboldened me to this second address most humbly imploring that as your goodness was then both to it and me the onely refuge from the tyranny of the times you will now be pleased to protect us from the envy of this censuring age in the sanctuary of your name which will make this copy as immortal as its original and fix on it a character as indelible as the faith and obedience of

your majestie's most loyal subiect and humble servant tho ross

the epistle at brvges
to his sacred majestie

may it please your majestie

had not presumed to present this poem to your majestie's view had not believed the dignity of the subject might in some measure plead my apologie
know your majestie is familiar with the history in its plainer dress of prose but this authour being frequent in the hands of few but those whose business is books have adventured to make him english believing since to my strictest observation of historians he does not in the main deviate from the granted truth that his poetical fancies do not only ad lustre but a more then ordinary pleasure to the story for herein all the most eminent actions in that famous vvar which once disputed the empire of the universe are described with so vigorous and lively a flame that if my english hath not too much depressed it it may create in the readers an emulation of the renowned performers which have not presumed to

present to your majesty who are above them as examples for imitation but that by reflecting on them your majesty may see what unperishable monuments great persons may build to themselves in asserting their country and that as your sacred person is endowed with all those virtues that rendred the valiant hannibal famous or scipio a conquerour so by the blessing of heaven on your majestie's designs some happy pen may have matter to build you such another monument for future times and that your majestie's kingdoms being restored to their former glory by your hand posterity may date their happiness from your conquest and your name become an eternal terrour to rebellion

so prayes your maiestie's most humble and most obedient subject and servant tho ross

to the king
had fortune plac'd you on a peacefull throne had not rebellion made your virtues known as stormy nights and dark eclipses may set greater value on a fairer day posterity had onely understood that you like your great ancestours were good and iust that under you the church and state flourish'd and seem'd above their present fate
but then when hell and earth had must'red all their forces to procure your father's fall when trait'rous hands had seiz'd upon your crown when all our rights and laws were trampled down temples to stables turn'd our flamens fly or else for victims on their altars dy all holy things prophan'd that you alone as when the arrian heresie was grown too strong for truth and in one holy breast religion dwelt exil'd from all the rest have gainst these cruel storms a bulwark stood and like the great restorer when the flood

o'reran the vniverse an ark prepare

to which all such as good and loyal are for safety flie had ne're been known to fame and still this great addition to your name had been conceal'd and after your decease the good but easie titles of a peace had been your sole renown but now we see what you in peace what you in war can be with what an equal temper you can stand the shocks of fortune and your self command
so that by you the old instructed are to live the young the worst of fate to dare
hence all but such as are by charms of wealth or rebels that now fear your arms come from all quarters of the world in you their present happiness their future view
our church within your walls alone can keep her rites and recollect her scatter'd sheep
within your breast the archives of the law are safely lodg'd and thence we hope to draw those streams of iustice that as sacred nile swells and makes fruitful the aegyptian soil shall england happy make that now with war as rudely looks as if hot sirius star on it in stead of libya only shed its flames and men worse then her monsters bred
none then can justly of their fate complain that are exil'd unless you there did reign
you are our onely wealth and whether you auster or boreas frozen kingdoms view or should you to america repair or t'other indies bless whereer'e you are all that are good will follow you and all that place their home that place their countrey call

but oh me thinks see with squallid locks

poor england rear her head above the rocks and this great blessing beg that she may be eas'd of her chains and by your conquest free
go then great prince go may propitious gales still wait upon you and extend your sails those that from tyrannie their native land redeem in fame's large temple greater stand then those whose forein conquests trophies rear
such the camilli such the decii were whose names in story are more sacred far then theirs that happy in invasive war brought western gold and eastern spices home these did enrich but those preserved rome
such sacred prince be your return may we such your success and such your triumphs see as when the phoenix in his reviv'd in triumph from the spicie east returns and offers on the pharian coast due sacrifice to his paternal ghost while all the birds of night and those of prey into the deserts fly to give him way
but a more noble and obsequious train their king attend and aegypt wanting rain sees father nilus flow without excess or'e all the land and give a rich encrease without their labour
may you then repair the ruins of your throne and sitting there restore to vs again an age of gold while your blest father may from heav'n behold himself in you as great as you are good and all due expiations for his blood on rebels made
while all that now for fear or interest with them comply when there

they you behold shall then repenting come

and justly from your mouth attend their doom
when france shall tremble and the swede shall run fearing your arms yet further from the sun
and victory attending on your hand wheree're your ensigns flie shall take her stand resolv'd to fix with you and shall devest her self of wings to plume your radiant crest
and then those wounds those ills which we before so much lamented have we will adore

the life of caius silius italicus

caius silius italicus whether born in spain but of italian extraction or in italy but of spanish predecessors shall leave petrus crinitus gyraldus and others to dispute in his youth applying himself to the study of rhetorick was a close imitatour of cicero as the most perfect pattern of romane eloquence after whose example he pleaded many causes with such success and reputation that he was in a short time made a judg among the nor was that honour the sole reward of his virtues though he lived in the reign of the worst of emperours for he was thrice consul and his first consulship was signalized with that great felicity to the romane empire the death of nero
he was of asia and returned to rome from that province with great advantage both

of vvealth and honour
it is no mean argument of his wisdom and prudence that in the most troublesome changes of the empire he never fell under the displeasure of the prevailing party for as he was the last consul that nero made so he dyed the last of all that had been consuls under him
among the chief of the city neither covetous of power nor obnoxious to envy he was reverenced and esteemed by all and of such integrity in the opinion of vitellius that when he despaired of force to resist the power of vespasian he selected him with cluvius rufus and sabinus to treat his conditions with the conquerour
nor did his friendship with vitellius eclipse him with vespasian having ever entertained it with prudence and moderation so that he survived that noble emperour and was honoured with a third consulship by his son domitian
under whom finding the weight of business too heavy for his declining years he retired into campania and recreated himself with the muses and as his veneration of cicero had moved him to purchase a lordship called by that renowned oratour his academy in imitation of that of athens where he composed his books entituled his academiques
so his high esteem of virgil caused him to buy a farm once belonging to that prince of latine poets to whose tombe near naples as to a temple he frequently repaired and celebrated

his more religiously then his own
nor was he onely a devote to his memory but a noble emulatour of his muse after whose example he composed this immortal work supplying with his care and judgment the defects of nature
he was with many other famous wits as lucan statius persius junius aquinas and martial who is frequent in his praises and commits to his censure his own vvorks in this epigram among many other excellently englished by my worthy friend jo heath esquire

martial ad silium lib
epigr


sili castalidum decus silius who art the muses fame who the fierce perjur'd africk name and crafty hannibal rome foes mak'st yield to th greater scipio with thy commanding pow'rful stile thy severe looks lay'd by a while whilst loose december now abounds with cogging dice and boxes sounds and wanton lots fly round the board thou to my lines some time afford
but pray thy smooth not knitted brow to this my looser mirth allow
so soft catullus sparrow might appear in our great virgil sight

he was esteemed happy by those of his time through the whole course of his life unless in the loss of the youngest of his sons who dyed in his youth the other he left flourishing in vvealth and consular dignity
in this tranquillity and content he lived to the age of seventy five years when surprized by an incurable ulcer he voluntary set a period to his life by abstinence

silius italicus of the second punick vvar
the first book

the argument
at nine years old young hannibal doth swear at th altar to maintain the romane war his father leading into farthest spain the libyan armie is in battel slain him hasdrubal in chief command succeeds who hate contracting by his cruel deeds by a poor slave's revengefull hand doth fall then hannibal elected general breaks faith with rome and to sagunthus brings his arms whose famous siege the poet sings

sing those arms by which rome glory swell'd to heav'n and haughty carthage was compell'd to bear oenotrian laws
my muse relate hesperia toils how many men how great

rome bred of old for war
when

cadmus seed

perfidiously infring'd their sacred deed and strugling for command did war imbrace
while fortune long was doubtfull where to place

the empire of the world
the tyrian lords

thrice with successless

arms and impious swords

the senate peace and league which they had sworn to iove first broke
and while with fury born each nation mutual ruin did contrive they to whom fate the victory did give

were nearest to their fall
the phrygian powers

in triumph enter carthaginian

towers

rome palaces

sidonian troops surround

while onely in her walls she safety found
the cause of so great rage and hate with care

bequeathing to their nephews endless war

let me relate and their dark counsels scan the source of so great stirs which thus began

long since when dido fled her native land

polluted by her brother's impious hand by chance on libya fatal coast she falls and on her purchas'd land erects new walls with a in thongs divided round encompass'd and set out the measur'd ground
here iuno as the antient story goes neglecting argos and mycenae those belov'd and pleasant seats desir'd to build eternal mansions for her dear exil'd
but when she saw rome raise her lofty head so high and crossing seas her eagles spread through all the world mov'd by a jealous fear she the phoenicians fill'd with thoughts of war
but these at first repress'd and having lost

their high attempts on the

sicanian coast

again she arms prepares one captain may suffice her to embroil the earth and sea
and he was hannibal who now puts on all her dire fury him she dares alone

ev'n gainst the fates oppose
when joy'd to finde

a man so bloody casting in her minde the ills that she would bring on italy shall that dardanian fugitive said she his troy and twice captivate in spight of me to latium translate and for the trojans latine scepters found

ticinus rather may thy banks abound

with slaughter'd romanes and my

trebia flood

swell through the celtick plains with trojan blood

and troubled

thrasimenus backward fly

affrighted at the streams of purple dy

so may see hesperian

cannae crown'd

with bodies and in blood the vallies drown'd

and thee swift

aufidus incertain where

to leave a ford when as no banks appear lab'ring o're arms and scatter'd limbs thy way to break into the adriatick sea
this said the youth who nothing else desires but broils and war with martial thoughts she fires
faithless repleat with guil unjust was he and when once arm'd contemn'd the deity valiant but cruel hating peace and fir'd with a strange thirst of humane blood desir'd then in his pride of youth to wipe away

his father's

stains and i'th sicilian sea

to drown all leagues
iuno with hope of praise inflames his heart to which his soul obeys
now in his dreams he seems to break into the capitol and o're the alps to go oft in his troubled sleep rising by night with horrid cries his servants hee'd affright who found him bath'd in sweat his future war to wage and beat with rage the empty air

this fury against italy abus'd

while yet a

childe his father had infus'd

born of the noble barcean race deriv'd

from ancient belus
for when first depriv'd of her sichaeus dido fled from tyre the belian youth t'escape the tyrian ire join'd to her train resolved to embrace her fate and fortune from that noble race amilcar fam'd for valour claim'd descent and studious former hatred to foment soon as his son could speak and words exprest kindled the romane war within his breast
amidst the city circled by a grove of shady yew that did all light remove a temple stood built to eliza ghost and dreadfull held through all the tyrian coast
here as tis said the queen with her own hand her self from grief absolv'd sad statues stand of father belus and in order all his with agenor whom they call the glory of their line phoenix whose fame gave to that land an everlasting name

at length eliza

joined to her lord

for ever at her feet the phrygian sword next unto these twice fifty altars stand built to the gods that heav'n and hell command clad in a stygian vest with scatter'd locks

the priestess here

ennaea power invokes

and acheron when from the trembling ground sad murmures breaking through the temple sound and flames from the unkindled altars rise then rais'd by magick songs with horrid cries the wandring ghosts fly through the hollow air while dido in her marble sweats for fear

hither comes hannibal commanded by

amilcar who observ'd with curious eye his face and gesture
him no horrid rites

o'th place nor mad

massila fury frights

nor the dark pavement stain'd with blood nor flames arising at the sound of horrid names
stroaking his head his father kiss'd him chears his early courage and thus fills his ears
an unjust nation sprang from ruin'd troy with their harsh leagues do cadmus sons annoy if fates deny the honour should be mine to wipe off this disgrace may it be thine
think on a war may italy destroy and may the tyrrhene youth my warlike boy thy rising dread and teeming mothers fear their children to produce if thou appear
mov'd by this language he replies
by sea and land so soon as years will suffer me with fire and sword the romanes i'le pursue and what rhetaean fates decree undo
neither the gods nor leagues forbidding war tarpeian rocks nor alps shall me debarr
this my resolve by mars swear and by thy ghost great queen
this said to hecate falls a black victime the priestess enquires the trembling entrails as the soul expires
and when as custome was with art the mind o'th gods she had explor'd she thus divin'd
th aetolian plains see with armies fill'd

and lakes that with

idaean blood are swell'd

what mighty bodies climb unto the skie by rocks on whose high top thy camp shall lie now from the hills the furious army falls into the plains and now the trembling walls

in smoak are lost
see

sidonian flames

through all hesperia shine and bloody streams mix'd with eridanus
even he that bare

to iove the third

opimous spoils of war

lyes dead on heaps of arms and men his face retaining still its fierceness
but alass what tempests do with suddain storms arise while from the gaping heav'n swift lightning flies the gods great things intend see even iove engag'd in war and thunder from above
the silent entrails now no more reveal'd but iuno all the fates to come conceal'd
dangers and tedious labours are behind
so keeping in his breast the war design'd while to remotest gades he doth lead

his troops and at

alcides pillars spread

his getick ensigns slain in fight in pride of all his hopes the tyrian captain dy'd

him

hasdrubal succeeds whose reign begun

in that rich land where the declining sun stoops to the ocean whose th iberi and beticolae obey
of a dark soul implacable was he the fruit of whose command was cruelty his thirst of blood unquenchable appear'd esteeming it an honour to be fear'd this rage known torments could not satiate
and thus while he both gods and men forgate tagus of antient race and noble fame for beauty and for valiant acts his name deriv'd from golden tagus and bewail'd through all iberia on an oak impail'd he shews in triumph to's sad peoples eyes a king deprived of his obsequies

content with his own bounds he nor requir'd

maeonian streams nor lydian pools desir'd nor those rich vales where liquid gold doth flow and hermus with the sand doth yellow grow
he first the fight began and last withdrew and when with's fiery steed he broke into the ranks no sword no spear could him withstand but in both armies with his conqu·ring hand tagus in golden arms by all was known
whom when his servant saw impail'd upon the fatal oak deform'd snatching a sword from's side esteem'd by his lamented lord into the tyrant's tent he suddain prest

and

pierc'd with num'rous wounds his cruel brest

grief now and rage the tyrian camp divide and all their thoughts to sad revenge apply·de
some fire some burning brass some racks prepare and some with rods his bleeding body tear
all busie hands in various torments chuse their part some deadly poyson do infuse others the gaping wounds with flames do fill
and what was terrible to see or tell while with all art of cruelty each limb was stretcht that bones in liquid flesh did swim and marrow mix'd with blood in smoak did rise his courage still was firm and did despise and scorn their torments or as he had been a safe spectatour onely and had seen

not felt what they inflict the

slave disdains

his fainting executioners complains they're dull and stoutly for the cross doth call
midst these despised pains the general thus lost the trembling armie with one voice

and cry on

hannibal streight fix their choice

the image of his father's valour fame

of the war vow'd against the romane name his young and active courage noble heat his eloquence and mind arm'd with deceit procured this applause
and first of all the libyan troops salute him general next these the pyrenaean people than the warlike bands of the iberian
when streight a confidence of this command enflames his soul as if the sea and land where auster rules or where the lamp of day in cancer lodg'd tormenteth libya or asia did submit or he beheld a third part of the world obedience yield
his bounds were where fam'd nilus sees the day first rise and with seven streams invades the sea
but where they milder look to either bear

wash'd by th herculean the

plains appear

of fertile europe from the neighb'ring hills all the vast tract beyond the ocean fills

nor will huge

atlas suffer that his name

farther extend atlas whose neck the frame of heaven doth prop whose clouded head doth all the stars support which that withdrawn would fall
the winter of frost and snow dwells on his beard upon his lofty brow a grove of pines that cast eternal shade his temples by the winds are hollow made and rivers from his misty jaws descend in froth and both his sides with seas contend which when his panting steeds the weary sun doth drench in smoaking waves do seem to drown the chariot
but where parch'd africk fields appear the barren earth no harvest yields

but serpents with fell poison charg'd yet where

the soil is bless'd with a more temperate air nor pharian nor ennaean plains excell

here the

numidians insulting fill

one quarter of the camp no use they know of bridles but when horses swiftest go them with a wand between their ears apply'd as with the reins or curbs at pleasure guid
a warlike nation that in wars delight yet trusting more to fraud then open fight
the spanish troops another part contain'd aids by his valiant father's trophies gain'd from europe whose fierce horse with neighing fills the plains and swiftly climbs th encamped hills not mars through thracian fields more furious drives a nation fierce and prodigal of lives willing to hasten death for when their prime of years is by conqu'ring time scorning decay of strength or age to know bear in their hands their fate
here metals grow

of matter mixt

electrum pallid veins

produc'd and darker steel the earth conteins but god those springs of mischeif deeply hides yet astur covetous the earth divides and in her mangled entrails drown'd again returns with gold and bears the pretious stain
hence durius and rich tagus with thy streams

contend pactolus and that

flood that seems

to bring up lethe to the people and upon the gravii rolls the glistering sand
a land where ceres and lyaeus too do dwell and in plenty grow
these nations now reduc'd to the command of warlike hannibal and in his hand

the reins of rule streight with his father's

arts

he makes his party now with arms subverts decrees of senate now with bribes appears the first to walk on foot the first that bears a part if haste require a trench to make the first that all attempts would undertake remiss in nothing that to honour tends refuseth nature rest and watchfull spends the night in arms
now by his cassock known mix'd with the libyssaean foot lies down on th earth contending with the steel he wore in hardness sometimes he'd advance before his num'rous troops and with a valiant hand perform in person what he did command sometimes on his bare head he'd entertain the ruins of the heav'ns their storms and rain
the tyrians saw th asturians did admire to see when iove did dart his forked fire when thunder fell in storms and every blast of wind struck forth the flames how bold he past through all on's snorting steed nor would retire though clog'd with dust and scorch'd with sirius fire
and when the sultry air did frie with heat that parch'd the earth they seem'd effeminate who sought a shade while he to exercise his thirst where er'e he sees a fountain flies· his sole delight's to dress a furious horse for war and to be famous for the force of's killing arm to swim a stream unknown or'e ecchoing rocks assail the foe upon the adverse bank
the first that would ascend to scale a wall and when he did contend in open fight where er'e his sword did go it carried death and streams of blood did flow

being therefore now resolv'd to violate

the sacred league he urgeth on his fate
and where he can on rome allies doth fall and storms in farthest lands the capitol
his waving ensigns first for love

of greater wars against

sagunthus move

the walls first built by hercules not far from sea upon a rising hill appear
whose noble name zacynthus there by fate entomb'd upon the top did consecrate
he among others of alcides train

return'd to thebes the fam'd gerion

slain

three souls that monster did inform three pair of hands his head a triple neck did bear
earth ne'r beheld another could survive one death to whom the fates three lives did give
yet here the conqu'rour shew'd his spoils and as in heat of day the captive heards did pass unto the springs a serpent kick'd by chance big with enflaming poison did advance his tumid jaws and by a deadly wound lay'd the inachian dead on spanish ground
about that time an exil'd colonie born in an island of the grecian sea came from the south and by zacynthus there to ithaca dominions added were
the daunian youth wanting a dwelling then rich in their numbers led by valiant men sent from a city which we ardea term their weak beginnings to confirm these by agreement with the romane state having their liberties inviolate and honour of their ancestours forsook what they had long endur'd the tyrian yoak

against these therefore his incensed bands

breaking the league fierce hannibal commands disturbs their peace with arms
shaking his head himself on his panting steed surveys the walls and when he had beheld the trembling houses summons them to yield their gates and forts tells them that italie their and aids far distant be nor should his mercy meet them if subdu'de by arms that all the senate could conclude their laws and statutes nay their gods and faith were now within his power
and what he saith confirms by's javelin thrown against the walls which on caïcus vainly threat'ning falls and through his arms his body pierc'd
he slain and tumbling from the rampart brings again to the insulting conquerour his dart reeking in blood and trembling in his heart
the rest th example of the general with shouts pursue and streight obscure the wall with a dark cloud of darts
nor was their clear valour in number lost each man doth bear himself against the foremost as if he alone would undertake the enemie
here one the sling with frequent jerks doth ply which waved thrice about his head lets flie a weapon with the winds which in the air is lost to sight
huge stones another there flings from his sinewy arm this doth advance and from the slippery nouse expells a lance
but hannibal before all other rich in's father's arms now flings with flaming pitch a smoaking lamp then hurls his javelin now with stakes and stones doth press upon the foe

or poison'd arrows sends and doth applaud

insulting as they flie his quiver's fraud
such shafts the daci on the getique coast steep'd in the poison of their countrie boast

and by the banks of

ister shoot

but now it is decreed and they about the hill their horned bulwarks raise and round the city armed towers do abound
oh faith by antient times ador'd which now on earth we onely by thy name do know the valiant youth resolved stand and see all hope of flight cut off their walls to be begirt with arms yet think a noble death most worthy rome
and that sagunthus faith by them preserv'd she might more glorious fall then stand they now more resolutely all their strength collect
then from contracted strings

stones of vast bulk the phocaean

engine slings

or changing weight whole trees with iron bound ejects that breaking through the ranks confound
a shout both armies raise and furious come to blows as if they had besieged rome
among so many thousands that did stand circled in arms like corn on fertile land bold hannibal desirous to enspire into his armie's minds that furious fire was lodg'd in his own breast doth thus excite their rage and stimulates the following fight
do we stand still before a captiv'd foe asham'd we have begun asham'd to go on with this omen goodly valour shall these be the of the general must we fill italie with such a fame premise such fights as this go on for shame

this said with fury they invade the wall

on which they leave their hands and backwards fall
with that in haste a mount was rais'd above the town whereon the fighting squadrons move

but with an

engine that by many hands

was mov'd the brave besieg'd the thronging bands drive from the gates
it was a mighty oak strange to behold which for defence they took from th pyrenaean hills
this strongly lin'd with num'rous pikes of steel could hardly finde by walls resistance and about besmear'd with sulphur and with unctious pitch appear'd like an huge and from the walls of their high arcenal it swiftly falls cutting with trembling flames the yielding air so comets running with their bloody hair from heav'n to earth cast a prodigious light and with a furious force that did affright ev'n hannibal upon the armie flies tossing their smoaking members to the skies till fix'd to a vast tower the active flames

through the raw hides consume the mighty beams

and there in burning ruins both the men and arms involves
the carthaginians then grown wise by loss through secret mines convey their troops and so the city open lay
that labour of great hercules the wall to th earth with noise incredible doth fall and in its ruin stones immense doth roll that eccho from the alps unto the pole
so airy rocks torn from their native side by storms with horrour do an hill divide
the breach was soon with heaps of bodies slain obstructing their advance supply'd again

amidst those ruins both with equal rage

do meet before the rest in's prime of age murrus ennobled by a latine line himself a greek his mother sagunthine whose parents in a sacred league combin'd dulichian nephews to italian joyn'd
he as stout vaidus his companions calls aloud unto the fight upon him falls and wounds him where unarm'd he did appear between his cask and corslet with his spear stopping his bold attempts and as he lies prostrate upon the ground insulting cries th art down false carthaginian surely thou as conquerour didst fancy foremost now to climbe the capitol but what could move such bold desires go war with stygian iove
then as iberus fiercely did advance to succour him fix'd in his thigh his lance and spurning vaidus dying face quoth he this to the walls of rome your way must be fear'd and valiant hands you all must tread this path whither soe're your haste doth lead
and as iberus labour'd to renew the fight his target seis'd and pierc'd him through his naked side
iberus rich in land and flocks unknown to fame could well command his dart and bow against a flying beast happy in's private life had he possest those weapons still within his father's groves
to succour him with speed now ladmus moves on whom bold murrus grimly smiling thou said he shalt tell amilcar shade below that this after the vulgars fall shall give you for companion hannibal

then rising high with's sword on's helmet struck

which through the very brasen cover broke his cracking scull
then chremes who his hair unshorn like to a cap on's brow did wear with masulus and harcalo though old yet not unfit for war who with a bold and fearless hand a teeming lyoness would stroke then bragada whose shield's impress a river's urn hyempsal who the wrack of ships from dang'rous sands would boldly take as spoils from raging seas these sadly all slain by his fatal hand together fall and with them atyr skilfull to disarm serpents of poison whose sole touch could charm to sleep the banefull adder and apply the cerast all suspected broods to try
and thou hyarba garamantick born by oracular groves thy helmet like an horn bending about thy temples there wer't slain accusing iove and destinies in vain that often falsly thy return express'd
but now with bodies slain the heap encreas'd and with the streams of slaughter smoaks while murrus to the fight aloud provokes the general as when pursu'd by cries of spartan dogs a boar the forest flies and met by hunters on his back doth rear the ensigns of his rage and his last war attempts and as his foamy blood he eats groaning his tusks against their javelins beats
but in another quarter where despair had forc'd the youth to sally free from fear that any hand or dart could work his fall raging amidst the troops was hannibal

and shakes his sword that was not long before

with fire enchanted on th hesperian shore made by old temisus whose pow'rfull skill could temper with his charming tongue the steel
so in bistonian plains the god of war brandish'd his sword when in his iron car the titans he pursu'd or with the breath of's steeds and noise of's wheels extinguisheth the flames of war
hoscus and pholus now lygdus and dirius to the shades below by him were sent
to them galesus fair the twins chronus and gyas added were with daunus who all other did excell in pleading at the bar and by his skill though a most just observer of the laws still gain'd the hearers minds unto his cause
but furiously with rage transported now this language adds as he his darts doth throw whither proud carthaginian will the spite and fury of thy father thee incite here are no fabricks by a womans hand erected purchas'd with a price or land to exiles measur'd by an oxe's hide here the foundations of the gods abide and romane leagues
while thus he boasting speaks with a fierce charge the carthaginian breaks into the fighting ranks that him surround and seising on him captive having bound his hands upon his back· commands him strait in pains to meet his fate
then bids his ensigns to advance and through the heaps of slaughter'd men the way doth shew exciting all by name and gives away sure of success the city as their prey

but now inform'd by some that fled that heaven

to murrus in another part had given the day with victory enrag'd he flies like a fierce tiger and that enterprize forsakes while as he goes his helmet seems upon his head to cast forth killing beams
as when a comet with its fiery hair a kingdom frights and scatters through the air its bloody flames which as they issue forth with horrour threaten ruin to the earth
the ensigns arms and men unto his rage give way and as he furious doth engage both armies tremble while his spear ejects a light prodigious that round reflects like lightning on his shield
as when the waves swelling up to the stars while corus raves on the aegaean hang in the air filling th affrighted hearts with fear and roaring as they encrease

toss to and fro the trembling

cyclades

within their hollow bosoms
him not all the darts that do invade him from the wall nor flames cast at his face nor stones by art excuss'd from mighty engines could divert
soon as a shining crest he did behold and by the sun's reflection arms of gold besmear'd with blood look red enrag·d he saies
see murrus who our great attempts delaies and libya affairs i'le make thee know what thy iberus and vain leagues can do
keep still your laws faith justice but said he leave your deceived deities to me
murrus replies th art welcome
my desire to combate thee long since did burn like fire

in hope to have thy head receive what's due

for all thy fraud and under ground pursue thy way to italy to thee this hand shall a long journey give to th trojan land and alps and high pyrene crown'd with snow· this said perceiving his approaching foe from the high breach a firm and weighty stone with all his strength he takes and hurls it down as he advanc'd and in its speedy fall oppress'd him as if stricken with the wall
shame fires his thoughts nor still wont to prevail though check'd did then his conscious valour fail
gnashing his teeth he labours to ascend the wall through all the darts that it defend but when he nearer shin'd and stood upon the rampart all the tyrian troops came on and compass'd murrus round who all the host amaz'd and soon among his foes was lost
a thousand hands and swords together shine unnumber'd waving crests on casks decline
loud shouts and clamours from all quarters came
as if sagunthus all were in a flame
murrus his limbs with instant death possess'd drags after him and these last words express'd
alcides thou who first these walls didst whose sacred we inhabite here avert this storm which menaceth our land if defend not with a sluggish hand thy walls
and looking up as thus he pray'd to heav'n shall not our bold attempts he said more justly favour'd be great hercules unless our emulous valour thee displease
for not unlike thy self when mortal me thou shalt acknowledg
then propitious be

thou god that first didst

waste unhappy troy

me rather who the reliques will destroy of th phrygian race said hannibal assist
and as he spake with all his fury prest his sword through murrus
troubled at his fall the youth run in his arms and corps by all well known were to the conquerour deni'de for spoil the troops encrease on either side and stand all in an heap while stones rebound gainst helmets while spears gainst targets sound
some hard'ned stakes do throw some pond'rous lead by which the crest's divided on the head and glory of the plumes in slaughter fall
and now the rivulets of sweat o're all

the

libyan members flow on ev'ry scale

stand barbed arrows in his coat of mail
no rest no shelter left to shun a blow his knees decline and weary shoulders bow under his arms
then from his parched jaws his breath like vapour breaking forth he draws deep sighs and groans that check'd by panting throws a broken murmur through his helmet goes
his courage his adversity outvies perswading virtue then to exercise her strength when fortune frowns and so outweighs dangers by th glory of ensuing praise
a suddain noise among the clouds breaks forth from the divided heav'n and shakes the earth
iove over both the armies thund'red twice then in an horrid in the skies shak'd the revengfull lance of unjust war and couch'd upon his adverse thigh the spear
ye rocks tarpeian where powers divine reside and trojan flames that ever shine

on virgin altars what great things alass

to you by that fallacious meteor was promis'd by heav'n for had it nearer been oppos'd against their rage we ne'r had seen a passage through the alps nor allia should thrasimenus to thy streams give way
but iuno on pyrene top from far beholding his so early heat in war and fruitless onset pulls his falling spear from the hard bones where it did first appear
he hiding with his shield the blood that swims diffus'd in streams upon his wounded limbs fainting with slow and doubtfull steps retires
the night at length arrives to their desires and both the earth and sea in darkness hides and putting day to flight the fight decides
but their resolved minds still watch with care and lab'ring in the night the breach repair
extremities of danger do incense their thoughts and courage which takes violence from their despair
hence men oppress'd with age women and tender children all engage to help and in that dubious state of things with his yet bleeding wounds the souldier brings stones to the work the senatours their share partake and nobles in the publick care
they meet and chosen men exhort with pray'rs to succour their deplorable affairs and from sagunthus walls to drive away the tyrian flames
now go with speed say they

and

while the wounded tyger is restrain'd

and shut within his den their ships ascend
a speedy diligence is best in war the way to honour is where dangers are

haste ye these antient walls that can no more

defend us and our faith at rome deplore
come home with better fates in brief return before in funeral flames sagunthus burn
with this sad charge to the next shore they hie and or'e the seas with swelling canvase flie
now tithon rosie wife had sleep exil'd and with her horses early neighing fill'd the misty hills and shook her reins with dew surcharg'd when from the walls the youth did shew their tow'rs that there by night had bin erected and the city compass'd in
all action's lay'd aside the souldier's sad the siege declines that heat stands still that had so active been and in that danger all their cares are turn'd upon the general

the

rutuli by this the seas had crost

beginning now to see th herculean coast and rocks that to the skies

from the

monoecian hills aspiring rise

here thracian boreas his imperial seat maintains and always cold sometimes doth beat upon the shore sometimes with roaring wings cleaves ev'n the alps and when himself he flings over the earth from the bear no other winds against him dare appear
with whirling blasts the ocean is broke into divided waves that rise in smoak and hide the hills from sight then as he flies heaves rhene and rhodanus unto the skies
when this dire fury of fierce boreas they had scap'd th alternate dangers of the sea and their sad war and dubious success of things with frequent sighs they thus express

dear countrey faith's renowned temple where

are now thy fates do yet thy tow'rs appear sacred on hills or of so great a name do ashes the sad reliques of a flame onely remain ye gods oh fill our sails with gentle winds and give us prosp'rous gales if that our temples roofs the fire invade not yet or latian ships can lend us aid
in such complaints they day and night deplore their state untill on the italian shore the ship arriv'd where father tyber made more rich by anyo waters doth invade with yellow waves the sea
from thence they come unto the walls of their rome
the consul calls a solemn council where

fathers of unstain'd

poverty appear

whose worthy names do from their triumphs rise
a senate that in virtue equalize the gods such men as valiant acts to fame commend whom just desires of right enflame their beards and hair neglected on their brow their hands familiar with the crooked plow content with little hearts whom no desire of wealth torments who often did retire to their small lares in triumphal cars
but at the the spoils of wars their captiv'd chariots and weapons stain'd with blood opimous spoils which they had gain'd from generals with axes terrible in fight then bars of gates whose cities fell under their fury targets pierced through by darts and swords hang up and here they view aegathes war ships scatter'd on the sea whose stems there hanging testimonials be

of libya vanquish'd fleet the helmets here

of curled senones are fix'd and there

the sword the judg of their

redeeming gold

with these the honour'd trophies of the bold

camillus and his arms in triumph borne

the gauls now all repuls'd at his return

here were the spoils of great

aeacides

and epirotick ensigns among these dreadfull ligurian crests with the rude shield

of spain and alpine

gesa they beheld

but when the ruins they had born and fear'd as written in their squallid looks appear'd so that sagunthus image seem'd to stand before their eyes and their last aid demand grave sycoris with tears began and saith
ye romanes famous for your sacred faith whom justly all the nations that give place unto your arms acknowledg mars his race think not that we have measur'd o're the sea for dangers light
our walls and countrey we besieg'd and falling saw and there whom wilde beasts or the raging seas brought forth beheld fierce hannibal
far from these walls oh far keep him ye gods pray and to our war confine his dreadfull hand
what mighty beams he hurls how strong how great in arms he seems over pyrene hills he makes his way

and scorning that

iberus flood should stay

his speed he listeth calpe in his bands

with those that dive in

nasamonian sands

and seeketh greater walls that if the sea whose rage we lately felt shall cease to be his bar into your cities he will break
think you this desp'rate youth would undertake

the charge of so great broils and violate

with arms your league or thus precipitate by vows into a war onely to give sagunthus laws or us of life deprive oh haste suppress the rising flame for fear the danger prove too strong for tardy care
or though you have no terrours of your own nor yet the seeds of war which he hath sown appear can your sagunthus be deny'd

an helping hand so near in

blood ally'd

all the iberi galli all that are still thirsting under libya fiery star under his ensigns march
we pray you by th ador'd beginnings of the rutuli laurentine and by these dear pledges of mother troy with speed prepare to aid our pietie who are compell'd

for poor

acrisionean walls to yield

tyrinthian tow'rs
you nobly did contend

gainst a sicilian tyran and defend campanian walls and once to have expel'd the samnites strength was a great honour held worthy sigaean ancestours
call to witness you eternal fountains all that from time's birth live in apulia and close numician pools when ardea too happy then first sent her youth abroad with turnus altars for a new abode that they beyond pyrene hills with care all the laurentine deities did bear
why then as members from the body torn or else cut off should we expect your scorn or why should we descended of your blood be now opprest because have firmly stood

unto your leagues thus having ended all

their sad complaints a wofull sight they fall spreading their squallid bodies on the ground
the senate strait consult and as they round their votes do pass bold lentulus who seems ev'n then to see sagunthus fall in flames adviseth that they instantly demand the youth be punish'd and to waste the land of carthage with a suddain war if they

refuse
but

fabius who did wisely weigh

future events in dubious affairs not too elate who would not stir up wars on light occasions and well was skill'd to manage them yet not engage a field gravely advis'd in matters of that weight
not to be rash but try if't were the hate and fury of the general had mov'd those arms or if the senate them that some be sent who truly might relate the state of things
this as fate and providently pond'ring in his breast the rising broils wise fabius exprest
as when at stern a skilfull pilot finds· by signs some future danger in the winds contracts unto the reeling yard the sails
but tears and grief with anger mix'd prevails with all to hasten on the hidden fates and from the senate chosen delegates are to the gen'ral sent and if he stand deaf to the league in arms have in command to turn to carthage city and declare gainst them who had forgot the gods a war

wise fabius who descended of tirynthian race could shew

three hundred ancestours that in one day

the cruel storms of war had cast away when fortune that unequally withstood

their labours stained with

patritian blood

the banks of cremera
an equal share

with him in cares

publicola did bear

who did from spartan volesus descend and as his name imports the people's friend the romane fasces as his bore
when hannibal first heard that these before the port arriv'd bringing decrees of state that now amidst the flames of war too late forsaken peace demanded and withall the punishment of him the general included in the league
he strait commands his threatning ensigns and his armed bands to shew along the shore their targets stain'd with blood and swords that late in slaughter reign'd and cries there's now no place for words you hear the tyrrhen trumpets sounding ev'ry where and groans of dying men
while yet they may twere best they would return unto the sea unless they long to be besieg'd
all know what armed men in heat of blood may do how lawless anger is and what drawn swords will dare to act
by these his threatning words repuls'd from the inhospitable shore they haste to carthage with the lab'ring oar while he to animate the army rails and thus pursues the vessel as it sails prepares that ship to carry o're the sea my head alass blind souls and hearts that be proud with successes doth your impious land arm'd hannibal to punishment demand i'le come ne're ask it you enough of me shall have e're you expect and that proud she which now doth forein gods defend ev'n rome shall fear for her own gods and gates at home

although you climb tarpeian rocks again

or in your

capitol immur'd remain

no gold your captiv'd lives shall
their minds incensed by his words and rage join'd to their arms soon clouds of arrows round the skies obscure and ecchoing tow'rs resound with storms of stones all prosecute the fight while yet the flying ship remains in sight and views the walls
but still the general his wounds discov'ring on his troops doth call

for promis'd

piacles and fills the air

with new complaints
we we companions dear demanded are
see fabius from the poop shews in contempt our chains and we must stoop to the proud senate wrath
if you repent of what's begun or our just arms intent be worthy blame the romane ship from sea recall care not come deliver me enchain'd unto the wrack for why should born of eöan belus race deny to be their slave although so many hands of valiant libyan or iberian bands circle me in no let the romane state for ever rule and ensigns propagate to ev'ry age and nation let us dread their words and frowns
this said deep sighs are spread through all the camp and all convert hate against aeneas race and stimulate with shouts their rage
among the num'rous throngs of libyans and diff'rent tongues fierce in the war against the romane name hasbyte with marmarick ensigns came sprang from hyarba garamantick
he of ammon born medusa caves that be

in phorcas isles cyniphian mace and

battiades did once command with nasamon and barce and autololian woods and shores that ly near treach'rous syrts getulians that ride swift without bridles
his first beauteous bride the nymph tritonis was from whence the queen her stock did boast that iove himself had been her and in groves fate the names of her great ancestours relate
she still accustom'd to a in hunting and in woods her life had led the basket or the distaff to her hands unknown she hunting and thy diana lov'd and with her heel impell the running steed or flying beast to kill as when disdaining getes and cicones or rhoesus family or bistones with arms a troop of amazons through the pangaean lofty forest runs o're rhodope or hebrus plains
she by her countrey's habit known restrains with fillets of fine gold her flowing hair
her to the fight exposed bare her left a thermodoantiack shield bright as the sun defends
thus through the field shaking the smoaking she runs with rapid speed while her companions some in light chariots by two horses drawn on some that venus rites had known with a more num'rous their queen attend
but she still in the van is seen proud to expose to view her fiery steeds chosen among the best her countrey breeds

and as about the trampled field she scowrs

flings wounding darts into the highest tow'rs
but mopsus not enduring to behold her at the walls so frequent and so bold through the moist air gortynian arrows sends which by the winged steel where he intends give deadly wounds
he born in crete was wont bred mong the sibyls sacred caves to hunt in the dictaean woods and when a childe birds mounting to the skies had often kill'd and stop'd by suddain wounds the running dear that scap'd the toils and while he yet might hear the singing bow perceiv'd the beast to fall
nor could that age any more justly call a skilfull archer had gortyna sought the conquest and eoan arrows brought
but when his former sports the sad decay of wealth deni'd constrain'd to put to sea with meroe his wife and sons by fate into sagunthus led in low estate a guest he there remain'd
his hopefull pair of sons full quivers at their backs did bear with light cretan shafts which he standing amidst the valiant youth lets flee gainst the massilian troops by which bold tyre with gravius glisco baga did expire and lixus who deserv'd not to have bin the object of so certain aim whose chin the tender down of youth not yet indu'd
but with his arrows while he thus pursu'd the fight he aims against a valiant maid forsaken iove invoking to his aid unluckily
for sarpe born upon the hollow banks of sandy nasamon

no sooner saw him turn the fatal bow

but she receiv'd within her bosom though far distant the swift arrow and her fate which with a gaping wound did penetrate so far that at her back her sisters all first saw the point appear
before her fall incens'd another of the endeav'ring to support but all in vain her dying limbs and watring with her tears her eyes whose light almost extinct appears with all the strength that grief and fury lent towards the walls a deadly arrow sent which through the shoulder of stout dorilas as swift as thought with rapid force did pass
the bow was drawn so far the horned ends did seem to touch and as the nerve extends the space between the bow the shaft supplies and when released by her fingers flies before the active winds then from the walls headlong the miserable wounded falls and turning his quiver round his dying body scatters on the ground the shining shafts
then icarus who stood near him alike in arms his brother's blood prepares to vindicate and as in haste his hand unto the quiver past to draw an arrow by a weighty stone that from the hand of hannibal was thrown he fell to earth a deadly coldness all his stiffned limbs possest and in his fall from's fainting hand into its place again the arrow sinks
his sons thus slain when father mopsus saw thrice to pursue their wish'd revenge in a sad rage he drew

his cretan bow but thrice his fail'd

and grief above his former skill prevail'd
then by their death of all his joys bereft too late alass he griev'd that he had left his native soil and snatching up the stone that against thee poor icarus was thrown beating his breast in vain when no relief his feeble hands could give to ease his grief by speedy death himself he sends from an high tow'r and on his son extends his dying limbs
while thus unfortunate in forein wars this stranger met his fate teron who kept alcides temple and with incense at his altars us'd to stand to new designs the army stimulates and in a sudden sally from the gates invades the tyrian camp
he neither spear in's hand nor helmet on his head did bear but trusting to his strength of youth his broad

and lofty shoulders like th

oetaean god

with an huge club destroys the trembling files upon his head a lyon's threatning spoils with gaping jaws he wore
an hundred snakes carv'd on his shield display'd their marble backs mong which a monstrous double hydra spreads in several serpents her divided heads
thus arm'd he iuba and micipsa fam'd for valiant deeds and from his nam'd with aged tapsus and saces and moor driv'n from the walls and flying to the shore fiercely pursues and by one valiant hand the streams of blood the neighb'ring ocean stain'd
for hot with slaughter and not satisfy'd that idus rothus and iugurtha dy'd

or that marmarick cotho he had kill'd

hasbyte chariot and her shield shining with gold he covets and invade with all his force and rage the warlike maid
him with his bloody weapon when she spy'd come rushing on she turns her steeds aside and in fallacious circles wheeling round the champain field divides the yielding ground and as if wing'd with speed she makes her way with her light chariot through the winding sea
thus while she flies his sight swift as the wind the horses raise a cloud of dust behind and with the ratling wheels in pieces tear an adverse troop
she to augment their fear from her sure hand did frequent darts expell by which thamyris and lycus fell

with stout

eurydamas whose noble name

derived was from him who known to fame fondly to high embraces once aspir'd and mad with love penelope desir'd but by her chaste and modest arts deceiv'd and the fallacious web so oft unweav'd gave out vlysses in the sea was drown'd
but what he fain'd of him he after found real in his own fate and he expires by ithacus dire hand his nuptial fires turn'd into fun'ral flames and here of all his race the last eurydamas doth fall slain by a libyan hand whose chariot makes her way and all his bones in pieces breaks
but now perceiving teron after all his labours hard beset to work his fall into the fight again the furious maid returns with speed and as about invade

her fo she waves her ax before her brows

herculean spoils to thee diana vows
but teron no less big with hopes of praise himself against her bounding steeds doth raise casting before their eyes the lyon's skin and threatning jaws affrighted they begin to yield to fear and turning swiftly round cast with its load the chariot to the ground
then on hasbyte who endeavours now to quit the fight he leaps and on her brow strikes his herculean club by which her brains dash'd through her broken skul upon the reins and fervent wheels dispersed ly while he hasting that such a trophy all might see with her own ax cuts off the virgins head
nor was his anger there determined but fixed on a spear he strait commands to bear't in view of all the punick bands and drive the chariot to the
these slaughters teron ignorant of fates and that the favour of the gods declin'd commits while his own death's not far behinde
for now fierce hannibal whose face the throne of rage and death appear'd came furious on incens'd and griev'd to see hasbyte dead and the trophie of her head in triumph borne
but when the troops beheld the bright reflections of his brasen shield and as he mov'd though distant far did hear the fatal clashing of his arms with fear possess'd they trembling fled unto the walls
as when to their known beds the ev'ning calls the winged people from the search of food or when on the cecropian hills a cloud

the bees on tender flowers

disperst affrighteth with approaching showers like one congested heap unto their hive and fragrant cells they haste and murm'ring strive one climbing on anothers back to gain their entrance at the port and shun the rain
thus fear the sagunthines precipitates while few discern their way unto the gates
oh flatt'ring light of heav'n is death to be shun'd with so great a fear which none can flee since joined to their birth they cry for aid repenting that they had this sally made from their safe walls and works while still in vain teron their flight endeavours to restrain
sometime dire menaces sometimes his hand he does imploy and cries why flee ye stand he is my enemy to me the crown of this great fight belongs and from our town and walls the tyrians by this hand alone will repell
stand therefore and look on or if this pannick terrour drive you all to seek th inglorious shelter of a wall a shame the greatest that the adverse fates can add against me onely shut the gates
but hannibal while yet a sad despair of safety seis'd their hearts and horrid fear did reign in ev'ry breast a while suspends the slaughter of his enemies and bends his course unto the batter'd walls which he resolves with all his force shall stormed be
th herculean priest perceiving his intent labours with speed this mischief to prevent
at which fierce hannibal more furious grown cries out receive fond porter of the town

that punishment of fate that shortly shall

sagunthus self involve and by thy fall open the gates
his rage could not afford more words but as he waves his fatal sword the daunian youth flings his contorted oak with all his force against his breast the stroak clashing against his arms with horrour sounds and from the hollow brass the club rebounds
then having lost his weapon and his strength employ'd in vain unto the walls at length he turns and with the rest forsakes the fight
th insulting conquerour upbraids his flight and follows at his back
then with sad cries the weeping matrons lifting to the skies their trembling hands from the high walls proclaim their griefs and fears some calling him by name tell him they fain would send unto his aid and let him in but that they are afraid with him they should receive the conqu'ring fo
but now alass he can no farther go for hannibal oppress'd him with his shield and as the city from the walls beheld cry's go and let hasbyte comfort take in thy approaching death
and as he spake into his panting throat which now abhor'd a longer life thrusts his revenging sword
then from the very walls in triumph leads through all the camp his spoils and captiv'd steeds which at the thronged gate excluded stand by multitudes that fled his fatal hand
and now the raging troops of nomades haste to perform their queens sad exequies adding all funeral rites and bearing thrice the corps of teron as a sacrifice

to hallow her dead ashes round the pile

cast into th flames his club and lyon's spoil and sing'd his face now of all form bereft and to th iberian fowls his carkass left
while thus affairs before sagunthus stand they who at carthage were in chief command consult upon the war and what shall be return'd to rome imperious embassie
whose oratours with fear their hearts had fill'd while some to their demands perswade to yield urging their faith and league that long before they and their fathers at the altars swore the gods to witness call'd
others the love of the ambitious youth's attempts doth move to hope for better things if they pursu'd

the war
but

hanno whom a native feud

against the general had long enflam'd their doubts and rash applause thus stoutly blam'd
might for fear grave fathers now refrain for him with threats some labour'd to restrain to speak but will not desist although saw my death approaching by my fo call the gods to witness and to heaven leave those sacred vows that we have given which to perform our countrey's safety calls
although sagunthus be besieg'd her walls sinking in flames not yet too late my fears this caution give which oft with anxious cares have broke my rest that this pernicious head might not in arms and war be nurtured and while live my sense shall thus abide
his innate poison and paternal pride know
and as those pilots who the skies and stars do contemplate what storms will rise

what future winds will cause the seas to rage

to the affrighted mariners presage
aspiring to a throne he doth invade the reins of rule
all leagues all laws are made the objects of his arms with which he falls on cities and from far against our walls by this last act aeneas warlike race he hath incens'd and we have lost our peace
his father's ghost and fury him excites and memory of those nefandous rites he once did celebrate and what of old vainly to him massila priest foretold and thus the gods for his infringed faith on his perfidious head convert their wrath
with hopes of a new kingdom blind he arms gainst forein lands and now sagunthus storms
but let him not commix this citie's fate with his own fortune let him expiate with his own punishment his proper crime for now dear carthage at this very time he thee besiegeth and assaults thy walls

we

stain'd with gen'rous blood th aenean vales

and scarce with hir'd laconians could maintain the war our navies broken on the main have fill'd up scylla caves and we have seen when from charybdis bottom decks have been spew'd up again
vain wretch whose soul no fire of piety doth warm do but retire thy thoughts a while upon aegathes war and limbs of libya dispersed far
whither dost run why thirsting after fame thus in thy countrey's fall dost seek a name the alps may give thee way and apennine equal to them his snowy head decline

yet though thou gain'st some ground think'st thou to finde

in those great nations a mortal mind that they to fire and sword will yield alass

you fight not now with a

neritian race

their souldiers in the camp are bred and born

and e're the down appear their cheeks are worn with brasen helmets ease and rest's unknown to who pale and bloodless grown in the continued service of the state in fronts of battails do provoke their fate
my self have romanes seen who pierced through their bodies from their wounds their weapons drew and turn'd them on the fo their valour have seen and thirst of honour when they dy
if therefore carthage thou decline this war nor give thy self up to the conquerour how much of mischief may prevented be and how much blood shall hanno save for thee thus he but gestar whose full breast the while with anger and impatience did boyl who twice to interrupt him had essay'd replies
is then a romane souldier made one of the libyan councils and must he a member of the tyrian senate be tis true he is not arm'd but well know in all things else he is a perfect fo us with the snowy alps and horrid height of lofty apennine he would affright with raging seas and waves of scylla coast nor wants it much but he a romane ghost still dreads their wounds and deaths he so doth praise and to the stars an humane race doth raise
trust me though some cold hearts with fear may be possess'd we have a mortal enemy

ev'n beheld their

regulus the hope

of the hectorean race their strongest prop his hands enchain'd behind with publick joy into a dungeon drag'd ne'r seen by day saw when crucified from the high oak he hanging on hesperia did look
nor doth the face of boys that helmets wear a cause of terrour unto me appear or that their cheeks with early casks are worn we are not of a race so sluggish born
how many libyan troops their years in deeds of arms and war on naked steeds
the general so soon as he could speak at th altar vow'd this war to undertake to waste with flames the phrygian people and his father's arms resolv'd to take in hand
ev'n in thy sight vile hanno he shall be revenger of the romane crueltie
then let the alps encrease and let them joyn to heav'n their shining heads with apennine
yet dare say though vainest fears do finde their influence upon a guilty mind ev'n through those rocks and snows nay through the stars his way he'l make and scorn to think them bars which hercules or'ecame or to despair of second honour
but the former war its devastations and the miseries of libya hanno vainly amplifies nor would that we should undertake and try again these labours for our liberty
but let him lay those throws of fear aside and with the women safe at home abide and save his sighing soul we fathers we it is decree'd will meet the enemy

and from thy walls dear carthage far remove

the tyran romanes in despight of iove
but if the fates resist and mars give way that tyrian byrsa be condemn'd this day i'le rather choose to die then give up thee dear country to eternal slavery and go with freedom to the shades below for as to that good gods which fabius now demands that we lay down our arms and qui sagunthus when our troops have conquer'd it
then burn your targets let your navy be consum'd in flames and wholly quit the sea
but if our carthage hath not merited to feel such things as these ye gods forbid this wickedness oh let our generals hands be free and not bound up in peacefull bands
this said he silent sate as custom was the senate streight proceed their votes to pass while hanno urgeth to restore the spoils of war and add's the authour of those broils
with that the fathers leaping from their seats amazd as if the fo were at the gates th temple pray the gods that it may be a fatal omen unto italy
fabius perceiving that their thoughts were far from peace and treacherously enclin'd to war no longer able to conceal his ire with speed another council doth require and to th assembled fathers doth declare that in his bosom he brought peace or war demands their choice that him they would no more detain with dubious answers as before
but when no choice of either they exprest as if he'd powr'd whole armies from his breast

take then a war said he with that let's fall

his folded garment take a war which shall

to lybia like the former fatall be in its events
this said incensed he the temple and the city quit's and home returns a messenger of war to rome
while such at carthage was the state of things fierce hannibal enrich'd with trophies brings again his arms before sagunthus walls and to his aid those many nations calls whose faith to rome was shaken by the fear of dubious war while they continued there the people that inhabited the coast presents the best callaick art could boast brought to the general
a shining shield that beams like lightning terrible did yield
an helmet on whose rising crest a plume did tremble and in whiteness overcome the alpine snow
with them a sword and spear which afterwards to thousands fatall were with treble chains of gold a coat of mail studded gainst which no weapon could prevail
these made of brass and harder steel inlay'd with tagus wealth triumphing he survey'd and in the carved works was pleas'd to see his nations happy birth and history
dido the first foundation there did lay of carthage and her navy sent away the work begun th industrious youth pursu'd
some with long piles and banks the port include to others reverend bitias prepares their houses platforms all in equal shares
and as they turned up the fertile ground a warlike horses head by chance they found

the

omen with an universal shout

of joy they all appeared to salute
among these figures sad aeneas stands wrack'd on her coasts and with extended hands deprived of his fleet and friends is seen to crave assistance
him th unhappy queen views with an earnest eye and entertains with smiles for love within her bosom reigns
then they describ'd the cave and secret rites the lovers us'd to warrant their delights
mean while the cries of men and dogs appear to strike the marble sky till suddain fear of an impetuous storm the hunters all constrain'd for shelter into woods to fall
not far from these upon the empty shore eliza weeps and did in vain implore the trojan return that now to sea had hois'd up sails and bore her love away
then on a lofty pile at last she stands wounded and to the tyrians commands revenging wars the trojan prince the while beholding from the sea the flaming pile to the propitious fates his sails doth spread resolv'd to follow wheresoe're they lead
apart from these at stygian altars stood young hannibal a childe who secret blood offer'd with the infernal priest and there the war against aeneas race did swear
but old amilcar image seem'd to be alive and triumph over sicily you'd think he breath'd forth war within his eys a flame of terrour with grim aspect lies
upon the left side of the shield a band of spartans with their ragged ensigns stand

whom bold xantippus as a conqu'rour led

from fair amycle fam'd by laeda bed
near these hung regulus their sad renown upon a cross and to the trembling town faith's great example was
a joyfull face of things adorns the rest where some the chace of beasts pursue and carved houses shine
not far remote from them with parched skin the moor sister in an horrid dress tames with her country's speech a lyoness
then through the fields the wandring shepherd moves free without stop through unforbidden groves near them his dart and whom he cydon names his barking dog his cottage and hid flames in veins of flint then lively they exprest his pipe familiar to the lab'ring beast
then on a lofty hill sagunthus stands and by unnumbred nations and bands of fighting men appears and to be push'd at by their trembling spears
about the borders rich iberus seems to make the circle up with winding streams over whose banks fierce hannibal from far

calls

africk to the romane war

on his broad shoulders as he smiling tries these wealthy presents proudly thus he cries
in how much romane blood shall imbrue these arms with how great punishments pursue that gowned senate that themselves do make revengers of the war we undertake now in the siege the fo grows old a day concludes the citie's fate while weary they their forein aids expect but now no more they look upon the seas or helpless shore

perceiving deaths approach with sad despair

for their parch'd entrails the contagious air enflames while famine in their bowels reigns and dries the blood in their contracted veins
from their faln cheeks their sinking eyes within their heads retire and through the shrivled skin the bones and joints a wofull sight with nervs consum'd appear the dew of night some gather from the earth to quench the fire of thirst and some themselves do vainly tire for liquour while they hardest oaks do bruise their rav'ning hunger which doth nought refuse compels them to strange food
from shields they tare the hides to feed upon and leave them bare
these ruins of his citie from the skie alcides look'd on with a mournfull eye but all in vain for him the strict command and fear of his great father iove withstand that he should nothing act gainst the decree

of his severe


therefore he

concealing his design to faith repairs who in the farthest part of heav'n the cares of deities revolv'd thus at her shrine he tries her counsels thou great power divine born before iove himself who art the grace and honour both of gods and humane race consort of justice without whom nor seas nor earth can know the benefit of peace a goddess where thou art in every breast canst thou behold sagunthus thus opprest unmov'd that citie which for thee alone so many so great ills hath undergone for thee the people dy upon thee all men women children that can speak do call

by famine overcome from heaven relieve

their sad estate and some assistance give
thus he to whom the heav'nly maid again replies
see all this nor is't in vain that thus my leagues infringed are a day shall come alcides that shall sure repay with vengance these their dire attempts
but was forc'd from the polluted earth to fly to seek in iove blest mansions a place free from the num'rous frauds of humane race
left their tyrans that their scepters hold fearing as they are fear'd that fury gold the vile reward of treacheries left and above all the men who now bereft of all humanity like beasts by spoil and rapine live while honour is the foil to luxury and modesty by night and her dark crimes opprest avoids the light the place of right the too imperious sword doth arrogate and force alone's ador'd vertue gives way to vice for look upon the nations of the earth and there is none is innocent their frequent fellowship in crimes alone the common peace doth keep
but that these walls erected by thy hand may in the book of fame for ever stand by an end worthy thee and that they may not give their bodies up a captive prey to the proud african which onely now the fates and state of future things allow the honour of their death will extend beyond the pow'r of fate and them commend as patterns to posterity and go with their prais'd souls unto the shades below

this said the constant virgin through the air

descends and to sagunthus doth repair then strugling with the fates through ev'ry breast she goes invades their minds which by her great deitie each soul doth prove her altar burning by her sacred love
now as if strong again for arms they cry and in the fight their weak endeavours try
strength above hope they find while the sweet name and honour of the goddess doth inflame their hearts resolved for her sake to dye and suffer things far worse then death to try the food of savage beasts and crimes to add to their repast but them chaste faith forbad longer with so much guilt to view the day or with man's flesh their hunger to allay
her when saturnia who by chance came down into the libyan camp within the town which she so hated saw she doth upbraid the virgin's courage and the war she made
then in a rage with troubled steps she went to that dire fury that doth still torment the guilty souls and thus upon her calls with hands extended
strike said she those walls thou darling of the night let thy fell hands destroy that people tis iuno commands my self within a cloud will here stand by and see the issue of thy industry
those weapons which sometimes immortal iove disturb by which thou acheron dost move thy flames of sulphure and thy hideous snakes in curls thy horrid voice which silent makes hell's porter and let fall from's jaws his poys'nous spume commixt with gall

what plagues and mischief what impiety

soe're within thy fruitful breast do lie upon these hated rutuli throw down and let sagunthus sink to acheron thus let their peevish faith rewarded be
incited by these words tisiphone invades the walls then round about the hill trembles and roaring waves the shore do fill
innumerable serpents on her head hissing her tumid neck and breast or'espread
death walking with her his wide jaws extends on whom pale sorrow and black grief attends
all plagues were present that created were while cerberus with howling rends the air
forthwith she counterfeits tyburna face her voice her speech her gesture and her pace
tyburna of a noble race deriv'd her blood from daunus and by war depriv'd of her dear husband murrus then bewail'd her widdowed bed
the fury having vail'd her self with her sad countenance her hair dishevel'd to the assembly doth repair and tearing there her cheeks what end said she of our great faith and citie shall we see have my murrus seen who every night doth me with his yet gaping wounds affright and lamentably thus on me doth call flie my tyburna flie this citie's fall
or if the conqu'ring libyan deny the earth to thee to me tyburna flie
our gods are faln and we poor rutuli are lost the punick sword doth all enjoy tremble and his ghost as yet before mine eyes appears
shall no more

thy stately palaces sagunthus see

happy my murrus was thrice happy he who saw his countrey standing when he fell but us victorious carthage will compell after so many miseries of war and dangers of the sea their yoak to bear and serve sidonian ladies and to lie captives in libya bosom when we die
but you whose conscious valour doth deny
brave young men a possibility to be made captives to whom death will be a certain guard against all misery with your own hands your mothers now redeem from slavery
true virtue gets esteem from hardest things
go on that praise to gain which hardly meaner people can obtain
with this sad language having fill'd their ears the fury to an antient tomb repairs which on the hill was built by hercules a unto such as plough'd those seas by him adorned with all sacred rites
come thither from the bottom she excites a sight of terrour a caerulean snake with spots of gold upon his scaly back his shining eyes are fill'd with bloody flames and to increase the terrour of those beams he hisseth loud and shakes his forked tongue and then with speed into the trembling throng of citizens he glides and from the walls into the midst of all the citie falls
thence like a fugitive he makes his way to th shore and drown's himself i'th foaming sea
then all distracted are and as betrayd its silent mansion ev'ry frighted shade

fled and refus'd to stay in conquer'd ground

and now despair of safety doth confound their troubled thoughts they now their meats detest and mad erinnys reigns in ev'ry breast
nor is the wrath of heav'n which they endure more grievous then the sad delays of sure and certain death
they all contend their fate to meet with speed and longer life do hate

amidst the city by the industry

of all the people raised to the skie there stood a lofty pile to which they bear and drag their riches that congested were in peace
their wealth acquir'd by their own hands and stately robes admir'd for art embroid'red with callaick gold by skilfull matrons and their arms of old brought from dulichian zacynthus by their and those gods the rutuli took from their antient abodes with all they could their own as yet unconquer'd call their shields and hapless swords and what within the earth in time of war had buried been again digg'd up they add unto the pile glad with themselves to burn the conqu'rour's spoil
when these the fury saw together heap'd she shakes her lamp of sulphur lately steep'd in burning phlegethon and drives away by stygian darkness the affrighted day
then they began the work whose sad renown their memories with lasting fame shall crown through all the world and them unconquer'd call
for prompted by erinnys chief of all scorning delays they all with triumph prest th unwilling swords into each others breast

then thrice the stroaks of her infernal whip

sound sadly through the citie while they dip in blood of kindred their unwilling hands and ev'ry man with thoughts of horrour stands amaz'd at what he acts and doth bemoan with floods of tears the mischief that is done
this mad with rage and sense of misery so long endur'd obliquely turns his eye upon his mother's breast whilst that invades his dear wive's neck with's ax then streight upbraids himself and check'd with horrour doth survey what he's about to do then flings away the weapon midst his rage yet cannot she escape for streight the blows redoubled be by fierce erinnys who through all appears and with her breath inspireth horrid fears
thus in the husband nuptial love doth dye those sweet delights are lost and memory of hymeneal tapers
then at length the mangled corps he throws with all his strength upon the pile whence a dark pyramis of smoak like a black storm doth waving rise
but thou tymbrenus with unhappy rage and piety sinister dost engage amidst the throng hasting anticipate the carthaginians in thy father's fate wounding that face and members that were known in all things to resemble so thine own
and you lycormas and eurymedon twins so alike in form that both were one who labour'd in your sons to propagate your names and forms here sadly met your fate in prime of age
but thee that sword from guilt absolves which through thy throat transfixed spilt

thy blood eurymedon while with her woes

distracted and deceiv'd oh whither goes my dear lycormas your sad mother cryes here turn thy sword
and as lycormas dies by his own hand she by the marks again of his deceiv'd exclaims in vain whither eurymedon doth rage thee lead thus she with changed names invokes the dead till to her trembling breast the sword apply'd on her ambiguous sons she frantick dy'd
this noble citie's horrid miseries their punishments for faith and prodigies renown'd with their sad acts of piety who can relate without a weeping eye scarce could the punick camp and cruel foe forbear their pitty in their tears to shew
that citie faith's most antient abode the authour of whose walls was held a god by the sidonians treach'rous arms doth fall and their mighty actions all by the unequal gods neglected are while fire and sword consumes them ev'ry where that place that wants a flame is impious held and clouds of smoak with pitchy darkness swell'd up to the very stars at length the tower that stood upon the hill by all the power of war till then untouch'd from whence the shore and carthaginian camp they us'd explore and all sagunthus with those bless'd abodes on earth the sacred temples of the gods now sinks in flames whose image from the main by waves that seem to burn return'd again
but now behold tyburna midst the heat and rage of slaughter most unfortunate

arm'd with her husband's sword in her

her left a flaming taper waving and her hair dishev'l'd her breasts made black and blew with stroaks of grief and to the publick view expos'd with naked arms to murrus tomb o're heaps of mangled carcases doth come
as when tormenting souls th infernal king with groans like thunder makes his courts to ring alecto at his throne doth strait appear to act his will and plagues administer
her husband's arms that lately with much blood defended were as then shee weeping stood upon the tomb she lays and having pray'd th elysian ghosts to entertain her shade she puts the flaming taper underneath and willing to accelerate her death these in the other world my self said she my dearest murrus will convey to thee
then taking up the sword her self she lai'd upon his arms and gaping did invade the rising flames dispersed on the ground promiscuous heaps of bodies round about her ly unhappy funerals as when a lyon fierce with hunger falls on trembling flocks which greedily he eats with thirsty jaws and blood regurgitates from his extended throat or'e mangled heaps of trunks and limbs he leaps then walking round them with a murm'ring noise grinding his teeth surveys what he destroys the sheep and the company of shepheards with the master prostrate ly and all the cottages as if a war had late been there destroy'd and wasted are

and now the carthaginians do invade

the city by these ruins empty made
this work which glad saturnia commends perform'd to hell tisiphone descends and with her as in triumph proudly takes a num'rous troop to the infernal lakes
but you bless'd souls who cannot equal'd be by any age since time's nativity may you the glory of the earth become and happy dwellers in elysium adorn the chaster seats of pious souls but you whom unjust victory enrolls in fame's large catalogue ye nations hear break not the leagues of peace nor crowns more dear then faith esteem
cast from his countrey he a wandring exile through the world shall be and carthage trembling shall behold him flie while in his troubled sleeps affrighted by sagunthine ghosts he'll wish he there had dy'd by them and when a sword shall be deny'd this great unconquer'd captain then shall go

deform'd by poyson to the shades below

silius italicus of the second punick vvar
the third book

the argument
bostar to ammon oracle is sent to understand the future war's event
to carthage hannibal his wife and son conveys by sea unwilling they should run the hazard of the war
a num'rous list of all the nations that him assist
pyrene overpass'd he marcheth on vntill his conqu'ring army stood upon the banks of rhodanus whose rapid stream by art and industry he overcame
at length ascends the alps great miseries the army in their tedious march surprize vntill arriving in the taurine plain they there encamp
bostar returns again from horned ammon temple and declares the god's command to prosecute the wars

all tyes of faith by tyrian arms undone

and walls of

chast sagunthus overthrown

through iove displeasure strait the conqu'rour went

to the world's bounds and gades

by descent

to him ally'd and diligent to finde what prophets and presaging souls divin'd

concerning his command bostar is strait

dispatch'd by sea to know ensuing fate

tis a belief in sanctuaries long

preserv'd where horned ammon plac'd among the parched garamantians emulates cyrrhaean caves that in a grove which fates foretells he future ages did declare with their events
an happy omen to his designs he sought and long before the day arriv'd all chances did explore and fortune of the war
but here the god ador'd the holy altars he doth load with spoils snatch'd lately at sagunthus fall from the then flaming arcenal
tis a report and not believed vain that from the first erecting of that fane the timber firm continues and hath known the hands of the first architects alone
here they rejoice to think the god doth dwell and from his temple doth decay repell
and they that have the honour to repair into the secret places must with care provide that women do not enter in and from the gates must banish bristled swine
neither before the altars may they wear discolour'd robes their bodies cover'd are with linen and pelusiack tulbans crown their heads their garments loosely hanging down they incense burn and by their fathers taught the sacrificing vest with studs is wrought their beds from loose desires are free their altars keep eternal fires
within no statues of the gods appear or images
the place a rev'rent fear

and majesty adorn
but carv'd with skill

the gates the labours of alcides fill
there the lernaean hydra lies her snakes cut off and there with strength he breaks the nemaean lyon's gaping jaws and then hell's porter drag'd from his eternal den affrights the ghosts with howling and disdains his thraldom while megaera fear'd the chains
near these the thracian horses and the boar arcadia plague the hart whose wore horns that in breadth the arms of trees surpass'd next them a conquest no less easie plac'd antaeus on his mother stood and the centaur ugly brood

while the poor

acarnanian seems to fear

his naked front then oeta doth appear to shine with sacred fires and to the skies on winged flames his mighty soul doth rise
these various shapes of valour having fill'd a while his eyes near to them he beheld a sea that rising to a wondrous height fell on the subject earth with all its weight no shores do give it bounds but ev'ry where the waters o're the fields diffused are
for where blew nereus in caerulean caves turns from the bottom the contorted waves an inundation breaks and by release of hidden springs fierce torrents do encrease then as if with furious throws th impetuous billows labour to impose upon the trembling earth the swelling main then strait the falling tide retires again and the forsaken vessel leaves aground while looking for the flood the decks are crown'd

with idle seamen stooping from above

in her bright chariot the moon doth move these restless kingdoms of cymotheae and the continual labours of the sea bringing the tide and bearing it away while still alternate tetbys doth obey
these view'd in haste for weight of many cares lay on his thoughts first to remove from wars

the consort of

his bed and son as yet

an infant and depending on the teat for they their virgin joyn'd in youth and still retain'd a loving minde
but at sagunthus siege begot the childe not yet the age of twice six moons fulfill'd
and hannibal resolving to remove those dear and tender pledges of his love from arms and future danger to his son directs his speech and smiling thus begun
oh thou great hope of carthage and no less a terrour to the proud aeneades may'st thou exceed thy father in thy fame and by thy actions build thy self a name may'st thou a greater warriour appear then was thy and now sick with fear may rome teach matrons to prepare their tears when they the number of thy years if my divining soul do not delude my sense this very boy we may conclude a mighty labour to the earth will be know my countenance in his see beneath his angry brow his threatning eye
observe the weighty eccho of his cry those elements of anger that from me derived are
if any deity

by chance so glorious acts anticipate

and break off their beginnings by my fate dear wife endeavour to preserve with care this pledg of war and when thou first shalt hear him speak within my cradle him convey and on eliza altar let him lay his tender hands and to my ashes swear the prosecution of the romane war
then when more firm in years his cheeks shall wear the flower of youth let him in arms appear and scorning leagues a conqu'rour at rome raise in the capitol for me a tomb
but thou whom th happy honour of a birth so high attends renown'd through all the earth for faith and constancy remove far remove from dangers of uncertain war and leave these harder labours· we must go or'e rocks and hills that cover'd or'e with snow seem to prop up the heav'ns
we what may make iuno her self admire must undertake alcides labours and the alps that are a toil more greivous then the sharpest war
but if inconstant fortune my design shall thwart and promis'd favours shall decline may'st thou live long and hasty fate extend thy ev'ner thread of life beyond my end thus he
imilce of cyrrbaean race whose ancestour renown'd castalius was apollo priest and castulo in spain so called from his mother doth retain as yet the name and from that sacred line deriv'd her parents since the god of wine shaking high calpe with his thyrsus and arm'd subdu'd th iberian land

and milicus who of a satyre born

and nymph myrîce on his front the horn of his lascivious father planted wore a potent scepter in that country bore
from him her country did imilce claim and fam'd original from him her name corrupted by their barbarous speech· she than tears flowing with sad language thus began
forgetfull that my safety doth depend on thine dost thou refuse me to attend on thy designs is thus thy nuptial vow and of my bed neglected now or shall wanting be to climb with thee the frozen hills believe and try in me a woman's strength
no labour is too great for my chast love but if on me you set no other rate but of my sex alone and part for that yield look not on my fate
may iove consent go happy thou go and propitious gods our pray'rs allow and when in fight and heat of arms you are think then on me and this your son with care
for nor romanes nor their darts nor fire do dread so much as thee who dost desire to run upon their swords and dost present thy head to danger
thee no good event of valour satisfies
honour to thee alone seems vested with infinity
souldiers to dye in peace to thee appears a fate ignoble
oh my many fears forgive me for tremble yet none do fear that shall encounter thee alone
but pity us great father mars this storm avert nor may the trojans do him harm

now to the shore they haste the seamen climb

and hanging on the yards their canvase trim and fit them for the wind while to allay his fears and ease his minde oppress'd with cares thus hannibal oh spare these omens my most constant wife forbear thy tears
in peace or war we all must have a period to our life
our first day gave a being to our last
brave thoughts do few enflame by noble actions to pursue eternal fame such onely mighty iove hath destin'd to the bless'd abodes above
shall the romane yoak endure and see the tow'rs of carthage in captivity ghosts do by night affright me and the shade of my dead father doth my sloath upbraid
the altars and the horrid sacrifice once did offer stand before mine eys shortness of dubious life forbids delay of time
shall sit still that carthage may alone acknowledge me and speak my fame and shall not all the world know what am shall relinquish honour through a fear to dy alass how little distant are death and a silent life
yet think not do praise affect with mad temerity have esteem for life for glory wears titles and is ador'd in length of years
great trophies of this war shall also thee attend if heav'n and gods propitious be
all tyber shall thee serve th ilian dames and the rich romane with the wealth he claims
while thus they sadly talk and mutual tears express their present grief and future fears

from the tall ship the master put to sea

beckons to come aboard without delay
then from her husband snatch'd with fixed eys she views the shore till the swift vessel flies through liquid paths and takes her sight away while sea from land retires and land from sea
but hannibal resolving to remove with cares of war his pensive thoughts of love goes to the ruin'd walls the which he views and often in his wish their fall renews walking about the ruins till at length his labours overcame his stubborn strength and sleep insensibly with pleasing charms compos'd his minde intent on war and arms
then iove designing still to exercise the trojan race in future miseries revive their antient labours and by wars to raise their lasting name unto the stars his slothfull rest and resolution curbs and by infused fears his sleep disturbs
and now cyllenius through the humid shade of night his father's high commands convai'd and lighting on the earth thus sharply he the sleeping youth upbraids
tis base to see a general in sleep consume the night they must be vigilant would stand in fight
the seas oppress'd with navies thou shalt see and the ausonian youth insulting flee o're all the ocean while thou dost stand at first attempts in the iberian land
is it an action of sufficient fame or valour to commemorate thy name that with so great attaques sagunthus fell awake if any thing within thee dwell

fit for brave actions rise and go with me

and where call thee bear me company but forbid thee to look back for this by th greater thunderer commanded is
and if thou dost obey thou shalt become a conquerour before the walls of rome
with that he seem'd to lead him by the hand with speed and full of joy to saturn land
when strait a noise breaks forth with a loud crack like thunder round about and at his back the hiss of direfull tongues the waving air shakes and repells while he with sudden fear surpriz'd no more retaineth in his minde the precepts of the god but looks behinde
when dragging groves from hills with the strokes of his vast bulk eradicating oaks and bearing rocks along through invious waies a serpent black as night his tongue displaies with dreadfull hissing and to's eys appears as big as that which the unequal bears in num'rous foldings doth at once behold and both the constellations unfold
so large his jaws immanely he distends and lifting up his head in height ascends equal to hills
heaven's rage ingeminates the noise and mix'd with hail new fear creates
he with his monster frighted for nor sleep nor night did then their former empire keep and with his wand the god had put to flight the darkness and with sleep had mingled light what mighty plague it was demands and where twould fall or whither that vast body bear that then the burthen of the earth was made or gaping what sad people twould invade

to whom cyllenius answers
thou dost see

the war so much desir'd and sought by thee
thee greatest wars attend the dreadfull fall of woods and forests with high storms that all the face of heav'n disturb the slaughter thee and death of men the great calamity of the idaean race and saddest fate do follow and upon thee daily wait
as great and terrible as that dire snake which now the mountains with his scaly back depopulates and drives the forests through the fields before him and doth earth imbrue with frothy poison
such thou having past and overcome the alps with war shalt wast all italy and with a noise as great the cities and their walls shalt ruinate
thus wounded with these stings the god and sleep at once forsake him and cold sweat doth creep o're all his limbs while in a wofull fright his dreams revolving he retracts the night
and now with happy omens to the king of gods and mars they holy off'rings bring but first a bull devoutly they to hermes on deserved altars lay
and all these rites perform'd he strait commands his ensigns to advance
with that the bands whose languages and manners different were with clamours shake the camp and fill the air
but now calliope declare to fame what and how many valiant nations came rais'd by his dire attempts to italy what cities with untam'd iberians he did arm what troops on th paretonian shore libya presum'd to muster and before

great rome to challenge to her self the reins

of rule and on the earth impose new chains no tempest raised by impetuous storms went on so furiously no dire alarms

of war when twice five hundred

ships

the sea and fill'd the trembling world with dread
the carthaginian youth the chief of all their ensigns spread of body light not tall of stature but of that proud grace depriv'd
apt for deceit they readily contriv'd their secret frauds
a round unpolish'd shield with a short sword their arms and in the field they march'd ungirt with garments they cunningly conceal'd the blood was shed
captain to these in purple splendid tall above the rest brother to hannibal mago in's chariot with the noise alarms the fo and brother imitates in arms
next these divided in sidonian bands built before towr's of antient byrsa stands old vtica
then aspis which the shore encompass'd with sycanian walls whose store of crooked turrets that a warlike shield resembled all the neighbr'ing sea beheld
but young sychaeus drew the eys of all upon himself whom son to hasdrubal with a vain pride his mother's high descent had fill'd and's uncle hannibal content with no less pride still to repeat his name
near these the warlike souldier that came from watry berenicis and the bands

that with long

dolons arm'd among the sands

of thirsty barce dwell
then to the fight cyrene sprang from pelops doth excite

the false battiades whom once extoll'd

and by amilcar fam'd ilertes old in war but young in counsel did command
with tabraca then tyrian people and sarranian leptis oea too combin'd trinacrian colonies with africk joyn'd and tingis sent from a tempestuous sea by lixus vaga and hippo fam'd to be the love of kings and their delight of old
and ruspina that doth from far behold unequal billows rising on the main

with

zama where the libyan troops were slain

by valiant scipio

thapsus too that stood

renown'd as oft imbru'd with romane blood
these nations both in arms and body great whose name and deeds did still perpetuate alcides honour taller by the head

then all his following bands

antaeus led

then came the aethiopians not unknown to fruitfull nile who that mysterious stone do cut that draws untouch'd the distant steel with mibians whose parched bodies feel the fury of the sun not wont to wear helmets or coats of mail or bows to bear accustom'd when in fight they did contend with flax their heads and bodies to defend and in some deadly poison to imbrue their swords or to infect the darts they threw
then first cinyphian macae did begin to learn phoenician warlike discipline their squallid beards their faces and rough their shoulders covered with arm'd they came into the field
but th adyrmachidae a painted shield

and swords like hooks by art intorted bear

and their with armour guarded were but they rude tables have and uncouth fare for in hot sands their viands roasted are
massilians then with ensigns shining bright who last of all behold the falling light of day which the hesperian seas do drown
these with long curled tresses hanging down fierce bocchus leads and views upon the shore growing on sacred trees the precious ore
getulians likewise from their wandring home into the camp to his assistance come familiar with wild beasts they could allay with words the lyon's rage
no houses they possess but dwell continually in wains bearing their restless lares through the plains
a thousand winged troops whose steeds obey the wand as nimble as the winde their way into the camp do break
as when the hills and plains a pack of dogs with eccho fills and with full crie in view the flying deer do follow and precipitate with fear
these his stern face and brow with rage acheras slain hasbyte brother led

pyrene whose rough brows the clouds enfold

from far the rich iberi doth behold divided from the celtae and still stands a firm divorce between those mighty lands
the hills their name from a bebrician maid did first derive and by the crime tis said of hercules a guest when by the fate of those his labours rais'd by iuno hate triple geryon land he did invade and then in bebrix cruel palace made lyaeus vassal he pyrene left her form bewailing now by him bereft of her virginity and if we may believ't of her unhappy death they say that god was cause that god who in her womb began to swell
for she her dearest home frighted forsook and with an awfull dread her father's ire as from a serpent fled
wandring in desart caves alcides night she did lament and all his vows recite

and promises unto the shady groves

till thus bewailing his ingratefull loves and lifting up her hands implore his aid she to the salvage beasts a prey was made
but when at length the god return'd again with spoils a conquerour gerion slain her mangled limbs with tears he did bewail and when he saw her face with rage grew pale
the lofty hills struck with his voice appear to shake when with a mournfull noise he on pyrene calls and under ground the dens of beasts and all the rocks resound pyrene name then sadly he prepares her sepulchre embalming her with tears
nor can the teeth of time destroy her fame the hills retaining her lamented name
now or'e the airy mountains and through vast condensed woods bold hannibal had past the bounds of bebrix and by's armed hand his way through the inhospitable land of volsians breaks untill his army stood

upon the banks of that

unruly flood

which from the alps and snowy rocks descends upon the celtae and himself extends into a swelling stream that makes his way o're land with a large current to the sea
to its great force mix'd arar adds that seems to stand so slow his pace with silent streams which rhodanus once seising bears away in restless billows and without delay drowns in the main and forceth it disclaim near to its native shore its countrie's name
but now the hostile river all invade while some upon their heads and shoulders lai'd

their arms and breaking through the torrent strive

which on the adverse bank shall first arrive
to skifs that late were trees their steeds they binde and waft them o're nor do they leave behinde the elephants whose fears awhile withstood for covering with mighty beams the flood so much by them abhorr'd and ev'ry plank with solid earth from the bank the beasts descend whom to the other side swimming as on the ground they gently guid
the river frighted with so vast a weight of the fierce herd the threatning billows strait from's sandy bottom turns and all his springs lets loose and to his aid with murmurs brings
now the tricassian coast the army gains and fertile fields now through vocuntian plains they move where swift druentia troubled rolls huge stones and trunks of trees and so controlls their pleasant march for from the alps it springs and thence with roaring waves devolving brings eradicated trees and quarries torn from hollow rocks at the creation born then deviating his fallacious streams turns from their course and is not what he seems
the fords deceitfull are to foot unstable the chanel to small barks innavigable but then encreas'd by fall of sudden storms o'rewhelms a multitude of men with arms surcharg'd who sinking in the foaming waves dismembred in the bottom finde their graves
but now all memory of labours pass'd and fears the so near in view displac'd
all parts with frost and undissolving hail are cov'red and eternally prevail

to keep their aged ice the lofty brow

o'th airy hills is bound about with snow which opposite to phoebus rising beams will know no dissolution by his flames
as far as the tartarean abyss of that pale kingdom where the dwelling is of mournfull ghosts and stygian waters are removed from the upper earth so far erected through the air the mountains rise and with their shadow intercept the skies
no springs no summer's glories do appear but deform'd winter still inhabits there and on the cliffs perpetually defends her seat and thither from all quarters sends the swelling clouds and showres
here all the storms and winds their furious powers dispose
beyond the rocks no eyes extend their sight the hills above the clouds ascend
though athos lay on taurus rhodope on mimas or though snowy pelion be on ossa heap'd or othrys were beheld on haemus lai'd to these they all must yield
alcides first to these unknown abodes aspir'd to go whom cutting clouds the gods beheld and cleaving highest hills to clime those rocks since the birth of time
but now the souldiers their march retard as if those sacred bounds which nature barr'd bearing those impious arms they had transgrest and going forward should the gods resist
gainst which the general whom nor the height o'th alps nor terrours of the place affright to cure their minds with monsters terrifi'd and to recall their courage thus reply'd

is't not a shame that through obsequious fear

of gods you that so many trophies wear of war now weary of success should yield your backs to snowy hills and be repell'd with idle terrours while no courage warms your hearts and you to rocks submit your arms
oh my companions think you now assail the walls of rome or iove high temple scale
this labour will give up into your hands ausonia and bring tyber into bands this said the army mov'd by promis'd spoils in haste the mountain climb nor think what toils ensue while he commands them to forsake alcides and new waies to take to tread in paths that might be call'd their own and by their names in future times be known
then through untroden places first of all he breaks and from the top of rocks doth call his troops and where in hard congealed frost in the white cliffs the slipp'ry path was lost his sword th obdurate ice divides and now into deep gaping pits of yielding snow whole squadrons sink and from the hollow top to bury them alive fresh ruins drop
sometimes fierce corus on his gloomy wings collecting snow against their faces flings sometimes uniting all his rage in storms from the advent'rous souldier takes his arms which with the whirling blasts unto the skies in circles that delude the sight arise
the higher they ascend and seek to ease their steps the more their labours still encrease to one great height a greater doth succeed and ev'ry hill another seems to breed

hence all their sweats and labours which before

they had o'recome they durst not now explore such fears repeated objects do present and wheresoe're their trembling eies were bent the horrid face of winter ever white appearing gives sad limits to their sight
so mariners that late forsook the land and now amid'st the calmed ocean stand while no propitious wind or gentle blast fills the loose sails upon the steady mast from the smooth sea divert their weary eies and fix their expectation on the skies
above these miseries and sad distress the places gave in a most sordid dress an alpine band like salvage beasts their locks stiff with eternal squallour from the rocks and aged their faces show and with their constant vigour through the snow through thorns and invious paths by them alone frequented and familiarly known by various incursions on them prest and their enclosed enemy infest
all places now assume another form the snow's made red with blood there ice grew warm with purple streams and that which ne're before could be o'recome resolvs by reeking gore
and as with iron feet the horse divide the yielding frost their hoofs there fix'd abide within the closing ice
nor was their fall the onely mischief but they leave withall their limbs behind which by the piercing frost fall as cut off and there are sadly lost

through all these miseries when they had past

twelve daies as many tedious nights at last

to the desired top they come and there

hanging on broken cliffs their tents they rear but cytherea who through fear grew faint goes to her father with this sad complaint
what stint of punishment pray what end of plagues shall the aeneades attend when shall they after toils by sea and land repose why now doth carthage take in hand and labour thus to drive my progeny from that renowned city giv'n by thee see on the alps they libya impose threatning our empire's ruin and the woes of lost sagunthus rome may justly fear
oh whither shall we troy last ashes bear those sacred ruins and th assarick race with vesta secrets give us iove a place where we may safely dwell
is it so small a thing that they have wandring sought through all the world their exile or shall troy become again a prey in captivated rome thus cytherea whom the thunderer thus answers
erycina cease to fear nor let these high attempts or what's design'd by envious libya perplex thy mind
thy blood possesseth and shall long possess the high tarpeian towr's the fates no less permit
by this great weight of war will perpend their virtue and their valour try
shall that brave nation that so long hath been inur'd to war that hath with triumph seen so many their great labours overpast the honour of their ancestours at last decline or shall they whom our seed did raise who never spar'd their blood in seeking praise

still thirsting after fame obscurely spend

their time or with inglorious silence end their daies as poison'd with the love of ease valour suppress'd doth perish by degrees
it is a mighty work not to be done without much toil and labour that alone among so many valiant nations rome should to her self the reins of rule assume yet shall the time arrive when she shall be

the chief ennobled by calamity

hence their great acts shall add unto the skies new stars and names hence paulus shall arise hence fabius and marcellus who shall be pleasing for his opimous spoils to me
these by their wounds shall raise in italy an empire that not all the luxury of their degen'rate issuecan destroy

and there's already born a warlike

boy

who shall the carthaginian recall to his own countrey and before the wall of carthage of his arms shall him deprive
then cytherea shall thy live long in command then by the cures shall coelestial virtue to the stars extoll herself and by their sacred rites proclaim a large addition to iülus name

then from a

sabine stock a branch shall spring

whose father shall enable him to bring trophies from unknown thule and shall be the first that caledonian woods shall see with his victorious troops who shall confine within his hollow banks the swelling rhine shall govern the rebellious african with vigilance and when an aged man

idumea shall subdue

nor shall he after death those kingdoms view that are for ever dark or th stygian lake

but of our

honours and this place partake

then shall a

youth excelling in his strength

of understanding on himself at length assume the burthen of his father's care and in his empire have an equal share he the iudaean war so full of rage shall quite extinguish in his tender age

but thou

germanicus who though a childe

thy father's acts transcendest and hast fill'd the yellow germanes with an awfull dread

fear not the capitolian fires

thy head

amidst those sacrilegious flames shall be preserv'd
thou long and happy daies shalt see to thee gangetick youth their bows unbent shall offer up and bactria shall present her empty quivers from the icy north thou shalt in triumph bring thy chariot forth and through the city ride then from the east such trophies gain as bacchus ne're possest
thou frozen ister scorning to give way to dardan ensigns shalt compell obey and in sarmatick limits shalt restrain
thou romane nephews that shall honour gain by eloquence shalt in thy speech excell to thee the learned sisters that do dwell near thespian springs shall offer sacrifice
thy lyre shall sound more sweetly then did his that hebrus made to stand and rhodope to follow and shall utter things may be admir'd by phoebus
raised by thy hand on the tarpeian rocks where faith doth stand

ador'd of old rich capitols shall shine

and to the stars their lofty turrets joyn
but thou born of gods which shalt give birth to future deities the happy earth rule with thy father's power thy fate shall be retarded and these heav'nly mansions thee a late and aged guest shall entertain quirinus shall give place and thou shalt gain between thy brother and thy sire a throne and near thee fix'd shall shine thy starry son
while iove the series of times to come doth thus unfold the libyan captain from th unequal hills through waies perplex'd descends and dubiously on quarries moist contends to fix his sliding steps
no furious shocks of foes deterr him but the obvious rocks whose prone and threatning cliffs obstruct the way so as besieg'd they stand and the delay and difficulties of their march lament nor would the time allow them to foment with rest their frozen limbs
they spend the night in labour and their shoulders all unite with speed the forests from the hills to bring
the highest mountains naked made they fling the trees in heaps together and surround with flames the rocks which with a dreadful sound now yielding to their bars of iron breaks and to the weary troops a passage makes into latinus kingdom
when they'd past through all these miseries the alps at last the general within the taurine plains his tents doth pitch and there encamp'd remains
in the mean time from garamantian sands with ammon oracles and dark commands

bostar with joy arrives and doth appear

to glad their hearts as iove himself were there and thus begins
great hannibal whose hand hath banish'd bondage from thy native land we have through libya pass'd where sands arise up to the stars and lift us to the skies
us earth more furious then the raging main had almost swallow'd up the barren plain from the first entrance to the farthest bound of heav'n extends nor can an hill be found by nature rais'd in all that spacious tract but what with hollow clouds of sand impact the whirlwinds build or when fierce africus escaping from his den to spoil the earth or corus that the stars doth with the ocean wash with furious wars invade the field and with congested sand make heaps that there in stead of mountains stand observing stars o're this inconstant we sail for day our voyage would confound
and cynosura that a faithfull star doth prove to the sidonian mariner the wand'ring traveller who seems abide still in the midst through the deep plain doth guid
but when we weary to the sacred grove and woody empire came of horned iove where on large columns stands the shining fane with what a chearfull brow our entertain arisbas gave the god's divining priest who to his house conducted me his guest

near to the temple in the grove a spring

doth rise a strange and memorable thing which at the birth of day and its decline is warm when sol in midst of heav'n doth shine

it soon grows cold but in the shades of night

that heat is greater made that shuns the light
full of the god these places then he shews and glebes made wealthy without help of plows and chearfully thus speaks
this shady grove these woods whose tops do touch the feet of iove connex'd to heav'n here prostrate falling down bostar adore for unto whom unknown are iove fam'd gifts through all the world the pair of doves that in the top of thebae were of which the first that the chaonian land did touch and on dodona oak did stand fill'd it with prophecy
but that which o're carpathian seas unto the libyan shore with snowy wings repair'd this sacred seat

the cytherean bird did then create

and where you altars and dark groves behold standing between the horns strange to behold of a choice ram the leader of the rest o'th wealthy flock from its inspired breast answers to the marmarick people sung
then out of earth this wood thus shady sprung and groves of aged oaks that now the skies do seem to touch and such at first did rise by antient favour keeping as before their po'wr and we with altars warm adore
while these things with admiration view struck with a noise of terrour open flew the and strait a greater light our eyes beheld
the priest array'd in white before the holy altars did appear the people all contending to go near
then as was order'd having pray'd behold the god doth suddenly invade

the prophet and through all the ecchoing grove

grave murmurs from the trembling beams do move
and now a voice more loud then usual through the yielding air doth break
for latium you intend said he and to infest with war the issue of assaricus prepare
see what warlike libya intends and now the cruel god of war ascends his chariot and his furious steeds expire towards th hesperian coast a gloomy fire while blood upon their reins doth largely flow
but thou who dost desire events to know of battels and th'extremities of fate couragiously attempting toyls so great

th aetolian captain's iapygian field

invade encrease of honour thou shalt yield to thy sidonian fathers after thee into the bowels of rich italy no conquerour shall further penetrate till by thy hand subdu'de the dardan state shall tremble and their youth ne're quit their fears while hannibal alive on earth appears
these oracles brought bostar and desires of present battel into all inspires

the fourth book

the argument
the people's fears when hannibal had past the alpine hils the senate care and haste oppose his progress
on ticinus shore the armies meet
what auguries before the fight begun foretold the libyans stay in italy the romanes lose the day
scipio in fight's relieved by his son then but a boy
the romanes marching on to trebia their arms with gracchus join and lose a second day
the apennine when hannibal had with his army crost in cold and moorish grounds an eye he lost
his son demanded for a sacrifice to saturn by the senate he denies and promiseth hereafter to make good those rites again with noble romane blood

now fame ausonia frighted cities fills with rumours that the hills and rocks that threatned heaven the war imbrac'd that now the carthaginians had pass'd those pathless waies and often doth repeat that hannibal who seem'd to emulate

alcides labours did the plain possess

and thus mischievous tumults doth express encreasing as she goes and swifter far then swiftest winds with the report of war shakes the affrighted tow'rs
the people's fear apt to believe the vainest things they hear the rumour feeds
now all with care and speed prepare for war the noise whereof is spread through all ausonia must'ring arms and men
they whet their piles and rust wip'd off agen its cruel splendour to the steel restore
the youth their plumed helmets long before lai'd up in peace repair their loops they join to darts and new from forges axes shine
with these impenetrable coats of mail they form and destin'd to prevail gainst many hands and frustrate strongest blows
some carefully provide italian bows while others teach the panting steeds to wheel or trot the round and whet on stones their steel
then with like care and speed they stones convay to antient walls and castles whose decay was wrought by time in these their magazin of arms they make and speedily begin with bars of oak their trenches and their gates to fortifie while fear precipitates all that they act and doth in chief command
some in the desert fields amazed stand others their and home forsake and frighted on their trembling shoulders take their feeble parents whose weak thread of life was almost spent
one drives before his wife with locks dishevel'd dragging a little son that in each hand unequally doth run

thus do the people vent their fears nor scan

the cause or whence those rumours first began
the senate though these bold beginnings fill'd their hearts with terrour and they now beheld ev'n in the heart of italy a war to which the alps and pathless rocks from far seem'd to descend oppose a valiant mind against adversity resolv'd to finde honour in dangers and by valour raise a name so great of such immortal praise as fortune never did before bestow or to the best successes would allow
but now his troops chill'd with a long excess of cold and tyr'd doth hannibal caress in safe retreats and to their joyfull eyes shews through rich fields their way and rome their prize
yet he omits not to pursue the cares of war and still consulting his affairs he onely takes no rest
as when of old ausonia happy territory bold and warlike nations fiercely did invade and by their valour to the world were made a terrour the tarpeian thunderer and captiv'd romanes felt a cruel war

while he endeavours with his gifts the vain

and wav'ring nations to his side to gain and join in arms the consul scipio from

massilia by sea returning home

arrived suddenly upon the shore and these great captains that had try'd before the sev'ral labours of the sea and land now in the plain more near to danger stand and joyn their fates while a most dismal hour approach'd
for when the consul with his power

came to the camp and fortune all delay

had lai'd aside the troops no longer stay endure but all incensed with desire of fight the fo in view the sign require
the tyrian captain then to animate his num'rous army doth aloud relate his glorious conquests in th iberian war that not pyrene hills could set a bar to his commands nor furious rhodanus sagunthus burnt that through the celtae thus he had conqu'ring made his way and where't had been alcides labour he in arms had seen his libyan horse insult and trampling on the rocks with neighing make the alps to groan
but contrary the consul to the fight and noble actions doth his men excite
you have said he a tyr'd and weary fo already half consum'd with frost and snow who scarce can drag his limbs benumm'd with cold
go on and let him learn that was so bold to pass those sacred mountains and those high and airy rocks how far this trench doth ly above herculean tow'rs that with more ease he may ascend those hills then break through these impenetrable ranks
let him recite to fame his vain attempts untill in fight subdu'd and hasting to return again by the same way he came the alps restrain his flight
the gods have brought him hither through those difficulties that he might imbrue with his perfidious blood th italian ground and that his bones hereafter may be found scatter'd in hostile land
fain would know if't be another carthage that doth now

intend us war or is't the same again

that near aegutes perish'd in the main this said the army to ticinus goes
ticinus in a shallow chanel flows with clear and quiet waters and the stream so slowly passeth on that it doth seem to stand as it with silence glides along embrace the shady banks where birds do throng and their shrill quires perpetually keep as if to charm the lazy flood asleep
now at night's period the morn begun with shining shades and sleep its course had run when to explore the place's nature round the neighb'ring hill and view the the consul went abroad the libyans too the like resolve and it with care pursue
this done they both advance into the field with wings of horsemen and as they beheld the clouds of dust to rise and heard the sound of furious steeds that prancing made the ground to tremble and the trumpet's shrill alarms each captain cries now souldiers to your arms
in both an equal valour and desire of honour shin'd in both an equal fire to press into the fight and when as nigh they came as from a sling a dart might fly a sudden augury diverts their eyes and minds all clouds dispers'd unto the skies
an hawk pursuing from the south the fair

and gentle birds that by

dione are

so well belov'd with his devouring bill his pounces and his wings fifteen did kill nor would be satisfied his strong desire of blood increas'd and slaughter fed the fire

untill as stooping at a trembling dove

that knew not in its flight which way to move to meet with safety from the rise of day an eagle came and frighting him away towards the romane ensigns flies and where the general son young scipio did appear then but a boy in arms with a loud cry there twice or thrice proclaims the victory then with his bill his helmet's crest doth bite and to the stars again resumes his flight
liger who knew by his divining skill the god's advice and by his learned quill could future things declare aloud to all exclaims
full eighteen years the libyan shall th ausonian youth in italy pursue like that rapacious bird and shall imbrue his hands in blood and wealthy trophies gain
but yet proud african thy rage restrain for see iove thee denies italian scepters
chief of deities be present may thy eagle's omen be at length confirm'd
for noble youth to thee the final fates of conquer'd libya are reserv'd and a most glorious name in war greater then carthage in her height of pride unless those birds in flight the gods bely'd
but bogus contrary to this doth sing all happy omens to the tyrian king
the hawk a good presage the doves that fell slain in their airy region foretell the fall and ruin of the romane state
thus having said as conscious of and prompted by the gods he first doth throw with strength a ready jav'lin at the fo

but through the spacious field had vainly flown

and lost its killing force if riding on full speed ambitious to be first of all that gave the charge bold catus horse ith fall had not receiv'd it on his face and though it then was weak he met the fatal blow and found his ruin for the trembling wood fix'd in his front between his temples stood
now with loud shouts both armies through the plain came rushing on and meeting all restrain their reins to stand the charge
the furious steed erected stands and struggling to get head flies like a tempest through the while to his feet the sand doth hardly yield
before the rest a nimble active band

of boii whom stout chryxus did command

assault the van and chryxus with a rage great as his doth engage
from brennus he his fam'd original deriv'd and now the conquer'd capitol among his titles wore upon his shield the pensive romanes ready all to yield on the tarpeian sacred hill behold the celtae weighing their redeeming gold
his a golden chain did bear his garments with pure gold embroider'd were bracelets of massie gold adorn his wrest and the like metal shin'd upon his crest by his fierce onset the camertine bands at first were routed
nothing now withstands the boii who in a condensed throng break through the thickest ranks and mix'd among the barb'rous senones beneath the feet of their fierce horses trample all they meet

and with mangled corps the field which seems

to swim in blood that in continued streams from men and horses flows and doth imbrue the sliding steps of them that still pursue
bodies by horses hoofs are slain which flying round the fatal plain scatter'd from their light heels the purple flood and lave the wretches faces with their blood
tyrrhenus born near high pelorus shore first dying stained with his purple gore a conqu'ring dart for as he did excite with a shrill trumpet others to the fight reviving courage by the warlike sound received by a barb'rous dart a wound in's panting throat which quickly doth impair the rising noise yet the infused air blown from his dying mouth awhile doth pass his lips now silent through the winding brass picens and laurus both by chryxus dy
but yet not both alike for laurus by his sword was slain selected near the po a polish'd spear gave picens fatal blow
for as aside he turned to delude by wheeling round the fo that him pursu'd the spear at once both penetrates his thigh and's horses flank and both together dy
next he wounds venulus and from his neck retires the weapon stain'd with blood to check thy speed rash who by the same dost likewise fall with tullus near the stream of cold velinus bred ausonia pride and of a glorious name had he not dy'd or had the tyrians their league maintain'd
with these the great tyburti who had gain'd

renown in wars and romulus his hand

sent to the shades below
hispellas and metaurus daunus too his ruin found from him whom with his lance he thought to wound
nor was there room for tyrians to engage in battel with the rest
the coltick rage fill'd the whole field no shafts from any hand were sent in vain but fix'd in bodies stand
here among trembling files quirinus high in courage and disdaining thoughts to fly resolv'd to meet with an undaunted mind his fate if prosp'rous fortune once declin'd inflames his furious courser with his spear and with his arms disperseth here and there the shafts that him invade thinking to make his way and through the thickest ranks to break attach the king and certain to receive his death attempts by valour to atchieve that honour he could not survive
a wound into the groin of teutalus the ground doth make to tremble with his weighty fall
next sarmens dy'd for valour known to all who his long yellow tresses that pure gold contracted in a knot behind had vow'd if he return'd a conquerour a sacrifice to thee the god of war
but the stern fates regarding not his vow him with his hair unshorn to th shades below untimely sent
o're all his limbs the reeking blood in streams diffused swims and stains the earth
lycaunus whom a dart that met him as he mov'd could not divert rush'd in and waving his revenging sword with all the strength that fury could afford

upon his shoulder gives a fatal wound

where his left arm by yielding sinews bound its strength and motion did receive which now hangs loosely down and lets the bridle go and as he stooping labour'd to retain within his trembling hand the reins again from's body vegasus lop'd off his head and in his helmet as it largely bled ty'd to his horse's main it bears about the gods saluting with a barb'rous shout
while thus the field the gauls with slaughter feed the consul mounted on a steed into the fight advanc'd with fresh supplies and first of all with courage flies on the prevailing fo on him attend the choicest youth that italy could send
the marsi corae and the latines pride sabellus who by all was magnifi'd for flinging his dart with certain skill with stout tudertes from his native hill devote to mars and the falisci who deck'd in their wars pursue with these that by a silent river near

herculean walls their wealthy orchards rear

with apples crown'd
next the catilli came that dwell on banks where anyo swift stream to tyber hasts and those that from their slings send hernick stones hardned in freezing springs
nor were they absent that inhabit where casinum still is crown'd with misty air
thus went th italian youth to war and by th unequal gods were destin'd there to dy
but scipio where the fury of the fo did highest triumph in the overthrow

and slaughter of his men spurs on his horse

and as if from their fall inspir'd with force to their sad ghosts kills frequent sacrifice
there padus labarus and camus dies brennus whom many wounds could scarce destroy and larus that like gorgon turn'd his eye
and there leponticus by cruel fate most fiercely fighting fell for snatching at the consul reins and as he stood upright afoot the horsman equal'd in his height with his sharp sword his head the consul cleaves and it divided on his shoulders leaves
next abbatus that in its furious course endeavour'd with his shield to stop his horse was by a kick struck dead upon the place the beast still trampling on his wounded face
the romane captain through the bloody plain thus raging rides as when th icarian main cold boreas with victorious blasts doth raise from its deep bottom over all the seas in batter'd ships the mariners are tost and in white foam the cyclades are lost
chryxus now seeing hopes of life declin'd and death's approach confirms his valiant mind with a contempt of fate
his horrid beard shin'd with a bloody foam his jaws appear'd all white with froth his locks with flying sand and dust made squallid stiff like bristles stand
thus tarius fiercely he invades who nigh the consul fought and with strong blows doth ply then fells him to the ground for with a spear that his last fate upon its point did bear wounded he tumbles headlong from his steed which mov'd by fear with uncontrouled speed

drags him his legs fast in the stirrop bound

about the field
blood issuing from the wound leaves a long winding tract that with his spear trail'd in his hand doth in the dust appear
the consul prais'd his death and doth prepare to vindicate his ghost when through the air an horrid noise was heard and he descries those shouts commended chryxus whom his eys scarce known before beheld
his anger now grew high and viewing with a troubled brow his with a gentle hand clapping his horse's neck he makes a stand and thus bespeaks him
we as yet have made a vulgar war and to the stygian shade have sent down people of no name at all but my garganus now the gods us call to greater actions
see'st thou not how great chryxus appears to thee i'le dedicate those trappings that with tyrian lustre shine their grace and golden reins shall all be thine
this said he chryxus in the open plain aloud provokes the combate to maintain
his willing enemy the like desire inflames
on either side the troops retire commanded to give way and strait beheld the champions in the lists amidst the field
great as the mimas did appear in the phlegraean plains when heav'n for fear ev'n trembled at his arms from's salvage breast such cruel chryxus here himself exprest with horrid murmuring and to engage his valiant fo with howling whets his rage and thus insulting speaks
do none survive in burnt and captivated rome could give

thee notice what brave hands the progeny

of brennus bring to war now learn of me and as he spake a knotty beam of oak that would have shaken with its weighty stroak a citie's gates he flings
a dreadfull sound it makes and falling vainly tears the ground for having lost his distance by a throw too strong it flew beyond his nearer fo
to him the consul answers take to hell this with thee and remember that thou tell thy how far distant thou didst fall from the tarpeian and say withall it was not lawfull for thee once to view the capitol
and as he spake he threw a jav'lin fitted to destroy so vast a fo which from the thong with vigour cast pierc'd through his cassock's num'rous folds and through his coat of mail which nerves confirm'd into his breast whose depth the weapon wholly drown'd with a vast ruin prostrate on the ground he falls
the suff'ring earth beneath the weight of's arms and body groans and feels his fate
so on the tyrrhene coast the hills that stand oppose the billows that invade the land struck by impetuous storms immanely roar and raving nereus beating on the shore the waves divided by their furious shocks drown in the angry deep the broken rocks
their captain slain the celtae all to flight themselves and hopes commit their courage quite declines
as when on the pyraenean the busie hunter with sagacious skill searching the secret dens to rouze his game from their thick coverts fires the thornes the flame

with silence gathers strength and to the skies·

dark clouds of pitchy smoke aspiring rise then all on fire the hill doth strait appear loud noises fill the woods the beasts for fear and birds forsake their shelter and from far through all the vale the cattle frighted are
when mago saw the celtick troops were gone

and their first

onset which in them alone

is vigorous was lost he strait doth call his countreymen to fight and first of all the who appear on ev'ry side in troops and without reins or bridles ride
now the italians fly and then renew the fight
the tyrians then for fear withdrew and now advance again
these their right wing in circles lead the other bring their left alike in form alternately in globes they fight and when they fly with art avoid the slaughter of the fo
so when the winds from sev'ral quarters blow fierce boreas one way drives the swelling main which eurus meeting tumbles back again and with alternate blasts both furious throw the ocean that obeys them to and fro
at length in tyrian purple shining wrought with gold comes hannibal and with him brought terrour and fear and fury to the field
and soon as he his bright callaiek shield held up and struck a piercing light through all their hopes and valour both together fall
their trembling souls cast off all shame of flight none care to seek a noble death in fight
resolv'd to fly they rather wish to know death by the gaping earth then by the fo

so when a tiger from's cancasean den

descends the fields forsaken are by men and beasts
all as distracted fly for fear and shelter seek while as a conqe'rour he wanders up and down the desart plain and now extends then shuts his jaws again as if some present carcass he did eat and gaping wide doth slaughter meditate
him nor could metabus nor vfens shun though vfens very tall did swiftly run and metabus full speed on fled for metabus was with his lance struck dead and vfens falling on his knees did bleed by's sword so lost his life and praise of speed
then sthenius laurus and collinus dy collinus born in a cold climate nigh the chrystal caves of fusinus and o're that lake by swimming pass'd from either shore
the next companion of their fate that fell was massicus born on that sacred hill that crown'd with fruitfull vines doth bear his name near lyris nurs'd that with a silent stream its course dissembleth and with glitt'ring waves unchang'd by rain the quiet margent laves
but now the heat of slaughter grew so high that they could scarce finde weapons to supply their active rage shields clash on shields and feet on feet do press and as they furious meet encountring close the waving crests that crown'd their helmets mutually their wound
three famous twins all valiant brothers whom sidonian barcè happy in her womb in time of war unto xantippus bare most fiercely fighting in the van appear

their power and wealth in greece their

father's fame

a valiant captain with amycle name and regulus in spartan fetters bound with all that their had renown'd inflam'd their minds in arms to prove their high descent and by their deeds to testifie that they from lacon sprang to visit then the cold taygeta and wars again allai'd through their eurotas sail and see those rites lycurgus were ordain'd by thee
but heav'n and three ausonian brothers who in age and courage equalled the fo sent by aricia from those lofty groves where numa with the nymph his secret loves enjoy'd deny'd they should to sparta go
nor would too impartial fates allow

that they

diana altars should behold

and sacred lakes
for now the fierce and bold clytias eumachus and xantippus proud of's father's name engaged in the croud and heat of all the fight
as when within the libyan plains the lyons do begin a war among themselves their roaring fills the fields and cottages or'e secret hills and pathless rocks th'affrighted moor doth fly his wife endeavouring to suppress the cry o'th tender infant hanging at the teat of her large breast the raging beasts repeat their murmurs and between their bloody jaws crash broken bones while limbs beneath their claws and cruel teeth still fight as if with scorn to seem to yield though from the body torn so the egerian youth fierce virbius here there capys press to fight albanus there

alike in arms him clytias by chance

stooping to shun a blow strikes with his lance quite through the belly
strait his bowels fill'd extruded by his fall his hollow shield
next by stout eumachus was capys slain who as if fix'd endeavour'd to retain his target till a sword from his left side lopp'd off his arm and by the wound he dy'd while his unhappy hand refus'd to yield its hold and stuck unto the falling shield
two of the three thus miserably slain the last great conquest virbius doth remain who as he fain'd to fly xantippus slew with his keen sword and eager to pursue eumachus by his jav'lin likewise falls
and thus the fight by double funerals is equal made
then the survivers dy'd by mutual wounds and lai'd their rage aside
oh happy you whom noble piety urging your fate did thus perswade to dy such brothers future times shall wish to see and your last valiant acts your memory shall crown with honour if our verses live or miserable nephews that survive shall read these monuments your virtues claim and great apollo envy not our fame
but now his troops dispers'd through all the plains the consul with his voice from flight restrains while he could use his voice
whither ye bear those ensigns how are you destroy'd by fear if the first place of battel you affright or you want courage in the front to fight behinde me stand but lay aside your fear and see me fight
their fathers captives were

from whom you fly
what hopes can we pretend

if once subdu'd shall we the alps ascend oh think you see rome whose head her walls do crown submissively now spread her hands while her proud foes her sons enchain daughters are ravish'd and their parents slain
and in their blood me thinks see the fire of holy vesta now alass expire
oh then prevent this sin
thus having said his jaws with dust and clamour weary made his left hand snatching up the reins the right his sword his breast to those that fled the fight he doth oppose now threatens them and then himself to kill unless they turn agen
these armies when from high olympus iove beheld the noble consul dangers move his mind to pitty
then he calls his son the god of war and to him thus begun
my son fear that gallant man's not far from ruin if thou tak'st not up the war
withdraw him full of fury from the fight forgetfull of himself through the delight of slaughter
stop the libyan general who will more glory in the consul fall then all those numbers that he doth destroy

thou seest besides how soon that

warlike boy

his tender hands in battel doth engage and strives by action to transcend his age thinking it tedious to be young in war

thou guiding

him he shall hereafter dare

attempt great things and his first trophie shall be to prevent his noble father's fall
thus iove strait mars from the odrysian field his chariot summons and assumes his shield

which like a gloomy its beams

scatters abroad his helmet too that seems to other deities a weight too great and's that with so much toil and sweat the lab'ring cyclops form'd then shakes his spear stain'd with the blood of titans through the air and with his chariot fills the dusty plain
the dire eumenides and dreadfull train of furies him attend and ev'ry where innumerable forms of death appear while fierce bellona who doth guid the reins whips on his steeds and all delay disdains
then from the troubled heav'n a tempest forth doth break and in dark clouds involves the earth
his entrance ev'n the court of iove doth shake and rivers by his chariots noise forsake their banks and struck with horrour backward fly to their first springs and leave their chanels dry
the garamantian bands now ev'ry where invest with dars the consul and prepare new presents for the tyrian prince the spoils of his rich arms his head through many toils of that sad day bedew'd with sweat and blood
while he not to give way to fortune stood resolv'd and then more fierce with slaughter grown returns the num'rous darts against him thrown
till over all his limbs the blood of foes mix'd with his own in streams diffused flows and then his crest declining in a ring more closely girt the garamantians fling their steeled shafts with nearer aim and all like storms of hail at once about him fall
but when his son perceiv'd a dart to be fix'd in his father's body as if he

had felt the deadly wound his pious tears

bedews his cheeks and paleness strait appears to run o're all his body and with groans that pierce the skies his danger he bemoans
twice he attempted to anticipate by piercing his own breast his father's fate as oft the god of war converts his rage against the fo with whom he doth engage and fearless through the armed squadrons flies and in his furious speed doth equalize the deity his guid
the troops that round his father fight give way and on the ground a tract of blood appears
where er'e he goes protected by the heavenly shield he mows whole squadrons down
on heaps of arms he slew such as oppos'd his rage with him that threw the dart who dy'd before his father's eys with many more as pleasing sacrifice
then snatching from the bones the fixed spear upon his neck from danger he doth bear his fainting sire
the troops at such a sight amazed stand the libyans cease to fight th· iberians all give way
a piety so great in tender years turns ev'ry eye upon him to admire what they beheld and strikes deep silence through the dusty field
then said the god of war thou dido towers hereafter shalt destroy and tyrian powers compell'd by thee a league shall entertain yet never shalt thou greater honour gain then this
go on brave youth go on and prove thy self to be indeed the son of iove
go on for greater things reserved be though better never can be giv'n to thee

this said the sun now stooping to the main

the deity returns to heav'n again involv'd in clouds
darkness the fight decides and in their camps the weary armies hides
but when in her declining wain the night phoebe withdrew and by her brother's light the rosie flames from the eöan main gilded the margent of the skies again the consul fearing that the plain might be a great advantage to the enemy to trebia and the mountains takes his way
and now the winged hours advanc'd the day when with much toil the bridg was broken down o're which the romane army pass'd and thrown into the flood when to the rapid stream of swift eridanus the libyan came seeking by marching round through various waies the fords and where its course the river staies trees from the neighb'ring groves at length he takes and to transport his troops a navy makes
the valiant consul from the antient line

o'th gracchi sprang whose ancestours did shine

in monuments with noble titles crown'd for valour both in peace and war renown'd thither from high pelorus came by sea incamping near the banks of trebia
the carthaginians likewise in the plain the river encamp'd remain encourag'd by success of their affairs while their insulting general prepares their minds and to their fury still doth give fresh fewel
what third consul doth survive in rome said he what other sicily remaineth now in arms against us see

all the italian bands and daunian line

are met
now let the latine princes joyn in league with me now let them laws require
but thou that in the fight unhappy sire ow'st to thy son thy life so may'st thou live may'st thou to him again that honour give may'st thou not dy in war so old tis when fate shall call that must in battel dy
this with high rage express'd he doth advance with his massilian troops and with his lance ev'n at the trenches doth provoke the fo
the latine souldiers scorning thus to ow their safety to their rampires and to hear the gates to eccho with an hostile spear break forth and through the breach before the rest the valiant consul flies
the plumed crest of his bright helmet waving with the wind his cassock stain'd with honour'd blood behind he calls with a loud voice the following bands and where the fo in strongest bodies stands he breaks his way and chargeth through the plain
as when a furious torrent swell'd with rain falling from lofty pindus top doth fill the vallies with a noise as if the hill by some rude tempest were in pieces torn the heards and salvage beasts and woods are born away the foaming waves o're all prevail and pass with roaring through the stony dale

could like the maeonian

prophet sing

or would apollo to assist me bring an hundred voices could not declare what slaughter here the consul made what there the libyan fury acted
hannibal murranus and the romane general

phalantus old in labours and for skill

in war all famous hand to hand did kill
from anxur stormy cliffs murranus from tritonis did phalantus come
but when by his illustrious habit shown the consul was engag'd cupentus one depriv'd of half his sight that with one eye pursu'd the war assaults him suddenly and fixeth in the margent of his shield his trembling lance
the consul him beheld with boiling rage now villain lay aside said he what ever mischief thou dost hide beneath thy ugly and deformed brow
and as he spake with aim directly through his glaring eye he thrusts his fatal spear
no less incens'd doth hannibal appear by whom in silver arms unfortunate varrenus fell varrenus whom of late fertile fulginia wealthy fields with gain enrich'd and wandring in the open plain his curled bulls as white as alpine snow

return'd from cold

clitumnus stream but now

the gods were angry and those victimes prove nourish'd in vain which for tarpeian iove with so much care by him were fed before
then light iberians with the nimble moor advance
here piles there libyan arrows fly so thick from either side they hide the sky and all the space between the river's shore and with darts is cover'd o're
so thick they stand the wounded have no room to fall and dy
there allius that from argyripa through daunian fields with rude unpolish'd shafts his flying game pursu'd

was born into the midst of all his foes

upon his iapygian steed and throws not vainly his darts his breast the skins of rough samnitick bears invest instead of steel his head an helmet wore fenc'd with the tushes of an aged boar
but him thus active as if he had bin then following the chase of beasts within the gargan woods when mago here espy'd there bold maharbal they on either side charge him
as bears more fierce by hunger made from sev'ral rocks a trembling bull invade their fury not permitting them to share their prey with leisure so both here and there gainst allius discharged weapons flew
at length through both his sides the libyan yew doth singing pierce into his trembling heart and death remain'd ambiguous to which dart it should give way for both together there as in their center met
now full of fear the romane troops with scatter'd ensigns fly whom to the banks the libyan furiously a sight of pitty wandring up and down pursues and in the river strives to drown
then trebia to their ruin doth conspire and raising at saturnia desire his fatal waves begins a second war against the weary vanquished who are by earth that shrank beneath them where they stood devour'd and cover'd by the treach'rous flood
nor could they from the thick tenacious mire if once engag'd their weary limbs retire but stand as bound and fix'd within the mud untill o'rewhelm'd by the deceitfull flood

or ruins of the hollow banks some fall

while others through the slippery places crawl and seek through the inextricable shore their several ways to safety
but as or'e the rotten bogs they fly and ruin think to shun by their own weight oppress'd they sink
here one swims swiftly and now near the land snatching the tops of rushes in his hand to raise himself above the flood again nail'd by a jav'lin to the bank is slain another having lost his weapon fast within his arms his strugling fo embrac't and in one fate both joyn'd together dy'd
death in a thousand shapes on ev'ry side appears
there wounded ligus backward fell upon the shore and as the flood doth swell with heaps of bodies and his visage laves he sucks in with his sighs the bloody waves
but scarce did fair hirpinus swim and beckned to the rest to follow him when carryed by the stream's impetuous force and gaul'd with many wounds his horse obeys the torrent till with labour tir'd under prevailing waves they both expir'd
yet still these miseries encrease for as the towred elephants attempt to pass into the flood with violence they fell as when a rock torn from its native hill by tempest falls into the angry main and trebia afraid to entertain such monstrous bodies flies before their breast or shrinks beneath them with their weight opprest but as adversity man's courage tries and fearless valour doth to honour rise

through danger stout fibrenus doth disclaim

a death ignoble or that wanted fame and cries my fate shall be observ'd nor shall fortune beneath these waters hide my fall
i'le try if earth doth any living bear which the ausonian sword and tyrrhen spear cannot subdue and kill
with that he prest his lance into the right eye of the beast that with blind rage the penetrating blow pursu'd and tossing up his mangled brow besmear'd with reeking blood with horrid cries turns round and from his fallen master flies
then with their darts and frequent arrows all invade him and now dare to hope his fall
his immense shoulders and his sides appear one wound entire his dusky back doth bear innumerable shafts that like a wood still waving as he mov'd upon him stood till in so long a fight their weapons all consum'd he fell death hasting through his fall
but now although a wound which by the way an adverse hand inflicted did delay his speed a while implacable with rage within the river scipio doth engage
and with unnumbred slaughters doth infest the enemy while trebia seems opprest with targets helmets and with bodies slain and scarce doth any vacant space remain to see the water
there mazêus by his lance there gostar by his sword doth dy
then against telgon who from pelops sprung and in cyrene dwelt a pile he flung snatch'd from the stained torrent and within his gaping mouth fix'd the whole steel
his chin

now falls against his teeth the trembling wood

rebounds with noise and sudden streams of blood together with his life flow from the wound yet after death no rest his body found for trebia it eridanus conveys eridanus it tumbles to the seas
with him and others lapsus likewise dy'd to whom the fates a sepulchre deny'd
what then avail'd his rich hesperides or groves by nymphs frequented what his trees that bearing gold extend their shining boughs but trebia swelling from the bottom throws his curling waves unlocketh all his springs and all his forces with fresh fury brings the billows roar aloud and as they fly still a new torrent doth their place supply
the general perceiving this his blood with greater fury boils
perfidious flood said he severely shalt thou punish'd be for this thy insolence
i'le scatter thee in lesser streams through all the gallick coast untill the name of river thou hast lost
i'le choak thee in thy birth nor shalt thou flow through this thy chanel to the banks of po
what sudden rage is this doth thee invade and thee sidonian of a latine made him boasting thus the waters in a heap assail and on his lofty shoulders leap
himself against their rage he doth oppose and with his shield sustains their furious throws
behind the surges thicker come and cover his plum'd helmet with their foam
that he should farther wade the god deny'd while from his feet the slipp'ry earth doth slide

the angry billows now begin a war

among themselves and striking rocks afar diffuse the noise through all the neighb'ring coast and in the fight his banks the river lost
then lifting up his streaming locks his brow impail'd with said he dost thou so proudly threaten thy revenge on me and that the name of trebia shall be by thee extinguish'd oh thou enemy to this my empire see what bodies do bear that by thy fatal hand were slain such heaps of shields and helmets here remain that they my waters from my chanel force and i'me constrain'd to leave my former course
thou see'st how deep with slaughter they are stain'd and backward flie
restrain thy killing hand and pitch thy camp within this neighb'ring field
this cytherea from an hill beheld and near her vulcan who themselves did shroud from mortal eyes within an airy cloud
but scipio sighing lifteth to the skies his hands and saith ye gods whose auspicies have hitherto preserv'd dardanian rome must at length a sacrifice become to such a death preserv'd by you of late in so great fights is it above my fate to fall by fortune oh deliver me again my son unto the enemy that may dy in battel and my end unto my brothers and to rome commend
griev'd with this language venus sigh'd and all her husband's fury on the flood lets fall
o're all the banks the active flames appear dispersed and the streams that many a year

had there been nourish'd by the aged flood

most furiously devour
the neighb'ring wood doth likewise burn and through the highest groves

vulcan an uncontrouled conqu'rour moves

now lose their arms the lofty pines and alders sink the poplar too declines and from their standing trunks those branches fell where quires of chanting birds were wont to dwell
ev'n from the bottom of the troubled flood the fire licks up the waters dries the blood late shed upon the banks
the parched earth as when rash phaëton to prove his birth did fire the world with heat excessive cleaves and heaps of ashes on the waters leaves
father eridanus now thinks it strange that his eternal course so soon doth change the nymphs their liquid caves with mournfull cries now fill and as the flood endeavour'd thrice to raise his scorched head the god of fire throwing a lamp constrain'd him to retire beneath his smoaking waves and thrice his head of reeds deprives at length as vanquished and weak submitting to his conqu'ring fo twas granted in his former banks to flow
scipio and gracchus then from trebia all their troops unto a fenced hill recall
but hannibal the river doth adore and with much honour sprinkles near the shore

his

social waters on the holy grass

not knowing how much greater things alass the gods would act
what woes for italy were thrasimenus then prepar'd by thee
not long before flaminius did invade the boii and an easie conquest made

over that nation weak and void of all

deceit
but to contend with hannibal requir'd more toil more vigilance and skill
him fatal to his countrey and with ill presages born saturnia prepares as general while italie affairs sadly declin'd a man most worthy all the mischief that did on his countrey fall
for in the first day that he took in hand the helm of state and th army did command as mariners unskilfull to convey a beaten ship through a tempestuous sea obey the winds and leave to ev'ry blast or wave the wandring vessel which at last is driven by the pilot's art less hands on rocks or else is swallow'd up in sands so with rash arms flaminius doth invade the lydians and those mansions sacred made

by antient

corythus arrival there

and the maeonian colonies that were joyn'd to italian by their blood and in the catalogue of kindred stood
nor did the gods neglect to advertise the libyan captain of an enterprize that to his name such honour might produce
for when that sleep o're all the world his of poppy had diffus'd and with his wings had cover'd o're the tedious care of things
iuno the figure of the neighb'ring flood assumes and as he slept before him stood the dangling tresses on her watry brow encompass'd with a wreathed
with sudden cares she dives into his breast and with this pow'rfull language breaks his rest

oh hannibal most happy in thy fame

and unto italy a fatal name who if th ausonian land had giv'n thee birth

might'st with the gods when thou forsak'st the earth

hereafter be enthron'd
while yet we may and fates permit us banish all delay the great success which fortune doth allow not long endures
go on the blood which thou didst to thy father promise when the war gainst rome before the altar thou didst swear shall from ausonian bodies flow to thee and thou thy father's ghost shalt satisfie with slaughter and to me securely pay deserved honours
therefore now obey for that thrasimenus am that by the bands from tmolus sent encompass'd ly beneath high hills and reign in shady streams
by this advice excited from his dreams his army which the deity doth fill with courage strait he leadeth to the hill
high apenninus who his joyns unto the stars surcharg'd with lofty pines was cover'd then with ice
among the steep and slipp'ry rocks all trees in snow as deep as is his height were hid and to the skies his hoary head with frost congeal'd did rise
here he commands them on for having cross'd the alps all former glory had been lost and quite extinguish'd had they made a stand at other mountains therefore they ascend those broken cliffs whose tops the clouds invest perpetually with showrs
nor did they rest when once that labour they had overcome but strait descend into the plains that swum

with thawing ice and where in moorish ground

the cold unfrozen waters did abound in these unwholsome fens the gen'ral bare

uncover'd

head was shaken by the air

and on his bloodless cheeks his melting eye in tears descends
while scorning remedy he thinks the time of battel is to be purchas'd with any danger
therefore he disdains the beauty of his face to spare so he may have his ends nor doth he care to part with other limbs if victory may be the price and thinks his single eye enough if so a conquerour he may behold the capitol or any way subdue a fo that bears the romane name
through all these miseries at length he came unto the lake where for his loss of sight he kills unnumbred piacles in fight
but now behold from tyrian carthage sent ambassadours arrive
the first intent and motive of their journey was of weight yet could they nothing of content relate
it was a custome mong those people where exil'd elisa first her walls did rear the favour of the angry gods to seek

with humane slaughter and what ev'n to speak

is horrour on their flaming altars burn their tender sons
those lots an annual urn reviv'd the bloody rites to imitate of thoantêan dian to this fate and lot of heav'n as custome was inspir'd of old with malice hanno then requir'd the son of hannibal although the fear of his return and arms did then appear

as present for revenge to other eyes

mov'd by this dire demand with mournfull cries tearing her hair and cheeks imilce fills the town
as when on the pangaean hills

edonian froes their

treiterian feast

perform and bacchus reigns in ev'ry breast
imilce so among the tyrian dames as if she saw her son amidst the flames cries iö husband in what part soe're o'th world thou wagest war oh hither bear thine ensigns here here is an enemy more violent more near
thou happily ev'n at the of rome receivest now darts flying in thy target or dost throw a burning lamp tarpeian tow'rs to fire
in the mean time thy son thy onely heir ev'n from the bosom of thy countrey to the stygian altar's drag'd
whilst thou dost go to wast ausonian houses with thy sword tread in forbidden paths break that accord that league which once by all the gods was sworn these dire rewards doth carthage now return for thy deserts such honours unto thee ingratefull shee decrees
what piety is this the temples thus with humane blood to stain alass had mortals understood the nature of the gods this horrid crime had ne're been known
go and at such a time with holy frankincense just things desire of heav'n and let those cruel rites expire
the gods to men are mild let it suffice pray that we fat oxen sacrifice or if the gods resolve that this decree shall stand to your desires accept of me

me that have born him why should you deprive

libya of those great hopes that in him live why should aegates more lamented be or if the punick kingdoms we should see now sinking then the sad untimely fall of this brave of my hannibal this speech the senate wav'ring twixt a fear of gods and men invited to forbear their sentence and to her twas left to chuse whether she would the killing lot refuse or else the honour of the gods obey
at this imilce trembled ev'ry way with fear distracted there her husband's ire she apprehends and there the fatal fire
this heard with greedy ears the general replies dear carthage what can hannibal though equal to the gods return to thee worthy such favours what can be invented day and night arms will bear and make that to thy temples rome repair with gen'rous victimes that their blood derive from her quirinus

silius italicus of the second punick vvar
the fifth book

the argument
flaminius rash valour at the lake of thrasimenus
the sidonians take the hills for ambush prodigies foreshow before the fight the roman overthrow
both armies while an earthquake overthrew cities and rivers turn'd the fight pursue
but the sicilian troops that basely fly the field and climb the trees for safety dy together by sichaeus whose sad fall soon after by flaminius slain by all the libyans is bewail'd
scout appius kill'd by mago whom he wounds what slaughters fill'd all quarters how flaminius bravely dy'd whose corps the romanes slain about him hide

now hannibal preparing for the fight with secret ambush in the dead of night the mountains of hetraria did invest and all the passes of the woods possest
on the left hand there was a lake that swell'd like a vast sea and all the neighb'ring field

cover'd with tenacious slime

here faun aunus reign'd in antient time but now tis known by thrasimenus name

whose sire

tyrrhenus lydian tmolus fame

to the italian coasts that since do bear his name maeonian colonies from far by sea did bring and is by all renown'd for having taught those nations first to sound the trumpet and their silence broke in fight
yet not content with this he doth excite his son to greater things but fir'd with love of the fair boy who with the gods above for beauty might compare now chaste no more

agylle snatch'd him walking on the shore

into the stream
this nymph lascivious minde was still to love of beauteous boys inclin'd and the italian darts soon warm'd her breast but him the carefull naiades carest within their mossy caves while he the place abhors and seeks to shun their fond embrace
from hence the lake a dowry to his fame still conscious of his rape retains his name
and now the chariot of the dewy night its bounds approach'd although the morn her light not yet from her bright chambers did display but from the threshold onely breath'd a ray and men could less affirm that night had run her course then that the day its race begun when through the consul march'd before his ensigns after him the horse no more in order haste next in confusion go the bands the foot disorder'd too forsake their ranks with them though us'd in war unfit for fight the sutlers mixed are

and ominous tumults through all places spread

advancing to the fight as if they fled
while from the lake a vapour black as night arose and quite depriving them of sight in a dark mantle of condensed clouds involves the skies and day desired shrouds

but

hannibal pursues his fraud the while

and in his ambush closely sitting still would not permit them in their haste to be oppos'd while all the shore appeareth free from danger and neglected by the fo who to their fall permits them on to go
for they advancing through a narrow way before design'd their safety to betray a double ruin found
the waters here contract their passage there steep rocks appear and on the mountain's top within the wood engage them there a libyan party stood ready to fall on any that should to a retreat
so when a fisher by a chrystal brook an osier weel doth twine the entrance large he makes but binds within the tonnel close contracting by degrees the yielding tops into a pyramis through which deceitfull hole the fish with ease do enter but return not to the seas
in the mean time the furious consul lost his reason in this storm of fates in haste he calls his ensigns on untill from sea the sun's bright horses the day and rosie titan to revive the world the clouds that o're the face of heav'n were hurl'd had quite dispers'd and sensibly to hell by his clear rays resolv'd the darkness fell

and then a bird which as an old

presage

the latines us'd before they did engage in fight he took explore the gods intent and what should be the following fight's event
the bird divining future miseries refus'd her meat and from it crying flies
with that a bull a sad presage before the holy altars ceased not to roar and waving with his neck the fatal stroak o'th falling ax the sacred place forsook
besides as they endeavour'd where they stood to pull their ensigns up the earth black blood into their faces spouts as to foretell that slaughter which them afterwards befell
then iove the sea and land with thunder shook and snatching bolts from aetna forges strook the thrasenian lake that smoaking seems to burn and flames to live within the streams
oh lost admonishments and prodigies that strive in vain to stop the destinies ev'n gods themselves must with the fates dispence
and here corvin fam'd for eloquence and of a noble name whose helmet bore thy bird apollo that did long before

the valour of his

declare

full of the gods and troubled at the fear of his companion intermingled than with counsel pray'rs and with these words began by the iliack flames the fate of rome our countrie's walls and by our sons that from this fight's event the fates as yet suspend yield to the gods we pray thee and attend a time more fortunate for battel they a field will give thee and a better day

onely disdain not thou expect the more

propitious gods and that more happy hour which shall for libya destruction call and when not forc'd as now our ensigns all shall follow when our birds shall gladly feed and pious earth no more so strangely bleed
how much is left to fortune in this place skilfull in war thou know'st
before our face the fo appears those woody hills now threat an ambush on the left hand no retreat the lake allows the pass is narrow too between those hills
it's wisdom then in you with stratagems to strive and fight delay untill with fresh supplies servilius may arrive that with you in command doth share and's forces in the legions equal are
the war with policy we must pursue to th fighting man the least of honour's due
corvinus thus exhorts the captains were no less importunate and all with fear divided
sometimes for flaminius pray unto the gods then him intreat obey the pow'rs divine and not their will oppose
with that his kindled fury higher rose and hearing full of rage that new supplies would soon be there saw you not me he cries when in the boian war charg'd and when so great a ruin and such dreadfull men came on that the tarpeian rock again did tremble then what multitudes were slain by me how then this vengefull hand the ground bestrew'd with bodies which the deepest wound could scarce destroy yet were they forc'd to yield and now their scatter'd bones oppress the field

therefore servilius arms may come too late

to this brave action if you think not that cannot overcome unless share my triumphs and contented am to bear a part of honour but the gods do seem advise us otherwise
oh do not dream you that now fear the trumpets sound of gods so like your selves
our trusty swords are odds and augury enough against the fo
the best presage the romane souldiers know is that in feats of arms they do excell must it be then resolv'd that sit still corvinus basely thus within a vale besieg'd while the sidonians do prevail against arretia walls and levell to the ground the tow'r of corythus and go thence to clusinum and at length may come untouch'd unto the very walls of rome vain superstition a deformity in men of arms valour alone should be the goddess that should o're their souls command
troops of sad ghosts by night about us stand whose corps are tumbled still in trebia waves and swift eridanus and want their graves
thus having said without delay he quits th assembly and inexorable fits his last unhappy arms a hide his helmet lines and on the top its pride a triple crest ascends and largely a main the locks resembling of the swedes above was scylla waving in her hand a broken oar and dogs about her stand with gaping jaws
this noble trophie he gain'd near garganus and the victory

so pleas'd him having flain the boian king

that fitted to his head he us'd to bring this as his glory into ev'ry fight
then takes his coat of mail whose scales were knit to chains of steel and studded o're with gold
next he assumes his shield where they behold the stains of celtick blood which he before in battel shed and in it carv'd he bore a figure in her gloomy den licking a child's soft limbs as it had been her whelp and nurs'd of the assarick line

a stem that afterwards was made

divine

at last he girds his sword and to's right hand makes fit his lance
hard by doth ready stand his horse which cover'd with a tiger's hide champs on his frothy bit with pleasing pride
then mounted where the way between the hills was streight thus with encouragement he fills his men
your work and honour it will be dear to let your parents see fix'd on a spear and born with joy through all the streets of rome the head of hannibal
that head may satisfie for all the rest let each man therefore fancy in his breast what may excite his rage and thus deplore my brother now upon ticinus shore unburyed lyes
alass my son through all the po now swims and wants a funeral
thus to himself let ev'ry man prepare revenge but as to you who have no share of private grief let those great things which fire a publick soul enflame your greater ire
think they have broken through the alpine hills and then remember those nefandous ills

sagunthus suffer'd what a sin it was

in them iberus sacred bounds to pass and now ev'n tyber touch
for while in vain with birds and entrails augurs you detain it onely wanteth now that he invade the capitol
this when he eager said and seeing that his horse amidst the croud of thousands rais'd his cloudy mane aloud he cries to fight my orphitus must prove thy task
what other to feretrian iove opimous off'rings can in triumph bare for why should any hand this honour share with me then moves and hearing a known voice in fight far hence said he that martial noise shews thee to be murranus and thee already high in tyrian slaughter see
how great a praise attends thee but pray let thy sword wider make that narrow way
then knowing born upon soracte hill aequanus who in beauty did excell and arms the customs of whose countrey were the entrails thrice through harmless flames to bear when as the pious archer did desire to offer sacrifice in holy fire noble aequanus may'st thou ever so

unburnt on phoebus flaming

altars go

and conquering the smoak so ev'ry year to the pleas'd god said he thy offering bear
worthy thy deeds and wounds conceive a rage accompanied by thee dare engage to penetrate through the marmarick bands or charge cinyphian troops
with that he stands no longer to advise or to delay with words that fight which by the romanes may

be

long deplor'd
the signal ev'rywhere

is and fatal trumpets rend the air
oh grief oh tears which in so long descent of ages cannot now too late be spent tremble as if now those mischeifs all were acted as if libyans hannibal and arm'd asturians from their hills did bring or the fierce balearick with his sling
now num'rous troops of macians nomades and garamantians sally forth with these the warlike stout cantabrians then whom with mercenary hands none sooner come to fight or hired arms more gladly bear and gascoins too that helmets scorn to wear
on this side horrid rocks on that the lake here clashing arms with the loud shouts they make amaze and urge beside the signal from the tyrian camp through all the hills doth come
the gods their faces turning from the field unwillingly to greater fates do yield
ev'n mars thy fortune hannibal doth fear sad venus weepeth with dishevel'd hair apollo to his delos doth retire and strives to ease his grief with mournfull lyre
iuno alone on appeninus stood expecting slaughter hating trojan blood
but as if forcing heaven and free from fear in their own hands th incensed souldiers bear predestin'd piacles and kill again fresh sacrifice in fight to those were slain
first the picenian bands when they beheld the cohorts dissipated and repell'd and hannibal advancing furiously charge him with courage and before they dy

amaze the conquerour whom they invade

to see the slaughters that their valour made
for now with one consent and force a showr of piles upon the libyan troops they pour and when repuls'd their fixed targets all press'd with the weight of crooked shafts let fall
this with their gen'ral presence doth excite the libyans rage who mutually to fight exhort each other and so closely prest upon their foes they fought them breast to breast
her torch bellona shaking through the air and springkling with much blood her flaming hair through both the armies up and down doth flee and· from her horrid breast tisiphone a deadly murmur sends while to engage the fatal trumpets all their minds enrage
these by their adverse fortune and despair of future safety animated are them more propitious gods and victory smiling upon them with a joyfull eye encourage favour'd by the god of war
but lateranus while entic'd too far with love of slaughter furious on he goes at length engaged stood among his foes when lentulus of equal age him spy'd too much with fight and blood on ev'ry side oppress'd and midst an army to provoke the fates with a brisk charge to aid him broke through all the ranks and baga then about to wound him in the back though fierce and stout prevented with his spear and doth attend the fate and hard adventures of his friend
with chearfull courage now their arms they joyn their fronts and crests with equal glory shine

when syrticus by chance for who durst move

arms against them unless by stygian iove condemn'd to dy descending from the hill arm'd with a broken oak upon them fell and as the weighty tree about he waves with thirst of both their deaths thus vainly raves
not here fond youths aegates nor a coast treach'rous to seamen nor the ocean tost by tempests shall on you bestow fortune without a war
you now shall know that once were conquerours at sea by land what libyan warriours are nor us withstand within a better empire
as he spoke at lateranus with the pond'rous oak he strikes and fighting rails when lentulus gnashing his teeth for anger meets him thus
sooner shall thrasimenus raise his flood to those high hills then in his pious blood that thy pernicious tree thou shalt imbrue
and as he stretch'd himself to strike quite through his body pierc'd him through the gaping wound the reeking gore flows largely to the ground
no less in other quarters of the field imcens'd to mutual wounds their fury swell'd
by tall hiertes nereus fell and by rullus brave volunx rich in land doth dy nor riches heap'd nor palaces that shin'd with's countrey's ivory to which were joyn'd his vassal villages could now withhold his fate
what boots extorted wealth· or gold which men with thirst insatiable pursue whom fortune richly did of late endue with her most wealthy gifts is naked now by charon wafted to the shades below

there warlike appius though but young in years

great in attempts the field with slaughter clears and where of greatest strength and valour none else durst aspire there honour he alone atchieves
him atlas meeting atlas who sprang from iberian blood did vainly plow remotest sands thrusts at his face a lance the top whereof as it doth lightly glance and raze the skin tasteth his noble blood
like thunder now or a flood he threats
new flames within his furious eyes are kindled mad like lightning then he flies through all th opposing troops his wound that sends blood from beneath his cask the rest commends of his stout martial limbs then might you see the trembling youth contending as they flee to hide themselves
as when th affrighted deer an hircan tiger follows or with fear doves fly the tow'ring hawk or as the hare when she beholds the eagle in the air ready to stoop to covert runs with speed here with his sword he lops off atlas head
and his right hand then raging· on doth go charging more furious by success his fo
for arm'd with a bright ax and in the sight of's father mago to engage in fight ambitious big with hopes of praise there stood cinyphian isalces vainly proud of promis'd nuptials when the romane war should ended be
but appius sets a bar to these his hopes and with such fury came against him that as he his ax with aim directed at his face so strong a stroak fierce appius rising higher gave he broke

his sword upon his cask
isalces too

upon his tget gives as vain a blow
with that a stone which had not anger lent him sength he could not lift now almost spent at's fo stout appius throws it's weighty fall him backward fells and breaks his bones withall
when mago saw him fall for near at hand he fought he wept beneath his helmet and groaning with rage came on
th alliance late by them contracted and the nephews that he thence expected fire his thoughts the more
but as with nearer view he doth explore appius his shield large members and the raies of's helmet· him a while that sight delays
as when a from a shady hill in haste descends his hungry gorge to fill he stands and soon contracts his speed if he within the plain a bull approaching see though with long hunger press'd he views his high thick neck admires his threatning eye beneath a rugged brow while he prepares for fight and earth to give the signal tears
first appius spoke as he a jav'lin threw if thou hast any piety pursue thy contract and accompany thy son in death
with that the flying weapon run quite through his brazen arms untill it struck his left arm and in it deep wounding stuck
the libyan return of words forbore
but with his spear which hannibal before sagunthus walls a conquerour had ta'ne from noble durius there in battel slain and to his brother gave which with delight he a brave trophie bore in ev'ry fight

charg'd him
grief lending force the through

his cask and mouth inflicts a deadly blow and as he strove to draw it from the wound his hands soon bloodless fell
upon the ground appius a name through the sea renown'd a great part of rome ruin lay
and in his bloody mouth expiring there crush'd and with murm'ring bites the fatal spear
the lake then trembled from his body dead with waves contracted thrasimenus fled
next with no better fates mamercus dyes and wounded falls by all his enemies
for where the lusitanian cohorts fought gain'd with much blood and valour as he brought a standard whose stout bearer he had slain and call'd his flying again his foes at what they saw him do what ever in their hands was missile threw and likewise all that earth then cover'd o're with darts and spears afforded like a shour of hail upon him falls and greater store of darts no single romane felt before
thus stout mamercus fell and at his fall vex'd at his brother's hurt came hannibal and raging ask'd when he the wound espy'd now him then his companions if his side the spear had pierc'd or if within the wound twere fix'd but when no fear of death he nor danger from the field he strait was sent cover'd with his own coat into his tent within the camp and free from trouble there for cure all med'cinal arts prepared were by learned synalus who did infuse bathing the wound throughout the healing juice

of choicest herbs and with a secret charm

the weapon strait extracted from his arm him with a crooked snake to sleep compell'd all other synalus in skill excell'd and for it was through all the neighb'ring land

and cities fam'd o'th

paretonian sand

to synalus his of old those secrets garamantick hammon told and how the bitings of wild beasts to heal and deepest wounds of weapons did reveal
he those celestial gifts while yet he liv'd transmitted to his son who them deriv'd to th honour of his heir whom synalus as great in fame succeeds and studious his garamantick secrets to improve as a companion once to horned iove with many images his line deduc'd
now when he brought those gifts divine in haste as custom was his garments round tuck'd up with water first he purg'd the wound from blood
but mago thinking on the spoils and death of his slain fo his brother's toils and cares with words of courage thus allaies and eas'd his own mishaps with thoughts of praise
cease from thy fears dear brother to my wound no greater remedy can now be found great appius by me compell'd is gone to th shades below and we enough have done since he is dead willingly can go to hell it self after so brave a fo
but when the consul from an hill beheld that this the libyan captain from the field had troubled turn'd that in their trenches they as if the clouds of war were vanish'd lay

with sudden fury for his horse he calls

and from the hill descending fiercely falls upon the trembling files which now grown thin he routs and in the valley doth begin the fight again
as when the clouds above surcharg'd with ratling hail dissolve and iove mixing his thunder with their torrent shakes the alps and high ceraunian rocks and makes the world thus mov'd the earth the sea the air to tremble and ev'n hell it self to fear so like a sudden tempest from the hill the consul on the frighted lybians fell
the sight of him chill horrour strikes into their bones while he through thickest ranks doth go
and with his sword cuts out a spacious way
with that confused cries to heav'n convey the fury of the fight and strike the stars
as when the angry seas against the bars of hercules do beat and roaring waves throws into lofty calpe hollow caves the mountain groans and as with furious shocks the foaming billows break against the rocks tartessos though far distant thence by land and lixus that by no small sea doth stand divided thence at once the eccho share
by a swift dart that silent through the air had pass'd before the rest doth bogus fall bogus who at ticinus first of all against the rutuli his jav'lin flung and vainly thought that clotho would prolong his thread of life and that a num'rous line of nephews he should see by the false sign of flying birds deceiv'd
but none have power by augury to remove the fatal hour

mid'st storms of darts he falls and to the skies

lifting in vain his dim and bleeding eyes o'th gods misunderstood as he expires the promises of longer life requires
neither could bagasus then boast in fight that he unpunish'd in the consul sight had conquer'd libo strip'd who vainly there the lawrel of his ancestours did wear
but a massilian sword lops off his head and on his cheeks as down began to spread the barb'rous souldier by untimely death suppress'd his rising years
yet his last breath did not in vain implore flaminius aid for strait by him his fo was headless made as pleas'd that after his example by the same sad death the conquerour should dy
what god muses aptly can rehearse so many funerals or who in verse worthy such noble shades lament their fall or tell how there the early youth did all contend in death for honour or what then ev'n in the porch of death more aged men perform'd what courage of unconquer'd hearts they shew'd when as their breasts were fill'd with darts on either side as furious they engage they frequent fell nor would their eager rage allow them time to spoil or thoughts of prey which their desire of slaughter takes away
the consul while within the camp the fo the wound of mago kept now darts doth throw then us'd his sword and mounted on his horse through myriads of men his way doth force sometimes afoot before the eagles goes while blood the fatal valley overflows

with num'rous streams and th hollow rocks and hills

the noise of horse and arms with eccho fills
marmarick othrys in the field among the rest advanc'd to fight
his body strong above all humane strength the very sight of his gigantick members turn'd to flight the trembling wings his shoulders largely spread above both armies rais'd his lofty head
rude like an horse's mane his tresses hung upon his lowring brows his beard as long o're shadowing his mouth his squallid breast the horrid bristles of a boar exprest
scarce any dare look on him or come near to fight him
like a monster ev'ry where he rangeth through the field from danger free till turning his fierce looks on those that flee a cretan arrow mounting to the skies with silent wings in one of's glaring eyes doth falling fix and turneth him aside from the pursuit
which when the consul spy'd he lanceth at his back as he retreats towards the camp a dart that penetrates breaking his naked ribs his body through and in his bristled breast the head doth shew
to draw it forth with hast he labours where the fatal shining point did first appear till the blood largely flowing to the ground he fell and crush'd the weapon in the wound
his last breath waving through the field doth rear the dust and heaves a cloud into the air
in the mean time a diff'rent war the hills the woods and cliffs with various slaughter fills the rocks and thorns as dy'd with blood appear
the cause of their destruction and their fear

sychaeus was who at a distance slew

murranus with a lance then whom none knew in time of peace more sweetly with his quill to touch orphaean nerves or had more skill
in a vast wood he fell and ev'n in death look'd for the aequanian hills where first his breath he drew in wine most fertile and for fair surentum where the zephyrs purge the air
to his sad fate conqu'ring sychaeus joyn'd another's fall and in that new sad kind of cruel fight rejoyc'd
for while into the wood tauranus rashly did pursue the stragling fo too far engag'd as he secur'd his back against an aged tree from blows and vainly his companions calls with his last breath he by sychaeus falls and piercing through his body in the wood behind him fix'd the tyrian jav'lin stood
but what did you unto your selves prepare what anger of the gods what sad despair your minds possess'd who quitting fight did fly to arms of trees for your security fear in distress'd affairs adviseth still the worst and whensoe're th event is ill it argues want of courage
in the wood it's branches to the skies extending stood an aged tree which high above the rest into the highest clouds aspiring prest its shady head and had it stood within an open field as it a grove had been to a most large extent the dark'ned ground had cover'd with its shade
near that they found an oak which there through many ages grown endeavour'd to the stars its mossie crown

to raise and from its spreading trunk did fill

the arms with leaves and shadow'd all the hill
hither the cohorts sent from sicily not daring to prevent their infamy by death and yielding up their minds to fear contend with speed to fly and climbing there the wav'ring boughs with their uncertain weight oppress'd and all contending to be at the safest place some shaken from their stand fall to the ground by rotten branches and the aged tree deceiv'd some trembling hung still on the top among the darts were flung against them by the fo untill resolv'd that in one ruin all should be involv'd at once sychaeus lai'd his shield aside his weapons chang'd and strait an ax imploy'd late sharp'ned for the fight
with him the rest hasten the work and all the tree invest which now through frequent blows declining cracks aloud and as the weakned body shakes th unhappy troop upon it to and fro are tott'ring toss'd
so when the zephyrs blow upon an antient grove the birds that there on the weak tops of trees their nests prepare are toss'd and made the sport of ev'ry blast
o'recome with many blows the oak at last their most unhappy sanctuary doth fall and in its spacious ruin crush'd them all
then doth another face of death appear that tree that to their slaughter was so near shines and is seis'd by active flames among the leaves and branches dry and growing strong vulcan his globes of furious fire doth turn to ev'ry side and highest boughs doth burn

nor do the libyans cease their darts to cast

while bodies by fire imbrac'd the burning arms and with them groaning fell
but amidst this destruction sad to tell the incens'd consul came and busied all his thoughts on rage and fierce sychaeus fall
the danger of so great an enemy prompts the brave youth his fate again to try with's lance which lightly on the brazen brim of's shield he plac'd thereby to hinder him to pass through that defence the consul loath to trust the fortune of sychaeus death to missile weapons with his sword advanc'd and maugre his thick shield so deeply lanc'd his side he fell expiring to the ground upon his face
death entring at the wound with stygian cold through ev'ry part doth creep his eyes composing to eternal sleep
while thus the god of war himself applies to enterchanges of sad tragedies mago and hannibal the camp forsake and in their speedy march their ensigns take along most eager to repair the time that they were absent by a greater crime of blood and slaughter with their furious pace the troops advancing raise in ev'ry place thick clouds of dust like whirlwinds to the skies and with the sand the field doth seem to rise and wheresoe're the gen'ral bends his course like a strong tempest with impetuous force through the vast air it swells and highest hills covers with horrid darkness
here he kills valiant fontanus wounded in the thigh there pierc'd quite though the throat stout bucca by

his spear was slain the point through th wound appears

in's neck behind

fregella him with tears

bewail'd renowned for's antient descent

th other his fair

anagnia did lament

like fate levinus thee befell although thou didst not choose the tyrian king thy fo but with hiremon who then led the light autololes contend'st in single fight whom wounded in the knee and prostrate while thou dost keep down and vainly seek to spoil with cruel force an heavy jav'lin broke thy ribs thy body by the fatal stroke with sudden ruin on thy prostrate fo doth fall and both in death together go
nor were the sidicinian cohorts then wanting in valour these a thousand men stout viridasius arm'd whose skill did yield to none to guid a ship or pitch a field none sooner could with batt'ring rams prevail gainst walls or sooner highest tow'rs could scale
him when the libyan general beheld with the successes of his valour swell'd for he avaricus not trusting to his arms and by him hurt did then pursue his anger rising higher at that sight he thought him worthy with himself to fight and from avaricus as he withdrew his wounding spear upon him fiercely flew and piercing deep into his breast said he prais'd be thy valour whosoe're thou be tis pitty thou by other hands should'st fall
the honour thus to dy by hannibal bear to the shades below and were not thou born of italian blood thy life should now

be spar'd next him he fabius slew and bold

labicus who in feats of arms was old

and long before in

arethusa land

had with amilcar fought and honour gain'd and now unmindfull of his broken years with courage fresh again in arms appears but that he now grew cold in war his blows more vain betray the fire so weakly glows in dying embers that no strength at all the flame retains him when fierce hannibal shew'd by his father's spy'd thy former fight's due punishment he cry'd receive by this my hand amilcar now revenging draggs thee to the shades below
this said from's ear with aim a dart he throws which as upon the wound he turned goes quite through his head the fatal shaft again pull'd out his hoary locks a crimson stain of blood receive and his long labours all in death are ended
next to him doth fall herminius a youth who first there took up arms before accustom'd with his hook fam'd thrasimenus in thy lake to prey and to his aged father oft convey delicious food and with his angle from the neighb'ring waters drew the fishes home
but now the carthaginians sad convey upon their arms sichaeus corps away unto the camp whom with a mournfull cry pressing along as hannibal doth spy
with a presaging grief he strikes his breast what is this sadness that's by you exprest my friends said he of what hath us the ire of heaven depriv'd thee burning with desire

of praise sichaeus and too great a love

of thy first war doth this black day remove from life and us by an untimely fall with that he groan'd to which the tears of all that bare him do consent who likewise tell weeping by whose revengefull hand he fell
see it in his breast said he see where

the wound was made by the ilîack

spear

oh worthy our dear carthage shalt thou go and worthy hasdrubal to ghosts below
nor shall thy noble mother thee lament degenerate from thy so high descent
nor as unlike thy ancestours from thee in stygian shades shall our amilcar flee
but these our tears flaminius this day the cause of all by's death shall wipe away this pomp thy funeral shall sure attend and impious rome her self shall in the end that my sichaeus body with her sword she ne're had wounded any rate afford
thus he his fury vents and as he speaks from's foaming mouth like smoak a vapour breaks his rage in broken murmurs from his breast extrudes that breath that should have words so from a boiling pot in scalding heaps like waves through too much heat the liquour leaps then with blind rage into the midst of all he runs and rends the air as he doth call upon flaminius who no sooner hears his voice but to the combat he appears and mars more near approach'd while hand to hand to fight within the lists both champions stand
then strait through all the rocks a sudden crack doth run the mountains all with horrour shake

their tops do tremble and the grove of pines

that crown'd them from its pleasant height declines and broken quarries on the armies fall groaning as pull'd from her foundations all

the

earth doth quake and breaking strangely wide

through the vast gulfe where stygian shades discry'd and fear'd the day again
the troubled lake rais'd to the highest hills forc'd to forsake its ancient seat and channel with a flood before unknown now laves the tyrrhen wood this storm the people and the towns of kings like a dire plague to sad destruction brings
besides all this the rivers backward run and fight with mountains and the sea begun to change its tydes the faunes now quit the hill of apennine and fly to floods yet still the souldier the rage of war although the reeling earth doth toss him too and fro fights on and as he falls deceived by th unconstant ground throws at his enemy his trembling darts till wandring here and there the daunian youth distracted through their fear fly to the shore and leap into the stream
the consul who by chance was mix'd with them that by the earthquake fell their fight in vain upbraids
what then pray you doth remain to such as fly to hannibal thus you his way unto the walls of rome doth show you put both fire and sword into his hand gainst iove tarpeian tow'r oh souldiers stand and learn by me to fight if ye deny to fight at all then learn of me to dy flaminius to posterity shall give no vile example and while do live

no libyan or cantabrian shall see

a consul back although alone be
but if so great a thirst and rage of flight your minds invades their weapons all shall light upon this breast and after this my fall my ghost into the fight shall you recall
while thus he vents his grief and doth advance· to meet his num'rous foes with countenance and mind as cruel forth ducarius came who from his ancestours deriv'd his name and since the boian armie's overthrow those wounds which he receiv'd so long ago as marks of barb'rous courage did retain and knowing the proud conqu'rour's face again art thou the boians greatest terrour said he by this my wounding dart will try if th blood of such a body may be shed nor be you slack more vulgar hands that head to sacrifice to valiant ghosts twas he who in his chariot proud of victory our captiv'd fathers to the capitol drove and they now on you for vengeance call
with that a showr of darts that ev'ry where fly like a tempest through the darkned air o'rewhelm and hide his body so that none could after boast that by his hand alone flaminius dy'd
thus with the general the fight soon ended for the chief of all the youth as angry with themselves and heaven that to their arms so ill success had given and choosing rather once to dy then see the affrican enjoy the victory with hands all bloody in the fatal fight seise on their gen'ral body in their sight

so lately slain with all his weapons and

united in a ring about him stand till all in one great heap of slaughter dy'd

and falling like an hill his body

hid

now having spread destruction through the wood and lake and left the valleys deep in blood to th heap of bodies hannibal withdrew and with him mago and as them they view what wounds what deaths are here said he behold how ev'ry hand still grasps a sword though cold in death the armed souldiers as they ly seem to maintain the fight how these did dy now let our troops observe the threats appear yet in their foreheads and their faces bear their living anger and fear that land which fruitfull is in men so valiant and of so great courage fates to her decree the empire of the world and she shall be victorious in distress
this said he yields to night and darkness over all the fields diffus'd while sol into the sea descends restrains their fury and the slaughter ends

the argument
brutius great valour who before he dy'd his eagle from his foes i'th earth doth hide
sorranus wounded to perusa plains by night retires him marus entertains and having dress'd his wounds to him declares great regulus his father's death and wars his noble courage in his punishment
fabius elected general his descent
the romanes sadness and the people's cries affrighted at the libyans victories
the conqu'rours to linternum go and there the monuments that did at large declare the victories by sea and land which rome from carthage once had gain'd with fire consume

but when his steeds in the tartessiack main loos'd to give way to night sol joyn'd again on the eoan shores and serians who the first of all the world his beams review for silken fleeces to their groves repair the place of sad destruction ev'ry where

appears and monuments of furious war

here men and arms and horses mingled are there hands lop'd off still to their lances stick in wounds of bodies slain there targets thick trumpets and headless trunks ly scatter'd round through all the plain with swords that as they gainst bones were broke
some with eys half dead in vain there sought th enlightned skies
the lake all foams of gore and on the waves float bodies that for ever want their graves
yet midst these miseries and loss of blood firm as her fate the romane valour stood
brutius whose many wounds declar'd that he against his foes had fought unequally scarce from the heaps of th miserable dead mong whom he lay had rais'd his wounded head striving with mangled limbs to creep away his nerves now shrinking when the fatal day was done
him fortune had not plac'd among the rich nor was he honour'd for his tongue or his descent but valiant with his sword
nor did the volscian nation afford any that had of time recover'd more nor sought he when but yet a boy before the down had cloath'd his cheeks himself to hide for safety in the camp
flaminius try'd his courage when in fight he overthrew with better gods the celtick arms hence grew his present honour in all wars that he the keeper of the sacred bird should be
hence glory made him to preserve with care the cause of's death
for when he did dispair of life perceiving nothing could withstand

to keep his eagle from the libyans hand

since fate gave way and that the romane side

was ruin'd in the fight he sought to hide and bury't in the earth but overthrown with sudden darts again and falling down extends himself upon it and beneath his body hides it choosing such a death
but when from stygian night and sleep the light return'd he from the neighb'ring heaps upright arose upon his spear and strong alone in his attempt the earth now overflown with blood and softned by the standing gore with's sword he digs and as he doth adore th unhappy eagle's image with his hand now fainting smooths again th unequal sand then into thinner air his breath doth go and his great soul unto the shades below
near him was to be seen the sacred rage of valour whose deservings do engage our muse to sing its fame
levinus born on high privernum that rich vines adorn dead on dead nasamonian tyres lay and when unequal fortune had that day depriv'd him of his arms his spear and sword then naked in the fight his griefs afford new weapons
with his bloody mouth he flies upon his fo and with his teeth supplies his want of other arms and thus he tears his nostrills off bites out his eyes his ears pulls from his mangled head his forehead too strangely disfigures while the blood doth flow about his jaws yet this not satisfies till with his mouth all full he feeding dyes
while valour sadly to the victour's eye these wonders shews the wounded troops that fly

to various chances are expos'd
some through

of desert woods some wandring go by night through unfrequented fields and there each little noise or motion of the air or flying birds affright them and they finde no sleep or quiet thoughts but still inclin'd to fear beleeve that mago with his spear or hannibal pursues them in the rear
serranus a renowned name thy son great regulus whose lasting fame shall run along with time to tell all ages how with the perfidious carthaginians thou thy faith didst keep in the first glorious state of's youth had enter'd with his father's fate the punick war and now sore wounded from the fight to his sad mother and dear home alone return'd no company to ease his smarting wounds but thus through devious waies supported by his broken lance while night gave him protection he a silent flight towards thy plains perusa takes and there to a small cottage weary doth repair resolv'd to try his fate and knock's at door
marus who to his father long before a souldier of no mean esteem had been leaps quickly from his bed to let him in and borrowing light from the few coals that lay upon the hearth lifts it up to survey his face which strait he knows and saw sad sight those cruel wounds were giv'n him in the fight
his fainting steps supported by his spear the rumour of this loss before his ear had struck what wickdness is this said he oh born to bear too much calamity

that now see thee greatest captain

beheld when ev'n in thy captivity thy looks affrighted carthage and thy fall which we the guilt and crime of iove may call gave me so deep a wound that from my heart not libya ruin can remove the smart
but oh where are ye now ye gods again himself great regulus offers to be slain and perjur'd carthage now oh grief to see this rising branch of that great family hath quite alass destroy'd
thus having said the fainting youth upon his bed he lai'd nor was he ignorant for he in war that skill had learn'd fit med'cines to prepare and first with water purg'd his wounds then of herbs of healing virtue doth infuse then binds them up and with a tender hand swaths on the bolsters with a gentle band
thus having giv'n him ease twas his next care t'allay his tedious thirst and to repair his strength with frugal diet this in haste perform'd kinde sleep its benefits at last apply'd and gave his body gentle rest
but e're the day again did gild the east marus as if he'd cast off age again was ready to allay the burning pain that then return'd with med'cines try'd before and piously doth nat'ral warmth restore
but here the youth lifting up to the skies with sighs and frequent groans his weeping eyes said oh immortal iove if yet thy hate to the tarpeian rock quirinus state hath not condemn'd with a more kinde aspect on italie distress'd affairs reflect

our iliads of woes behold for we

the alps have lost and our adversity no limits finds
ticinus and the po swoln high with romane slaughter overflow and trebia by sidonian trophies known with that sad land that annus did renown
but why do complain of this alass our present miseries the rest surpass
saw thy waters thrasimenus swell with slaughter'd men
flaminius when he fell amidst the weapons beheld· and all the shades below my gods to witness call that by a death worthy my father with slaughter of my foes then sought to dy had not hard fates as they my dearest sire refus'd deny'd a death to my desire
thus bitterly complaining to divert the rest old marus speaks
most noble heart whatever be our lot or whatsoe're our fortune it like romanes let us bear
through various chances such by the decree of heav'n the wheel of our mortality in a steep path doth swiftly run
of this thy family a great example is and fam'd through all the world
that divine he thy noble father whom no deity excells mong all eternal honour gain'd for that he did adversity withstand nor shrunk from any virtue till his breath was from his struggling body forc'd by death
hardly was a youth when down began on regulus his cheeks to sign him man yet then his companion was and we our years still pass'd with kinde society

untill the angry gods decreed that light

of the italian nation should quite extinguish'd be within whose noble breast faith kept her temple and his soul possest
that sword an ensign of great honour he as a reward of magnanimity on me bestow'd and reins you see with dust and smoak now cover'd o're but yet no rust their brightness stains such gifts as these prefer marus to any romane cavalier
but above all my honours must prize

that

spear to which often sacrifice

streams of lyaeus blood as here you see tis worth your time to know the history
slow bragada plows up the thirsty sand with troubled waves in all the libyan land no flood more largely doth it self extend or swelling doth its waters farther send o're all the fields
as thither we withdrew in search of springs of which that land but few affords upon the banks we joyfull sate hard by the stygian grove that did dilate t'exclude the day its shadow ev'ry where and a thick vapour breaking through the air expir'd a noisom smell within was found a dire and spacious cave that under ground with many labyrinths did winding run and ever dark had ne're beheld the sun
the very thoughts of it my soul invades with fear that fatal bank and stygian shades a most pernicious monster by the rage of earth produc'd whose equal in no age was seen inhabited a snake of strength prodigious and an hundred ells in length

his immense paunch surcharg'd with poison kill'd

upon the river's banks or lyons fill'd or heards that scorched by the furious heat of the sun's rays did thither make retreat or birds that by his pestilential breath attracted from the skies there found their death bones upon the ground were spread
and thus when he had plentifully fed on divers prey within his noisom den he belching lay and when the fire agen of thirst was kindled from his fervent food he came to quench it in the neighb'ring flood and foaming waves and e're within the water his vast bulk had drenched been his head upon the adverse bank would ly
not thinking of so great a monster with havens and aquinus forward go explore the silence of the place and know the wood when horrour seiz'd as we drew near our joynts and all our limbs congealed were with a most strange unusual cold and yet we enter and the nymphs and gods intreat o'th flood unknown to favour what we do and thus though full of fear presume to go into the secret wood when from the mouth and entrance of the den as from the south raging with furious storms a stygian broke forth and o're the flood the tempest cast mix'd with an hellish noise
we struck with fear gaze on each other's face and think we hear the earth to groan and see it quake the den to sink and ghosts to sally forth
but then big as those snakes wherewith the giants arm'd themselves when they the court of heav'n alarm'd

or that which in the fens of thee

alcides try'd or kept the golden tree such tearing up the earth and to the skies lifting his head a serpent here doth rise and mong the clouds disperseth here and there his foam and as he gapes infects the air
we fled and out of breath with horrour strove in vain to raise a cry for all the grove his hiss had fill'd when vmbrian havens blind with fear and much too blame but fate inclind his mind to what he did himself betook unto the body of an aged oak thinking thereby the monster to deceive but my self could hardly this beleive had not seen the snake himself about the oak streight twines and tears't up by the root
then trembling havens who to us for aid with his last voice doth call he doth invade and swallowing whole this looking back spy'd in his envenom'd paunch doth quickly hide
next poor aquinus who in's speedy flight himself unto the river did commit swiming amidst the stream with fooming jaws he seiseth and a death most cruel draws back to the banck and there devours while in the mean time had liberty to fly
as much as my sick thoughts permit haste and to the general tell all had past
he sigh'd and their sad fate bewail'd and as against an enemy in war he was most eager burning with desire to be active in high attempts commands that we with speed take arms and that the choice of all the horse into the field should quickly fall

himself advanc'd before and gave command

that instantly a band should follow with the engines us'd to be employ'd gainst walls and towr's for battery
and now when prancing on the champaign ground the furious steeds began to thunder round his dismal cave the serpent hissing loud leaps forth
a stygian vapour like a cloud breaks from his smoaking mouth from's glaring eyes a flame as terrible as lightning flies his crest erected high appears above the tops of tallest trees within the grove
his trident tongue which with a motion quick he waveth in the air the stars doth lick
but when he heard the trumpets sound amaz'd his immense body strait aloft he rais'd then into rings beneath his breast contracts his tail and on his back doth rest
thus fitted for the fight those twisted rings were soon resolv'd and as himself he flings at length he suddenly as if at hand the faces ev'n of those that farthest stand invades
the horses now no more obey the reins or curbs but as they fly away trembling and panting from his sight expire from their extended nostrills frequent fire
on his swoln neck to ev'ry side he moves his lofty head and as his rage improves flings some aloft some with his weight were crush'd and as from broken bones the marrow gush'd he licks it up and while the blood doth flow about his jaws invades another fo and bodies throws away and now the ensigns all as if the day

were lost retreat
yet some that farthest fly

by his contagious breath infected dy
but your great father lab'ring to restrain the flying troops thus calls them back again
what to a serpent basely turn your backs italian youth and yield to libyan snakes ausonia honour if his breath subdue the cowards or their courage as they view him gape be lost alone i'le undertake to fight the monster
and as this he spake from his strong arm a winged jav'lin flies the barbed point whereof between his eys not lightly wounds his front and thrown with strength within the head o'th reeling beast at length it sinks and trembling stands
confused cries and shouts of joy now strike the marbled skies
till then the monster ne're did feel though he had liv'd so long the wounding steel a stranger to all pain and scorning so to yield to any doth more furious grow
nor had his rage been vain which borrow'd force from what he felt if skill'd to guide his horse after the wound your father had not wav'd his fierce assault and turning nimbly sav'd himself while winding ev'ry way with speed he furiously pursu'd the wheeling steed
but all this while your marus did not stand as a spectatour with an idle hand
the second spear that wounded him flung
just as the weary steed his forked tongue lick'd on the back with all my strength threw my weapon and by that upon me drew his fury and the war till all the bands by our example led employ'd their hands

and storm'd him with their darts that him engage

alternately to exercise his rage till from a warlike engine by a stroke that would have batter'd down a wall we broke his strength and yet although he could no more his back now broken raise as heretofore his head unto the clouds more furious on he strove to come till the phalarick stone into his belly sunk and then the sight of both his eyes by winged shafts was quite extinguish'd by those many wounds his death approach'd
then through his wider jaws his breath infectious poison his last refuge cast
thus by our darts and pond'rous stones at last stretch'd on the ground he prostrate lay and yet his jaws extended wide appear'd to threat till from an engine shot a beam that through the yeilding air with a loud fragour flew struck off his head which as he gasping lay a pale dark cloud of poison that the day infected where it went his mouth exhal'd
the mournfull river strait his death bewail'd with hideous groans and dolefull murmurs move upon the waves the den and native grove and banks upon whose sands he us'd to roule with a loud eccho roar and sadly howl
but oh how soon this dismal fight we rue with how great loss what punishment we drew what plagues upon our selves the prophets strait us of our dangers but alass too late admonish that we had the servant slain of the blew naiades that did remain in bragada warm streams
but then this spear as honour and reward for what there

had done your father gave me cause it stood

first fix'd and drank the sacred serpent's blood
the noble youth who wept while he relates this story interrupts him
if the fates had suffer'd him to live till now said he trebia had ne're o'reflown with blood nor we had seen thy billows thrasimonus hide so many noble names
marus reply'd yet he the piacles of his sad fate and cruel torments did anticipate with tyrian blood
for africk wanting men her wealth consum'd had begg'd our mercy when therapne mov'd by some malignant star

sent forth

a man to prosecute the war

of stature he was low no comely grace of meen or signs of honour in his face but admirable vigour in so small a body active one that could the tall and o'recome
this man design'd to manage now the war against us joyn'd to arms strong policy
in desarts he could live and greatest hardship easily survive
not hannibal who now so well for libya guids the war doth him excell
oh would to heaven tayegeta most sad and fatal unto us by thee he had upon eurota banks ne're hardned been then in victorious flames might have seen phanissa walls to sink nor then the fall had lamented of my general
nor should for death nor fire can ease my wo my griefs bear with me to the shades below
both armies take the field and through the plains the god of war grows hot and fury reigns

in every breast
here regulus in great

attempts lets loose his sword and hast's to meet with dangers in the mid'st of all his foes and with his valiant hand gives deadly blows
so when the south wind on his wings doth bear a pitchy cloud that hanging in the air both to the sea and land a tempest threats the husbandman and shepheard strait retreats for shelter to the woods and fear prevails with the stout seaman to contract his sails

but the laconian having lai'd his

snare

secur'd the hollow rocks and leaving there his men upon a sudden from the fight wheeling he turns his horse pretending flight with fained fear
so shepheards to secure their flocks within their folds by night allure wolves into pits the which they with boughs and with a bleating lamb betray
honour by which brave minds inflamed are and a fallacious confidence in war
invited and drew on your noble sire who spurring on as mad with a desire to fight ne're looks if his companions were behind him or who follow'd in the rear
when all alone a thick and sudden cloud of fierce laconians that themselves did shrow'd among the hollow rocks him round invest and the force of his ruin still encreas't
of fatal day to italy to be mark'd in our fast as the infamy of thee oh mars those hands that to thy rome and thee were born by a most fatal doom are now condemn'd to chains
my greif will be eternal a sidonian dungeon thee

great regulus beheld and by the odds

of such a triumph carthage to the gods seem'd equal
but what plagues sufficient are for the laconians guilt of such a war but now the carthaginian fathers all consult to offer to our general

new

leagues and send him home to mediate

a peace requiring that the captivate in war might be return'd on either side and now no more delay the ship doth ride at anchor in the road the seamen are employ'd their oars and benches to prepare some fit the twisted cables others haste to furle and trim the sails upon the mast others the anchors place upon the prow but above all cothon ordain'd to go chief pilot of the ship in renown'd for skill the helm and poop prepares
the beak its shining raies most richly guilt o're all the sea displaies
weapons and all things else that needfull were gainst dangers of the sea with them they bear amidst the ship upon the decks he stands that timeth with his voice the seamens hands and bids them strike at once and as again they raise their oars that eccho o're the main applauds them all
thus when they had perform'd the seamens work the ship compleatly arm'd and th hour arriv'd to hoise up sail and weigh their anchors and the wind was fair for sea a multitude of women children men together flock'd and envious fortune then dragg'd through the throng our noble general and shew'd him as a spectacle to all

he in their view as smootha bore

as when he first on the sidonian shore arrived with his fleet
with his consent in the same ship his companion went resolving his adversity to share and thought it greater fortitude to bear their nastiness ill diet and their poor obdurate beds and to contend with more important miseries then to subdue a fo nor is't so honourable to avoid misfortunes by our vigilance as to o'recome by noble sufferance whatever fate can do
and yet though knew his severe and rigid constancy hop'd if heav'n permitted us to come within our citie's walls and see our home his heart might then relent or by your tears at least be mollifi'd
thus my fears kept in my breast and thought that he inclin'd to weep and had in misery a minde like mine
but when we came to tybur observ'd his face and most intentively beheld his looks which inward sense betray
but credit me brave youth in what say his countenance amid'st a thousand toils abroad and when at home enrich'd with spoils and when to cruel carthage he was sent and in the instant of his punishment unalter'd beheld and still the same
then all ausonia from her cities came to meet the captive all the neighb'ring hills the plains already throng'd their number fills and tybur to his banks the noise imparts but the sidonian princes cruel hearts

strive to reduce him to their countrey's dress

and so the honour of the gown suppress
the senate weeping stood the matrons throng and youth to shew their greifs while he among so many sighs unmoved stands
his hand the consul on the shore as he on land first stept extends to help him and to meet with kind respect and his arrival greet
he stepping back still carefull of our state requires the consul not to violate his supream dignity but to retire
then on he goes while weeping we admire his constancy and compass'd by the proud sidonians and with them a captive croud rais'd envy in the gods
but now his flame with her two hopefull sons sad martia came unhappy in her noble lords excess of virtue that disdain'd in his distress to stoop to fortune
her dishevel'd hair and robes neglected as she sadly tare oh know'st thou not the day or can it be it touch'd thee not in younger years said she and when in tyrian habit like disguise deform'd she saw him then with mournfull cryes she fainting fell and strait grew cold and pale in all her limbs oh let our prayers prevail and if the gods be just may carthage see such the sidonian mothers then to me he whispers and commands that remove you and your mother while he still doth prove impenetrable gainst the strongest blow of grief and scorns that yoak to undergo
here with deep sighs and tears complaining thus the youth begun dear father whom with us

no deity excells that doth remain

in the tarpeian tow'rs if to complain may be allow'd to piety oh why this comfort unto us did'st thou deny or why oh why thou too severe that grace did'st thou refuse to touch thy sacred face or kiss thee to joyn hands was it a sin so great how much these wounds had lighter been if fixed in my minde when repair to shades below thy embrace might bear but in vain these things record for we were then my marus in our infancy
yet remember well his form was more then humane that his locks descended o're his manly neck white as the alpine snow stern majesty was seated on his brow the venerable index of his minde such as since then mine eyes could never finde
then marus him advising to refrain by such complaints to vex his wounds again resumes the word
what when he careless past by his own houshold gods and went in haste

to the sidonians curs'd

abode his eyes

the monuments of his great victories then saw hung up as shields and chariots and known darts while at the door his wife doth stand and cryes oh whither goes my regulus this is no punick dungeon that thou thus should'st fly both it and me
the here of our chast are yet as clear as at the first
our house still entertains its gods without a crime then say what stains in us thou find'st the senate gave thee joy when to thee this and that other boy

had born oh turn and see this house is thine

where thou a noble consul once didst shine in purple robes and marching from this door did'st see the romane fasces go before
hence did'st thou go to war and here with me wert wont the trophies of thy victory to fix against these posts
ask not now the rites of hymen or our nuptial vow onely desist our to slight and to thy sons at least allow this night amidst these tears he with the tyrians goes to lodge and left her venting thus her woes
scarce had the rising day on orta seen the place where great alcides pile had been when for the libyan lords the consul sent

at the gate beheld

him as he went

into the temple what the senate there debated what his last addresses were to the sad weeping court himself to me did chearfully relate
so soon as he was enter'd with their hands and voices all him to his wonted seat contending call
but he the antient honour of his place rejects while they about him throng'd embrace and take him by the hand and thus intreat he would restore a captain of so great a name unto his countrey he might be exchang'd for numbers in captivity
and then more justly might the tyrian land and towers be wasted by that valiant hand which they had bound in chains
but he his eyes and hands together lifting to the skies thou god of justice said that govern'st all and faith whom no less divine may call

and sarran iuno all invok'd by me

my promise of return to testifie let me speak worthy of my self and by my words prevent my countrie's ruin more chearfull shall to carthage go said he if that my promise of return may be preserv'd though be to punishment
oh then desist to tender unto me agen that honour with destruction to the state
my many years and wars accelerate my death and now by long imprisonment and bonds in this my age my strength is spent
your regulus was once and did pursue the hardest duties of the war when you did know him such but now within a cold and bloodless body you a name behold
oh let not carthage then that house of fraud that doth her self in treachery applaud not knowing how great things to us remain think for this aged body to regain her captiv'd youth men fit for war
but go arm'd against her deceits and let her know what rome can do though am captivate nor let a peace accepted be but what

our

fathers entertain'd
they now require

and gave it me in charge as their desire that in an equal league the war be weigh'd and equal laws on either side be made
but may sink to styx before see the romanes to so base a peace agree
this said the court resolving to pursue his faithfull grave advice he strait withdrew himself to render to the libyans ire
who with a sad repulse of their desire

dismiss'd return'd through the herculean main

threatning their cheerfull captive home again
after the senate now a mournfull croud of people throng and all the fields with loud complaints are fill'd sometimes resolv'd again to call him back or else by force retain with their just griefs
but trembling bove them all his wife as at his sudden funeral when to the ship he went with dolefull cries and shreekings to the sea as frantick flies
take me along libyans let me share both his death and punishment said she my dear beg this one thing onely by those pledges of our loves permit that may share with thee whatever dangers be destin'd by land or sea or heav'n to thee did not send xantippus to the war nor did give those heavy chains that are about thy neck why then dost fly me so to punishment oh give me leave to go me and my children and perhaps our tears may carthage move to pity
if her ears the cruel city stop we then may all thou and thy family together fall or if resolv'd to dy here dy with me for a sharer in thy fate will be
as thus she spoke the vessel by degrees loos'd from the shore to put to sea she sees then most unhappy mad with grief she cries lifting her weary hands unto the skies see him that boasts with treach'rous libyans thus and foes to keep his faith but what to us was promis'd violates oh where is now perfidious man thy faith and nuptial vow

these words he unrelenting heard
the rest

the noise and dashing of the oars supprest
then down the river with the stream we run unto the borders where the sea begun
o're which we sail and with our hollow pine cleave the vast billows foaming with their brine
dreading more then death proud libya scorn wish'd that the ship by some rude tempest born against some rock might split or else that we might by the raging seas o'rewhelmed be
but winds the vessel bore away and us to libyan rage restore which unhappy saw and home was sent a sad relatour of his punishment
·twas an hard task nor would now relate to thee how carthage then did imitate the fury of wild beasts to vent their spleen if any age in all the world had seen any thing greater then that high and brave example which the rev'rent virtue gave of your great father
twere a shame for me to add complaints to those dire torments he so unconcern'd endur'd and truly you worthy of so great blood your self should shew

by wiping tears away
a

cage they build

of wood whose grates on ev'ry side were fill'd with equal pikes of steel which sharp and thick by art in order plac'd erected stick
all sleep by this invention was deny'd and when through length of time to either side dull slumbers him inclin'd a row of pikes into his bowels through his body strikes
oh cease to grieve brave youth suppress thy tears
he overcomes that this with patience bears

his glory long shall flourish while in heav'n

or earth to constant faith a place is giv'n or virtue's sacred name alive shall be
a day shall come wherein posterity great regulus shall tremble when they hear thy fate which thou with so much scorn did'st bear
thus marus spoke and with sad care again his wounds fomented to allay the pain
fame in the mean time having sprinkled o're her rapid wings with blood as if before dip'd in the streams of thrasimenus lies with truth commixing through the city flies and to the people's minds again recalls the loss of allia and tarpeian vvalls storm'd by the senones
sad terrour shakes her reins and fear the tempest greater makes
now to the walls with winged speed she flies an horrid voice is heard our enemies approach and then with piles and darts the air in vain they beat
th affrighted matrons bare their hoary locks and with them as they weep the walls and pavements of the temples sweep and to the gods for friends deceased pray too late alass and rest not night or day
howling with grief the scatter'd people ly before the gates and with a carefull eye all that return observe
about them throng and as they speak hang listning at their tongue but cannot credit give if news of joy they chance to tell and yet again their stay intreat and sometimes with sad looks alone not words with such as hasted to be gone prevail for tdings and yet trembling stand to hear what they so earnestly demand

bad news doth force their tears and if deni'd

to know or if the messenger reply'd with doubtfull words from thence new fears arise
and now when troops returning to their eyes more near appear'd out at the gates they run fearing they had been lost and then begun to kiss their wounds and tire the gods with pray'r
among these honoured for his pious care old marus with him young serranus led
and martia who since regulus was dead still kept at home all company forsook and onely for her childrens sake did brook the light now runs into a grief as great as was her former
though distracted strait she marus knew and thus accosts him thou great faiths renown'd companion surely now thou giv'st me lighter wounds or say hath fate caus'd the revengefull sword to penetrate into my bowels deep what e're it be so carthage him in chains may never see nor sacrifice him to his father's pain i'm pleas'd
ye gods how oft have in vain oh my dear son intreated thee forbear thy father's courage and his heat in war that his sad glory might not thee engage in arms
have of too vivacious age the hard afflictions undergone
but now spare us pray ye gods if any of you for us have fought suppress the enemy but when this sullen cloud of misery was past the senate with all speed prepares to give support to their distress'd affairs
all strive with emulation the war to undertake and present dangers bar

the progress of their griefs· the chief of all

their cares was no appoint a general upon whose conduct shaken italy and the whole frame of her affairs might be when now their countrey did appear to sink
for iove resolved to defer awhile the time of her imperial pow'r and rising look'd from the albanian tow'r upon the tyrrhen people and beheld the carthaginian with successes swell'd preparing his victorious arms invade our walls
but iove his head then shaking said never will permit that thou shalt come proud libyan youth within the walls of rome
thou mayst the tyrrhen vales with slaughter fill and make with latine blood the rivers swell and overflow their banks but defend that the tarpeian rock thou shouldst ascend or to those walls so dear to me aspire
with that four he threw his forked fire which shin'd through all the tyrrhen land and cast a cloud upon the army as it past from the divided heav'n
but yet all this the libyan to divert could not suffice
with that the god th aeneades possest with resolution in a faithfull breast the nation to repose and put the reins of safety into noble fabius hands
perceiving then the pow'r of war to be entrusted to his care not him said he envy nor fame with libyan vanity guided nor spoil nor cunning treachery nor other base desires shall overthrow skilfull and old in war he well doth know

success and loss with equal thoughts to bear

his minde well temper'd both for peace and war
thus iove and then remounted to the skies
this fabius whom his foes could ne're surprize in arms and thus by iove commended thought himself most happy when entire he brought those numbers home again which he before conducted to the field and no man more desir'd himself or dearest son to spare then he did them none with so sad a care beheld their wounds in fight and when again he came a conqu'rour with the noble stain of hostile blood besmear'd his legions all appear'd compleat before the citie's wall
his fam'd original with heav'n did claim alliance for when great alcides came from spain gerion spoils his monstrous kine he that way where the walls of rome do shine in triumph drove
then did arcadius found as fame reports in rude and desart ground his palace and a needy people swai'd when by his sacred guest the royal maid arcas his daughter overcome with joy from that her crime of love conceiv'd a boy was fabius nam'd from him a mother she became to a tyrinthian progeny
and hence three hundred fabii once did go all from one house in arms against the fo whose most renowned actions by his wife delaies which then alone could equalize the libyan conduct this our fabius all excell'd
so great then wert thou hannibal but while the latines busily prepare to raise recruits and the war

the carthaginian captain terrified

by iove and having lai'd his hopes aside of batt'ring rome high walls his army leads up to the vmbrian hills where tuder spreads upon an high descent its hanging walls and where mevania o're large fields exhales thick gloomy clouds and consecrate to iove fat bulls through rich and wealthy pastures move
from thence desirous of picenian prey through the palladian fields he makes his way and wheresoe're the spoil invites him there his wandring troops their plundring ensigns bear till fair campania stop'd his furious course and undefended entertain'd the force o'th war within her bosome
as he there beheld the temple and the buildings near

linternus swelling stream he fix'd his eyes

upon the various pictures where he spies the monuments o'th former war maintain'd by th romane senate
for they there remain'd carv'd on the porches and all things exprest in order and at large
before the rest great regulus appears to instigate the war a war which had he known his fate

he would have shun'd
there noble

appius stood

in a pitcht field and high in libyan blood from their great slaughter a just triumph crown'd with lawrel gain'd
near these at sea renown'd

duillius on a column rose

bearing his naval trophies stems and prows of ships the first that italy had known those spoils the tyrian navy overthrown to dedicate to neptune
near him stand his nightly glories shining torches and

his sacred trumpeter that from a feast

was wont with chearfull sounds that joy exprest attend him to his honour'd home and then

the honours of that noble citizen

deceas'd he sees
near these doth scipio stand

and celebrates in the

sardôan land

the tyrian captain's funerals subdu'd by him
then on the libyan shores he view'd the routed bands in scatter'd parties fly about the field and regulus hard by pursuing at their backs the nomades the garamantians the autololes the moors and hammon lay down arms and yield their cities up
within a sandy field slow bragada with poison foams and there a serpent gainst an army makes a war

then from his ship

xantippus thrown in vain

calling upon the gods was in the main by a perfidious band most sadly drown'd
and there too late great regulus he found the punishment of thy unhappy death
the two aegates likewise from beneath the waves they make to rise about them lay torn ships and libyans floating on the sea

lord of the ocean then

luctatius bore

away with a propitious gale to shore the captiv'd ships
with these in order all amilcar father to the general

stood

bound and from all other objects drew

upon himself the people's eyes to view his stern aspect and then was to be seen the face of peace the altars that had been polluted with the league and iove deceiv'd the romane giving laws and as they heav'd

their axes up the libyan trembling stands

and begging pardon with submissive hands swears but in vain the league
this from the sky fair cytherea with a joyfull eye beheld
but when the libyan general had with a troubled brow survai'd it all his slow contracted rage that all the while boil'd in his breast thus with a scornfull smile he vents
we likewise things as great by me perform'd shall carved on our houses see
let me carthage see sagunthus all at once by fire and sword together fall
sons by their fathers kill'd and let there be space large enough the conquer'd alps to see whereon victorious nomades may ride and garamantians
let me see beside ticinus overflow his banks with blood and trebia and thrasimenus flood choak'd up with thuscan corps
flaminius great in body and in arms there finde his fate
let consul scipio bleeding fly and on the weary shoulders of his pious son to's friends be born
let this divulged be carthage shall greater things hereafter see
rome burnt in libyan flames shall there be shown and iove from his tarpeian temple thrown
in the mean time as it becomes ye you brave youth by whose assistance can do and have done things so great go quickly burn those monuments and them to ashes turn

silius italicus of the second punick vvar
the seventh book

the argument
fabius is for the war dictatour made the libyan by his policy delai'd wasts the falernian countrey and to gain a battel sev'ral waies removes in vain vntill at length by the ausonian bands encompass'd in a vale besieg'd be stands his stratagem by which his troops agen are from this danger freed the romane then with mutiny demanding battel are by fabius appear'd
at length the war is to minutius left who soon doth yield to their designs and rashly takes the field to fight at first the libyan prevails till fabius while all other succour fails came to the romanes and who get the day and sacrifices to his honour pay

but fabius the onely hope and stay of rome distress'd affairs ausonia now sinking through her wounds and her allies soon arms and vig'rously himself applies though old the hardest toils to undergo and with his army march'd against the fo

his understanding more then man's no force

of darts no weapons nor the strength of horse regarded but he went alone gainst all the libyan forces and their general as yet unconquer'd keeping in his breast alone the strength and safety of the rest and if he had not then resolv'd to stay the course of adverse fortune by delay that the last age of the dardanian name had surely been and rome had lost her fame
the favour of the gods that did attend the punick arms he temper'd and an end to libya conquests put
the enemy insulting in the woes of italy by his wise conduct he debell'd and all the fraud deluded of proud hannibal
most noble general who troy again lapsing to ruin dost alone sustain and sinking italy who dost uphold evander empire and whate're of old the labours of our fathers gain'd in wars go on and raise thy name unto the stars
but when new titles had proclaim'd the choice of the dictatour by the publick voice the libyan prince revolving in his minde that something of importance had inclin'd the romanes to that change of their command so suddenly desir'd to understand what was the fortune of the man what were his honours or why fabius should appear their last safe authour in distress why he after so many storms by rome should be thought equal unto hannibal and yet it vex'd him that his years did want that heat

that might expose him through temerity

to his deceits and therefore instantly he for a captive calls t'enquire of all his customs actions and original
cilnius a youth and of a noble name from fair aretium to ticinus came in an unhappy hour and by a wound that overthrew his horse fal'n to the ground his neck to libyan chains then yielded
he desirous by his death himself to free the libyan thus informs
thou hast not now with fierce flaminius said he to do or gracchus rash resolves his family from the tyrinthian gods deriv'd had he within thy countrey hannibal been born carthage the world's imperial crown had worn
with a long series i'le not strive to show particulars let this suffice to know the fabii by one combat having broke the peace and shaken off the romane yoak the bold veientes brought the war's alarms ev'n to our gates the consul cites to arms th old listed bands alcides progeny fills up a private camp one family

sends a

patrician army to the fight

three hundred captains each whereof you might trust safely with the conduct of a war appear
but going forth they threatned are with dire presages
conscious of their fate

the trembling threshold of the

guilty gate

sends forth a fatal sound that altar roar'd where chiefly the tyrinthian god's ador'd
yet they invade the fo and with so fierce a valour charge that their small number scarce

could be distinguish'd and their slaughters are

more then the souldiers oftentimes the war in globes compacted close they entertain
as oft dispers'd in parties through the plain they dangers meet
equal in labours all and valour merit to the capitol to lead three hundred triumphs but alass how vain those hopes each man forgetfull was how soon all things that humane are decline these men disdaining while the fabian line was safe that publick wars should waged be incompass'd by a sudden enemy fell by the envy of the gods but yet thou hast no cause of joy in their defeat for the surviver is enough for thee and libya as with all their hands will he alone contend his limbs so active are so circumspect his industry and care secur'd with cautious ease
not you whose veins swell'd high with youthfull blood can with the re sooner restrain nor prick the warlike steed into the battel with more furious speed
but hannibal perceiving as he spoke he coveted to dy thou dost provoke in vain thou fool our rage and seek'st to free thy self from bondage by thy death said he no thou shalt live and straiter chains shall press thy captive neck
thus swelling with success and the propitious gods he vents his scorn
but by religion to the altars born the fathers and the latine dames their eyes with sorrow fill'd in order'd companies a robe and vows to iuno offer hear oh queen of gods lend us a willing ear

we a chast people pray thee
we who be

the chief of the ausonians to thee this fair and venerable garment wrought by our own hands with threds of gold have brought and till the fears of mothers do decrease this shall thy vesture be
and if thou please that this marmarick cloud we may behold far scatter'd from our land a crown of gold enlai'd with various gemms to thee shall shine
this goddess thus ador'd to pallas shrine they proper off'rings bring then worship thee venus and phoebus and the deity of war from the approach of miseries so great a rev'rence of the gods doth rise
the happy seldom to their altars come
while antient honours in her temples rome thus celebrates great fabius takes the field with his troops and as most skil'd in warlike arts like one secure though slow all avenues gainst fortune and the fo blocks up and from their ensigns suffers none to stray and that which chiefly thee doth crown brave romane and thy empire's head so high hath lifted taught thy souldiers to obey
but when from far their ensigns all in view upon the hills and all the troops in new bright arms appear'd the libyan hopes swell high and hannibal with his prosperity enflam'd believ'd his victorie's delay was onely that the armies in array were not drawn forth to fight
go on said he quickly assault their ports let their works be ev'n by your breasts o'rethrown i'me sure the fo no longer hath to live then we can go

over the plain between us for to war

their sedentary old men cited are with whom to fight am almost asham'd
what you now see are their remains disclaim'd as wholly useless in the former war
where is their gracchus now or now where are those thunderbolts the scipios expell'd from italy they ne're their flight with held till frighted to the farthest part they came o'th earth and sea
now trembling at our name both wander and iberus banks defend and where we are not there a war pretend
likewise from flaminius death may claim increase of honour and his active name in war among my other titles lay
how many years this sword shall take away from fabius yet he dares but let him dare i'le make me shall no more in arms appear
this spoke aloud his troops with furious speed he leadeth on and mounted on his steed sometimes with his right hand provokes his foes sometimes upbraids them then at distance throws a dart insulting in his armie's sight shewing the image of a future fight

so thetis

son in the dardanian field

bore his vulcanian arms and in his shield express'd the earth and heav'n and mother curl'd with waves and in that figure all the world
but fabius carefull to delay sits still and his vain fury on a lofty hill beholding checks his proud insulting mind and tires his furious threats while he declin'd the fight
so when by night a shepheard keeps his flocks in fenced folds and safely sleeps

the hungry wolves fierce howlings round about

streight raise and gnaw the fence that keeps them out
the libyans design thus render'd vain thence with his army through th appulian plain he slowly march'd and sometimes closely sate conceal'd in vallies to precipitate his following fo or try if he might be surpriz'd unwarily by policy
sometimes by secret waies he steals by night and then retreats in a pretended fright
then from his camp full of rich plunder goes and prodigally thus invites his foes
so with innumerable turnings through maeonian plains doth fam'd maeander flow
nothing that fraud can do is left untry'd
he trurns o're all and all his thoughts apply'd to various attempts
as when the sun shining on water by reflection leaps on the houses tops and glistering sheds in constant raies and dancing shadows spreads upon the roofs
now mad with grief alone thus to his sacred rage he makes his moan
if he at first our enemy had been the names of trebia and of thrasimen had ne're been known
nor had they given to us new titles nor had stain'd erydanus troubled with bloody waves the frighted sea
but he while we are tyr'd with his delay and he contains himself hath found a new strange way to victory
how oft in shew of meeting us hath he our plots o'rethrown with judgement and our stratagems undone thus to himself when the shrill trumpets sound midnight proclaim'd but when the third watch round

the camp new centinels had call'd to stand

he turns his course and leaving daunus land behind to the campanian coasts his way he takes well known as greedy after prey
here when he entred the falernian fields that land is rich and constant profit yields to the laborious swains he straitway throws his hostile flames among the fruitfull boughs
but here though great actions be our theme the mention of thine honour we must not pass by in silence but record thy praise who dost that sacred juice afford whose vines with nectar swell'd a nobler name then the falernian press can never claim
falernus old in better times did plow the massick hills they then no swords did know the then within the naked field did not with swelling grapes green shadows yield nor knew they how to lyaeus blood among their cups but in some chrystal flood or spring their thirst allai'd
an happy hour thither lyaeus going to the shore of calpe and the bounds of day a guest did bring
nor did the deity detest a low poor cottage but he enters and the smoaky room and table that did stand before the chimney as the custom was of that poor age receive him
but alass the host whose chearfull looks his joy exprest did not perceive a god was then his guest and yet as his us'd to do spar'd not his age from running to and fro most kindly busie till his choicest chear he brought there cornels in neat baskets here

fresh from his watry juicy fruits

serv'd in then and milk he puts as dainties mong the rest and all the while nothing of blood the table doth defile but ceres gifts brought in he doth compose the fire into the midst whereof he throws his sacrifice
pleas'd with the old man's care the god resolv'd his liquour should be there when suddenly is very strange to tell the cups of beech with wine begin to swell as the reward of his poor entertain
the too with blushing wine began to overflow and from an hollow oak into a goblet the sweet liquour broke from the grapes here take and store thy self lyaeus said with what before thou did'st not know but which falernus name for nobler vines hereafter shall proclaim
with that the god himself reveal'd and round with purple raies an ivy garland crown'd his shining front about his neck he flung his locks in his right hand a tankard hung and fallen from his thyrsus vines about the table with nisaean branches sprout
nor could falernus with the pleasant tast contend when some few cups about had past
now with his foot or stamm'ring tongue he makes the god to laugh while the strong liquour shakes his brains and he endeavours to make good return of thanks in words scarce understood till sleep which bacchus still accompanies wheree're he goes compos'd his struggling eyes
but when the rising sun dispers'd the dew the massick swains with admiration view

their fields with vines like groves most richly crown'd

and with the sun the branches shining round the hill their glory spread and since that hour rich tmolus and arvisian cups that pour ambrosian liquour forth and thy fam'd field fertile methymna to falernus yield
through this the libyan like a fury past and all the countrey round about lai'd wast incited by his men whose swords pursu'd their thirst of blood
while fabius doth delude their general and now a mad desire of fighting the ausonian camp doth fire all covet in that madness to descend into the plain
my muse let us commend the man whom fate permitted to subdue both armies and their fury overthrew
if me the senate had believ'd to be of such hot temper and so rash said he or that such clamours easily my minde could shake they had not when the state declin'd giv'n me the conduct of this desp'rate war
my resolutions of a battel are already fix'd it shall my conquest be to keep you safe that urge so eagerly your fate against your will none of you all by fabius shall have liberty to fall
if weary of the light you now desire that the ausonian name with you expire or if it grieves you that at such a time no place is rendred famous by the crime of some new mischief or notorious blow recall flaminius from the shades below a signal by his late temerity and auspicies you have
do ye not see

a precipice and your approaching fate

consider to the ruin of the state one victorie's enough for hannibal
stay then and understand your general when the wish'd time shall come that may require your hands then let those furious words conspire with deeds beleive me tis an easie thing to go to fight should we now open fling our ports one hour you all into the field may pour but they to whom the gods shall yield a kinde and mild aspect as forth they go shall have that bliss alone to scape the fo and safe return
the libyan relyes upon his fortune and his vessel flies with a propitious wind and till that gale shall slack and cease to fill his swelling sail it must of business be and constant care to seek delaies
fortune's imbraces are perpetual to none see how much less the tyrian forces are how they decrease in fame since we declin'd the fight
and we mong other things for this may praised be that they it is better far that forbear more words you now the enemy
a battel and require
oh may this confidence be such another day ye gods in the mean time excluding all chances of greater dangers that may fall upon you and my countrey pray let me to the whole war alone opposed be these words their furious arms and rage appease· as when his calmer brow the god of seas lifts bove the troubled waves and views the main as lord and is by it beheld again

the raging winds their cruel murmurs cease

nor move the wings upon their foreheads peace is soon diffus'd o're all the calmed brine and on the silent shore smooth waters shine
this by the libyan subtile care descry'd strait by the poison of his plots he try'd their minds
for fabius as his father's heir plow'd a few acres which the name did bear of massicus renown'd for gen'rous vines these to advance his mischeivous designs which through the camp ambiguous rumours spread from fire and sword his spar'd this plot soon bred suspicion of the quiet of that place as if that he did privately imbrace a league to lengthen out the war
but all the cunning stratagems of hannibal the wise dictatour saw and understood
but among swords and trumpets thought it good to scorn their envy nor the wounds to shun of fame the hazard of a fight to run
till wandring up and down and oft in vain moving his camp now here now there to gain occasion to fight the libyan he enclos'd where woods and rocky hills we see with his divided troops
here him behind

the lofty

laestrigonian rocks confin'd

there with its moorish grounds linternum was
no use of souldiers or of swords the place affords but there severest famine all the plagues that lost sagunthus did befall exacting them oppress'd and fate an end seem'd to the arms of carthage to intend
now sleep all things by sea and land did hide with's gloomy wings and having lai'd aside

the labours of the day the pleasing rest

granted to men by night the world possest

but the

sidonian general the cares

that then enflam'd his heart and watchfull fears rob'd of the benefits of night while he left his unquiet bed and suddenly cov'ring his shoulder with a lyon's skin that lately spread upon the grass had been

his pallat in the field to

brother's tent

from's own not distant far directly went
he not degenerate in martial rites on a bull's hide then slept and by the night's great blessing eas'd his pensive thoughts and near fix'd in the earth upright his fatal spear on which his helmet hung upon the ground his sword and shield about it round his bow and balearick sling
not far from these a youthfull troop all try'd in war lay sleeping on the earth and near at hand his horse caparison'd doth grazing stand
his entrance mago wakes
brother said he with that takes up his arms what is't that thee thus stupifies then mago rose and all his troop then lying on the ground doth call with speed to arms
then hannibal began us fabius that so vigilant old man the sole delay to our propitious fates thus indispos'd by night exasperates to cares
you see how we encompass'd are with armed bands and how the souldier collected in a ring doth us invest but now since our affairs are thus distrest consider my design
we have within the camp an herd of oxen that have been

plunder'd from all the countrey round and now

as custom is march with the army to the horns and fronts of some of these will give a command dry twigs and sticks to ty which fir'd when once the heat shall scatter'd be the oxen sensible of pain will flee and on their necks the wandring flames will bear o're all the hill then seiz'd with sudden fear their centinels will from their stations runs and fear that something more by night is done
if this you like extream resolves delay refuse let's do't said he
with that away they go to other tents where in the field upon the ground his head upon his shield mong horses and spoils that by his hand in fight were taken· and with slaughter stain'd mighty maraxes lay and in his sleep a dreadfull cry as if engaged deep in fight by chance then gave and felt about with's trembling hand to finde his weapons out and his try'd sword
thus warring mago shakes the man and with his spear inverted wakes captain since now tis dark thy fury lay aside reserve thy valour for the day with policy we now must use the night for safe retreat and to conceal our flight into the woods my brother doth intend with kindled boughs ty'd to the horns to send the oxen where the passes guarded be by hostile bands and so our army free
let us be gone and this design shall be a document to fabius that we with policy contend
he makes no stay but joy'd at what he spoke they haste away

to stout acherra tent who satisfi'd

with little rest or ease had never try'd his sleep to lengthen with the night but still on as perpetual centinel serv'd and was wont to ease his weary steed by dressing him and alwaies bridled feed
now all their weapons whet and the dry'd gore wipe from the steel and to their swords restore their sharpness what the fortune of the place and time requir'd and what their duty was declar'd advising that whoe're did go as chief in the design might not be slow
then through the camp the word and orders run all mutually instruct what's to be done and importune they may no longer stay their fears inciting all to haste away while yet the dark and silent night might hide their flight
then to the boughs the fire apply'd from their large horns the flames aspiring rose
the mischief in an instant greater grows and th oxen shaking their tormented heads fan out a pyramis of fire that spreads it's basis largely and o'recomes the smoak
the beasts affrighted through the forest broke then o're the hills and rocky mountains fly as they were mad and as their nostrils by the flames besieged are they labour oft in vain to bellow while o're cliffs aloft through vallies vulcan wanders and ne're stands at all but shining on the neighb'ring sands as manifold appears as when at sea in a clear night the mariners survey innumerable stars or when upon garganus top a shepheard sitting down

beneath him sees calabrian forrests burn

which husbandmen to fertile pastures turn o're all the hills the flames with such a face appear to fly and they whose chance it was to be the guard believ'd they wandring fled none scatt'ring them and that they furious fed within the hills some thought that iove had thrown from his incensed hand his thunder down others that kindled sulphur gave them birth and from her secret caves th unhappy earth condemn'd to greater ruins threw the fire
the rutuli affrighted strait retire and from their station fly
then hannibal with speedy arms possess'd himself of all the passes and advantag'd by their fears insulting in the open field appears
yet vigilant in conduct of the war the wise dictatour had advanc'd as far as trebia and behind him left the sea of tuscany that it enough might be for hannibal the romane arms to shun and fabius who after him had gone and with his army close pursu'd his flight but that some sacred rites did him invite

to his paternal

gods
then as to rome he took his way a valiant youth to whom the chief command and conduct of the war was giv'n he thus with counsel doth prepare
if by the fortune of my actions thou minutius hast not yet learn'd to allow things warily perform'd nor words can thee lead to true honour or invite to flee unworthy things thou hast seen hannibal besieg'd
twas not the souldier nor all

our wings nor our throng'd legions thee

attest perform'd it but twas done by me
from the camp will not be long away onely permit that to the gods pay a solemn sacrifice and him again shut up by floods or hills if you refrain from fighting will give into your hands
in the mean time believe me for it stands with my experience in distress'd affairs tis safety to sit still though it appears honour to many and may please them too as the most glorious conquest to subdue an enemy by fighting yet to me to keep you safe it shall a triumph be
a full camp leave in thy hands and men free from all wounds to give them such agen to me thy glory and renown shall be

the libyan

lyon thou perhaps shalt see

these works assaulting
sometimes off'ring prey entice thee sometimes to flee away as if he fear'd thine arms but all the while he thinks on fraud and doth with fury boil
tis his desire to fight but let thy stay within the camp take all those hopes away
let this advice suffice but if thy minde and courage my entreaty cannot binde as dictatour by a pious right and strict command conjure thee not to fight
the camp by his advice thus fortified he pious left and to the city hied
but now behold with prosp'rous winds before the laestrigonian and cajetan shore a libyan navy plows the sea and comes into the port and all the ocean foams

with num'rous oars when from their chrystal caves

affrighted with the noise above the waves the nymphs rise and see the shore possess'd by hostile ships that then disturb'd their rest then full of fear with speed they all repair to those known coasts by them frequented where

teleboae kingdoms midst the ocean rise

and hollow thrones where mighty proteus lyes within a broken cave and largely laves the adverse rocks a prophet with his waves
he for he all things knew and what they fear'd when chang'd in various shapes he had appear'd and scar'd them hissing like a dreadfull snake then roaring like a lyon fierce thus spake
what is it nymphs that brings you hither tell why doth that paleness in your faces dwell why seek ye what hereafter shall befall to know to this the eldest then of all the italian nymphs cymodoce replies
thou know'st already whence our fears arise
what doth this carthaginian fleet that thus deprives us of our coast portend to us must the rhaetean empire cross the seas to other gods or tyrian seamen these our ports possess or from our native seat exil'd must we to atlas now retreat and dwell in calpe farthest caves then he rehearsing things long past ambiguously thus undertakes to shew ensuing fate
on ida when the phrygian sate and calling back his stragling bulls to feed in fertile meadows with his pipe of reed the fam'd dispute of sacred beauty heard then cupid who solicitous appear'd

observe the time the cygnets joyn'd

to mother's chariot drove a quiver shin'd upon his shoulder and a golden bow and with a nod to let his mother know there was no cause to fear shew'd he had brought that quiver to her aid with arrows fraught
some of his brothers comb her golden hair upon her others are imploy'd
her flowing garments to compose when sighing from her lips that like a rose blush'd to her sons this language fell
you see the day that must a faithfull witness be of your great piety to me
oh who would e're have this believ'd so long as you are safe that venus beauty and her face should question'd be for now what other grace remains to us if my artillery infected with most pleasing poison to you committed have by which you aw your at your pleasure who gives law to heav'n and earth then by my victory o're iuno and minerva let me see cyprus with idumaean palms abound and paphos with an hundred altars crown'd

saturnia enters on the other side

after her brother's bed resolving ide

the trojan judgment and disdain to bear

last

cytherea smiling doth appear

and through the grove and caves within the sheds fragrant odours from her sacred locks
nor could the judge endure to keep his place but dazzled by the beauty of her face fear'd onely lest he should appear to her to doubt
the vanquish'd goddesses transfer fierce wars beyond the seas and troy was soon with her unhappy judge quite overthrown
pious aeneas then by sea and land toss'd up and down in latium takes his stand with his dardanian gods while whales within the ocean shall swim and stars shall shine in heaven and phoebus from the indian main shall rise so long his progeny shall reign
no bounds of time their rule shall terminate but you my daughters while the thread of fate

doth run the dang'rous sands of

sasson flee

we aufidus swell'd high with blood shall see driving his purple waves into the main and you aetolian shades shall once again fight with the teucri in that field so long

ago condemn'd by an

immortal song

then punick darts the romane walls shall shake

and hasdrubal

metaurus flood shall make

to shine with slaughter
and then he that was

so secretly begot by iove

imbrace

with a severe revenge shall expiate at once his uncle's and his father's fate then shall he fill with flames eliza shore and force the libyan tormenting sore the bowels of italy to hasten home and him in his own countrey overcome

carthage in arms shall yield to him and he

shall from the name of africk famous be

from him

another shall arise by whom

the third fierce war shall be subdu'd and rome see him triumphant after byrsa fall bring libya ashes to the capitol
while he the secrets of the gods detects thus in his cave rejects both fabius and his counsel and with rage possess'd the fo endeavours to engage nor was the libyan wanting to foment and feed his fury
but with an intent entice him to embrace a greater fight with little loss sometimes dissembles flight
as when the fish allur'd by scatter'd baits in some clear brook forsake their deep retreats and swimming near the water's surface shine the cunning angler with his twisted line soon drags them to the shore
now fame which lies among the romanes like a fury flies
telling the fo was turn'd and hannibal in flight his safety found an end of all their miseries did then at hand appear if they to overcome permitted were
but that their valour had no other guid the one that did sad punishments provide for such as were victorious gainst his will
that he within the camp would shut them still and give command to sheath their swords again that so he might a just account maintain in arms and souldiers give a reason why they dare to overcome the enemy
the vulgar murmure thus and iuno fires the senate minds with envy and desires

of popular air
then madly they decree

things not to be believ'd and such as be the wish of hannibal such as they soon with too great danger wish they ne're had done
for now the army is divided and

minutius shares with fabius in command

the old dictatour free from passion saw and fear'd the ills that rash resolv might draw upon his countrey therefore full of care and pensive to the camp return'd and there sharing his social forces all the hills adjoyning with his neighb'ring eagles fills and there at once observes the libyan power and romane army from a lofty tower
while mad to perish or destroy his foes with sudden fury rash minutius throws the ramparts down and when on either side here the dictatour there the libyan spy'd him marching forth their minds with diff'rent care this to destroy that to preserve him are inflam'd
but he to arm with speed commands and leads from all defence his hasty bands
the libyan captain pours into the fight his forces all and thus doth them incite while the dictatour souldiers is away go on and bravely use this fighting day
behold the gods now to your wishes yield off'ring a battel in an open field
and since this opportunity is gain'd your weapons cleanse that have so long been stain with rust and satisfie your swords with blood
this fabius observing as he stood viewing the champagn ground and thou alass oh rome did'st sadly learn what fabius was

in so great danger this rash boy said he

now my colleague in arms shall punish'd be as he deserves that through so blind and mad a vote with so much danger durst invade our fasces
peevish tribes how slipp'ry are your pulpits see with what vain men the bar and forum throng'd now let the offices of war by them be equall'd and decrees ordain the sun to yield unto the night
their weakness the rash errour of this fight shall quickly rue and all the wrongs which they upon our common parent bring this day
with that he shook his spear and as a flood of tears gush'd from his eyes with tyrian blood said he my son these sad complaints must be suppress'd by thee
shall endure to see a citizen destroy'd before my face and these our troops or while am in place permit the libyan conquer if my heart were such they'd seem less guilty that did part and equal us but this my son believe and from thy aged sire as truth receive to be incens'd against our countrey is a sin so great that none to the abyss of hell can with a fowler crime descend
this our did to us commend and thus how good how great exil'd from home and banish'd long did'st thou camillus come into the capitol how many there by thy condemned hand then slaughter'd were had not thy thoughts been calm or had thy minde at all to anger or revenge inclin'd aeneas throne had chang'd its place and thou great rome hadst not upon thy hills as now

stood head of all the world
therefore my son

let all displeasure for my sake be gone let's hast to aid them with our social arms
with that the trumpet's intermix'd alarms sound through the camp and all with such a force rush on they bruise each other in their course
first the dictatour all things that withstand his speed the gates and bars with his own hand o'returns and to the battel breaks his way
with such a fury winds contend at sea when boreas sally's from th odrysian coast and with like rage by africus is crost the sea's distracted and to sev'ral shores each drives the billows while the tempest roars and the whole ocean wheresoe're it goes obeys now here now there with furious throws
so much of honour could not rise from all phoenicia subdu'd or byrsa fall as this great injury which first did spring from private envy did of glory bring to the dictatour
for by's conduct there at once he all those difficulties fear envy and passion with malicious fame and hannibal and fortune overcame
when hannibal perceiv'd them run amain down from the lofty camp into the plain his courage trembled and with sighs soon all his former hopes of their destruction fall
for he the romanes had encompass'd round with num'rous bands not doubting to confound them so enclos'd by darts that on them fall on ev'ry side
and then their general already griev'd for that unhappy fight the stygian waters and eternal night

had entred in his thoughts with sad despair

asham'd to hope that fabius would be there· to his assistance
but two valiant wings circling the battel the dictatour brings to his relief and then encompassing the libyan army with a larger ring their utmost troops behinde invests and those that late besieg'd the romanes doth enclose
alcides made him higher rise in fight and to appear much greater to their sight his lofty crest was strange ejecting rays in active vigour soon it self displaies through all his members while he jav'lins throws and storms with clouds of wounding darts his foes
such before he was old in prime of all

his years in war the

pylian general appear'd
then rushing on he turis sent to hell and stout malêo confident to cope with any who was known to fame and by his spear had gain'd himself a name
then butes maris arses garadus adherbes and conspicuous for height bove both the armies tylis dies who on the highest fortress could surprize the battlements
these at a distance all with darts but saph'arus and monesus fall by sword with them morînus as he sounds to fight with his shrill brass he deadly wounds on the right cheek and by the dying blast expell'd the blood quite through the trumpet past from's wounded jaws idmon the next to him who us'd o're nafamonian sands to swim dy'd by his lance for slipping where he stood upon a place o'reflown with reaking blood

endeav'ring to recover's feet again

and shun that slipp'ry place fabius amain upon him spurs his horse and to the ground nails him with's spear which left within the wound though trembling with his motion firmely held his carcass down and fix'd it to the field
honour's example likewise fires the minde of sylla crassus and metellus joyn'd with fannius and torquatus strong in fight above the rest all these in fabius sight engage amid'st their foes
but here in hast retiring to avoid a stone was cast against him bibulus unhappy on an heap of slaughter'd friends fell backward down and where his brigandine was gaping wide unhasp'd by frequent blows quite through his side a weapon's point that in a body stuck by chance upright into his bowels struck
sad fate hee'd scap'd marmarick troops and all the garamantian darts that he might fall by a neglected lance that was not thrown with an intent to wound him
breathless down he tumbled horrid paleness strait involv'd his youthfull beauteous face and life dissolv'd through all his limbs his arms hang loose and sleep with stygian darkness through his eys doth creep
from tyrian sydon sprang of cadmus race excited by his nephews cleadas came to the war and proud of the command among his aids a brave eöan band of archers led rich gems all over deck his golden cask and chains about his neck such when late wash'd and from the ocean rais'd

the

usher of the morn by venus prais'd

contends with other stars
in purple he

his horse in purple all his company in tyrian purple shin'd
he as he wheel'd his steed to th right and left about the field deluding brutus eager of the fight that by his hand a name so famous might extinguish'd be an arrow parthian backward lets flie nor doth it vainly strike but in his casca chin it sticks and penetrating deeply in the point obliquely wounding upward struck to his moist pallet and within it stuck
but brutus troubled at his friend's sad fate him that so oft did thus disseminate in seeming flight his cruel shafts no more sought with his nimble courser as before to overtake but his whole fury to his lance committing the swift weapon threw from the loose thong and where the chains devest loosen'd by running to and fro his breast into the upper part a deadly wound

the fixed

cornel gave down to the ground

he dying sinks and in his fall lets go from his right hand the shaft his left the bow
but with a better fate charmelus who soracte honour was did then pursue the fight for he his sword with blood had stain'd

of bragad who o're

iuba people reign'd

zeusis who of spartan phalanthus race a race implacable derived was and whom his mother a phoenician bare a fam'd laconian by him likewise there was slain
but nampsicus not daring to appear in fight before so fierce a fo

nor yet as fear perswaded thence to fly

crep'd through the bushes to an oak that nigh did stand and climbing to the top among the shady leavs conceal'd himself and hung upon the boughs that trembled with his weight him begging earnestly to shun his fate and leaping fearfull oft from bough to bough furious carmelus with a pike quite through the body pierc'd the fowler so in groves his lai'd when as his mark removes in silence strives on tallest trees with aim to strike with his encreasing shaft his game his life and blood gush out and as it flows the pallid corps hangs on the bending boughs
the romanes now the tyrians put to flight closely pursue
when of stupendous height upon a sudden a most dreadfull moor breaks forth his limbs black as the arms he wore
their lofty mains his sooty horses rear and all his chariot with new arts that fear might move adorn'd like to their backs appears
like plumes upon his crest like robes he wears as when of old to his infernal bed the dreadfull king of night eternal fled and in his stygian chariot bore away from aetna fields ravish'd proserpina
but cato then a youth and the renown

of the high walls of that

circéan town

where fam'd laertes nephew did command although he saw the latines make a stand all troubled in the front undaunted he spurs on his starting steed that sought to flee his way affrighted at the stygian shade
with that he quits his back and doth invade

on foot the chariot and the flying moor

behinde when strait his sword that trembled o're his neck his whip and reins together fall and suddenly an horrid paleness all his limbs through loss of blood doth overspread when cato with his sword lops off his head and bears it as a trophy on his lance
but now the fierce dictatour doth advance and through a globe with slaughter breaking where

a wofull sight the

gen'ral did appear

sinking through many wounds and loss of blood and poorly begging quarter with a flood of tears lamenting to behold him so protects him with his target from the fo and calling to his son my valiant boy said he now let thy valour wipe away this stain let us to hannibal return for his great kindness that he did not burn and wast our fields a due and just reward
the youth with these encouragements he heard and's father's arts rejoyc'd the troops that round the libyan stood constrain'd to quit their ground with's conqu'ring sword and clear'd the field again while hannibal was forc'd to quit the plain
as when a greedy wolf with hunger prest the shepheard stept aside or taking rest hath seiz'd a lamb and holds it trembling fast between his jaws if then the shepheard haste hearing it bleat to meet him in the way the wolf now fearfull for himself his prey panting between his teeth lets fall again and hungry to the woods retreats amain
at length the stygian darkness that was spread o're all the earth by a rude tempest fled

their hands were weary and they all confess

they did not merit safety with excess of sudden joys their minds distracted were like such that by some sudden ruins are oppress'd when they are freed again and night retires then wink and fear to see the light
this done his army number'd in the plain to camp upon the hills with joy again the old makes a safe retreat and then as rescu'd from the hand of fate the youth loud shouts raise to the stars and all express their joy with emulation call fabius their safety fabius their renown fabius their common father and the crown of all their hopes
then he that lately shar'd his troops to thank them with this speech repair'd most pious father if it lawfull be that we complain to life restor'd by thee oh why didst thou permit us to divide our camp and forces why didst thou abide so patient so calm those arms to yield to us which thou alone art fit to weild sinking beneath that charge with loss of blood we near the shades eternal lately stood
hither your eagles hither quickly bear your rescu'd ensigns here's our countrey here in this one breast the citie's walls abide and thou oh hannibal now lay aside thy frauds and known deceits the war with by fabius alone must manag'd be
this said when strait a reverend sight it was a thousand altars rise of turfs of grass compos'd and none or meat or wine essai'd to touch before devoutly they had pray'd and on the sacred table to the wise dictatour honour paid a sacrifice

elected by the people varro proves a fatal consul the delaies upbraids of fabius a list of all the aids that with the romanes joyn
the army goes to cannae fabius counsel's to oppose rash varro
what sad prodigies foreshow in heaven and earth the romanes overthrow

now fabius the first that made them see

the flying backs of cadmus

progeny

was by the romane camp and souldiers all their common parent stil'd by hannibal his onely fo impatient of delay the libyan raves
for that to have a day of battel the dictatour death must be expected and the aid of destiny was to be wish'd for while in arms he stood while fabius liv'd to hope for trojan blood was vain
for now the souldiers brought again their eagles and united all remain

under his sole command
with him alone

he must again contend and what upon his thoughts lay heaviest was that by delay he took the fury of the war away and by his art of sitting still had made the plenty of the tyrian army fade
and though an end by fighting could not be obtain'd or battel he his enemy had by his conduct lately overcome
besides the boasting celtae towards home began to look a people of a light unconstant minde fierce at the first in fight but if withstood soon quell'd
they griev'd to see a war should be maintain'd from slaughter free a thing to them unknown and while they stood in arms their hands were stiff and dry from blood
to add to this an inward grief and wound of civil envy did his thoughts confound for hanno thwarting all he did intend at home would not permit the senate send

to his assistance any aids at all

torn with these cares and fearing now the fall of his affairs iuno who knew the fate of cannae and with future things elate him with fresh hopes of arms and war inspires and fills his thoughts again with mad desires

for

anna call'd from the laurentine lakes

in this mild language her instructions takes
there is a youth in blood ally'd to thee call'd hannibal and from our belus he his noble name derives make haste away and the rude surges of his cares allay shake fabius from his thoughts who is alone the stop that italie not overthrown

fabius is now dismiss'd with varro he

hereafter must contend the war must be with varro wag'd
let him not wanting prove to fate but quickly all his ensigns move will be present let him haste away to th iapygian plains there trebia and thrasimonus fates shall meet again
anna a neighbour to the gods that reign in those chast woods thus answers
it would be unjust in me should delay said she your great commands but yet permit pray the favours to my antient countrey may with caution be retain'd and that the will and charge of my dear sister fulfill
though anna be esteem'd divine among the latine deities yet time with long ambages turning in obscurity hath drown'd the reason of antiquity why temples the ausonians should ordain to tyrian pow'rs or why where trojans reign eliza sister should be there ador'd
but keeping close to time will record what antient fame reports and briefly all the story tell from its original
when tyrian dido by her trojan guest forsaken was and all her hopes supprest within a secret place in haste with cares and love distract a fun'ral pyle she rears then takes the sword that fatal gift that by

her husband fled was giv'n resolv'd to dy

when strait hyarbas whom before she had rejected as a lover doth invade her kingdom and his arms victorious while her ashes yet were warm fix'd to the pyle

who durst while thus the nomades fierce king

prevail'd to their distress assistance bring battus by chance the reins of chief command

over

cyrene with a gentle hand

then held this battus was by nature kind and humane chances easily inclin'd with tears to pity and at first when anne a suppliant before him came began the fickle state of kings to apprehend and to relieve her did his hand extend
here she two harvests pass'd but could no more enjoy the aid of battus and that store his bounty did afford for then a fame was spread pygmalion to her ruine came by sea
she therefore from that kingdom flies and as if hated by the deities and no less hatefull to her self that she her sister's death did not accompany by fatal tempests on the sea was tost till with torn sails to the laurentine coast she driven was and sadly there a stranger to the people soil and air a fearfull tyrian stood on latine ground
when now behold aeneas having crown'd his labours with a kingdom to the place by chance with young iülus came his face she quickly knew and when he spy'd her there her eys fix'd on the earth and full of fear faln prostrate at iülus feet whose eys o'reflow'd with pity helping her to rise to's house he with a gentle hand convey'd and when with kind reception he'd allay'd her fears of danger with a pensive care desir'd unhappy dido fate to hear

then she with language fitted for the time

and tears her words protracting thus to him the story told
thou alone wert the true cause my sister both her throne and life enjoy'd her death and fun'ral fire alass that in it did not expire can witness this for when she could no more behold thy face sometimes upon the shore she sate sometimes she stood and as her eys pursu'd the winds with loud and mournfull cries aeneas call'd and onely begg'd that she might in the vessel bear thee company
soon after troubled in her thoughts again she to her runs amain where as she enters she is seiz'd with such a sudden trembling that she dares not touch her nuptial bed then mad with her embrace the starry image of face she hugs then thine on which at length she dwells with fixed eys and her sad story tells to thee and hopes an answer to obtain
but when love lai'd all hopes aside again the house she quits and flies unto the shore hoping the shifting winds might thee restore
at length fallacious levity invites her ev'n to magick arts and the dire rites of the massilian nation to descend
but oh what wicked errours do attend such prophets while they stygian pow'rs allure from hell and promise to her wounds a cure
what a sad act did deceiv'd the while behold she throws upon the horrid pyle all monuments and fatal gifts by thee on her bestow'd
with that thus lovingly

he interrupts her by this land swear

which in my wishes you did often hear by mild head to her and thee once held so dear most unwillingly oft looking back and troubled in my mind your kingdom left
nor had then declin'd my had not threatned bin by mercury who with his hand me in the cabine plac'd and drove into the sea with furious winds the flying ship away
but why though all advice is now too late did you permit at such a time as that that she without a guard in love should be so furious in broken murmurs she among her many sighs to this replies with trembling lips
then a sacrifice to stygian iove and his infernal queen to try if my poor sister might have been eas'd in her mind prepar'd and to the altars with all diligence drew the lambs with mine own hand for the night before was fill'd with horrour by a dream for thrice my sister call'd on you with a loud voice thrice on sychaeus who leaping for joy with a most chearfull face thought appear'd
but while strove to chace these fancies from my mind and as the day began that what saw might prosper pray the gods she frantick runs unto the shore and on the silent sands where you before had stood her frequent kisses fix'd and prest your with a kind embracing breast as mothers late deprived of their sons their ashes hugg
from thence away she runs

like a rude bacchinal her hair displai'd

to that high pile which she before had made of a vast bulk from whence she might explore all carthage with the seas and shore
then putting on the phrygian robe and chain enrich'd with gems when she to mind again had call'd the day wherein she first had seen these presents and the banquets that had been at your arrival made and how the long labours of troy you told while on your tongue with pity her ear depends then to the port her weeping eys she bends and off'ring to the gods in death her hair thus speaks
ye gods of lasting night who are by our approaching death much greater made be present beseech you and my shade o'recome with love and weary now of life receive with kind aspect aeneas wife and venus daughter who avenge the guilt of my sychaeus death these tow'rs have built of lofty carthage now the shade to you of that great body come
my husband who was fam'd for his kind love perhaps me there expects and would renew his former care
this said the sword that fatal sword which she thought a sure pledg of dardane love to be into her breast she thrusts her servants who beheld her with sad cries and shreeking through the palace run
the noise unhappy receive and frighted to the palace fly
like one distracted with my hands my face tear and strive to climb up to the place
thrice with that sword thought my self to kill as oft sounding on my sister fell

but when the rumour of her fate was spread

through all the neighb'ring cities thence fled to fam'd cyrene and by fate still cross'd from thence upon your coast by tempests toss'd now am cast
the trojan prince inclin'd to tears at this resolv'd to be more kind to her and now all sadness grief and care was lai'd aside and anne no longer there a stranger seem'd to be
but when the night all things by sea and land had cover'd quite her sister dido seem'd with sad aspect these words to her then sleeping to direct
can'st thou oh sister can'st thou long endure within this family oh too secure indulge thy self to rest and dost not see what dangers thee surround what plots gainst thee are lai'd or dost thou not yet understand how fatal to thy kindred and thy land the trojans are so long as sphears above with rapid the stars shall move and with her brother's light the moon shall shine upon the earth between the trojan line and tyrians there shall be no peace arise

be gone from hence

lavinia jealousies

now secret plots contrive and in her minde something of mischeif gainst thee is design'd
beside nor think that this is but a dream hard by numîcus with a gentle stream from a small fountain through a valley flows hast quickly thither and thyself dispose to safety there the nymphs with joy shall thee receive into the flood and thou shalt be in italy eternally ador'd a goddess
and as dido spake that word

she vanish'd into air
anne frighted by

these prodigies awakes and instantly through fear cold sweat o're all her limbs is spread
then clad with a thin garment from her bed she leaps and through a window that was low into the open fields doth speedy go untill numîcus in his sandy waves receiv'd and hid her in his chrystal caves
now when through all the world its beams the day had spread and in the trojan chambers they the tyrian lady miss'd with cries through all the latian fields they run and anna call
at length her footsteps to th neighb'ring flood they follow and as there they wond'ring stood the river from his chanel strait expell'd the stream and in the bottom they beheld mong the coerulean sisters anne who broke silence and to the trojans kindly spoke
since that when first the year begins is she divinely worshipp'd through all italy
when to this fight that did so fatal prove to italy the spightfull wife of iove had her instructed in her chariot light up to the stars again she takes her flight hoping full draughts of trojan blood she may at length receive
the lesser to obey the greater goddess hasts and strait to all besides unseen repairs to hannibal
sequestred from all company alone she finds him sadly ruminating on the dubious event of his affairs and war with anxious sighs to ease his cares with this kind language she salutes him
why most mighty king of cadmus progeny

dost thou persist to vex thy self with care

know that the angry gods appeased are to thee and now an eye of favour cast on th agenorides
away make haste draw thy marmarick forces out to fight
the fasces now are chang'd and fabius quite by a decree of senate now hath lai'd the war and arms aside it may be said with a flaminius thou hast now to do
me the great wife of iove nor doubt it true to thee hath sent in th oenotrian land religiously ador'd a goddess stand sprang from your belus blood
then quickly go and all the thunder of war's fury throw where high garganus doth it self display through fields unto the sea the place is not far distant thither all thy ensigns bear that rome at length may fall
this victory shall libya suffice
this said into the clouds again she flies
by these assurances of promis'd praise doth hannibal his thoughts dejected raise great nymph said he the glory of our line then whom by us no goddess more divine is held most happy with such tidings fraught thee after victoriously have fought at carthage in a marble temple will place and in her statue dido nigh to thee shall be ador'd
this said he then full of glad thoughts thus animates his men
now all your tedious cares your sense of ill and pains of my souldiers lay aside
we have appeas'd the wrath of heav'n the gods with us are pleas'd

hence is it that fabius can declare

discharg'd of his command the fasces are in other hands
now let me see those great and valiant acts which oft with so much heat you promis'd when excluded from the fight
behold a libyan deity this night hath promis'd greater things then we have done
then pull your ensigns up let us march on after the goddess and that land invade that by the name of diomed was made most fatal to the phrygians
while they encourag'd thus to arpos march'd away varro by stoln plebeian voices made

a consul who the

rostra did invade

with tyranny opens a spacious gate to ruin and draws on the citie's fate
this fellow basely born his parent's name

unknown into the

forum bawling came

with an immodest tongue and made by bribes and rapine rich humour'd th inconstant tribes by railing at the senate and so far prevail'd in rome then shaken by the war that he by whom had he with victory return'd it had been shame for italy to be preserv'd of all affairs the weight assum'd sole arbiter of her great fate
him mong the fabii and those names renown'd in war the scipios and marcellus crown'd with spoils to iove blind suffrages a stain

plac'd in the

fasti while the love of gain

and

mars field a greater mischief bred

for cannae then the arms of diomed
he as he was seditious busie still to foment envy and devoid of skill

to plead so was he weak in martial arts

and neither fam'd for courage nor for parts to manage such affairs hop'd yet among the valiant to be honour'd for his tongue and from the rostra urgeth for a fight
when therefore to the people full of spight

he had upbraided fabius for delay

against the senate too this boasting plea

he undertakes

quirites you to whom

belongs the chief command to you come your consul for commission now to fight
shall sit still or wandring o're the height of hills beneath me garamantians see and parched moors to share in italy or shall use that sword which now wear giv'n by your suffrage
good dictatour hear what tis the martial people now command
it is their will that the ausonian land be eas'd of libya war and of the fo
do they to war precipitately go who having suffer'd much now the third year with saddest miseries consum'd appear hast then take arms brave men your sole delay to triumph is a little march
that day which first shews you the fo shall overthrow the senate and the libyan war
then go with speed bound in latian fetters through the city hannibal in fabius view will lead
this boasting said out at the gates rushing to arms he strait precipitates like one that unacquainted with the arts to guide a chariot from the barriers starts gives the full reins with one with to'ther hand the whip imploys while he doth tott'ring stand

unequal to the steeds the

press'd by th wheels appears to be on fire and smoaks the chariot to and fro is toss'd with it the reins entangled flow
paulus who then for peace and war was joyn'd his colleague well perceiv'd the state inclin'd to ruin and by his unhappy sway its strength and glory quickly would decay
but the unconstant fury of the rude

and troubled people and a

wound renew'd

fresh in his memory complaints supprest and kept his swelling griefs within his breast
for when in younger years he had subdu'd illyrium the envious multitude upon his conquest foul aspersions cast and with unjust reports his laurel blast
thence of the cruel people he did bear still in his mind a rev'rential fear
but to the gods ally'd his pedigree from heav'n by fam'd progenitours might be deriv'd
his chief amulius could prove assaracus his ancestour he iove
and none deny'd who him in arms had seen that that his great original had been
to him as then he was about to take the field and quit the town thus fabius spake
if that thy greatest war thou dost believe to be with hannibal thou wilt deceive thy countrey paulus am loth my minde to speak thus freely but im'e sure thou'lt finde within the camp worse conflicts and a fo more fierce or in vain have sought to know events of war so long
lately heard him promise and if the ruins fear'd

that we shall suffer could weary be

of life and my old age so soon as he could see him he would fight the prosp'rous fo oh paulus should the eager libyan know this speech how near would our destruction be do believe that now the enemy stands ready in the plain and hopes to finde another consul of flaminius mind to fall into his hands
what men thou provoke mad varro or unskilfull how canst thou forthwith their camp and arms before discover and by thy delays explore how much the customs of the fo may thee avail how great his magazine may be or what the place's nature thou their kind of weapons soon wilt know and fortune finde standing on all their points
paulus thy just resolves to all his devious courses must opposed be if it be just in him afflict his countrey can it be a crime in thee to save it hannibal is now straitned for victuals his associates grow now weary of his friendship since the heat of war's allai'd here he finds no retreat to better quarters here no cities are to whose fidelity he can repair
nor can he here his youth again

scarce a third part of all those men remain

that with him from iberus came oh then continue firm and to our wounds agen the med'cine of a cautious war apply
if in the mean time th art invited by any propitious air and heav'n approve near to thy better fortune quickly move

paulus with sadness briefly thus again

this piety shall still remain with me thy minde unconquer'd general against the libyan i'le still bear
withall know there is such reason to from fight that hannibal now waxing old through thy delays perceivs the war to be almost suppress'd and at a stand but see the sad displeasure see the wrath of heav'n one consul believe to rome is giv'n to ther to carthage he draws with him all affairs and madly fears that rome should fall by any other hand then by his own she cruel from the tyrian senate none could more destructive choose no warlike steed to carry him against the fo hath speed enough
it grievs him that his march should be retarded by the night's obscurity
with swords half drawn he marches that no stay to draw a sword his fighting may delay
but ye tarpeian rocks and tow'rs that be sacred to iove through him ally'd to me and my thrice happy countrie's walls which now standing leave the witness of my vow where e're the common safety calls me will go and greatest dangers will defie but if still deaf to what shall advise the camp will fight shall no longer prize th enjoyment of my sons and dearest home nor like to varro me shall wounded rome returning see

silius italicus of the second punick vvar
the ninth book

the argument
the consul paulus as advis'd declines the fight forbidden by unhappy signs
rash varro urgeth for a day
a son in that sad night before the day begun his father flying from the libyan side vnhappy kills who bids him as he dy'd forewarn the romanes to avoid the fight his son this warning on his shield doth write and kills himself for grief
the fatal field is fought the romans miserably the libyans have the day
while fore his eys his men are slain the coward varro flies

while italy thus vext with prodigies the signs in vain of future ruin sees discover'd by the gods as if they might prove happy omens of the following fight the consul waking spends the night and now throws in the dark his jav'lins then as slow

upbraids his colleague and while yet twas night

would have the trumpets sound a charge and fight the libyans no less eager to engage
urg'd by the adverse fates with sudden rage out from the camp they sally and begin to skirmish
for the macae that had bin disperst for forage through the neighb'ring plain a winged showr of shafts like sudden rain pour on the romanes and before the rest mancînus who to be the first had prest to dip in hostile blood his weapon dy'd and with him many gallant youth beside
nor yet though paulus sadly did declare how cross the auspicies and entrails were would varro from the battel have abstain'd

unless the lot by which they did command

the camp by turns had thwarted his desire and forc'd the hasty fates a while retire
but yet no longer then a day could be between a thousand deaths and their decree allow'd
into the camp the troops return again while paulus ceaseth not to mourn seeing the reins of the next day's command were to be trusted in a frantick hand and that those souls were then preserv'd in vain from slaughter
for enrag'd and mad again for that he had the battel then delai'd dost thou thus now aemilius varro said thy gratitude and the reward repay of that thy guilty head or else have they from thee deserved such a base return who snatch'd thee from the laws and threatning urn command them to surrender to the fo their arms and swords or when to fight they go

cut all their off
but you whom

have often weeping seen commanded by the consul to retire or shun the fo no more expect the signal when you go to fight or slow commands let ev'ry man be his own leader and go boldly on in his own ways
when first the sun shall shed his morning rays upon garganus head these hands the ports shall open for you all then charge them quickly and this day recall which you have lost
thus he with mad desires to fight the discontented camp inspires
when paulus not the same in mind or face but as if after fight he'd seen the place strew'd with his slaughter'd friends and as if there in view the miseries ensuing were as when all hope of her son's life is past in vain his body in her last embrace a mother huggs and seems to be sensless with grief
by rome dear walls said he so often shaken by those souls which now night with a stygian shade surrounds and know no guilt forbear pray to run upon your ruin till the wrath of heav'n be gone and fortune's fury be consum'd
twill be enough if our new men shall dare to see the fo without a fear or if at all they will endure the name of hannibal
saw'st thou not when within the neighb'ring plain his voice was heard how soon the blood again from their pale faces fled and how their arms fell down before the trumpets shrill alarms fabius as you suppose was dull and slow to fight yet all those souldiers that did go

with those blam'd ensigns now in arms appear

so do not those that with flaminius were
but heav'n avert such things and if you are resolv'd my counsell to resist and pray'r yet hearken to the gods for know of old

this the grynaean

prophetess foretold

to all the world in former ages thee and this thy headlong rage presaging she divulg'd and as another prophet now plainly to thee here thy fate avow unless to morrow's ensigns be by thee restrain'd thou with our blood wilt ratifie the sybil words nor shall these fields be fam'd if thou persist from diomed but nam'd fatal from thee
thus paulus in whose eys enflam'd with grief the tears began to rise
and then a wicked errour stain'd the night for satricus made captive in a fight in libya to xantippus was a slave who him for's valour priz'd soon after gave to th autololian king
at sulmo he an house possess'd and left two sons to be there nurtur'd by their mother one they call mancînus other solymas to all known for his trojan name for his descent was dardane and his ancestour who went after aeneas fortune built and wall'd a city fair which solymon he call'd from his own name and mong italians fam'd by them corruptly now is sulmo nam'd
this satricus the autololian king among his barbarous troops did thither bring and on occasion us'd him there to teach getulians to know the latine speech

but when he found a possibility

pelignian walls and's native home to see to second his attempt he takes the night and quits by stealth the camp
yet in his flight he took no arms being fearfull to betray himself by's shield and naked went away
but when the spoils and dead within the field he spy'd mancînus strip'd his arms and shield he strait puts on by which his former fear was lightned but the body which he there had naked made and he whose spoils he wore was his own son there slain not long before by a fierce macian fo night growing on bout the first sleep behold his other son young solymus appointed by his fate then to relieve the watch without the gate from the ausonian camp advanc'd with speed to seek among the heaps o'th scatter'd dead mancînus body and by stealth interr his dearest brother but he had not far advanc'd when arm'd from the sidonian side coming up to him he a man espy'd with which surpriz'd into thy tomb he flies

aetolian

thoas and there skulking lies

but when he saw no souldiers in the rear and that alone i'th dark he wandred there out from the sepulchre he leaps and throws at's father's naked back as on he goes a jav'lin not in vain
his father who thought that some tyrian troop did him pursue and gave the wound about him look'd to know the authour of that unexpected blow but when with speed the conquerour advanc'd and from the arms a lustre glanc'd

and as the moon did then assistance yield

he plainly saw it was his brother's shield
enflam'd with rage i'me not thy son said he oh satricus of sulmo nor should be mancînus brother nor deserve a name among those nephews that directly came from dardan solymus should now thee permit false libyan with impunity to scape this hand
shall endure thee wear my brother's spoils before my face or bear the arms of a pelignian house away while survive or guilty see the day no my dear mother these i'le bear to thee a gratefull present and most fit to be a comfort to thy griefs for thy lost son that thou may'st them for ever fix upon his sepulchre and as he spake that word aloud he rush'd upon him with his sword
but satricus who now could hardly stand and faintly held his weapon in his hand hearing his countrey nam'd his wife and sons and arms cold horrour through his members runs and stupifies his sense his dying mouth at length this language to the furious youth breaths forth spare thy hand pray thee spare not that beg for longer life it were a sin in me to ask it but the stain of this my blood wish may not remain upon thy hand
am that satricus captive to carthage sprung from solymus now to my countrey by the tyrian brought
know my son twas not in thee a fault when first thou didst thy spear against me throw was a libyan then but from the fo

fled to you and hasted now to see

my dear wife's face prevented thus by thee
this target as came took away from thy dead brother but be sure to lay this with his arms excus'd upon his tomb but first be carefull soon as thou shalt come into the camp my last advice to bear to gen'ral paulus that he have a care still to protract the war and fight decline with hannibal whose auguries divine swell him with hopes that he shall shortly see an immense slaughter
but let varro be pray restrain'd for he as fame doth tell is eager still your eagles to impell
tis a great comfort as my life now ends that have giv'n this warning to my friends
but thy last kisses now bestow upon thy father lost and found at once my son
thus as he spake his helmet off he cast and with his trembling arms the neck embrac'd of's son amaz'd and strove with words his shame to cure and to excuse the weapon's blame that gave the wound
who knows said he my son or who can testifie what we have done doth not the night conceal the errour why dost tremble so thy breast more close apply to mine
why dost thou at such distance stand ev'n thy father do absolve thy hand and pray my labours ending it may close mine eys
the youth opprest with sudden woes gave no return of words to what he said but sighing deeply labour'd to have staid his blood and strangely weeping to have bound with his torn shirt the wound

at length among his many sighs thus he

breaks into sad complaints
doth fortune thee dear father to thy countrey and to us thus bring again or doth she cruel thus me to my father him restore to me happy my brother was thrice happy he who thought our father was destroy'd by fate but by tyrians untouch'd too late now know him by a wound
it would have been at least some comfort fortune to my sin had it been still left doubtfull but my woes no longer shall be left to the dispose of the unequal gods
while his complaints distracted thus he vents his father faints through loss of blood and into empty air his life resolves the youth with sad despair then lifting to the stars his eys thou moon who art sole witness of what have done by this polluted hand who by thy light did'st guid my fatal jav'lin in its flight into my father's body these mine eys and cursed sight said he while in the skies thou reign'st no more shall thee contaminate
with that his sword his breast doth penetrate yet he endeavour'd to sustain the wound till the blood on the ground his father's last commands he thus did write upon his target varro shun the fight then on his jav'lin's point his shield he hung and himself dying on his father flung
the gods these omens of the following fight to the ausonians gave and as the night conscious of all this wickedness gave way her shades retiring to the rising day

the carthaginian captain citeth all

his troops to arms the romane general the like performs and such a day as in no age before for libya doth begin
you need no words said hannibal t'excite your courage or provoke you to the fight but we have come from the herculean bounds with conquest to these ia~pygian grounds
we stout sagunthus have destroy'd to us the alps gave way and proud eridanus the chief of rivers in italian ground flows in a captive chanel trebia drown'd in humane blood flaminius who was flain by us a burthen to the tyrrhen plain lyes buried there and all the fields are fill'd with romane bones and since were never till'd
but now behold a day more bright then all these titles and which to our wishes shall afford more blood
this fight's renown to me a true reward and great enough shall be
all other things your conquest shall become and without chance of lots whatever rome hath hither from the rich iberian coast brought as her spoil or what she else can boast

in her

aetnaean triumphs or what more

sh hath basely ravish'd from the libyan shore your swords shall gain and you shall carry home all that to your victorious hands shall come
nothing of their vast wealth will as due to me your general demand for you hath the dardanian spoiler plunder'd all the conquer'd world so long
whoe're can call himself a native tyrian or can claim from his original a sarrane name

if him the fair laurentine land which now

sigaean swains your future slaves do plow delight or rather the buxentian fields where corn an the goddess yield i'le give him choice of lands and add to them these banks which tyber with his conquer'd stream doth largely water
but then whosoe're my dear companions doth now appear in arms and brings from byrsa farthest land as an ally his aids if he his hand stain'd with ausonian blood shall shew to me he shall a citizen of carthage be
nor let garganus or this daunian land deceive you at the very walls you stand of rome though far that citie's lofty site be distant from this place where we shall fight here shall she fall this day and henceforth shall need no more your valour to employ in war my souldiers but from hence you shall directly march into the capitol
this said their works and rampires down they throw and over all delays of trenches go while he the place well view'd in order'd ranks draws up his troops upon the winding banks
the barb'rous nasamonian bands were plac't in the left wing and the marmarick vast of body the fierce moors and macians massilian troops and garamantians with them the adrimachides that give themselves to war and love by it to live then all those people that inhabit on the banks of nile and from the scorching sun shelter their tawny bodies these their head and chief commander stout nealces led

but the right wing did valiant mago guide

plac'd where swift aufidus doth wandring glide by winding banks with crooked streams and there the active troops of rough pyrene were and with confused murmurs fill'd the shore there shin'd the warlike youths that targets bore
before the rest cantabrians appear and gascoins that no helmets use to wear with betick troops and him that fighting flings his flying lead from balearick slings
but the main battel hannibal commands which with his father's old victorious bands he strengthens and celtae who their troops oft muster on the banks of po
but where his course the river turn'd away so that the files unflank'd and open lay his libyan elephants in order stood their dusky backs all charg'd with tow'rs of wood which when they forward march'd up to the skies like battlements or moving walls did rise
but the numidian horse were left to scout on ev'ry side and scour the field throughout while he new force to his incensed men inspireth and insaable agen exhorting fires their thoughts by boasting he a present witness to each man would be and ev'ry person by his actions know and what a singing dart did throw
now from their works the legions varro drew from whence the rise of their destruction grew while joyfull charon busily made room in his pale river for the souls to come
the van affrighted at the signs of blood upon the hanging shield like statues stood

fix'd at the omen
near to that a face

of dread two bodies dead in their embrace
the fatal wound within his father's breast with his the son to hide it prest
at this they wept and then alass too late lament mancînus in his brother's fate
then the sad augury and looks alike in the dead bodies a fresh sorrow strike at length their errour's guilt and fates to be lamented and the arms that bid them flee the battel to their general they show
his thoughts now all a fire to paulus go with these said he for him whose fears now stand in his unmanly breast that guilty hand may move which stain'd with cruel slaughter when the furies punishment demanded then perhaps with's father's blood this charm did write
this said with threats his orders for the fight through all the army run with speed and where nealces led his barb'rous nations there himself with marsians samnites and with those the iapygians sent he doth oppose

but in the middle of the field where he

perceiv'd the libyan general to be against him he servilius commands to lead the vmbrian and picenian bands
paulus the right wing led and beside these attend the plots of nimble nomades scipio a party took with charge where e're he spy'd their troops within the plains appear he should advance and fight
both armies now drew near and by the running to and fro the confus'd neighing of the fiery steeds and clashing arms a sudden murmur spreads

it self through all the troubled troops as when

loud conflicts twixt the winds and seas begin their inward rage and storms that lave the skies the billows strait let loose and as they rise their threatning noise through all the trembling rocks from their foundations shaken by the shocks expire and surges from the bottom thrown with angry foam the lab'ring ocean crown
nor was this cruel storm of fate alone the labour of the earth dissension crept into heav'n and gods to war incites
here father mars and here apollo fights and neptune there vext cytherea here and vesta and alcides angry there for lost sagunthus
old cybele too and gods of mortals made· quirinus who first rais'd the romane state with faunus then pollux that lately with his had shifted his alternate life but there girt with a sword saturnia doth appear and pallas mong the libyan waters born and hammon too whose temples with an horn are circumflex'd and many lesser gods beside who coming from their bless'd abodes to see this fight with their approaches shook the earth and all their sev'ral stations took
some on the neighb'ring hills while others shrow'd themselves from mortal eys within a cloud
the heav'ns were empty left while all to wars descend and strait to the forsaken stars as great a clamour rose as when within phlegraean plains the giants did begin the fight with hercules or iove for all his did on the cyclops call

when the bold army did invade

his throne and mountains upon mountains lai'd
the charge so fierce no dart or spear before the rest was thrown but an impetuous showr of shafts together fell with equal rage and as they thirsting after blood engage the storm a multitude of both destroy'd
but where the sword more closely was imploy'd the greater number dy'd on whom the rest stood to maintain the fight and as they prest to strike a fo would spurn them as they groan
the sea as soon with raging billows thrown gainst calpe might remove it from its seat as all the libyan rage to a retreat could force the romanes or the romanes make the libyan bands their station to forsake
so close they fight no space was left at all for blows to miss or when they dy'd to fall· helmets gainst helmets clash and ev'ry stroke excuss'd the hidden flames
targets are broke gainst targets swords by swords are hack'd and feet on feet do tread so furiously they meet breasts against breasts are bruis'd and where they stood earth could not be discern'd o'reflown with blood and the thick clouds of arrows as they fly take from their eys the day and hide the sky
those of the second rank as if they fought i'th front with their long pikes and lances sought to wound the fo and those that farthest stood with missile weapons labour'd to make good the fight with those were foremost all the rest with clamour their desire to fight exprest and with their horrid shouts the enemy provoke
and now all sorts of weapons fly

some hard'ned stakes pines burning others fling

and weighty piles
these fatal pellets sling those darts and which would shake the strongest wall huge stones from the phalarick engines fall and through the clouds the singing arrows fly
how can hope ye goddesses whom religiously adore this day to show to future times can you such pow'r allow ye learned virgins to my mortal song and trust the cannae to a single tongue if you affect our fame nor shall decline to give assistance to our high design hither from your parnassus hither all your sacred lays and father phoebus call
but maist thou noble romane still appear as constant and thy future triumphs bear with as great courage as adversity thou then didst meet such maist thou ever be nor tempt the gods to try if those that are deriv'd from troy can bear so great a war and thou rome no more with tears deplore thy dubious fate but rather now adore those wounds that shall eternal praise to thee produce for shalt never greater be but sink in thy success and by the name of former miseries defend thy fame
now fortune shifting sides between them went deluding with sad doubts of the event the rage of both and furious mars so long as hope between in equal ballance hung rag'd in their arms alike
so have seen the standing corn while the stems were green mov'd by a gentle wind wave to and fro the weighty ears which as they nodding go

to this side then to that alternately

the sev'ral motions of the wind obey
at length nealces with confused shouts brings on his barb'rous troops and charging routs the adverse wing the ranks disorder'd through the intervals the fierce victorious fo breaks on the trembling files and strait a flood that like a torrent rush'd of reeking blood runs on the plain
none falling are by spears thrust on their faces for the romane fears

wounds on the back and on his breast receives

his cruel death and life with honour leavs
among the first affecting still to be i'th hottest of the fight and equally to meet all dangers stood brave scaevola who scorning to survive so sad a day sought worthy his great ancestour to fall and dy beneath that name perceiving all was lost our life how short soe're it be now in despight of fate let us said he extend
for valour is an empty name unless in death's approach a lasting fame by suff'ring bravely or by wounds we gain surviving honour
speaking thus amain into the midst where the fierce libyan hand cut out his way through those that did withstand he like a tempest falls and there he slew tall calathis and with his sword quite through his body pierc'd as boasting he put on the arms of one there slain strait down upon the ground he tumbles biting with his teeth the hostile arms the tortures of his death by that suppressing as he groveling lay
neither could gabar or stout sicha stay

with their joint valour his impetuous rage

for valiant gabar as he did engage lost his but sicha mad with grief and coming rashly on to his relief stumbling by chance upon his sword doth wound his naked foot by which upon the ground he falls and by the hand of's dying friend lies prostrate
this his fury in the end nealces fatal rage upon him brought who by so great a name incited sought the honour of his fall and strait a stone torn from the neighb'ring rock and tumbled down by the swift torrent from the mountain took and threw it at his face his jaws were broke asunder with the weight his face no more its form retains mix'd with thick clots of gore his brains flow through his nose and both his eys dash'd from his mangled front he falls and dyes
then marius fell endeav'ring to relieve casper his friend and fearfull to survive his death both youths in age alike both poor alike and both sacred praeneste bore they joyn'd their labours and both jointly till'd their neighb'ring fields they both refus'd and will'd still the same things their minds alike through all their life
a wealthy concord in a small estate
they fell together and expir'd in fight together as they both desir'd
their arms the trophy of simethus were
but such a benefit of fortune there the libyan could not long enjoy
for now the valiant scipio with a threatning brow came on sore griev'd to see his cohorts fly and varro cause of all their misery

with curio and brutus from

the first great consul sprung that rescued rome these by their valour had the field regain'd had not the libyan general restrain'd with a fierce charge his troops about to fly
who when far off he varro did espy engag'd and near him moving to and fro the lictour in his scarlet coat know that pomp know the ensigns of your state said he such your flaminius was of late thus speaking by the thunder of his shield his fury he proclaims through all the field
oh wretched varro thou might'st there have dy'd with paulus had not angry heav'n deny'd that thou by hannibal should'st there be slain
how often to the gods mightst thou complain that thou did'st scape the libyan sword for there bringing thy safety when thou did'st dispair of life upon himself brave scipio all the danger turn'd nor was fierce hannibal unwilling though by that diversion he the honour of opimous victory had lost thee for a greater fo to change and by that offer'd combat to revenge on him the rescue of his father near ticinus
now the champions both appear from sev'ral quarters of the world then whom earth never yet beheld two greater come within the lists in strength and courage held both equal but the romane prince excell'd in piety and faith
then from the cloud wherein from mortal eys the gods did shroud themselves leap'd forth to view the fight more near for scipio mars and pallas full of fear

for hannibal
the champions both abide

undaunted but their entrance terrifi'd the armies
round about thick gloomy fires where pallas moves her gorgon mouth expires and dreadfull serpents hiss upon her shield her eys like two great comets through the field disperse a bloody light and to the skies from her large crest the waving flames arise
but mars the air disturbing with his spear and cov'ring with his shield the plain doth wear his mail which by the lab'ring cyclops made aetnean flames through all the field displai'd and with his radiant cask doth rising strike the stars
the champions on the fight alike intent though traversing with watchfull eys their ground perceiv'd the armed deities approach and glad that they spectatours were increas'd the fury of their minds
and here a jav'lin pallas from the libyan side lets fly with a strong force which soon espy'd by mars instructed to afford his aid by that example of the furious maid strait his aetnean sword into the hands o'th youth he puts and greater things commands
at this the maid incens'd her visage burn'd in flames of rage and she so strangely turn'd her glaring eys that in her dreadfull look she gorgon overcame as then she shook her aegis all her snakes their bodies rear'd and at her first assault ev'n mars appear'd a little to give ground the goddess still pursu'd and part of the adjoyning hill torn up with all the stones that on it grew gainst mars with all her force and fury threw

the horrour of its fall diffused o're

the plain frights saffon with a trembling shore
but when the king of gods this fight's intent perceiv'd involv'd in clouds he iris sent with speed their too great fury to allay and thus instructs her
goddess haste away to the oenotrian land and there her rage command thy sister pallas to asswage bid her not hope to change the fix'd decree of fate and likewise tell her that if she desist not for the poison and the fire of her fierce minde know and check her ire against the romane she shall understand how much the dreadfull thunder of my hand excells her aegis
when tritonia knew this a long time uncertain what to do and doubtfull in her thoughts if she should yield her father's arms well we will quit the field said she but when w· are thus expuls'd will iove hinder us to behold from heav'n above garganus fields reeking with blood
this said under an hollow cloud the furious maid to other places of the battel took the libyan general and earth forsook
but mars the goddess gone recalls again their courage and dispers'd through all the plain encompass'd with a cloud as black as night with his own hand strait recollects the fight
the romanes now their ensigns turn and fear quite lai'd aside the slaughter ev'ry where renew
then aeolus who o're the winds is king and them within a prison binds who boreas eurus corus notus and the rest ev'n doth command

at iuno suit whose promises were great

furious

vulturous whose imperial seat

is in th aeolian plains into the fight let's loose for then the goddess took delight by him to vindicate her cruel ire he having div'd in aetna deep and fire conceiv'd strait raising up his flaming head into the air with horrid roaring fled from thence and through the daunian kingdoms blows clouds of congested dust and where he goes the dark'ned air from all as if the day were spent their sight hands voices took away
then gainst th italians faces globes of sand sad to relate he drives and his command to fight against them doth with rage pursue and with that weight of ruin overthrew the souldiers arms and trumpets and reverts upon the rutuli their flying darts and frustrates with his adverse blasts their blows but all the weapons that the libyan throws he seconds and their jav'lins and their spears as with the loop assisting forward bears
the souldiers now chok'd with thick dust and breath stopp'd twixt their jaws that poor ignoble death lament while hiding in the troubled air his yellow head and strewing all his hair with sand vulturnus with his roaring wings sometimes flies at their backs and sometimes flings himself against their faces in a storm that whistling loud whole cohorts doth disarm some that press'd on and ready with a blow to fix i'th'throat of the fo their swords he in the very stroak withstands and entring to a wound pulls back their hands

nor was enough that thus the romane arms

and men he spoil'd but with loud bellowing storms gainst mars himself his fury he exprest and twice with shook his lofty crest
while thus aeolian fury did engage the latine troops and mars provok'd to rage pallas near whom saturnia stood to iove thus speaks
behold what billows mars doth move against the libyans with what slaughters he himself doth glut is't not your will said she pray that iris now to earth descend though when was there did not intend the teucri to destroy for let your rome reign with my pledg and my palladium there still remain yet was loath the light of my dear libya hannibal should quite extinguish'd be or that in prime of all his years so great beginnings now should full here iuno took the word and from a sence of her long labours yes said she that hence the world may know how great iove empire is how much his pow'r how much his wife by this all other gods excells now let thy fire the tow'rs of carthage nothing we desire destroy the tyrian army sinking down through gaping earth in stygian waters drown or else o'rewhelm them in the neighb'ring main
to whom iove mildly thus replies
in vain you strive with fate and feeble hopes prolong that youth oh daughter against whom so strong so furious thou didst fight shall overcome the africans and shall from that assume that nation's name and shall transport withall the libyan lawrel to the capitol

and he on whom such courage wife by thee

such honour is bestow'd so fates decree shall turn his arms from the laurentine land nor do the limits of his mischief stand far off the day and hour approach with haste wherein hee'l wish that he no alps had past
this said he iris sends away with speed to charge the god of war he should recede and quit the fight
he not at all contends with those commands but murmuring ascends into the clouds though trumpets in the fight wounds blood and arms and clamours him delight
the gods no more contending and the plain now clear'd from mars the libyan again from the remotest part where he to shun celestial arms retir'd came furious on and with loud shouts along his foot and horse his towred elephants and all the force of's batt'ring engines drew and as he spy'd a valiant youth that with his sword destroy'd his lighter troops his anger sparkling in his bloody cheeks what god said he agen or what dire furies thee minutius thus drive on thy fo that thou once more to us dar'st trust thyself where now is fabius made thy father by our arms to give thee aid wretch tis sufficient once to scape from me with this proud language he a lance lets flee that swift as from an engine thrown his breast peirc'd through and with the stroak his speed supprest
nor is't enough the sword doth rage they send fierce beasts and the italian youth contend with monsters
for well mounted lucas rid up to the moor that with his spear did guide

the elephants commanding him excite

with greater speed the heard into the fight
the warlike beasts then driv'n on and goar'd with frequent wounds made haste and strangely roar'd with flames and men and darts the lofty tow'rs on their pale backs were arm'd whence furious showrs of stones fell on the troops and where they move thick storms of shafts as from the clouds above the libyans from their flying castles throw while a long wall of teeth as white as snow runs through the ranks and with their points declin'd from the bow'd top the spears of iv'ry shin'd
here among others full of fear a youth call'd vfens through his armour by the tooth of one of them was struck and born through all the troubled ranks while he in vain doth call for help the point where quilted thick was ty'd his lightly pierc'd by his and his unwounded body lifting high clash'd gainst his shield
his magnanimity the sudden danger not at all dismaies but turning that to his praise now near the forehead of the furious beast through both his eys his sword he quickly prest
when strait enraged by the fatal wound rising upright she tumbles to the ground the tow'r drawn backward by its weight and then the elephant depriv'd of sight the men and arms a spectacle of terrour all are crush'd together in her sudden fall
the romane to withstand the fury of these monsters gives command that burning torches wheresoe're they go should be oppos'd and sulph'rous flames to throw

into their tow'rs
this with all speed obey'd

the elephants they suddenly invade whose smoaking backs with flames collected shin'd that driv'n on by the tempestuous winde through their high bulwarks fire devouring spred as when on rhodope or pindus head a shepheard scatters fire and through the groves and woods like an hot plague it raging moves the leavy rocks are fir'd and all the hills leaping now here now there bright vulcan fills
but when the burning sulphur once begun to parch their skins th unruly monsters run like mad and drive the cohorts from their stand neither durst any undertake at hand to fight them but their darts and jav'lins throw at distance burning they impatient grow and through the heat of their vast bodies here and there the scatter'd flames encreasing bear till by the smooth adjoining stream at last deceiv'd themselves into they headlong cast and with them all their flames that still appear bove the tall banks till both together there in the deep chanel of the flood expire
but where the fight continued still nor fire had vex'd the elephants from fatal hands now darts now stones on the rheteian bands and winged lead at distance fall like hail
as when an army doth a fortress scale through steep ascents or storms a fenced tow'r
worthy himself and a more happy hour here mutius rais'd his hand and nearer goes in his attempt unhappy to oppose their fury with his sword but with a breath expiring heat and murmurs threatning death

a furious monster caught him from the ground

and in her winding trunk his body bound which toss'd aloft into the air and lash'd oft gainst the earth was all to pieces dash'd
amidst these slaughters soon as paulus spy'd varro in arms upbraiding him he cry'd now let us meet with hannibal whom thou plac'd fore thy chariot bound in chains didst vow to give the city
oh unhappy rome and people fatal in thy favour whom from the foul guilt of so great ills no time can e're absolve or purge thee from this crime
which shouldst thou rather wish had ne're been born varro or hannibal thus with sad scorn while paulus spoke the libyan furiously advancing at the backs of them that fly ev'n in their gen'ral view all shafts provokes
the consul helmet by their furious stroaks bruis'd and his arms all shatter'd paulus throws himself more fierce at this among his foes
but varro having lost his courage quite while paulus to another place the fight pursu'd strait wheels about and with his hand turning his horse said thou dost justly stand corrected rome that did'st to varro give command in war while fabius is alive
but now what civil discord in my minde what sad dissension of my fate finde what secret fraud of destinies all these torments will determine in my fall
but oh some god my sword withholds and me reserves alass for greater misery shall live then and to the tribes agen the fasces stain'd with blood of

and broken thus return and as go

my face to other angry cities show or then which nought more cruel could for me by hannibal be wish'd fly hence and thee oh rome behold more his distracted fear had utter'd but the enemy drew near and charging him more close with darts his steed snatch'd the loose reins and fled the field with speed

the tenth book

the argument
paulus great valour and what slaughters he at cannae made
he is advis'd to flee but thoughts of flight rejects
by hannibal christa with his six sons together fall
servilius by viriathus slain by paulus hand is soon reveng'd again and fighting midst his foes at length he dies the libyan celebrates his obsequies commends his valour and his noble end
their counsels who their countrey did intend to quit by scipio are suppress'd
to rome without all pomp doth consul varro come
the multitude incens'd against him are by fabius appeas'd
the slaves for war are arm'd the senate passeth a decree that none that captiv'd are shall ransom'd be

when paulus saw the adverse fight encreas't as when with spears encompass'd a wilde beast leaps on their points and by his wounds doth know where to direct his rage and choose a fo

into the thickest of the globes he goes

and to all dangers doth himself expose and seeks a death from ev'ry valiant hand upbraiding thus his flying men oh stand stand stoutly to and in your breasts receive the sword nor wounded in your backs thus leave the world there nothing now remains at all for us but the sole glory of our fall
me to the shades below you all shall finde your leader
then swift as the northern winde or winged shafts which in dissembled flight the parthian backward shoots into the fight and where unmindfull of his tender age paetus like mars in courage did engage he rush'd into the mid'st of all his foes and the youth whom light vascons did enclose and fierce cantabrians did with darts surround freed from their cruel arms while they gave ground and trembling fled
as when a goat in view through a large plain the huntsmen close pursue and in the chase the weary beast so nigh approach they think to catch't if suddenly gnashing his teeth a lyon from his den before their eys appears their colour then and blood flies from their cheeks their weapons all inferiour to their danger they let fall and flying think no more upon their prey
now with his sword on such as in his way oppose he press'd and such whom baser fear made fly with darts he follows in the rear
fury and rage delight him and to crown his deeds with honour by his hand alone a multitude of nameless people fall
and if another paulus there mong all

the dardan had been cannae its name

had surely lost and his fame
at length his wing declin'd and suddenly the front gives way and all together fly
there whom cingulum sent from her lofty walls there ocris whom with opiter setia sent from fertile hills
their deaths were different though the sidonian join'd the time for there shot through the hip fell labien here one through the shoulder other through the knee the brothers wounded him accompany
and there macaenas who of antient fame through the maeonian land his noble name from tyrrhen kings deriv'd wounded quite through the groin a tyrian jav'lin likewise slew
but through the thickest paulus all desires of life and hannibal charg'd furiously and thought his destiny could onely cruel be if he should dy and hannibal survive
fearing this rage for that if once in fight they did engage so great a storm and tempest could not be without great mischief iuno instantly

frighted metellus shape assuming why

consul said she sole hope of italy dost thou renew thy rage in vain while fate resists if paulus live the romane state may stand if otherwise thou draw'st with thee all italy
oh paulus can it be that thou wilt while the state thus totters go to hazard gainst so insolent a fo thy sacred head for now so flush'd in war is hannibal that with the thunderer

he dares contend and varro beheld

when first he wheel'd about hath left the field himself reserving for a better day
allow the fates their time and while you may from death redeem your soul that's greater far then ours you soon may have another war
to this with sighs the general reply'd
and is't not cause enough if nought beside did move me that now should wish to dy in arms when to an act so monstrous metellus urging hear thou fool away
fly oh fly hence with speed nor heav'n pray thee in the back may hostile weapons wound but with thy varro mayst thou safe and sound enter the walls of rome dost thou think me worthy so base a life and not to be as worthy coward of a nobler end because the libyan who dares contend forsooth with iove permits it oh thou base degen'rate issue of a valiant race when should choose to fight with whom should desire to cope but such an one that by my hand subdu'd or by his might give to me a name that after death shall live thus chiding mong his foes himself he threw and as acherras covertly withdrew from the throng'd maniples and sought retreat to the main body with more nimble feet him through the thickest ranks with targets fill'd and constipated arms pursu'd and kill'd
so belgick hounds an hidden boar pursue and with sagacious noses drown'd in dew through devious ways the doublings of the beast detect and all his footsteps closely prest

through thickest groves where cannot come

to beat still follow nor desist they from the chase untill they have him in the winde and in some thicket close at covert finde
when iuno saw that paulus could not be by words diverted but went on strait she gelastes shape puts on and hannibal as slow exciting thus to fight doth call
this way thy weapons turn hither thine aid eternal fame of carthage bring she said to such as it implore the consul near the river fights and horrid slaughter there commits nor canst thou greater honour gain by any fo that shall by thee be slain
thus she to sev'ral conflicts doth divide the furious youth while near the river's side old christa with's six sons their valiant hands employ'd and sore opprest the libyan bands
tuder where he was born no wealthy town was held yet not obscure was of renown as warlike mong the vmbrian people where her youth in feats of arms and slaughters were train'd up whence this old chearfull captain led a valiant phalanx who when they had fed their swords with humane slaughter overthrew with frequent wounds an elephant and to her fall add flames that instantly devour a joyfull sight to them her armed tower when strait an helmet's lightning struck their eys and they perceiv'd the trembling plumes to rise on the large crest
old christa by that light soon knew the man and drew into the fight his troop of sons commands them all to throw their darts and not to fear the flames that flow

from his fierce countenance or burning crest

as when an eagle carefull in her nest to nourish such a brood as may be fit to bear iove arms against the sun doth set their faces and by their undazled eys through those bright rays her doubtfull issue tries
and now to teach the rest what they should do with a weak force a single dart he threw which though it nimble past the middle air but lightly pierc'd his golden mail and there stuck loosely and by that weak stroak betrai'd the old man's hand
to whom the libyan said what rage thy hand with age now bloodless grown to vain attempts provokes thy cornel thrown so feeble is that our callaick gold it scarce can raze thy weapons now behold thus to thee return
better by me in war the memorable youth shall be instructed
speaking thus he forward prest and pierc'd with his own dart old christa breast
but from the other side six darts are thrown from six right hands and then six spears come on with equal fury
as in libya when a is chas'd into her den her angry whelps leap forth and strive in vain with tender teeth the combat to maintain
but hannibal with arms encompass'd round consum'd their shafts and weighty spears that sound at ev'ry stroak with horrour through the field strongly and with his batter'd shield repells nor can those many wounds that he hath giv'n nor all those slaughters satisfie his rage unless he with the father join the sons in death and quite cut off the line

then abaris who bore his arms and there

enflam'd the fight and him did ev'ry where attend he calls with shafts supply me still for there a troop that must be sent to hell and frets with darts my mail they instantly shall finde the fruits of foolish piety
this said the eldest lucas with a dart he penetrates the point prest through his heart upon his brother's arms he backward sinks next volso who in haste advancing thinks to draw the fatal weapon from the wound a pile that mong the dead by chance he found he through his beaver strikes into his nose then vesulus who slipping as he goes faln in his brother's blood he with his sword cuts off and barb'rous valour and abhorr'd his helmet fill'd with his dissever'd head flung like a missile shaft at those that fled
next telesinus strucken with a stone upon the back where to the twisted bone the joints are knit fell and beheld withall his brother quercens by a sling to fall dead to the ground while he expires the light of life and shuts his dubious eys in night
but perusinus weary through his fear running and grief though still he angry were with feeble steps retiring through the plain and sometimes standing to resist was slain by a stake which he that bare the arms of hannibal snatch'd newly there from a slain elephant the oak fix'd deep into his groin the furious stroak turn'd him upon his back
his cruel rage the youth with pray'rs endeavour'd to asswage

but as he gap'd his mouth with stygian fire

is fill'd and in his lungs the flames expire
at length with all the rest christa a name through all the vmbrian land of antient fame fell like a lofty oak that long had stood observ'd and holy in its native wood when struck by iove and sulph'rous flames devour the old and sacred branches to the pow'r o'th fire at length it yields and covers all the trees beneath it in its spacious fall
while hannibal thus rageth near thy flood

fam'd aufidus the

consul with much blood

having reveng'd his future death the war pursu'd as if he had been conquerour
there lay huge phorcus mong a thousand dead come from herculean calpe gorgon head carv'd on his shield about that dreadfull face the goddess's original and race him daring to oppose and vaunting high the antient names o'th monstrous family of fam'd medusa whose dire looks alone converted the beholders into stone as he too forward stoop'd and at left thigh too eager reach'd the valiant consul by the helmet caught and dragging headlong down upon his knees deep in his back doth drown his sword where bout his reins his belt was bound he from his gaping bowels on the ground spews streams of blood and the aetolian field to the atlantick prince a grave doth yield
amidst the slaughters furious in the rear

with sudden terrour other

troops appear

and charging fiercely unexpected fall upon the romanes
these had hannibal

instructed in all fraud and to that art

of fighting train'd who faining to desert the punick camp arm'd with deceit their hands and arms had yielded on the romane bands then busie in the slaughter with a rage united fly and all their rear engage nor did they weapons want slaughter affords a large supply of jav'lins darts and swords
but valiant galba whose still pious love to virtue no cross fortune could remove seeing an ensign taken by the fo pursues with speed and with a fatal blow the conqu'rour fells but striving to regain the eagle which his dying hands retain and would let go but slowly at the last pierc'd by amorgus sword who came in haste to's friend's relief he fell and in those great attemps unhappy sadly met his fate
but now as if enyo rage were still unsatisfi'd vulturnus in one hill of dust rolls all the field and the white sand throws up and such as labour'd to withstand his fury with strong blasts that strangely roar to th farthest part of all the champagne bore and gainst the hollow banks their bodies thrown and bruis'd within the swelling flood did drown and here unhappy in his silent fate the river curio life doth terminate
for while with inward fury boiling he labours to stop the romane troops that flee and in their way himself opposing stood driv'n headlong by the throng into the flood i'th troubled waves he sunk and born away dead in the adrîack sands inglorious lay

but the brave consul whose unshaken minde

the worst of ills could bear who ne're inclin'd to stoop to fortune meets the conqu'ring fo with equal fury and himself doth throw amidst their thickest arms encourag'd by a martial heat and confidence to dy when viriathus whom th iberian land obey'd pursuing with a fatal hand a fo now tyr'd and weary'd in the fight near unto raging paulus and in sight

cuts off
oh grief oh tears

servilius there

next paulus the best part of all the war fell by a barb'rous hand and in his fall alone with envy we may cannae call unfortunate
the consul his sad ire no more endures and though the winds conspire to rob him of his arms and blind his eys with dust yet through a cloud of sand he flies and him then tuning as tis us'd among th iberi on his shield a barb'rous song invades and through his left pap driving past his weapon to his vitals this the last of all his slaughters was no more could he in fight his hand imploy nor rome for thee in future wars must noble paulus stand
for an huge stone thrown from a private hand dash'd on his head and deep into his skull his batter'd helmet beats and fills it full and all his face with blood retreating then against the neighb'ring rock as he doth lean now almost choak'd with dust before his face besmear'd with gore his target he doth place like a fierce lyon lighter shafts represt and scorn'd when piercing deep into his breast

at length he feels the steel amidst the field

he trembling stands and patiently doth yield to ev'ry weapon while about his nose his jaws and main a bloody riv'let flows and sometimes turning his weak limbs about from his wide mouth he foaming goar doth spout
but then fierce hannibal spurs on his steed where e're the storm or conqu'ring sword doth lead where furious troops and where those monsters are that with their iv'ry teeth maintain the war
here overwhelm'd with darts when piso spy'd the libyan captain over bodies ride raising himself upright upon his spear pierc'd through his horse's flank attempting there in vain to leap upon him being down
to whom the angry libyan who soon himself recover'd though his plunging steed pitch'd him upon his shoulder when they're dead do thus the romane ghosts revive said he to fight in death nor will they quiet be this said into his body as he strives to rise up to the hilts his sword he drives
but his foot wounded with a cretan shaft as lentulus full speed on left the field the stones besmearing with his blood and with a stern aspect to th stygian flood sinking he paulus spy'd at that sad sight his mind's distracted he's asham'd of flight
then rome appears to burn and hannibal ev'n at the gates to stand then first of all the field that italy devour'd he saw
what then remain'd but the next day might draw the tyrians to the town at length he spake to paulus thus dost thou the helm forsake

in such distress the gods my witness are

unless thou guid us through this cruel war and live though gainst thy will in such a storm paulus grief made his language sharp more harm then varro thou wilt do
then take pray of rome now sinking state thou onely stay this horse upon my shoulders will take thee up and set thee safe upon his back
as this he spake the consul spitting blood from his torn mouth replies go on make good thy father's virtues why should we despair so long as such brave souls remaining are in romulus his empire spur thy steed which way thy wounds permit thee
let with speed the be shut for suddenly this sad destruction to the walls will fly and pray advise that fabius may command in chief blind rage my counsel did withstand
and what of my spent life remaineth now but that to the rude multitude show that paulus dares and knows well how to dy for thus consum'd with wounds to them shall be born what would the libyan give that me turning my back in fight he once might see paulus hath no such thoughts nor will go so poor a soul unto the shades below
no am one but why do delay thee thus with mild complaints haste thee away hence quickly with thy steed with service spent
with this grave charge strait to the city went sad lentulus nor yet did paulus dy without revenge but as when mortally wounded a tiger doth at length retreat and falls to struggle with approaching fate

he opens wide his weary jaws to bite

in vain and in attempts beneath the height of his great rage licks onely with his tongue the lances and the darts against him flung
and now ilerthes who insulting near approach'd and shook secure of wounds his spear he rising with his sudden sword doth wound and then for the sidonian captain round about him looks desiring in his hands to quit his strugling soul but strait the bands of nomades of garamantians moors with celtians and asturians thick showr's of darts upon him powr'd on ev'ry side oppress the man
thus noble paulus dy'd thus that high heart whom if the war he sole had rul'd perhaps we might compare with fabius his brave death a grace became

to rome and plac'd among the

stars his name

but when the romanes hopes were lost and all their courage ruin'd in the consul fall

to cruel arms the headless

army yield

their backs victorious africk through the field rageth in blood picenian cohorts here and warlike vmbrians fall sicanian there and hernick troops those ensigns scatter'd are upon the ground which samnites fierce in war which the sarrastes and the marsi brought· there targets pierc'd quite through as they fought broke each gainst others shields and helmets lay with useless swords and bridles torn away from the fierce horse's mouths the neighb'ring flood throws up his billows swelling high with blood into the fields and all the bodies slain returns with fury to the banks again

see a

lagaean ship that

floats on the sea if it by chance do strike upon a rock while cloudy eurus blows and shipwrack over all the ocean throws strait planks with oars and tackle and tall masts pendants and sails torn with impetuous blasts and miserable that again spew up the waves are scatter'd on the main
the libyan by his slaughters in the fight had measur'd out the day but as the night the aid of light to his great rage deny'd at length he lai'd the cruel war aside and from the toil of slaughter spar'd his men but yet with cares his mind still wak'd nor then amidst such favour of the gods could he endure to rest his thoughts continually prompt him to enter rome and the next day thence with drawn swords in haste to march away is his design while yet their blood was warm and slaughter stain'd the troops
now with his arm the gates he seiseth fires the walls and seems to with cannae the tarpeian flames
conscious of iove displeasure and the fate of italy saturnia troubled at what he design'd endeav'ring to restrain the youth's rash heat and in desires so vain to curb his greedy hopes strait from his deep and silent empire she the god of sleep by whose assistance she had often clos'd iove weary eys and them to rest compos'd summons and smiling said call not thee great god to hard designs nor that to me thou give up iove by thy soft wings subdued do require nor that thou shouldst delude

and shut in stygi
night his thousand eys

that iö kept and did thy power despise
but into hannibal dreams inspire nor now visit rome let him desire or walls forbid where iove denies that he should enter
her commands he instantly pursues and poppy in a crooked horn mix'd with some other juice through darkness born he silently descends and to the tent of the barcêan prince directly went
then hov'ring o're his drooping head he spreads his drowsy wings and slumber gently sheds like dew into his eys and with his hand unto his temples the lethean wand applies when suddenly prodigious dreams possess his furious breast and now he seems to compass tyber with his num'rous bands but as insulting at the walls he stands of rome he frighted sees immortal iove shining on the tarpeian rock above and in his threatning hand he thunder shook while all the neighb'ring fields with sulphur smoak blew anyo in cold waters trembling lies and oft a dreadfull sight before his eys flashes of lightning fly then through the air a voice was spread thy progress youth forbear thy honour's great enough that doth arise from cannae thou as soon our marble skies may'st cleave as through those sacred walls when storm'd by thee break way
thus iuno will perform'd sleep left him terrifi'd with what he then had seen and fearing greater wars nor when the night was done did day absolve his mind from that dire image which it left behind

a midst these troubles of his sleep and vain

disturbance mago tells him they had ta'ne the romane camp by night and brought away with their remaining troops a wealthy prey

to him then promising a joyfull feast

within the capitol when to devest the world of day the fifth night should arise the general concealing the advise of heav'n and his own fears their wounds in fight and strength exhausted pleads and that they might not be too confident of their success
the youth dejected from his hopes no less then if he had commanded him to flee ev'n from the walls and draw from victory his ensigns said with all this toil not rome as she believ'd but varro overcome by what sad fate so great success in fight dost thou neglect and thus thy countrey slight let the horse march with me and will pawn my head the iliack walls shall be thine own the gates shall open'd be without a war
while these by furious mago urged are and by his wary brother not believ'd the latine souldiers flying were receiv'd·

within

canusium walls and there apace

began to fortifie
inglorious face of sinking fortune there no eagles stand no ensigns mong the troops no high command of consuls nor by lictours axes born
but faint with fear and as with ruin torn and maim'd their bodies on weak members strive to keep their stand oft sudden clamours rive the air and oft deep silence with their eys fix'd on the ground here naked companies

with broken targets stand the valiant there

want swords then all the horsemen wounded are from their casks their glorious pride was torn and mars his honour lai'd aside
their corslets pierc'd with many spears and in their mails maurusian shafts were sometimes seen to hang sometimes they sadly call upon their friends were lost here galba they bemoan piso and curio worthy of a far more noble fate and scaevola in war most fierce all these of course but paulus fate as of a common father they regrate how he ne're ceas'd with truth their present woes to prophesie and varro minde oppose how oft in vain that day from rome he sought to turn and then how valiantly he fought
but such who care of future things do take either are busi'd bout the walls to make their trenches or to fortifie the gates as need requir'd and where the field dilates a plain and easie entrance to the foes firm in the earth they fix boughs like horns of stags and secretly beside to wound them in their march they calthrops hide
bove all these miseries and wounds that are not to be cur'd the reliques of the war and such as scap'd the fo through impious fear and a more fierce erynnis mov'd prepare the climate chang'd the punick arms by sea sidonian swords and hannibal to flee
the chief of this design for exile was

metellus sprung from no ignoble race

the wav'ring winds of that degen'rate crew in war to counsels base and strange he drew

to look for lands where they themselves might hide

as in another world and there abide where they might never hear the libyan name and whither their forsaken countrie's fame might never come
but when this news was brought to scipio with like rage as when he fought i'th field gainst hannibal his sword he snatch'd and to the house where they this mischief hatch'd gainst italy he hasts and breaking down the doors and entring with a dreadfull frown shaking his sword before their frighted eys he thus begun thou chief of deities who dwell'st on the tarpeian rock a seat the next to heav'n and thou iuno not yet

chang'd with the woes of troy and thou fierce

maid

upon whose dreadfull aegis are displai'd the gorgon furies and you gods that sprung from mortals and are willingly among our deities ador'd and which by me is equal held to any deity by my great father's head swear ne're will the land forsake nor e're permit that it forsaken be while survive
now then metellus instantly attest the gods that if in libyan fire these walls shall burn thou never wilt retire into another land unless thou swear to this although arm'd hannibal were here whom thou dost dread the fear of whom doth break thy sleep thou sure shalt dy nor will take a greater pride in any libyan fall
these threatnings crushing that design they all a sacramental oath as was enjoyn'd swear to the gods and to their countrey binde

their souls and from that crime their breasts absolve

while thus the latines their affairs revolve with troubled thoughts victorious hannibal the fields again survays and numbers all his own dire acts searching with greedy eys their wounds and to the cruel companies of libyans that round about him stood yields joyfull spectacles of romane blood
at the last gasp sore wounded through the breast with darts lay valiant claelius mong the rest expiring his departing soul to air and lab'ring faintly his pale face to rear scarce with his feeble neck from earth his head h'ad lifted when his horse that knew him neigh'd aloud with ears and bounding threw headlong upon the ground vagesus who upon his captive back was born and then flying with speed o're heaps of slaughter'd men and through the slipp'ry paths with standing gore made fat and bodies chang'd with wounds before his dying master stands and there his neck and shoulders bowing offers him his back on bended knees as he was wont to do and trembling seems his love to shew
none could more neatly mount a metled steed

then he none surer as he ran full speed

lay backward all along or stood upon his naked back or when he chanc'd to run a race more happily perform'd the course
but not a little wondring at the horse that equall'd humane sense the libyan strait his name and honours who with adverse fate so bravely did contend desir'd to know and to dispatch him gave the

then cynna for he to the tyrians side

had turn'd his arms who near him then did ride a slave to fortune answers sir said he his story worthy of your ear may be
in former times that rome which now disdains with so much scorn to bear the tyrian reins was under kings but hating tarquin sway soon as she had his scepter thrown away strait mighty armies from clusinum came if either cocles or porsenna fame or lidyan camps by chance thine ear have found he with maeonian aids encompass'd round and tyrrhen people strove again to bring by war into his throne the banish'd king much they in vain attempted at the gate the tyrant press'd when peace concluded strait all hate's compress'd and by a league aside the war is lai'd and faith by pledges ty'd
but yet good gods the romane hearts that know not how to yield prepar'd to undergo the worst of ills for honour claelia who not yet the age of twice six summers knew one of the latine maids that did remain a pledg of peace among the transmitted to the king she not to speak of what the men perform'd that king the league her years the flood contemning fearless o're admiring tyber from the hostile shore swum and the billows broke with tender hands
had nature chang'd her sex the tyrrhen lands porsenna happily should ne're again have seen but that may no more detain you in her story from her stock he came and from the famous virgin took his name

as he this story told a sudden cry

on the broke forth appearing nigh where paulus body mong the arms of men and mangled corps in ruin mix'd they then dug up amidst the slaughter'd heaps
alass how alter'd how unlike to him he was that lately with his shafts the punick bands had routed or when the taulantian lands with honour he had vanquish'd and did bring into subjection the illyrick king his hoary locks all black with dust upon his beard dry clots of gore a mural stone his teeth had broke his body all one wound which when o'rejoy'd the libyan captain found fly consul varro now securely fly and live said he since paulus here did dy fly and to lazy fabius to the state and people cannae story all relate
if thou desir'st so greedily the light of life i'le grant thee such another flight
but he whose valiant heart that justly claim'd me for a fo so brave an heat enflam'd with the last rites of funeral by me and decent sepulture shall honour'd be
how great here paulus dost thou ly whose fall alone is greater joy to me then all the thousands we have slain and so when fate me with the safety carthage of thy state· shall call do desire to dy
this said interr his friends when the next morn displai'd her blushes from her bed and to prepare a pyle of arms that to the god of war were to be burnt he gives command then all though weary to the work commanded fall

and strait in sev'ral heaps the groves are lai'd

and on the shady hills tall woods are made to eccho with their axes here to ground they fell the ash and shady pop'lar crown'd with hoary leaves and there the holm that took root in their age and firmest oak with pines that flourish by a river and sad cypress that near sepulchres do stand a mournfull ornament
these to the field they bear and there with emulation build the fun'ral pyles an office to the slain fruitless and sad till in the eastern main sol drench'd his panting steeds and by his flight from heav'n with stygian darkness rais'd the night
but when again the phaëthontian reins shed their first beams on the eo~an plains and did to earth its colours all restore they flames apply and corps distilling gore burn in an hostile land an horrid dread of various chance seising their thoughts is spread with silence through their hearts lest fortune by an adverse fight might cause them there to dy
but sacred mars to thee up to the skies like a vast hill a pyle of arms doth rise the general himself lifts up a tall and flaming pine and thus on thee doth call great father mars who now hast heard my pray'r these sacrifices of a prosp'rous war and of the fight within this flame hannibal or'e the ausonian name victorious burn to thee and living bands offer these chosen arms with gratefull hands
then throwing in the torch the greedy fire devours the pyle and strait a flaming spire

breaks through the smoak and to the stars ascends

and a clear light through all the field extends
thence hasting to the tomb and funeral to paulus giv'n the honour of his fall insulting boasts
a lofty pyle there they had rais'd and softer beds compos'd of hay gifts likewise added are to th valiant held a fun'ral honour his dire sword and shield of late a terrour and a stately sight then fasces torn and axes ta'ne in fight
no wife no sons no troops of kindred near ally'd were there nor on the lofty bier as custom was old images precede and grace the exequies but now instead of other pomp was hannibal alone sufficient to eternize his renown shining with richest purple to the rest upon the pyle he sighing threw his vest and after that his cloak then to his shade with this last honour spoke
ausonia glory go thou thither where souls great in deeds and virtue seated are thou by thy noble death hast honour gain'd fortune as yet with her unconstant hand our labours guids and doth command that we of future chances ignorant should be
thus he and strait from crackling flames into aetherial air the joyfull soul doth go
now fame her voice encreasing to the skies the sea and earth and chiefest city

they now distrust their walls and trembling all

hope safety onely in the capitol
for now for their defence no youthfull bands survive an empty name ausonia stands

without a body that the enemy

not yet broke through the gates they think to be delay through scorn their houses now appear to burn the temples spoil'd and ev'ry where their sons in cruel slaughter to expire before their eys and the sev'n tow'rs on fire
one day lamented the approaching falls

of twice an hundred

chairs and sinking walls

of rome depriv'd of twice three hundred thousand youth besides and this

after sad trebia and the tuscan

flood

and of allies as great a loss of blood
amidst these griefs the pious senate all by lot to their appointed charges fall old fabius what was done with diligence th affrighted calls upon
believ't there now no reason to delay we must be speedy that the libyan may approach our armed walls attempt in vain
by cross fortune strength doth gain among the fearfull and adversity through fear grows greater
go go speedily

snatch from the temple arms brave youths go make

the courts and porches naked quickly take the targets from the walls were gain'd in war enough our numbers for our countrey are if we loose nothing through our fear to fight in open fields that horrid plague may fright perchance but the moor shall ne're break through these walls or boast his triumphs here
while fabius thus excites their minds with dread dejected
bout the walls a rumour spread that varro was at hand and ev'ry breast with secret trouble and with doubt possest

as when a vessel wrack'd safe from the sea

alone the pilot swimming makes his way to th open shore the people trembling stand uncertain whether they should lend an hand to help him or refuse him and the rest so lost his sole survival all detest
how great his infamy who durst come near the ports so sad an omen to their fear these discontents and troubles to and turn the wav'ring people from their rage fabius declares how base it was to be vex'd at in adversity it did seem in those to bend who their original from mars pretend who could not hide their griefs but were intent to remedy their woes by punishment but if they would permit him to upbraid to him that day more dismal shin'd he said when he saw varro marching to the field then that wherein he him beheld
this language all their threats allay'd and strait their hearts were turn'd
now they condole his fate now summ up all the comforts from them ta'ne by the sidonian in two consuls slain

then to congratulate him out they run

in troops protesting that whate're was done they did believe proceeded from a great and valiant minde that trusting to the fate of their and their mighty power he not despair'd of the tarpeian tow'r
no less sad for his crime and full of shame towards the walls the consul weeping came not daring his dejected looks at all to raise to see his countrey and recall

their griefs
the senate and the people that

to meet him went seem'd not to gratulate his safety but sad parents to require their sons and brothers or enflam'd with ire to tear the consul face appear'd to come and therefore with a silent lictour rome he private enters and through grief contemn'd that honour which the gods so late condemn'd
but fabius and the senate doth provide speedy relief all sadness lai'd aside

and strait the

slaves are arm'd nor doth that shame

for common safety move them to the camp
but to reduce th state by any means within the laws of fate it is decreed and for the sacred tow'r honour of freedom and imperial pow'r ev'n servile hands to arm
now they devest boys of their garments and their shoulders prest with arms to them unknown stiff helmets close their tender cheeks and in the blood of foes they are commanded to grow up to men
but when was mov'd the captive troops agen should ransom'd be at easie rates for there of such that sought it many thousands were

they to the wondring libyan left them all

so much the possibility to fall arm'd into bondage did all crimes exceed all other guilt surpass
then twas decreed that whosoever should convicted be have fled the fight in farthest sicily should serve untill the fo th ausonian land should quite relinquish
such then rome did stand next whom thou carthage had the fates thought good to change her manners mightst as chief have stood

the argument
what people after cannae loss forsake the romane leagues and part with libya take
the capuans proud demands at rome which she contemning forc'd the messengers to flee with a repulse
strait capua entertains the libyans which decius disdains his faith and noble courage he is sent in chains to carthage whither as he went by storms upon cyrene he is cast where rescu'd from the libyans at last he dies
with wanton and luxurious feasts loose capua entertains her libyan guests
amidst their mirth the death of hannibal pactulus son conspires
mago with all the spoils of cannae is to carthage sent the people's acclamations and content when he arriv'd
he new supplies demands of men and monies hanno this withstands
in fine mago prevails and all that he requires the senate grants by a decree

but now what people to the libyan side and the sidonian camp themselves apply'd through cannae famous loss let me unfold
when fortune fails no mortals long will hold

their faith
their hands now openly they strive

to the perfidious libyan to give too ready in to

before the rest the cruel

samnites are

most eager on occasion to renew their hate and rage to shew

next the unconstant

brutians who with shame

too late did afterwards the fact disclaim
perfidious apulians next to these with their ambiguous arms then hating peace the vain hirpini who unworthily their faith infring'd
a gen'ral treachery like the contagion of some foul disease through all the nations spreads and now with these atella now calatia common fear depressing justice with their troops appear in the sidonian camp
then with as bold inconstancy tarentum that of old phalanthus built the romane yoak deny'd her friendly gates high croton open'd wide and taught the thespian nephews at the beck of barb'rous africans to yield their neck
like rage possess'd the locri and the coast

where graecia major

argive walls doth boast

and windings wash'd by the iönian sea
these following the success of libya and fortune in that errour fearfull sware to lend their arms to the sidonian war
and now the stubborn bord'rers on the po the celtae strive encrease the romanes wo again and mindfull of their antient hate with all their strength themselves associate
but whither is't more just this impious war to th celtae or the boii to refer

or rather capua madness so to please

the cruel nation of the senones and who would think those walls that first did rise from dardan hands and did till then despise the friendship of a barb'rous tyrant now at such a time so great a change should show but luxury and ease that long had bin nurs'd in their brothels and through frequent sin all shame all modesty consum'd beside infamous honour that alone rely'd on wealth with idleness the city void of laws and lazy people quite destroy'd
and then a cruel pride provok'd their fall their vices want no aids for none of all th ausonian people had a larger store of gold so full a sail their fortune bore then they their robes assyrian dy enrich'd they feast with high regality ev'n in the midst of day soon as the sun diffus'd his light their banquets they begun their wanton lives all stains of vices bear beside the senate to the people were severe the people through the senate hate incens'd seditions raise and with debate divide their hearts the youth meanwhile their crimes encrease and greater sins defile the aged
and then such as were of base extraction and whom an ignoble race defam'd their falling countrey's reins desire to guide and to the chief command aspire
with slaughter likewise twas their use of old exhilarate their banquets and behold dire spectacles of such as with the sword contend mix'd with the feast while on the board

besmear'd with gore the very goblets swell

not more with wine then blood of those that fell
with cunning these that to the tyrians he their minds deprav'd might turn more eagerly the libyan prince attempts
because he knew rome notwithstanding all that chance could do would never yield
twas easie to procure what he desir'd pactulus not obscure for guilt in this he counsels to require a share in government and to desire that with a sociate consul he might bear alternate fasces
if an equal share to him in pow'r and honour they deny'd nor to behold two axes would abide he a revenger in their view would stand of that repulse
therefore a chosen band with speed was sent and virius who the rest in eloquence excell'd himself addrest chief in the embassie
his birth indeed was mean but yet his fury did exceed all else
scarce what was impiously desir'd by th frantick people had he told and fir'd their ears with swelling words when a loud cry from the whole counsel rising did deny his message with unanimous disdain
then ev'ry one upbraids him and the fane through the contention of their voices shook and here the brave torquatus with a look grave as his said
dost thou presume oh capua such messengers should come within the walls of rome gainst which to bear their arms nor hannibal nor carthage dare after their cannae hath not touch'd your ear that when in the tarpeian temple here

the latines proudly urg'd the like demands

not with a vote or words but furious hands they were repuls'd and he who hither brought and with proud language utter'd what they sought with so great violence was headlong thrown out at the that bruis'd upon the fatal rock he there did expiate· in view of iove his language by his fate

and his

who that oratour

then from this palace of the thunderer expell'd and consul with his naked hand defender of the capitol did stand this who appears with threatning eys to view these trophies of rome victories and his faction to pursue
vex'd fabius seeing that he fiercer grew in this dispute thus interposing said oh impudence behold that seat is made vacant by storms of war and whom of all your crew pray do you intend to call and substitute in noble paulus place doth thy lot virius with the senate grace cite thee before all other or doth now the purple to our bruti thee allow as equal go thou fool go thither where perfidious carthage may for thee prepare her fasces
as with heat he this exprest impatient ev'n with sighs within his breast longer to keep his anger that thus broke like thunder forth aloud marcellus spoke
how dull a patience varro doth thy minde possess confounded with this stormy winde of war so much that now a consul thou these mad vain dreams art able to allow

why dost thou not from hence these headlong throw

out at the gates and make these know how great a pow'r the consuls have that be created by our custom and let me advise thou youth whose fall is nigh fly quickly hence
our general shall arm'd before your walls an answer make such as is meet
with that they all forsake their seats and with loud clamours press upon the capuans who hasted to be gone while virius vex'd at that repulse lets fall in murmur'd threats the name of hannibal
but fulvius the presages of whose minde his future honour at that time divin'd and falling capua image fore his eys appear'd replies though crown'd with victories thou hannibal his neck in chains to rome shouldst bring yet ne're hereafter shalt thou come within these sacred walls then take thy flight pray thee whither thy sick thoughts invite
at length this angry answer of the vext senate they bore away with threatning mixt
is it thy will great iove that fates should ly still buried in so great obscurity an age more happy shall hereafter come when a campanian consul pious rome shall gladly entertain and shall afford secure those fasces of her own accord

to valiant

nephews that were long deny'd

through arms war but of their pride this shall a lasting punishment remain
rome shall as soon the suffrage entertain of carthage as of capua
this reply when virius intermixing cunningly

fiction with truth did with the fates declare

the fatal signal of a bloody war was giv'n and the campanian youth inspir'd with fury arms and hannibal desir'd
the people flocking from all parts invite the libyans to their houses and recite what mighty things the libyan prince hath done how he like hercules had the alps and in his course had pass'd those high aspiring rocks that to the gods are nigh
who had a conquerour choak'd up the stream of po with slaughter and how he the same great conqu'rour troubled with ausonian blood the lydian lake and banks of trebia flood transmitted had with an eternal name to fame how he flaminius overcame and paulus consuls whom in fight he slew
beside how he sagunthus overthrew in his first war
and then pyrene heights iberus and his father's stygian rites they all and th war which long before he in his childehood at the altar swore
and then so many gen'rals overthrown in fight so many slain that he alone by all the weapons of the gods did stand untouch'd in battel
while he did command with such a person therefore they should joyn their hands and with him in a league combine but if that bloodless people's high disdain vain contumacy and that citie's reign that equal laws and fasces had deny'd as to their servants capua would abide varro was then to be preferr'd that he consul in purple might more glorious flee

a trojan who from father capys came

to whom he left his sacred rites and name from iove of great iulus kin shall among these nasamonians ly or mong the barb'rous garamantians which in grinning salvage beasts resemble pitch my tent mix'd with marmarick troopers or shall endure a general that for the league and justice takes his sword and praise from blood alone unto himself doth raise no right and wrong your decius does not with such indifference that he should fix on such a choice you with no good so great hath cruel nature arm'd as with the gate of death which gives you pow'r to leave a tedious life at any hour
thus to their ears averse while decius spent his breath in vain a chosen regiment made league with hannibal and strait a band of light autololes with noise at hand appear'd sent by the general before while he with a great body marcheth o're the plains with speed and decius agen exclaims come now's the time dear countreymen the hour's arriv'd while following me you may perform an action worthy capua
now let us all those barb'rous troops destroy let ev'ry one strive soly to enjoy that honour if the fo approach the gate obstruct with carcases and expiate this errour with your swords
such blood alone can purge your guilty souls from what is done
while this in vain to all unpleasant he express'd inform'd of his severity

with an heartfull of rage the libyan stands

before the walls and instantly commands the deputies into the camp to send for decius whom rough valour did commend and a breast arm'd with faith a soul inclin'd to justice and then capua a minde more great who with undaunted courage took those menacing commands and with a look most fierce as bitter words returns again
the libyan him so full of brave disdain amidst so many arms and ensigns thus aloud upbraids after flaminius and after paulus we are challeng'd see alass mad decius would contend with me to give a fame and honour to his fall but hence my souldiers quickly march with all your ensigns and in spight of him to me let the campanian city open'd be
what new wars he can raise i'de gladly try gainst us to whom the alps did openly and rocks that strike at heav'n o're which a god alone before impregnable had trod
with that he angry blush'd and from his eys through fury kindled sudden flames arise and foaming at his mouth deep sighs he draws that break in dreadfull murmurs from his jaws
by the whole senate thus attended hée the city enters and his face to see the people flocking round he venteth all the storms of his dire rage and burning gall while the approaching dangers more enflame brave decius minde who saw the instant came of time wherein he was to vanquish all the praise of an unconquer'd general

him neither flight nor barricado'd doors

conceal
but free as if no libyan pow'rs no hannibal were then within the town he with a fearless look walks up and down when strait with cruel arms a furious band seis'd him and forc'd him at the feet to stand of hannibal who on a lofty throne a conqu'rour sate and with a thundring tone this bitter language vents
dost thou presume alone to declining rome and rescue her from ruin thou fool say which of the gods from me shall take away so great enjoyments or was to be subdu'd reserv'd dull decius to thee weak decius to whom no woman born in agenorean carthage but would scorn to yield
but him for why such high disdains should we endure fast in deserved chains my souldiers binde
scarce he an end had made of railing when stout decius they invade and binde with chains his hands upon his back
then as a lyon on the lofty neck of a young bull amidst the herd doth leap and murmuring with rage victorious deep into his trembling flesh his claws hath prest there hanging feeds upon the groaning beast so decius raging while his chains they binde come speedily for such we ought to finde thy entrance hannibal these chains the prize of this unhappy league close binde he cries so decius may a worthy victime fall for tis not fit that thou who placest all delight in humane blood shouldst sacrifice bulls to the gods
let capua in this

behold thy see thy league as yet

the court thou hast not enter'd nor hast set thy foot with in the temples but we see the prison's open'd by the cruelty of thy commands
go on and give encrease to thy beginnings by such acts as these fame shall to me when dead hereafter tell that hannibal in capua ruins fell
but here they stop'd his speech and o're his head

to blinde his eys a

fatal robe was spread

and strait he dragg'd away in view of all his friends and then triumphing hannibal with a more quiet minde and calmer look goes on and viewing all about him took survey of all the buildings in the town and temples and what's worthy to be known enquires who built the walls what numbers are in arms how great their treasure was for war what was their strength of horse how great withall their infantry to him their arcenal

they shew and

stellate fields with store of corn

the day now phoebus to his bounds had born with weary steeds and hesp'rus by degrees obscur'd his chariot hasting to the seas when they as custom was their feasts prepare and through the city crown with royal fare their stately tables of the honour he and entertainment of a deity thought worthy sits aloft upon a bed of purple that far off its rays doth spread
nor was the troop of servants single some serve in the meat others burn rich perfume the sev'ral dishes some in order joyn some serve in drinke and antique goblets shine

of massive gold upon the tables night

by num'rous tapers flames is put to flight with noise of those that up and down do go the palace rings
a stranger to such lautious banquets with a wondring eye the unknown face of stately luxury

the tyrian souldier views with silence

he

feeds on and blames such prodigality in banqueting and that such troops of guests were entertain'd at their delicious feasts
but when at length his hunger was allay'd and his rough mind with wine more frolick made when mirth upon his smoother brow did rest and weightier cares were banish'd from his breast cymaean teuthras his euboick lyre tun'd and his ears dull'd with the trumpet's dire alarms in war with pleasant eyrs delights
now iove he sings and his stoln loves recites electra bed of atlas race was she from whence sprung dardanus a progeny worthy the gods how to immortal iove thence ericthonius did a nephew prove whence tros whence ilus came and in a long descent assaracus at length he sung capys who equal was in deeds and fame to all and gave unto those walls their· name
the carthaginians and campanians all applaud his lays and first the general with all due rites a goblet crown'd with wine pays to the honour of the pow'rs divine the rest him follow and instructed by their custom bacchus juice flows lib'rally upon the boards and fires their swelling veins
and now the tyrians having giv'n the reins

to mirth a valiant soul untouch'd with wine

for willingly brave youth thy high design worthy all memory i'le not pass by in silence nor deserved fame deny to thy attempts which though imperfect yet were clearest demonstrations of a great and noble courage from all venom free of drink the honour ponder'd silently within his breast of a sidonian fight and death and that this sacred motion might

the rather be admir'd

pactulus son

condemn'd those arts his father had begun
he closely following behinde his sire who with the feast oppress'd did slow retire from the throng'd palace when he found a time to open what he thought and tell to him his new design and when the place was free behinde them from the palace hear said he my resolution worthy capua and us with that turning his gown away he shew'd his armed side now intend with this my sword this cruel war to end and bear the libyan head to iove this sword shall ratifie this infamous accord made such by his deceits but if your age cannot in so great spectacles engage or tyr'd with greater deeds now fearfull be you may securely home retire and me leave so my thoughts
thou hannibal dost prize as chief and to the gods dost equalize but how much greater then a libyan name will thy son be with that a dreadfull flame seem'd from his mouth to issue and the man already in his minde the war began

but the old man who with a troubled ear

the weight of a design so great did bear trembling before him fell upon the place
and as he did with kisses oft imbrace his feet dear son by what remains to me of life and by a father's rights said he and by thy safety dearer far then mine to me desist pray from this design let me not see our hospitality with murther stain'd nor friendly cups to be fill'd up with blood and tables overthrown in fury of the fight
canst thou alone him whom nor armies walls nor cities dare withstand when he comes near and ev'ry where ejecteth rays like lightning him who throws something like thunder from his head oppose if when thy sword is spy'd that dreadfull voice he should cast forth by which he oft destroys whole squadrons in the field you but deceive your self if him thus feasting you believe disarm'd
gain'd by so many slaughters by so many wars eternal majesty the gen'ral arms
if you approach him then that cannae trebia and dire thrasimen and paulus mighty shade before thee stands thou wilt admire will his companions hands
or those about his person in so great a danger idle be thee intreat forbear nor wish superiority bove him o're whom thou canst not victour be
do not those fatal chains that late did binde decius instruct thee to compose thy minde thus talking when he saw the youth to be inflam'd with love of greater fame and free

from fear nothing more said he request

come let's return with speed unto the feast
thou canst not pierce the breasts of all that ring of tyrian youth that now defend the king
try in this throat thy hand for first thy blade if thou intend'st the libyan to invade must through my bowels pierce
my tardy age contemn not thou my body i'le engage against thee and that sword which cannot be extorted now by my death from thee will force
with that he wept and hannibal by heav'ns great care reserved was to fall by scipio arms
nor then did conscious fate allow a forein hand should perpetrate an act so great
but of what praise was he depriv'd whose glorious magnanimity worthy to act in deeds most famous won so much renown for what he would have done then both together to the feast they went again and clear'd their brows from discontent till sleep dissolv'd their banquet and their mirth
but as the next bright morning to the earth the fiery steeds of phaëthon did raise his chariot on the surface of the seas

reflecting fam'd amilcar active

son

already on his great affairs begun to think
fierce mago order'd to repair to carthage to the senate to declare what hannibal had done
with him the prey and captivated men are sent away and spoils that to the gods devoted are as sacrifices of a prosp'rous war
the next part of his care was to convey brave decius alass to libya

reserv'd at his return a sacrifice

to his slow rage had not the deities pittying his undeserved punishment

the youth by storms to

battus city sent

here

ptolemy pelléan pow'r the man

rescu'd from their dire menaces that than his keepers were and freed his neck from chains but the same land that sav'd his short remains of life from slavery soon after gave his bones inviolate a quiet grave
in the mean time the paphian goddess findes the hour involve the libyans mindes in secret ruin through prosperity and their insulting hearts by luxury to tame and therefore she her sons commands enticing darts to scatter from their hands abroad and silent flames to send into their breasts
then smiling on the wanton crew now let proud iuno us despise said she and tis no wonder for now what are we let her go on driv'n with propitious gales
she with her hands she with her arms prevails we small shafts onely from a childish bow expell and from our wounds no blood doth flow
but now be doing now's your time take aim my sons and with your silent darts enflame the tyrian youths that army which nor fire nor sword nor mars with slackest reins can tire with store of wine embraces and by sleep must be subdu'd
into his bowels deep let hannibal imbibed pleasures drink
to ly on painted beds let him not think it shame and with assyrian sweets his hair perfume let him that in hybernal air

boasted to lengthen out his sleeps delight

in houses rather to consume the night and let him learn to give the idle day to bacchus and when cloy'd with feasts he may be charm'd with musick and luxurious nights or sleeping spend or waking in our rites· this venus which the wanton troops commend and strait from heav'n with snowy wings descend the libyan youths soon feel their fiery darts and the discharged shafts inflame their hearts
now bacchus gifts and banquets they desire and warbling songs to the piërian lyre
now through the plains no sweating courser flies no lance thrown through the air doth exercise their naked arms in gentle baths to rest their lazy limbs they cherish and opprest with miserable wealth rough valour's gone the general himself but breath'd upon by flattering desire begins to feast anew and oft invited made a guest
and by degrees degenerate his minde corrupted by those secret shafts declin'd his countrie's arts
with equal honour all now capua another countrey call another carthage
their affections free before to greedy vice through victory now yield
nor do the capuans measure keep in luxury but drown'd in riot heap lust upon lust and in their feasts between each course add sports and often change the scene
so bout the lotos on laegaean banks the phrygian minstrels with lascivious pranks spartan canopus fill
and first their ears with his sweet eyrs while hannibal appears

extremely pleas'd fam'd teuthras for his skill

most eminent delights with voice and quill and when he saw the libyan prince admire the warbling nerves then the aönian lyre with praise he celebrates and as he sung his conspiring with his tongue the musick that of dying swans exceeds and those sweet lays mong many for the deeds of antient heroes best the ear affect most pleasant for the banquet doth select
once by the argive people strange to tell a lute was heard that did the rocks compell to follow and the flying stones to stand fix'd into walls
touch'd by amphion hand this rais'd the theban walls while to the skies flints of themselves in heaps congested rise enchanted tow'rs
another by his lays the phocae tam'd becalm'd the raging seas and protheus drew through all his shapes and bore arion on a dolphin back to shore
but that whose sound in the pelîack cave a bridle to the minds of heroes gave

and great achilles thoughts the

centaure lov'd

and when upon the strings his finger mov'd hell's or the ocean fury twould allay
he chaos and the world once wanting day or light a starless lump and then how god diffus'd the waters of the deep abroad and bound the globe of earth amidst the frame how high olympus to the gods became by his appointment a secure abode and chaster age of father saturne shew'd
but those sweet nerves by orpheus touch'd to whom the gods and shades below did listning come

their quill emerited now shine among

the brightest stars
his mother his sweet song admir'd and her aönian sisters too his musick the pangaean hills pursue
hemus and farthest thrace beasts with their woods him follow and the mountains with their floods unmindefull of their nests flight lai'd aside birds captiv'd in th unshaken air abide
and when the pegasaean ship before the sons of earth were skill'd beyond the shore refus'd the sea to enter by his song entic'd up to the poop the waters throng
he those pale kingdoms whither ghosts retire and acheron that with eternal fire and flames still ecchoes by his lays alone

subdu'd and fix'd the

stone

thus teuthras with his thespian lays their hearts hard'ned in war to softer ease diverts
but in the mean time with propitious gales mago unto the coast of libya sails and the desired port with lawrel bound the vessel enters as in triumph crown'd with captive arms the lofty prow displaies a lustre over all the neighb'ring seas the seamen in the road the ecchoing shores with clamours fill and as they tugg their oars against their breasts rais'd by their num'rous blows the foam o're all the broken ocean flows to catch their joys the eager people press into the waves and proud of the success with great applause and emulation all their welcome celebrate
the general is with the gods compar'd him ev'ry where matrons and nephews that instructed are

to honour him commend by young and old

the senate and the people he's extoll'd and likewise by slain heifers thought to be worthy the honour of a deity
into his countrey thus proud mago came and gates triumphing in his brother's fame enter'd the senate to their place resort and with a full convention throng the court there as an antient custom did enjoyn all veneration to the pow'rs divine and the assembly pay'd bring said he news of that broken force which italy against us us'd and of that war wherein your mago no mean part of toil hath bin and when we fought the gods our wishes crownd
there is a place from diomed renown'd possess'd of old by daunus the moist grounds their aufidus with rapid streams surrounds and through the plains o'reflowing cuts his way with speed into the adriatick sea where falling with great noise he beats again the yielding billows back into the main here varro and a name of honour held among the latines paulus took the field before the day had chac'd away the night and kindled with their shining arms the light of the then rising morn
desire engage enflam'd my brother and with equal rage our ensigns hasten on earth trembles strook with horrour high olympus groaning shook and here the general then whom the earth unto a greater never yet gave birth in slaughter hid the river and the field and as he furious charg'd this beheld

ev'n with the very noise that he came on

scatter'd through all the plains to him alone all italy gave way ev'n beheld when coward varro basely fled the field and threw his arms away brave paulus too saw when standing o're his friend and through his body pierc'd with darts at length he fell
aegates and those servile leagues that tell our former infamy that glorious day with streams of romane blood hath wash'd away
if such another day we live to see then carthage surely thou the head shalt be of ev'ry nation and shalt be ador'd by all the world these trophies shall record the slaughter which a badg of honour there on their left hands the noblest persons wear
with that pours forth they wondring to behold

a mighty heap of shining rings of gold

and ratifies his words and then again assumes his speech what then doth now remain but that said he from its foundation turn'd rome with the ground should levell'd be and burn'd let us endeavour this and now repair our troops that by so many dangers are exhausted
let the treasures open'd be with greatest freedom to such hands as we have gain'd in war
our elephants a sight of terrour to the romanes now are quite decay'd and all provisions grow low
as this he mention'd with an angry brow he turn'd to hanno whom the rising fame o'th general did long ago enflame with bitter thoughts now we have giv'n said he proof of our valour and designs to thee

is it now fit that a latine swain

should serve or must we hannibal again deliver up unhappy wretch forbear thy pois'nous envy and thy thoughts that are swell'd high with stygian gall
behold that hand at length crown'd with so many trophies and so many titles ev'n that hand which thou wouldst have giv'n up to romane tortures now their shores lakes rivers their fields with blood hath fill'd
thus mago while the senate stood inclin'd to favour him in what he spoke
but hanno whom both envy did provoke and anger thus replies not at all admire the railing language now let fall by that rash foolish boy
his innate pride and brother's spirit may be soon descri'd in him and the vain venom of his tongue but lest you should think me so chang'd among his vanities as to desist say that now's the very time that we should pray their peace and this destructive war forbear and beseech you to consider here what is he brings there nothing else beside left to your censure tis that we provide arms ships men mony elephants with store of corn
if conquer'd we could give no more we have with trojan blood already cloy'd rutulian plains and italie destroy'd now then good conquerour let's lay aside our cares and in our countrey safe abide let not our families that oft have been made empty be exhausted now agen by the expenses of a wastfull war
and now i'me sure the fatal day's not far

remov'd wish that my presage may be

false and my minde with a vain augury deluded but their furious hearts know and see the future anger that will grow from what they suffer
and for my part ev'n cannae dread
for lay your ensigns by try what is to be done demand a peace twill not be giv'n
our ruins will encrease from what they feel and they would sooner yield to league with us if they had won the field then now when overcome but thou who dost with such proud language so great actions boast and with such swelling noise invad'st the ears o'th ignorant thy brother who appears equal to mars in arms then whom the earth unto a greater never yet gave birth for war why hath not he pray thee say unto the walls of rome yet march'd away we children not yet fit the weight to bear of arms may from their mothers force to war and rigg a thousand ships at his command and seek for elephants through all our land that hannibal thus arm'd his empire may prolong and reign unto his dying day
but you my dearest for us no hidden dangers compass do not thus spoil your dear families but moderate the arms and wealth of such as in the state have pow'r let peace that is the best of things to mortals known peace that more honour brings then myriads of triumphs peace that can our common safety keep and make this man equal to that into our countrey be at length recall'd and let the infamy

and name of treachery be banish'd from

thy walls phoenissa but if you're become so greedy of a war and still persist not to give up your arms at the request ev'n of your countrey truly advise that hence your fury may have no supplies and this let mago to his brother say more he'd have said for speaking could not lay his anger but the clamours of the rest divided in their votes his speech supprest
at length twas answer'd if that the renown of libya hannibal excell'd by none in arms be cause of anger unto thee ev'n at the very bounds must therefore we be wanting to the victour or our aid refuse that one man's envy may be made a bar unto that empire which we now have gain'd with that they readily allow whate're for war is needful proud that so their favour in his absence he might know
then to iberia they decree the same should be convey'd while envy did defame the general immortal deeds and made his honour to be lessned by this aid

the argument
through luxury and ease the lybians made effeminate· parthenopè invade and are repuls'd
from thence to then to putzol on they march and are agen repuls'd the sulph'rous soil the pools and lakes describ'd
from thence the libyan captain makes his army march to nola where they are or'ethrown
what contributions for the war at rome are made such as would service flie in war are punished with infamy
torquatus prospers in sardinia
the libyan wasting countries in his way and burning towns goes to tarentum where the city is betrai'd the romans are for safety to flie into the fort
the ships by them block'd up within the port by a new stratagem unto the sea over the hills doth hannibal convey
by his host's treach'ry brave graochus falls in vain endeav'ring the besieged walls of capua to relieve
the libyan goes to rome where storms and lightning him oppose

now the sharp winter in the earth again his icy head his temples swell'd with rain and cloudy brows had hid and spring with clear and warmer air and winds began to chear

the fertile fields when forth the libyan breaks

from capua and with panick terrour shakes the neighb'ring towns
as serpents that lay still conceal'd while the riphaean winds were chill in warmer days roll from their secret beds and shining new erect their radiant heads and from their lofty jaws their venom spout
but soon as libya ensigns shin'd about the fields through fear all desolate was made and strait in works as terrour did perswade despairing safety they themselves enclose and trembling on the walls expect their foes
but then that vigour that did arm'd invade the alps and breaking through a passage made that trebia enjoy'd and stain'd with blood of bravest romanes the maeonian flood was lost
their limbs with wine and pleasure made effeminate and dull with sleep decai'd those that were wont in coldest nights to ly loaden with arms beneath a stormy sky and oft when show'rs of hail came rushing down contemn'd their tents who ne're by night were known to lay their quivers darts swords shields aside and arms as useful as their members try'd their helmets now an heavy burden call their targets weighty seem their jav'lins all so weakly thrown that they with silence fly
the first of all that was by

their arms was fair

a town

not wealthy but for strength of some renown but the convenient port the general who sought to secure the ocean thither drew that ships from carthage there might safe arrive
the citizens did then in pleasure live

and entertain'd in peace the muses free

from weight of cares siren parthenopé

from

achelôus sprang whose musick long

reign'd in those seas when her delightful song destroy'd the mariners that near her came left to those walls her memorable name
assaulting this behinde for by the sea the front was safe the libyan no way with all his strength could force
inglorious in the loss of that design he doth begin with rams to batter the obstructed gates and there that conquerour that ev'n the fates at cannae had subdu'd did stand in vain

before a

graecian bulwark and again

a cautious resolution doth approve by that event for that he did not move after the daunian field that sadly swum in trojan blood unto the walls of rome
now you that call me idle and that say know not how to give the fates their way for that would not suffer you to climbe said he the walls of rome ev'n at a time when you had newly now enter and within these houses which a graecian band onely defends give us that festival which once you promis'd in the capitol
while thus he them upbraids incens'd with shame should he desert the place of future fame he ev'ry thing attempts and eager whets their swords with his accustomed deceits
but sudden flames upon the walls and through the air at ev'ry breach swift weapons flew
as when an eagle hides upon an high imperious rock her yong if silently

a serpent thither crawl and gaping wide

by his approach her brood is terrifi'd she with her bill and talons wont to bear the arms of iove still watchfull ev'ry where resists her enemy and flies about the circle of her nest to keep him out
weary at length to cuma port he took his way by various motion to provoke fortune and wave that blow to his renown
but gracchus then commander of the town was its defence and forc'd him to retreat ev'n from the walls not suff'ring him to set before the gates or hope for entrance there
then mounted on a nimble steed despair seising his minde he views and searcheth all and thus again doth on his souldiers call with arguments of praise good gods said he what period friends what measure shall we see

of standing thus at

grecian towns while none

of you remember what you once have done is it because a greater bulk doth stand before you then the alps and command that you should climb again those rocks that strike at heav'n should we another land that's like to that now finde where sudden rocks and snow invade the very stars would you not go and boldly arms where're lead you bear these walls alass and cuman rampires here despairing gracchus hold who perceive ev'n in the least of danger dare not leave those ports but shall the world then think what you have gain'd by toils you did by chance subdue by those gods that at the tyrrhen lake propitious were entreat for trebia sake

and by sagunthus dust your selves now shew

worthy your present fame and cannae to your thoughts recall
as thus he sought to raise and fix with words their minds with wanton ease made dull and through prosperity decay'd and as he there the avenues survai'd a shining temple on the top of all the tower he spy'd whose fam'd original thus capua cruel captain virius told
in this our age that fabrick you behold was not said he erected greater hands built it when daedalus liv'd in the lands

of the

dictaean king thus fame doth say

to quit the earth by flying he the way first found none else in all the world did dare on borrow'd wings himself into the air to lift and shew men how to fly
but he his floating body poising equally amidst the clouds soon mounted out of sight like a strange bird affrighting in his flight the very gods
his son likewise assumes by his advice the shape of borrow'd plumes to try the waies of birds
but him again he fal'n beheld beating the troubled main with his unhappy wings and broken oars of quills and as indulgent he deplores his sudden fate moving his hands unto his breast unmindefull whither he would go sorrow his flight delay'd but to appear gratefull for his passage there to phoebus he first built that holy fane and lai'd aside his daring wings again
this virius
but hannibal each day pass'd without action numbers of that stay

and cross asham'd he sighs and quits the town

resolv'd to satiate his grief upon

the dicarchaean

city but ev'n there

the sea and industry of those that were within and lofty walls repell his rage
and while a tedious labour doth engage his army there to force a passage through the rough obstructed ways he takes a view of the mirac'lous pools and soil not far from thence
the chief of capua present are and one among the rest begins to show whence the warm baiae were so call'd and how one of the fam'd dulichian ship which came

upon that coast left to that pool his

name

another tells the lucrine lake of old was call'd cocytus and commends the bold adventure of alcides midst the sea when he disperst its waves and brought away· th iberian heard how styx its antient name had to avernus chang'd of greatest fame among those silent lakes then the dark face of groves and shadows that invest the place
fatal to birds it breaths into the air a dire contagion and is ev'ry where renown'd for stygian worship
near to this as fame reports a dreadful pool there is which leads to acheron and op'ning wide with a deep gulf divides on either side the gaping earth and sometimes doth affright the ghosts below with unexpected light
not far from this the place all dark they tell where the cymmerian people long did dwell in a tartarean city under ground press'd with infernal clouds and night profound

at length they shew those famous fields that fire

sulphur and boiling brimstone still expire
from the parch'd entrails of the groaning earth black vapours break like waves and at their birth into the air cast stygian blasts that from the trembling caves with dreadful murmurs come
and as sometimes the fire beats round about those hollow rooms and labours to get out it sadly bellows with a threatning sound and tears the mangled entrails of the ground destroys the shaking mountains eaten through with flames
the gyants there if fame say true

subdu'd by hercules the earth that's cast

upon them shake and often breathing blast the fields and when they threaten to prevail and break their chains the very heav'ns grow pale
there cruel mimas prison prochyté appears and farther off inarimé which with black storms fuming iapetus down doth press
while frequent sulph'rous flames are thrown from his rebellious mouth and if he should at any time get loose again he would against the gods and iove the war renew
not far from these vesuvian cliffs they shew and on the top the rocks devoured still by flames with ruins round the broken hill and stones that equal aetna fates and there he sees misenus in his sepulcher keeping his trojan name and on the shore th herculean bauli
thus doth he explore
with wounder both the threatnings of the sea and labours of the land
these seen away to th pherecyades high walls he hasts and the nysaean top of gaurus wasts

in gen'rous vines
from thence amain

his troops he leads to nola in a plain nola is scituate encompass'd round with num'rous tow'rs guarding the level ground with a deep trench but there marcellus who assum'd not arms to be protected so by tow'rs who would have valour onely made their wall's defence brought them both strength and aid
he when far off the libyan fleet he spy'd which thither steer'd and tow'rds the walls apply'd the flow'r of all their force to arms said he the cruel fo draws near
and instantlie exclaiming thus his arms he takes in hand and strait the eager youth about him stand and in a rage as custom was put on their bloudy casks
then running up and down the troops he orders thus nero by thee that port on the shall guarded be thou tullus who the volsci glory art thy larinantian ensigns shalt divert and country cohorts to the and when give the word with sudden fury then and silence force the gates and pour into the fields your show'rs of darts against the fo into the midst of them i'le charge and force from th open gates the skirmish of their horse
as thus marcellus spoke the libyans strove the bars and pallisadoes to remove and the despised walls to scale
then round the town the trumpets and shrill cornets sound with shouts of men hoarse horns and clashing arms against their furious limbs
with these alarms the elephants advance incited by the darts upon them thrown and suddenly

like a rude storm the troops of horse came on

and charg'd
as when the banks locks o'rethrown unruly rivers inundations make or driv'n by boreas foaming billows break against the rocks or an eruption made from their dark prisons winds the land invade nor with that dreadfull sight of arms and men could libya hope to gain the place
for then

dardan general advanc'd and at their flying backs withall his fury press'd his lance invoking thus his friends the gods and time now favour us
go on this leads to capua walls
and then turning upon the enemy agen stay whither haste do not said he upbraid thy flying men but rather thee perfidious hannibal for in our hands the war this present field and army stands i'le quit thy troops from slaughter let them see a single combate between thee and me
marcellus this demands this said the fame and value of the danger did enflame him with the libyan to begin the fight
but this to iuno was no pleasing sight who him diverted hasting to his fall from what he then design'd while hannibal strives all he can to rally and to stay his frighted troops
such then from capua and from those fatal mansions do we come said he oh stand ye wretches you whose summ of glory is dishonour credit me no place will faithfull prove to you that flee you have deserv'd that all ausonia now should rise against you and it is from you

you that with so great terrour routed are

that all may both of peace and life despair
his voice suppress'd the trumpet's sound and though obstructed through their ears his clamours go
in graecian arms young pedianus stood most fierce in fight and from that trojan blood himself derived that from antenor came

whether he fought or in a studious life the muses sought or turn'd aönian ditties with his quill not any was more famous for his skill as he in full career did close pursue the libyans at their backs and near them knew the cask and noble spoils of paulus slain worn by young cinyps who rejoyc'd in vain in that great favour of his general
this cinyps was belov'd by hannibal none was then he more beautifull in face none in the had a greater grace so shines that ivory that in the air of tibur bred time never can impair or gems of the which in the ear for whiteness of admired price we wear
him glorious in his helmet and his crest well known in the last rank among the lest when pedianus spy'd and to his eys paulus from shades below appear'd to rise gnashing his teeth he charg'd him must said he the trophies of that sacred head by thee

be worn which not without the crime of all

the gods and envy ev'n your general could wear see paulus and with that upon the ghost of paulus calls to see it done and as he fled his lance with all his force thrusts in his side then lighting from his horse tears off the cask and trophies of the great consul with his and while he yet could see despoils him of his honour all his beauty is dissolved in his fall
and strait a stygian colour his snow·white limbs and all the glory blasts of his admired form his amber hair disorder'd falls his limber neck can bear no more its former weight but as opprest sinks with his head into his milky breast

so when then

cythereian star again

rising refresh'd from the eöan main himself to venus boasts if clouds invade his face the lustre of his beams will fade and soon decreasing in that mask of night retires his languishing and fainting light
ev'n pedianus as he takes in hand his helmet at his naked face doth stand amaz'd and checks his rage and then away bearing with shouts unto his friends his prey he spurs his furious steed which stains with gore from his fierce mouth the frothy rems he wore
but then marcellus fierce in arms came on and meeting him the honour he had won thus gratulates
go antenorides go on and by such valiant acts as these surpass thy ancestours· it now said he remains the spoils of hannibal should be

our prize
then fir'd with rage his fatal lance

with dreadfull noise he threw nor had perchance his wish been vain had not the obvious force of gestar with his body stop'd the course o'th flying shaft for while he fighting near at hand defends his general the spear not aim'd at him past through him ending all his mighty threatnings in his changed fall
with that the general with speed withdrew struck with the danger of his death and to the camp retir'd
then with a headlong rout the libyan army turn'd their arms about and all contend who shall most speedy fly their enemies pursue and satisfie the anger of their woes while ev'ry man with emulation shows to the revenging gods and heav'n his sword

all stain'd with blood

that day did first afford

that which ev'n from the gods none durst believe before that it was possible to give a stand to hannibal in fight but then they took his chariots and men and strip'd the living and thus joy'd to see that hannibal did from the slaughter flee return
marcellus to the god of war in honour is compar'd and greater far in triumph march'd then when he once did bring

opimous spoils to the tarpeian king

but when the libyan prince with much ado had from his trenches forc'd the conqu'ring fo when and with how much hostile blood shall wipe off this stain ausonia saw me fly
oh iove said he dost thou conclude that am worthy after trebia thus to dy

and you my troops who are

alass now vanquished without a war by capua wealth not degenerate from former acts have seen you turn of late your conqu'ring ensigns from the latines and shew'd them your backs and when call'd to stand and fight from me you fled affrighted all as if from the italian general
what then o'th antient war remains said he in you who can when recall you flee thus hannibal while with loud shouts their prey the romane troops to nola bear away
but rome which had been long inur'd to hear the sad disasters of their friends and ne're enjoy'd success the joyfull tidings brought at length how happily they then had fought with that great favour of the gods erects her drooping head and courage recollects
but first those coward youths that slowly to the war were drawn and while it rag'd withdrew and hid themselves from danger punish'd be for their concealment
then with infamy they mark all those that through a fond desire of life had arts invented to retire or in a league with hannibal had bin involv'd and purge the nation from that sin
that fatal counsel's punish'd and thy crime metellus who consulted in a time of danger to desert thy native land
such then the hearts of men the women stand resolv'd to equal them and to require a share in glory

but the ambitious vain desires to raise unto himself the empty name and praise of a brave gen'rous minde upon him call to solemnize a joyfull funeral

for while a parley

gracchus did demand

and the perfidious promise entertain'd of the lucanian people sad to tell by his host's treachery surpriz'd he fell and hannibal with greediness assum'd the praise to see his corps entomb'd
but soon as it was known that with such haste to the campanian walls the libyan past affairs no where stand still
both consuls take the field with speed
nola and arpis make what strength they can young fabius among the rest his hasty forces brings along
there nero here syllanus day and night their cohorts speed to the desired fight and from all quarters come resolving all their gen'rals to oppose gainst hannibal alone
while nearer to tifata he advances where the hill's vicinity press'd on the neighb'ring walls and looking down from that near height survays the lower town
but when such numbers of allies he found which with their arms the gates encompass'd round

that entrance was deny'd to him alone

and that they could not sally from the town doubtfull of the event sometime he thought through all that then oppos'd him to have fought a passage with his sword and then declin'd again whate're before he had design'd and seeks those myriads by policy to draw from the besieged gates and free th inclosed walls
thus therefore his resolves he with himself debates and cares revolves
oh whither tend my troubled thoughts shall in this unequal place new dangers try and capua see me fly or sitting still upon the top of this adjoyning hill shall endure this town of my allies to be destroy'd and fall before mine eys such me nor fabius nor minutius found when escap'd from hills encompass'd round with armed troops with victory compell'd the affrighted herd to scatter through the field flames from their burning horns wheree're they run
nor yet are all my arts and projects done if capua cannot now defended be by us yet rome may be besieg'd
when he had thus his resolution fix'd before the sun had rais'd from the eöan shore his horses breathing day both with his hand and voice he draws his troops together and declares his high design
go on said he my souldiers let all difficulties be surmounted by your valour and as fast as you can march away now boldly haste to rome you go this march the alps to you this cannae did decree
go and into

th ilîack walls your targets drive and there

retalliate capua ruins which so dear shall cost that you shall see high tow'rs and iove from his tarpeian temple to instructed thus away the army hies rome in their ears rome onely in their eys is fix'd and they believe the diligence of hannibal that action did commence more aptly then had he conducted them

from the

aetolian fatal field
the stream

of swift vulturnus overpast the rear to stop th italians that behinde them were burn all their boats and then with nimble bands march over all the sidicinian lands and thracian cales that its antient name did from thy son fair orithya claim then alifanus that great plenty yields of bacchus fruits and the casinian fields inhabited by nymphs and straitway near to those aquinas and fregellae where the smoaking giant buried lies in haste they then with like speed they past o're lofty hills where warlike frusino sticks on hard rocks and where anagnia too hangs on a rising hill and plenty yields of corn
at length into labîcus fields and plains he enters and those walls declines batter'd by telegon
his high designs admit no stop nor pleasant algida nor yet gabinian iuno tow'rs can stay his march but on like a rude storm he goes to those low banks where anyo gently flows with sulph'rous waters and with silence to old tiber arms
when here the line he drew

of's camp and set his standard up and shook

the banks with cavalry first ilia strook with fear flies to her husband's sacred cave and all the frighted nymphs the waters leave
but the italian dames as if they had no walls at all affrighted run like mad about the streets and figur'd by their fear those wounded ghosts before their eys appear that at sad trebia and ticinus stream were slain brave paulus gracchus and with them flaminius seems to wander up and down
the waies and all the passes of the town are throng'd
the stately senate troubled to behold their fear endeavour to subdue their sad distraction with an angry frown yet tears sometimes with silence trickle down under their helmets as they doubtfull are what fortune threatens or the gods prepare
through their high tow'rs the youth dispersed thought affairs were then to such a period brought that was enough for rome her walls to keep
but hannibal who scarce the whole night's sleep had to his weary souldiers granted rose betimes an enemy to all repose and thinking whatsoever time was spent in slumber that so much from life was rent his radiant arms puts on commands his light numidians to break forth and then in sight of frighted rome with nimble coursers round about her trembling bulwarks with a sound like thunder rides
sometimes the sev'ral ways the avenues and passes he survays now gainst the barricado'd gates his spear he strikes and seems delighted with their fears

then pleas'd he to the lofty hills retires

and entring with his eys the town enquires of places and their causes and in that survey had taken time to penetrate into all parts and ev'ry thing had seen had fulvius with a strong relief not been at hand nor was the siege of capua quite relinquish'd but the libyan with the sight of rome much satisfied in his desires with his insulting troops to th camp retires
but when the night from heav'n was chas'd away and with the first appearance of the day the ocean blush'd and morn reviv'd again their labours breaking down the works amain he pours his forces out and with a cry as loud as he could make oh souldiers by our many trophies and our hands in blood now sacred make said he your wishes good equal your own desires attempt and dare as much in arms as rome hath cause to fear
destroy this heap and there is nought for you in all the world beside left to subdue nor let the fame of their original from mars retard you you that city shall now take by myriads enter'd long ago of warlike senones accustom'd to be taken and perhaps amidst their fears

their senatours in their triumphal chairs

like their sit expecting by your hands a noble death resolv'd to dy
thus he but the oënotrian youth require no language of their general to fire their thoughts their wives and children with their dear parents that up to heav'n lamenting rear

their feeble palms sufficiently excite

their courage and presenting to their sight their babes ev'n penetrating with their cry their hearts their armed hands with kisses ply
on they desire to go and to oppose their bodies for their walls against their foes then on their friends reflecting swallow down their tears
but when the gates were open thrown and the whole army sallyed forth a cry mingled with pray'rs and groans invades the sky from the high walls the matrons with their hair dishevel'd howle and lay their bosoms bare
but fulvius flying out before the rest exclaims who knows not that the libyans prest through a necessity to come before our walls he flies from capua gates as more he would have said with horrid murmurs from the broken clouds loud cracks of thunder come
for when the threatning libyan father iove as he from aethiopia did remove beheld approaching near the romane walls the other gods he strait together calls commands the dardan temples to defend and quickly into the sev'n tow'rs descend
himself high seated on the capitol musters up all his forces summons all the winds and clouds with storms of hail then powr's thunder and lightning down with stygian show'rs
the poles with horrour shake the heav'ns are quite obscur'd the earth is cover'd o're with night the tempest blinds their eys and rome though near to the approaching fo doth disappear
flames from the clouds upon the army thrown continue still their noise and hiss upon

their blasted limbs here notus boreas there

and africus with cloudy wings appear and war with such a rage and fury move as might suffice the wrath and minde of iove then sudden cataracts of water fall mix'd with black storms and blasts and cover all the neighb'ring champagn with a foaming flood
iove on the top of all the mountain stood and as he thunder poiz'd in his it gainst the shield of hannibal his stand not yet resolv'd to quit with fury throws his lance's head strait melts and his sword flows as from the forge it were but newly ta'ne
at length his arms thus burnt he doth restrain his men declares the vanity of all that secret fire that from the clouds did fall and murmurs intermix'd with winds but then after so many miseries of his men and ruins pour'd from heav'n the fo not seen nor sword in all the storms that there had been he bids his fainting army to retire to camp and sadly thus revives his ire
well to the winds and thou now oh rome the safety of one day dost ow but thee the morrow's light shall not defend from us though angry iove himself descend to earth to guard thee
and as this he spoke from the clear heav'ns a sudden lustre broke and all the clouds dispers'd
the purged sky shin'd out again the romanes instantly perceiv'd the god and straitway laying all their arms aside to the high capitol erect their humble hands and pious round the sacred hill their joyfull laurel bound

and then the chearfull face of iove bedew'd

of late with no small sweat thus praying view'd
grant father iove say they thou chief of all the gods grant that hannibal may fall by thine own sacred shaft in fight for none can him destroy we fear but thou alone
as thus they pray'd the ev'ning gan invest the earth with shades and silence stop'd the rest
but night by sol dispers'd as from the sea he rais'd his lamp and use of life with day restor'd to mortals hannibal agen came on nor did the romane youth within their trenches keep
but when they came as near to fight as one might well have thrown a spear their swords scarce drawn the light of heav'n began to fail thick darkness suddenly o'reran the skies the day was put to flight and iove began again to arm for fight the winds blew high and a thick globe of show'rs by auster driv·n along grew hot iove pou'rs his thunder down by which he atlas shakes with taurus pindus rhodope the lakes of erebus it heard and buried far in darkness once again celestial war typhaeus saw
now notus whistling loud comes on and whirling round a pitchy cloud full fraught with hail the libyan charg'd in vain struggling and threatning and him forc'd again into his camp but he no sooner there had lai'd his arms aside but strait a clear and joyfull face of heav'n again was shown nor could you think mild iove his bolts had thrown or had with thunder torn the peacefull sky
all this he vex'd endures with constancy

and oft affirming the ensuing day

no more should be against them
onely they their valour of their countrey must assume and lest they should believe to ruin rome might prove a sin where was pray said he the thunder of their conqur'ing iove when we with these our swords th aetolian champagn strow'd with slaughter when the tyrrhen pools o'reflow'd with humane blood
if now the king of gods fights for the romane walls with so much ods of thunder thrown why strikes he not at me who fight against him midst this noise no we most poorly turn our backs to storms and winde oh pray resume that courage and that minde which while as yet the leagues and the decrees of senate were in force did prompt us these our arms to take in hand
thus ev'ry breast he fires till sol his weary steeds releast
the following night could not his cares allay sleep durst not once approach him with the day his former rage returns and then agen he summons to the fight his frighted men and strikes his dreadfull shield the noise and storms of heav'n so imitating with his arms
but when he found that rome so confident was of the gods that she supplies had sent unto the betick coast and that by night the troops march'd from the walls full of despight and rage that the besieg'd such leisure had as now secure of hannibal more mad he presseth forward and advanceth near the walls when iuno almost sick with care thus iove with counsel seeks to qualifie
sister said he and wife most dear to me

when wilt thou check this tyrian youth or when

wilt thou restrain this furious man agen let it suffice sagunthus to destroy to level the high alps and to annoy and chains impose upon the sacred po and to pollute the lakes
he's ready now into our temples and our tow'rs to break
stop him for you may see as now we speak how he prepares how he for fire exclaims to imitate our thunder with his flames
to this saturnia giving thanks through air much troubled to the earth descends and there seising the youth's whither said she thou dost thou run and not to be maintain'd by mortals dost a war pursue tis iuno speaks to thee with that she drew her vail of clouds away and shew'd her face thou hast not now with phrygian swains alass or the laurentines to contend behold for ile remove the mist awhile unfold all things to thee observe and see thou where that hill's high top ascends into the air

parrhasian king

of neighb'ring hills the

aventine doth rise

see how diana shakes before thine eys her torches fir'd from phlegethon how she hath strip'd her arms for fight then that way see

how mars in cruel arms that

field that bears

his name hath fill'd there ianus furious wars and here quirinus ev'ry deity fights from his hill but then observe with me

how iove his aegis breathing storms and fire

shakes and with how great flames he feeds his ire or this way turn thy face and if thou dare behold the thunderer what tempests are beneath his nod or when he shakes his head what thunder falls what dreadfull flames are shed against thine eys at length give way unto the gods nor such titanian wars pursue
this said the man intractable to peace or rule yet wondring at the stormy face and fiery members of the gods with pain away she drew and peace to heav'n again and earth restor'd
he looking still behinde retires and to the camp much vex'd in minde commands his ensigns strait to march away and threatens to return another day when through the air a clearer light displaies it self and phoebus gilds the trembling seas
but when the romanes from the walls beheld far off that hannibal had left the field and pull'd his ensigns up they silent view each other's face and nodding onely shew that which as yet through greatness of their fear they durst not then believe nor willing were to think him gone but rather that he then practis'd his punick frauds and arts agen
in this suspense each silent mother stands kissing her children till the punick bands quite vanish'd from their eys and fear remov'd all his suspected plots but fancies prov'd

kept in the arcenal they thence essai'd to gain the spartan arms should ne're prevail o're troy nor should they with their honour sail back to amycle
for it was by fate ordain'd that none those walls should penetrate that did possess that image and then our

tydides joyn'd with ithacus the tow'r

entred by stratagem and having slain

the guard just at the entrance of the fane thence the celestial image strait convai'd and troy unto our fates was open lai'd
but when on the oënotrian coast he built a city troubled at his former guilt appease the phrygian goddess with his pray'rs and ilian gods devoutly he prepares
then on a lofty tow'r a temple strait to trojan pallas a most hatefull seat

was rais'd
when midst his sleep the threatning maid

discov'ring her great deity thus said this fabrick diomed which here you raise unworthy of the honour of such praise
to us garganus nor the daunian land are due him rather seek whose pious hand now the first walls of better troy doth rear in the laurentine fields
go thither there that captiv'd relique of their fathers lay
troubled at this advice he hasts away

to saturn kingdom where anchises

son

a conqu'rer then

lavinian troy begun

and's dardan arms in a laurentine grove

had fix'd
but as the daunian fleet did move near tiber mouth and diomedes there on shore had pitch'd his shining tents with fear the trojans trembled till in his a pledg of peace extending to the land an hoary tydaeus son amidst the trojans murmurs thus begun thy mindeful rage aeneas and thy fear now confidently lay aside whate're at troy at simöis or xanthus flood or near the scaean port with so much blood and sweat by us was done was not alass our crime the gods and fate it brought to pass
now think on what remains why do not we with better auspicies of time agree to live let's joyn our peaceful hands
this shall be witness of our league and shew'd withall trojan minerva from the poop
by her

fell the bold

gauls that rome invaded nor

of that great people did there one remain that to his native land return'd again

dismai'd at this the general his bands

much joy'd that they should march away commands to pull their ensigns up and to remove into those fertile plains where in a grove

wealthy

feronia worshipp'd and o're all

the grounds capêna sacred waters fall
from birth of antient faunus as tis said through a long tract of time together lay'd great wealth by frequent gifts encreas'd and there alone preserv'd by a religious fear the gold untouch'd for many ages lay their barb'rous hearts and greedy minds the prey pollutes and arms them to contemn the gods
from thence it pleas'd him through remoter rodes to turn where fields plough'd by the brutian swain extended are to the trinacrian main
while discontented thus the libyans go to th rhegian coast brave fulvius the fo remov'd from's country at the walls appears of capua and to the besieged bears th unwelcom news
their miseries were than extreamly high when fulvius thus began to all of name in arms take this disgrace away by valour
shall this treach'rous place to us another carthage after all her violated leagues and hannibal sent to our very gates her proud demand of an alternate equal consul stand and from her lofty turrets now dismai'd still look for libyan cohorts to her aid deeds to his words he adds and streight he calls for tow'rs of oak the highest walls he could surmount and instantly commands to joyn huge beams with cords and iron bands

by which the tallest posts of gates he brake

and all delays of bars would quickly shake
here fenc'd with starlike piles on ev'ry side a mount is rais'd and there they are imploy'd

to raise the

vinea arm'd above and all

soon done which he could necessary call he gives the sign to scale the walls and fills the town with terrour of impending ills when suddenly an happy omen shin'd on his attempts an hinde which rare we finde of such a colour that the swans or snow surpass'd in whiteness which when with his plow capys the circuit of those walls design'd a taken with its kinde familiarity when young he fed and a kinde sense of man had in it bred
all wildness lost she us'd to take her stand to feed at table by her master's hand when stroak'd much pleas'd oft the campanian dames smooth'd her with combs and in the neighb'ring streams renew'd her whiteness thus the hind became the deity o'th place and had for name diana servant and as to a god with holy ensigns they the altars load
lusty and strong in life though aged she a thousand years with great felicity had past and houses built by trojans there equal'd in age but not her death was near for chac'd by cruel wolves that suddenly into the town a dolefull prodigie in war by night had enter'd as the day began to break out at the gates away she ran and frighted fled into the plain near to the walls where by the souldiers ta'ne

who joyfully contended in the chase

to thee latonian goddess on the place the general off'ring her for unto thee he knew that sacrifice must pleasing be pray'd his design might by thine aid be crown'd and strait relying on the goddess round the city mov'd his troops and where into an orb the walls were bent obliquely drew a trench and kept them there inclos'd with arms like beasts in toils
while fear increas'd in others with a stately plume out at the ports doth warlike taurea come chafing his foaming steed to him for brave exploits maurusian shafts the general gave but lately and an autololian band he spurring on his steed which scorn'd to stand hearing the trembling cornets when so near he came that he perciev'd the fo might hear his neighb'ring call said claudius who i'th art of war excell'd and honour with desert in many a fight had gain'd if yet upon his valour he rely may he alone enter the field and fight with me
what stay'd the romane when twas heard what he had said was that it was ordain'd before on pain of death that none should dare to entertain a single fight without the general leave
but soon as fulvius his permission gave into the open plain with joy he flies and strait thick clouds of dust like billows rise
but scorning all assistance of the thong or loop to make his weapon fly more strong taurea with his bare strength his spear advanc'd and it with headlong rage and fury lanc'd

into the air while of another minde

the brave seeking where to finde a certain place to give a wound now shook then couch'd his spear and many a threatning stroke pretends till fix'd in's shield his jav'lin stood but was depriv'd of the desired blood
then instantly he drew his sword when strait taurea to fly the menaces of fate with his steel'd heel drives on his nimble steed
while at his back the romane with a speed great as his rage pursu'd and very near giving the reins approach'd him and as fear the conquer'd so the conquerour desire of his deserved blood honour and ire into the gates invite and while they there scarce credit what they see that he should dare alone to break into their walls and haste so boldly through th'amazed town he past through th adverse port and to his friends retir'd
with that th mindes of all the rest were fir'd with the like heat and industry invade the walls and where he had a passage made to enter flames and swords strait shine then showrs of stones and darts assault the highest tow'rs none could the rest in courage to engage excell all hands were equall'd by their rage
dictaean shafts fly through the air and fall with wounds i'th midst o'th town
the general is pleas'd to finde that they had left no room for his encouragement they all assume so eagerly their task
whom when he spy'd so well resolv'd and fortune made a guide to all up to the gate he furious came and sought with danger to encrease his fame

three brothers twiris who each a chosen band

had of an hundred men at their command guarded that pass and there their station held of these in beauty numitor excell'd laurens in running and laburnus tall above the other but their weapons all were diff'rent one renowned for his bow for's spear the other wont in fight to throw his poison'd lance and not to trust his sword but lamps with flames and sulphur mix'd the third compos'd
so famous in a former age that horrid monster of a triple rage gerîon fought on the atlantick shore whose three three sev'ral weapons bore one cruel flames behinde him t'other drew his bow the third his trusty jav'lin threw and dealt three sev'ral waies at once a wound
when these thus varying fight the consul found with diff'rent arms the slaughter that appear'd at th entrance of the gate and posts besmear'd with blood of such as thither did advance with an inraged force his twisted lance he throws
importing death th italian yew cuts through the air and where as then he drew his bow and from above his arrows ply'd stout numitor was naked pierc'd his side
but not content to fight besieged there in war unskilfull though still apt to dare with headlong heat rash virius open threw the gate and broke into the field and to the conqu'rours rage his miserable men expos'd these scipio fiercely charg'd
but then as he the offer'd troop insatiate kills calenus born upon tifata hills

bred up to bold attempts his courage great

as was his body often wont to beat lyons to fight to contend with steers and down the winding horns to bend of fiercest bulls by force unto the ground and for his vigorous fate before renown'd he while bold virius from the town expell'd some rash assailants whether that he held his useless or to shun delay into the field had naked made his way and nimbler now the panting fugitives o'retakes and sev'ral ways victorious drives and now already veliternus through the belly he had thrust and marius who with equal sport was wont to exercise equestral fights with scipio by him dyes struck backward to the ground by an huge stone torn from the earth
expiring with a groan h'implores his friend and gaping underneath the rock was crush'd
but sorrow for his death doubling his strength while all his face o'reflows with tears his singing cornel scipio throws hasting to his expiring friend to show the wish'd·for comfort of a dying fo
the shaft as if a bird the liquid air divided had past through his brest and there dissolv'd his mighty frame swift as its way a nimble galley makes upon the sea which flies more nimbly then the winds as oft as to their breasts reduc'd the oars aloft the curling surges strike and with the strength of one joynt strook runs farther then her length
but volesus ascanius who had cast his arms away that he might lighter haste

unto the walls as through the plain he fled

pursues
strait sever'd by his sword his head drops at the owner's feet but by the force of running forward in its speedy course the following trunk at length beyond it falls
no longer now to keep their open walls did the besieged hope
when strait about they face and shut their own companions out that beg to be receiv'd
their hinges then they turn and strive too late their bars agen and bolts to fix
at this th italians prest more fiercely on and the besieg'd infest
and had not earth been taken from their sight wrap'd in the stygian bosom of the night the souldiers their assault so furious made the broken gates had then been open lai'd
but yet the darkness brought not equal rest to all
these fearless slumbers such as blest with victory men know enjoy but there with dolefull cries of women ev'ry where with dire complaints and trembling parents groans capua affrighted her sad fate bemoans and prays a period of her woes to see
the head and authour of her treachery the senate murmurs
virius all cares of life now lai'd aside aloud declares no hopes of aid from hannibal
said he hop'd to rule o're rome and did agree if gods the libyan arms and better fate assisted had to capua to translate trojan quirinus empire
it was that sent that force to shake their walls and high tarpeian tow'rs
had the courage there to ask an equal consul that might bear

the fasces in our name
it hitherto

sufficeth we have liv'd and while we now have night enough whoever in his minde affecteth it at acheron may finde eternal liberty let him repair unto my table and my cates and there drenching himself in bacchus fruits his minde subdu'd he soon a remedy may finde for all his woes the sting of death may charm and with that pleasant poison fate disarm
this said a multitude attend him home
amidst his palace in a spacious room a mighty pyle of wood did still remain the common receptacle of the slain
but yet the people grief and fear distract while now too late on decius they reflect their thoughts and his brave valour punish'd by a cruel banishment
then from the sky divinest faith looks down and vexeth their· fallacious hearts and strait through ev'ry ear a secret voice is spred break no accord or oath ye mortals with the cruel sword but keep your faith inviolate for this then thrones that shine with purple better is
for who with fallacies delights to break a league or shall the slender hopes forsake of his afflicted friend his house his wife perpetual trouble shall attend his life shall ne're want tears but both by night and day despis'd and violated faith by sea and land pursuing shall him still torment
then in a cloud disguis'd erinnys went to all assemblies touch'd their tables and sits down and feeds and then with her own hand

bowls froathing up with stygian gore prefers

and largely plagues and death administers
but virius while yet ruin she pretends diving into his soul the pyle ascends and sticks in her embrace commanding strait to kindle it and so to joyn their fate
the night her limits touch'd and now amain the furious conquerour came on again
when the campanian youth upon the walls milo who thither his companions calls beheld affrighted strait they open threw the gates and such as wanted courage to avoid their punishment by death with low and trembling knees now entertain the fo
the town her houses by the tyrian guest polluted op'ning her blinde rage confest
women and children in confusion run with the sad senate that their woes begun and vulgar crew by none lamented whiles the army all stood leaning on their piles to view those men who nor prosperity nor misery could bear sometimes to see them sweep the ground with beards which trimm'd they wear down to their breasts with dust their whiter hair to stain and poorly weeping to entreat most shamefully and yielding air to beat with their affeminate howlings
but while these unmanly acts the wondring souldier sees and still incens'd expects the signal to o'rethrow the walls behold religion through each breast with silent sense of pity goes and their fierce mindes doth by her pow'r compose
a gentler god doth sensibly inspire their hearts to lay aside all thoughts of fire

and their destructive torches not to burn

and into dust at once the temples turn
he likewise then suggests to all unseen that that proud town's foundation had been by capys lai'd of old he tells them there fair houses fit for habitation were extended far into delicious fields
thus by degrees their former fury yields to milder thoughts and quickly mollifi'd in ev'ry furious breast all anger dy'd
the trojan houses willing safe to keep iove likewise thither sent the god of sheep pan who still seems as he were hanging and scarce on the earth imprints wheree're he stand one horned foot his wanton plays

with a tegaean hide and in cross ways

wagging his tail desired stroaks bestows
a pine surrounds his hair and shady brows on his red front arise two little horns his ears upright a squallid beard adorns his chin a past'ral staff he alwaies bears and a slick on his left side wears no ragged rock so steep and high doth rise on which his body poiz'd like one that flies he will not dare through pathless waies to tread sometimes he laughing backward turns his head to see the sportings of his bushy tail upon his back then lifts his hand to vail his forehead from the sun's too fervent rays and pastures with his shadow'd sight survaies
he when he had the god's commands fulfill'd their raging hearts appeas'd and fury still'd to the arcadian groves away he speeds and his lov'd maenalus where on shrill reeds

he sweetly plays and with his rural song

leads from the sacred hill his flocks along
but fulvius commanding that the fire should from the gates be kept and leave entire the walls th ausonian legions to shew the noble temper of their minds withdrew their flames and swords but from the temples and the houses that enrich'd with gold did stand a wealthy prey they took with that which fed their riot and by which they perished effeminate garments that their men array'd and tables rich from forein lands convey'd with goblets that provok'd to luxury set with eöan gems nor could they see an end of silver and the carved weight expressly made for feasts of golden plate
then came the captives in a num'rous train with all their coin sufficient to maintain a war with servants that in multitudes did at their banquets wait
but when from plunder of the town agen the gen'ral by the trumpet's sound his men had call'd a noble cherisher of great attempts to milo from his lofty seat

he thus began

lanuvian youth whom we

from iuno sospita receive from me this martial honour for thy victory accept and bout thy tower'd temples try

this

mural crown
this done he streightway sent

for all the nobles that first punishment had merited and for their treach'rous deeds beneath his juster ax each guilty bleeds
but that fierce valour taurea for to hide ev'n in a fo that honour had been try'd

were base with a loud voice exclaims shalt thou

thus unreveng'd by me deprive me now a soul more great then thine of this my sword or by the lictour when thou giv'st the word shall this most valiant head dissever'd fall at such base feet on us this never shall be by the gods allow'd
then with a look threatning and full of rage he sudden strook his warlike sword quite through his breast and dy'd
to whom the romane general reply'd go and the ruin of thy countrey thus accompany in death
what minds in us remain what is our valour what we are each man of us shall be discern'd in war
if thou dost think it shamefull to abide just punishment thou mightst have fighting dy'd thy countrey suff'ring at the very time with streams of blood for her unhappy crime
but mixing joys with sorrows the dire hand of fortune then in the iberian land two noble scipioes had destroy'd that there great griefs and honours to their countrey were
by chance a youth of that illustrious name

into the

dicarchaean city came

after extremities of war and there resided
fame reporting to his ear his friend's sad destiny and tears though he ne're us'd to stoop under adversity beating his breast he tears his garments nor could sense of honour or a souldier nor the perswasions of his friends prevail but still his angry piety doth rail on the unequal gods hates all relief and usual comforts of encreasing grief

and now some days were spent in sad complaint

and still his father's ghost seems conversant before his eyes and therefore he intends to raise the souls and manes of his friends and by discourse with them at length the rage and smart of his great sorrows to asswage
so by a neighb'ring lake invited where the acherusian liquour doth declare the horrid entrance to avernus strait his thoughts are fir'd to know ensuing fate
and therefore to autonöe who then under apollo name the sacred den and tripods kept he goes and open lays the counsels of his troubled breast and prays to see his father's face
without delay the prophetess commands him strait to slay to th shades below the usual sacrifice two lambs as day began to rise and while they yet were breathing as they dy'd the flowing blood within the earth to hide then shall the stygian empire send to thee her people
what thou more desir'st quoth she to know a greater prophetess shall sing
for to thee true oracles will bring from the elysian fields and thou shalt see amidst old sibyl rites performed by me that fam'd phoebean breast's prophetick shade
go then and when the dewy night hath made her course beyond her middle line then bring th aforesaid victims to the stygian king chast to avernus entrance
likewise joyn to them choice honey and the purest wine
he quickned by her counsel and no less with the great name o'th promis'd prophetess

the sacrifices for his dark design

prepares and when to the appointed line the night arriv'd and what was finished equal'd the following darkness from his bed he rose and to the troubled entrance went of the tartarean port where diligent to keep her word the prophetess had then all things fulfill'd and sate i'th stygian den
then that way where at first the broken ground a cave that ne're by sun was seen is found and sadly groaning from its hollow mouth belcheth cocytus bitter streams the youth into't she leads commands him in the ground with's sword to dig an hole and trotting round mutt'ring a secret charm she bids that all the beasts for sacrifice in order fall
to pluto first a bull to hecate

with a

chast neck an heifer then to thee

alecto and megaera ever sad the chosen bodies of two sheep that had but two years liv'd on these they milk infus'd honey and wine
the youth stood still amus'd while the old prophetess exclaim'd she well perceiv'd each face that did with pluto dwell
see said she all hell approaching and now the third empire in my view doth stand
behold what various shapes and whatsoe're was born of man and dy'd together there from deepest chaos come
the cyclops see scylla and those that with such cruelty their thracian horses fed with flesh of men attend and mark and without fear agen put up thy sword
those souls that in such haste march on before the off'red blood to tast

let pass till the chast sibyl shade appear

in the mean time behold how speedy there comes that unburied ghost to speak to thee and hath as when alive the liberty to use its voice till on the fun'ral wood its body burn if it hath touch'd no blood
this noble scipio saw and troubled at the sudden apparition said what sad chance thee from thy sinking country when our horrid wars require such gallant men renowned captain snatch'd for none could thee appius in valour or in policy excel
ten times the glorious lamp of day hath rose since return'd from capua and saw thee then bathing thy wounds and sad onely that they continued still so bad thou could'st not go unto the walls and quite depriv'd thee of the honour of that fight
to which the ghost reply'd th ensuing day the pleasant horses of the sun away from me then fainting turn'd and banish'd me to the dark waters for eternity
but while vain vulgar rites the tedious care of friends pursues my body they forbare to burn that far about at length they may it to my father's sepulcher convey
but by thy glorious deeds which emulate those of our father mars thee entreat let drugs that keep the bodies of the dead entire in other lands be banished

from me that so my wandring

shade may soon

go freely to the gates of acheron
most noble branch of antient claudus line none of my cares shall be preferr'd to thine

the youth replies although they are not small

that now afflict me for know through all the nations of the world a various sense of tombs and ashes keeps a difference and varies much the fun'rals of the dead
in the iberian country as tis said an antient custom tis that vulturs tire on their dead bodies
when their kings expire th hyrcanian people think it best t'expose to dogs their members
the egyptians close

in stone perfum'd their bodies after fate

and hardly from their tables separate the bloodless ghosts
in pontus they ordain the heads of men to empty of the brain and so embalm'd for many ages keep
what should we say of those that buried deep dig naked garamantians up in sand or of the nasamonians that command their dead to bury in the cruel seas upon the libyan coast the celtae please their empty skuls with gold about to ring and such for cups unto their tables bring
but the cecropians did by chance ordain that such as in their country's wars were slain should be together burn'd
oppos'd to these time onely doth interr the carcases of scythian people who on stakes of wood impal'd hang melting with corrupted blood
as thus he talk'd autonöe the shade th sibyl rising set a period said to your discourse
behold that priestess who so much of future things when living knew that ev'n the gods that they knew more deny'd
and now tis time your men should go aside

that you and the beasts may burn
this said

with myst'ries fill'd the old

cymaean maid

after the sacrificed blood her mouth had touch'd and tasted viewing well the youth whose face was beautiful began when etherial light not idly did enjoy my voice was heard in the cymaean den to answer people and thee scipio then in future ages and in rome affairs concern'd sung
but yet thy father's cares scarce merited my words for they nor made a due enquiry after what said nor yet observ'd it
but now mark since thou desir'st to know the fates of rome which now on thine depend for thy diligence to take the oracles of life from hence perceive and here thy father's manes see on th arm'd iberian thou with victory thy father shalt revenge to mars before due years entrusted and thy sword the moor shall of his joys deprive
thou shalt rejoyce when thee as omen to the war the voice of rome shall choose when in th iberian land
carthage thou shalt subdue
then to command more eminent thou shalt be rais'd nor iove from thee his care and kindness shall remove till the whole war he into libya drive
and there to thee ev'n hannibal shall give to be subdu'd
but oh ingrateful rome which after all these honours thee of home

and

country shall deprive
as this she spake

she turn'd her steps towards the stygian lake
whate're ill chance of life attends me the youth replies will my endeavours try

yet may my breast be free from guilt but now

pray thee since the onely cause that thou didst live was humane labours here to aid a while thy steps restrain renowned maid and unto me the silent shades report with all the terrours of the stygian court
she soon assents to that which he requir'd but thou a kingdom not to be desir'd

said she dost open

for the darkness there

people that once innumerable were inhabite and through endless shadows fly and yet make up but one great family
th midst a dark and airy space of large extent there is which common death doth charge with all that from the teeming world's first birth the fiery air produc'd the seas or earth
thither all things descend what hath or shall perish that gloomy field devoureth all
ten gates this kingdom compass whereof one receives the warlike sons of mars alone another those that famous laws have made and the foundations first of cities lay'd
the third for ceres harmless tribe that go by fraud unpoison'd to the shades below
next those that pleasant arts did first invent and way of living full of all content and which not father phoebus would disdain verses compos'd their proper gate maintain
the next the shipwrack port for so that gate is nam'd is kept for such as meet their fate in winds and cruel storms
another wide and near this stands for such as guilty dy'd and there confess their sins their sev'ral pains ev'n at the entrance rhadamanth ordains

and empty death inflicts
the to bands

of women that flock thither open stands where her pale groves the chast proserpina maintains
and near to this another way and gate there is by infants cries to them assign'd and all those companies that in the port of life extinguish'd are and virgin troops whose nuptial tapers were turn'd into fun'ral flames
but then remote from this there is another gate of note which night dissolving shines like rising day and through the shadow of a secret way leads to th elysian fields here nor to hell subjected nor in heav'n the pious dwell
but quite beyond all seas upon the brink th sacred fountain thither throng to drink forgetfulness of minde in lethe streams
the last with gold refulgent feels the beams of light and shines as if the moon were there
this way the blessed souls to heav'n repair and when a thousand lustra time hath past forgetting dis into their bodies haste death his black jaws wide op'ning to and fro through all these ways and ports doth wandring go
then a slow gulph without a body far extended and dark muddy lakes there are

where

phlegethon with swelling waters burns

the banks on ev'ry side and roaring turns the flaming quarries up with storms of fire
then in another quarter with as dire

a rage

cocytus rolls black waves of blood

and runs a torrent with a foaming flood
but styx which iove himself and all the rest of the immortal gods do still attest

dreadful with pitch and sulphur smoaking mud

drives through his chanel
but then these a flood more dismal froathing with corruption and thick poison belching up the gelid sand with horrid murmurs acheron through all the pools with a black stream doth slowly fall
this venom'd cerberus desires this for her drink tisiphone requires this dire megaera craves nor yet can they with all their drink their raging thirst allay
but the last river breaketh out before the entrance and inexorable door of pluto palace from a fount of tears
there a fourth tribe in sev'ral paths appears of monsters still to watch and terrifie the trembling ghosts with their confused cry devouring grief and leanness that on ill diseases waits with sadness feeding still on tears and paleness without blood with cares base treachery old age that nothing bares without complaint envy with both her hands crushing her throat and poverty that stands deform'd and prone to any thing that's bad with wandring errour and dissension glad to mingle seas with heav'n then briareus that with his hundred hands the gates doth use of hell to open cruel sphynx with blood her besmear'd the furious brood of centaurs with fierce scylla there and the rebellious giants ghosts appear here the dog when he hath broke his chains and off a thousand fetters shook and up and down through hell doth wandring go neither alecto nor megaera though

with fury swell'd come near while bout his loins

his vip'rous tail he fiercely barking twines
on the right hand a yew that like a wood its branches spreads and by cocytus flood water'd more leavy grown there stands here dire and fatal birds vultures that rav'ning tire on carcases and num'rous owls reside with specks of blood their pinions dy'd and greedy harpyes build their nests and thick among the leaves on all the branches stick and make the tree with dolefull cries to nod
among these dreadfull shapes th infernal god sits on a throne examining the crimes of kings and what they did in former times
enchain'd they stand and fore the judge repent too late while all the forms of punishment and furies round about them fly and now how glad would they their scepters disavow those souls which when on earth unworthy and unequal things endur'd with harsh command insult and what they living did not dare to utter now complain of freely there

then

one in cruel chains is bound upon

a rock

another rowls a restless stone

while with her snaky whip megaera still pursues him lab'ring up the lofty hill
such bloody tyrant's punishments shall be but now the time's arriv'd that we to thee must shew thy mother's face whose shade in place the first appears and hither comes apace

pomponia pregnant by iove stealth drew nigh

for when the libyan war in italy fair venus knew endeav'ring to prevent all iuno plots a silent flame she sent

into her father's breast which had not she

foreknown the conquer'd romane altars we by tyrian virgins kindled now had seen
but when the off'red blood had tasted been as the old prophetess advis'd and both each other's faces knew thus first the youth began my dearest mother who to me like some great deity appear'st that thee might have seen how willingly would have dy'd oh what was our sad destiny when that first day that gave me vital breath thee without honour snatch'd away in death
as thus he spoke his mother thus again replies son my death was free from pain for when the burthen of my womb was lay'd by iove command me mercury convei'd to the elysian fields and gave me there an equal place where laeda now and where alcmena by his sacred bounty dwell
but since we now have time my son to tell whence thou didst spring that thou no wars maist fear nor doubt to heav'n by deeds thy self to rear know this when by chance in mid'st of day retired to repose and sleeping lay a sudden close embrace my members bound not such as before my husband's found nor easy unto me and then clear although my heavy eys in slumber were involv'd great iove beheld you may believe this truth nor could his borrow'd shape deceive me then though turn'd into a scaly snake he coyling did a thousand circles make
but soon as thou wert born that should dy it was decreed and then how much did

lament that to thee could not declare

these things before my soul resolv'd to air
at this t'embrace her neck he thrice efsai'd in vain and lost as oft the fleeting shade
this done two ghosts of men that well agreed his father's and his uncle's strait succeed
while through the shadows pressing on he there vain kisses sought and strove those ghosts that were like flying smoak and clouds to apprehend oh thou on whom our empire did depend my dearest sire what god an enemy to the ausonian land did us of thee deprive said he oh wo to me for why was there the least of time that cruel should absent be from thee thy death might have chang'd by this my brest oppos'd in fight
what groans th italian people ev'ry where give at your funerals the senate rear in mars field to each of you a tomb
amidst his speech the hasty ghosts assume the word and first his father's manes barr'd his farther language thus a fair reward is virtue to her self yet it descends sweet to the shades below when mong our friends the glory of our lives survives nor our due praises dark oblivion can devour
but say how great a war doth thee molest our dear renown how oft doth fear my brest invade when but think how fiercely thou go'st on when dangers meet thee but now conjure thee by the cause of our sad fate most valiant youth thy rage to moderate and thy desire to fight sufficient be th examples of our family for thee

for the eighth summer then had reap'd the dry

and rusling sheavs of corn when conqu'ring

had all suppress'd and the tartessiack

the yoak accepted from my brother's hand

notus and raging waves against it heav'd by the coerulean trident it receiv'd the ocean in for by an hidden way the earth's torn entrails the impacted sea asunder threw and breaking through the land with a full tide at once the people and the cities by the tempest's secret force bore quite away
since keeping that divorce by an impetuous flood th unruly main permits not the disjoyn'd to meet again
but yet the space that the two lands divides as fame reports so narrow are the tides that run between barking of dogs and lays of early birds to either side conveys
so rich the soil that it the garners fills of with olives shades the hills titles creats to bacchus and swift steeds that will endure the sound of trumpets breeds

possess'd the land that still his name doth bare
nor was it loss of fame or held a shame for siculus to change sicania name

and ne're the hearts of those that did obey with cruel fears perplex'd ·nor could he be induc'd to violate that faith which he had at the altars sworn
for many years his social league with the ausonian peers entire he kept
but when the fates dissolv'd his aged life the fatal crown devolv'd to's eldest nephew and unto that court of late so good unruly minds resort

not sixteen years of age the king had known

when he eclips'd the glory of his throne unable to sustain his kingdom's weight too confident of his too fickle state
in a short time all crime's protected by the force of arms there all impiety familiarly was known the very name of justice banish'd and a modest shame was in the king held vile
his mother's high descent from pyrrhus the great family of antient aeäcus and thetis son in verse eternal spurr'd this fury on to that so great a precipice
and strait his breast's invaded by a sudden heat to favour the designs of libya and this his sin admitting no delay he makes new leagues by which it was agreed that the sidonian army should recede from sicily if they the conquest gain'd but yet his punishment for this remain'd still fix'd and dire eirnnys him a tomb ev'n in that land deny'd where he no room would yield to his ally
for some whom ire and dayly fears invited to conspire

resolv'd his youth no longer to abide

inflam'd with cruel lusts and bloody pride and adding to his tyranny abhorr'd and vilest acts him slew
and then the sword no measure knew
to this the slaughter they of women add and seizing as a prey

so himself from rhodope doth boreas throw and with tenth waves against the earth doth raise the main and following th ejected seas raves with his roaring wings
by the first war leontine territories wasted are a land where once the cruel laestrigon did reign
the general went furious on

to whom it seem'd all one if slowly he

subdu'd the graecian forces as to be o'recome
through all the plain they frighted fly so as you'd think they were a company of women that his men at first withstood and ceres fields made fertile with their blood
in ev'ry place they re slain nor as they run would furious mars permit them death to shun
such as hop'd flight some safety might afford the general prevented with his sword and urging on his troops that seem'd too slow with his shield's point exclaims go quickly mow with your keen swords that coward people down that in their wrastling exercise alone are skill'd whose lazy youth with joy affect the slender praise to be with olive deckt when they those easy conflicts in a shade have undergon and a poor conquest made
this must your onely honour be if you the enemy as soon as seen subdue

a tyrrhene souldier asylus nam'd

at thrasimenus lake once captive made

the milde commands and easy bondage had of berra undergone and home agen with his kinde master's leave return'd and then resuming arms his former misery reveng'd in the sicilian war while he was mingled in the midst of all the fight and did by chance on's master berra light who to the league from carthage sent did there entring the social war an helmet wear of brass that shutting close secur'd his face the youth he with his sword invades and as fainting with feeble steps he left his stand and backward went o'rethrew him on the sand
hearing the conqu'rour's voice poor berra strait his fearful lingring soul from instant fate recov'ring from his chin the fastning tares of his then treach'rous helmet and to pray'rs had farther language added but amaz'd at that so sudden sight asylus gaz'd on his known face and as his sword he stai'd with's hand with groans and tears obortive said oh beg not life pray or doubtful so entreat tis just that defend my fo
he the best souldier is who first and last in war defends his faith
me first thou hast rescu'd from death and not preserved by thy fo didst him preserve
i'de not deny my self who have endur'd so much of ill to be unworthy and deserving still to fall into things worse should this my hand not make thy way where fire and sword withstand
and kindly raising him as this he said with life the benefits of life repay'd

his first attempts in sicily thus blest

with quiet troops marcellus forward prest and his victorious eagles turning to the ephyreian walls he strait way drew about the syracusian towr's a line yet did his love of fighting now decline
with grave advice he strives to take away their blind resolves and fury to allay
but lest perhaps they might refuse or fear to credit offers that so gentle were the siege with strictest guards still forward went and he with cautious arms then more intent watch'd fearless in the front with secret care designing dangers not expected there
so in the po or in cayster streams swims the white swan and while her body seems unmov'd with the prone river forward goes and with her feet through silent surges rows
but while the town besieg'd still doubtful stands what to resolve their arms and social bands th excited people and the cities sent enforce the camp

then lofty eryx and centuripe

from her high mountain with entella came

entella plentiful in wine a name to troy acestes dear

with these an agathyrnian band was there and tyndaris that glories in her pair

of laeda

sons and agragas that breeds

and brings her num'rous troops of warlike steeds that all the air inflame with neighing loud and roll unto the walls a dusty cloud
their leader grosphus was whose carved shield the monument of antient torture held a fierce bull's image which while bodies burn'd by flames put underneath to bellowings turn'd sad groans and you'd believe some oxen goar'd and driven from their stalls then truly roar'd

but this reveng'd

with these along came those that murm'ring alabis and those that hyspa drink and the perspicuous flows of clear achates vagedrusa too and hypates whose chanel runs so low

pantagya likewise easy to be past

through his small current and which runs so fast the simêthus

hymera descends into the seas

for it divides itself two sev'ral ways and runs to east and west with equal force
nebrodes keepeth this divorce then which no hill with a sicanian shade doth rise more rich this lofty enna made a sacred fortress to the groves of gods
here a dark path to stygian abodes a cave that opens wide the gaping ground detects through which a strange new lover found a way to unknown coasts
pluto this way inflam'd with lust durst venture up to day and leaving doleful acheron above on the forbidden earth his chariot drove

then having ravish'd the

ennaean maid

in haste retiring his black steeds affrai'd to view the face of heav'n and flying day drove back to styx and hid in shades his prey
petreia romane leaders then desir'd and romane leagues callipolis requir'd and eugion arch'd with stone and there they see hadranum and hergentum melitè proud of her stately webs and wealthy store of wool melactè with a fishy shore and cephalaedias near the stormy main whose boist'rous coast in the coerulean plain feeds the vast whales the tauromenians too where ships by dire charybdis in their view in gulphs are swallow'd down and from the bottom strait again are thrown

the rest of the sicilian people there

a thousand were the agathyrnian bands as many strongylos that south stands a thousand sent fascellina the seat

the people then facile and ready tumults to desire their leaders with this boasting language fire

that their four tow'rs and walls no fo as yet

had entred that their fathers saw how great a cloud so inaccessible a town through situation of her port had thrown

upon the

salaminian victories

and eastern trophies when before their eyes three hundred ships and athens in whose ayd the ruins of the persian king were made to serve in one great wrack while they sustain no loss at all were swallow'd in the main

two

brothers born in carthage and ally'd

to carthaginians by the mother's side whose father a sicilian banished from syracuse had them in libya bred in whom sicanian levity conspir'd with tyrian fraud the giddy people fir'd
which when marcellus saw and that no cure the wounds of their sedition would endure the war still growing from the fo more high he streight attests the gods of sicily thy fountains arethusa and the lakes and rivers that unwillingly he takes the war in hand and that those arms which he ne're of himself assum'd the enemy forc'd him to bear
with that the wall he storms and thunders on the city with his arms
an equal fury them together all draws on on either side they fight and fall

with many cov'rings seeming to invade

the stars in height and by a

graecian made

ten stories high which shades of many a grove consum'd a tow'r there was from whence they strove to roll down mighty stones and engines which with fire were arm'd and pow'r down scalding pitch

here cimber at a distance having thrown

a burning lamp the fatal weapon on the side had fix'd the fire assisted by the force of wind quite through the tow'r doth fly and through the lofty machine sev'ral floors encreasing climbes and trembling beams devours with rapid flames which smoak like billows thick to heav'n ascending soon victorious lick the shining top
all places fill'd with smoak and clouds of darkness as with a fierce stroak of thunder dash'd none scaping it they all in one vast ruin into ashes fall
like fortune on the other side by sea the ships attended
for when nearer they unto the city and the houses drew where the port brings the calmed waters to the walls a mischief unexpected there fills by a new device their hearts with fear
a beam exactly smooth and ev'ry where like a ship's mast the knots shav'd off did bear strong grapples firmly fix'd and seising all that fought from the high rampart of the wall caught them aloft with hooks of ir'n and to the midst of all the city backward threw
nor did this force thus toss the men alone but when the steel impuls'd was downward thrown upon a ship and the impetuous stroak fix'd the tenacious teeth within the oak aloft the vessel's tost and suddenly the chains with art let loose most sad to see with such a force into the sea agen is thrown that it there sinks with all the men
beside these stratagems the wall by art made hollow narrow did impart

through which upon the fo they might secure

discharge their weapons from the and this so cunningly contriv'd the fo through the same way no shafts again could throw

thus

graecian policy and art excell'd

their arms and both by sea and land repell'd marcellus with his mighty threatnings and before the walls a dreadful war doth stand
the man th isthmiack swains immortal fame in wit with ease all other overcame that then the world produc'd
not rich but one to whom the heavens and all the earth was known
he by the sun's obscured rays at birth of day could tell what storms would fall if earth were fix'd or did instable hang why bound by certain leagues this globe's encompass'd round by thetis waves the labours of the sea and moon what laws the ocean tides obey
nor is it vain to think that he the sand of the vast world could count who by the hand of a weak woman could with so much skill

draw ships and heaps of stones against an hill

while thus with stratagems he wearied all the teucri and the romane general an hundred sail of tyrian ships their way made towards their relief and plow'd the sea
erected now with sudden hopes their fleet lanch'd from the port the syracusians meet and joyn with them nor on the other side was the ausonian backward to provide his navy but with drowned oars apace cuts through the ocean whose beaten face with frequent stroaks grows white and where they cleave the billows a broad path of foam they leave

both equally insult upon the main

and neptune empire with new storms again trembles through which their shouts and clamours sound and ecchoes full as loud from rocks rebound
and now drawn out for fight the warriours stood and compass with their wings the spacious flood and with their naval toils the wat'ry plain include
both navies in like form amain came on and with their circles crow'd the foaming waves
now no delay's allow'd the dreadful murmurs of the cruel brass sounding the charge through all the ocean pass

which rouzing

triton frighted him their yell

and noise contending with his crooked shell
scarce they the sea rememb'red with so prone a fury to the battel they go on and standing on the gallie's margents throw uncertain darts still nodding to and fro the sea between them is with weapons strew'd while the tall vessel rising as they row'd with lab'ring stroaks the foaming billows cleaves with the black keel and so their aim deceives
but some in fight were torn and with the stroke of the assaulting ship their oars were broke some swiftly through the bulk of others strike with their sharpe prows and in the breach alike are stop'd and stop
but then amidst them all a gally terrible to sight and tall above the rest then which none had before more large been lanch'd from the sidonian shore strikes with four hundred oars at once the main and proud of her large sails that could retain strong boreas and gather ev'ry blast with her wide yards but very slowly past

if onely driv'n with oars she put to sea

the latine ships more ready to obey the pilot's hand and charg'd with fighting men made way with more celerity
which when himilco through the calmed ocean spy'd advancing and commanded on his side to give the charge obliquely with their prows all the invoking to his vows as was his custom strait an arrow to th extended nerve he fits and gainst a fo directs it with his ey and when again his arms releas'd he shew'd the flying kain its passage through the air his steddy look pursuing brought it to a wound and strook nailing it to the helm the pilot's hand which now no more was able to command so maim'd the yielding stern where he was plac'd and while unto his aid the haste as if the ship were taken midst them all with the like fate and nerve a shaft doth fall again which taurus as he undertook the vacant helm quite through the body strook
but now at length a cuman ship broke in which corbulo commanded and had been with chearful youths at stabiae fill'd of late

the

guardian goddess neighb'ring venus sate

on the high poop
this charging very near the object of all shafts amidst them there sinking the yielding waters doth divide and their mouths foaming nereus as they cry'd for aid fills with his brine and as they strove in vain the sea them sucking in above the waves their hands appear
but here behold with an huge leap quite cross the billows bold

with rage leap'd corbulo upon the decks

for now the gallies which strong bands connex of ir'n a tow'r of oak brought up and there like a dire comet shaking in the air on the high top a flaming pine the fires with brimstone fed with which the winde conspires throws mong the libyan flags
the lemnian god soon enters and their hatches all abroad diffus'd strait fills the rowers full of fear forsake their benches yet although they were so hard beset the noise of that so great and fatal mischief did not penetrate to those below till running fiercely down by unctuous lamps and torches thither thrown victorious flames whizz through the hold
yet where from dardan fire and smoak as yet they were untouch'd and free the dire himilco held his gallie's fate and them with stones repell'd
and here poor cidnus while a flaming brand i'th air he brandish'd from lichaeus hand into the ocean by a mural stone from the decks slippery with blood was thrown
then with a filthy stink a lamp the air pollutes and hisseth on the waves and there a missile weapon sabrata lets fly from the adored poop the deity o'th libyan ship was hammon who survay'd with his horn'd brow the sea
now father aid and graunt thou garamantick god that we may gainst the romanes fling sure darts said he
then from the trembling throng as this he spoke a cornel came that through the visage broke of neptune neighbour telon nev'rtheless he in the gate of death doth forward press

on those who flying in a crowd retir'd

into a part o'th ship as yet not fir'd
but when th inevitable fire had past like lightning through whate're was next at last the whole ship to victorious flames was made a prey but first himilco by the aid of a where vulcan had not yet rais'd to extreamest height his stygian heat a little scorch'd slips down into the sea and by the oars of friends is born away
next wretched batho did thy fate deprive a ship of a good pilot who couldst strive with roughest seas and weather by thy skill the highest storms he could prevent what chill boreas next day or auster did intend nor cynosura couldst thou though thou bend thy course obscurely his eye deceive
when he perceiv'd their misery no measure had thou hammon who dost see this our unequal fate receive said he my blood
with that into his breast he drives his sword and in's the blood receives which largely twixt his sacred horns he pours
daphnis mong these unhappy fate devours an antient name who chose to leave the woods and chang'd his farms for the perfidious floods
but how much more under a shepheard's name did the first of that race excel in fame

to daphnis the

sicelides inclin'd

and a castalian pipe to him the kind apollo gave commanding when he lay'd himself along upon the grass and play'd to daphnis the joy'd flocks through medows and through fields should haste and rivers silent stand

when on his reeds he play'd the woods

he charm'd the syrens in their briny floods forgot to sing and scylla dogs no more would bark a quiet face charybdis bore and mong the rocks the cyclops overjoy'd would hear his lays
but here by war destroy'd fell the whole progeny and that great name so amiable for his sacred flame
on smoaking planks fierce ornytos away then swum and lingred out a death by sea
so ajax when her thunder pallas threw did rising waves with burning arms subdue
marmarick scyron wounded by a stem's sharp point quite through the belly part of's swim under water part above and so through all the ocean on the fatal prow is born away
the ships the fight pursue close on both sides and with a bloody dew from lab'ring oars the faces dash of those that fought
with such fierce strokes marcellus goes that his stout gally overcame the wind which as libaeus seizing fast behinde with eager hands endeavovur'd to have stop'd with a sharp ax his members off were lop'd and sticking to their hold were born away by the swift vessel
in this bloody fray aeölides podetus did engage in a sicanian ship although his age not yet arriv'd to man
he whether by sinister gods drawn thither or his high hot spirit and desire of war not yet full ripe for honour painted arms did fit to his white shoulders proud so with his tall chimaera to disturbe the sea
now all

rutulian ships now all the libyan he

better in oars and darts triumphantly outstrip'd and nessus had already drown'd in cruel waves nessus with turrets crown'd alass vain glory that did then so ill perswade a boy to fight which wanted skill
while for marcellus crest which then he wore on's dreadful caske and spoils he doth implore the gods as he too rashly did advance a deadly wound by a returned lance he took
oh how much prais'd whither he threw

the

discus shining near the stars or drew

his bow and to the clouds his arrows sent or run with winged feet and as he went scarce touch'd the ground or o're the measur'd plains by leaping past taught by continual pains enough of praise fond youth didst thou acquire in such safe conflicts why didst thou aspire to greater deeds when he was beaten down and sunk through num'rous darts against him thrown under the waves his shipwrack'd corps the while deprived of his syracosian pile cyclopean rocks bemoan with cyane anapus arethusa and the sea
but tiberinus in another place where then the libyan admiral did pass drives on his ship and streight they iö cry'd and cast their grapples in on either side the ships stand bound unto the combat nor with shafts and darts at distance thrown the war do they pursue but fight it near at hand and with the sword as in a fight at land
where the first slaughter open'd and did shew a passage the italian ships broke through

while the vast chains and iron bands his friends

maela advis'd to break and so intends such as had boarded him to bear away farther from their then equal arms to sea
yong polypheme in an aetnéan cave was bred and thence affected still to have the name of antient fierceness nurtur'd by a when a childe his stature high and terrible of bulk a cruel minde rage ever in his face his heart inclin'd to blood as all the cyclops he at length the chains got loose with all his bodie's strength had driven on the ship and in the sea drowning his oars had born her quite away had not laronius with a sudden blow of's lance as he his body rais'd to row nail'd him to's seat
scarce he in death forsook what he begun for as its wonted stroke his hand then languishing did still pursue upon the surface of the sea he drew the lazy oar struck with the adverse prow on one side to the other from the fo the libyans throng'd when with their sudden weight oppress'd waves leaping in on that side strait the vessel under water sinks and there targets and crests and useless darts that were pointed with steel with guardian gods upon the ocean float
all weapons lost here one fights with a broken plank and so agen by shipwrack arms himself for fight and then another whom blinde rage too rashly heats spoils of her oars the ship teras up the seats o'th seamen and with no distinction throws
neither from breaking sterns nor yet from prows

to deal intended wounds do they abstain

and snatch up weapons swimming on the main
the waves at gaping wounds break in which strait their fleeting souls with sighs regurgitate into the sea
some in a strict embrace are drown'd and where no weapons else have place kill in their death their foes
the rage of those that from the bottom rise more cruel grows and they resolve for swords the briny flood to use while coverd o're with blood the turning corps devour
loud clamours here are heard sad deaths and flight and groanings there with cracks of breaking oars and stems that beat the air with dreadful ecchoes as they meet
thus chaf'd and overspread with war the sea grew hot when in a little bark away himilco stealing weary of the fight towards the coast of libya takes his flight
at length both greeks and libyans quit the sea and now the captiv'd ships are born away in a long train together link'd to land while some amidst the deep still burning stand
the lemnian god shines o're the glitt'ring seas which brandish up and down his trembling rays

there known at sea burns

cyané and here

the winged siren burns europa there who in a white bull's shape by iove was born and cross'd the ocean holding by his horn
and nerëis who with hair dishevel'd rides a crooked fish and through the ocean guides the wat'ry reins there phyton wand'ring o're the waves and hammon burns with that which bore eliza image and on either side with twice three oars did o're the billows ride

but chain'd anapus to his native shore

is drag'd with nimble pegasus that bore his gorgon wings up to the stars and that tall ship where carved lybia's image sate and triton captivate and aetna high with rocks where buried deep in flames doth ly panting enceladus is drag'd away with their cadmaean sidon
nor had they to break into their trembling walls delay'd nor from the temples of the gods had stay'd their conqu'ring engins then if suddenly rais'd by the envy of the gods and by their toils at sea a dire contagion and devouring sickness had not set a stand to all their joys
for sol with flaming hair and influence of fiery stars the air and cyane that open lyes and swells with fenny waters round with noisom smells of dire cocytus fills and so pollutes autumn the flourishing with store of fruits and it inflames with lightning the thick air with clouds of darkness smoaks
earth ev'ry where parch'd with a vitiated face appears affords no food nor any shadows bears for fainting man and in the pitchy air black vapours move
dogs are the first that bear the fury of this plague next as they flie birds fall with flagging pinions from the skie then beasts within the forests dy at last it creeps into the camp and there doth wast th'infected troops their tongues dry'd up cold sweat creeps through their entrails or'e their limbs the meat appointed for their sustenance their dry and parched jaws refuse to swallow by

sharp coughs their lungs are torn and thirsty from

their panting throats a fiery breath doth come
their eys scare able to endure the light sink from their crooked noses while they spit corruption mix'd with blood a shrivel'd skin covers their bones the flesh consum'd within
oh greif in their known arms renowned by a lazy death the valiant souldiers dy their stately trophies gain'd in many a war are thrown into the fire no med'cines are of pow'r but all too weak for the disease
heap'd up the ashes of the dead encrease to a vast hill though bodies ev'ry where forsaken and unburied ly through fear to touch infected limbs
thus sadly fed the acherusian plague doth farther spread and shakes with no less grief trinacrian walls and on the libyan camp as fiercely falls
now equal in their ruin ev'ry place the common wrath of heav'n and the same face of death frequents and yet no force of all these ills could vanquish while their general was safe the romanes he alone secure doth balance all the woes which they endure

soon therefore as the burning

dog allay'd

his deadly heat and the contagion stay'd the greedy hand of death as when the seas the south ceasing their rude waves appease
the fisher drives his bark into the main
so his youth wasted by the plague again at length marcellus arms and ev'ry band purg'd with due sacrifice now chearful stand about their ensigns and o'rejoy'd appear that they then liv'd the trumpet's sound to hear

against the fo they march that they

if fates determine so in battel may dy by the sword it grieves them for their friends who like to beast by such inglorious ends their souls expired in their fatal beds
then to their tombs agen and worthless fun'ral piles they turn their eys and rather wish then see by maladies to be o'recome to have no graves at all
the first whose lofty ensigns to the wall advanc'd the gen'ral was
their faces in their helmets hide that leanness which had bin contracted by their lying still and so that paleness which might animate the fo is from their sight conceal'd
then on they fall and in thick bodies scale the batter'd wall
so many houses and strong tow'rs by war before unenter'd by the soldier

at one assault are now surpriz'd
the sun

wheree're his chariot through the world doth run could not behold a town that might compare

with syracusa then so many were

the temples of the gods within the wall so numerous their havens and withall their and their theatres on lofty columns rais'd and mighty bars contending with the sea
then add to these innumerable stately palaces that in long rows most spatious appear like countries with the groves which sacred were to sports the youth which limits large enclose with ample galleries then captiv'd prows and stems of ships adorn the temples mix'd with num'rous arms that to the gods were fix'd

which or the marathonian fo had lost

or else were brought from conquer'd libya coast
and there agathocléan trophies shin'd there hieron great riches there they finde antiquity by artists sacred made
not any place in any age tis said more glorious was in pictures there they take

all works of brass that

ephyrè could make

garments with yellow gold contending where the images in texture breath and there what babylon could boast engrav'd or tyre proud in embroider'd purple could admire what in attalick arras needles wrought and varied with art or could be bought from pharian looms with silver goblets rich with gems and images of gods the which the deity first giv'n by art retain beside the spoils o'th erythraean main was made their prey with fleeces which from trees the serian women card
this wealth and these rich houses when the romane general had taken standing high upon the wall the city trembling with their shouts he views and when he found it left to his refuse whether the fabricks there of kings should be left standing or the following day should see no walls at all he sadly groans and then

griev'd that so much was left to cruel men

he speedily recalls the souldiers ire commanding that the houses stand entire and that the antient gods their temples there inhabit still
the conquer'd thus to was better worth then spoil and vict'ry stood content and clap'd her wings unstain'd with blood

tears for thee likewise from the general

thou fam'd

defender of thy country fall

whom drawing lines and figures in the sand while in so great a ruin thou dost stand untouched and idaeas dost pursue by chance an ign'rant common souldier slew
but now again their minds the people give to mirth in which the conquer'd seem to strive

ev'n with the conquerours

he emulous

o'th nature of the gods preserving thus the city built it which still stands to be a glorious trophy to posterity and shall continue that the manners so of antient generals the world may know happy the people if as antiently in war our towns could now preserved be from spoils in peace for if his care by whom

we now enjoy our peace had not o'recome

though but

five lustra old
the vain delights

of youth to which fond pleasure him invites he flyes and virtue follows
then by sea to spain he hasts and in one happy day an omen to his future conquests makes new carthage which he sudden storms and takes
his chastity that to her princely spouse a captiv'd beauteous maid untouch'd allows
the macedonian king makes upon the graecian coasts
old fabius takes tarentum

young hasdrubal over pyrene flies perswades the gauls with him in arms to rise and italy invades where he again is by the romans overthrown and slain by nero who his head upon a spear in triumph to the romane camp doth bear

but a new care rome senate now perplext the nations trembling at their loss who next should rule and undertake the war of spain

by a proud fo both

scipioes were slain

two warlike valiant brothers hence a fear

lest the tartessiack people should adhere to tyrian laws and dread the war at hand
the state thus shaken sad the senate stand looking about for remedies and pray th immortal gods to give them one that may with courage in the shatter'd camp succeed as general
the noble youth indeed eager his father's and his uncle's shade to vindicate sad troops of friends disswade and adding by their sorrows to their fears sadly recount the number of his years should he into that fatal country go amidst the ashes of his friends that fo he there must fight who had the counsels foil'd and arms of two great generals and boil'd with pride of his success
nor was it for his tender arms to manage such a war or that command at such unskilful years to undertake
the youth these cares and fears alone retiring to the farthest part of all his house revolved in his heart under a laurel shade
when suddenly here virtue pleasure there her enemy descending through the air on either hand exceeding humane stature by him stand
the one breath'd persian odours from her head her upon her shoulders spread shining with yellow gold a tyrian vest she wore the beauty of her front exprest the bodkin's art and from her wanton ey the frequent flames with dubious motion fly a diff'rent habit did the other wear her forehead rough and never chang'd by hair

compos'd a steddy look her gesture nigh

to man's and such her face with modesty chearful upon her lofty shoulders shin'd a robe
then pleasure first inclin'd to promise much thus seizeth him
what rage what fury's this brave youth thy flow'r of age thus to consume in fighting art thou so unmindful of dire cannae and the po or thrasimen then styx more grievous far to what end do you thus the fates by war provoke th atlantick kingdoms you prepare to try and tyrian houses
but forbear let me advise to strive with dangers so or thy self rashly as before to throw into those storms of arms unless you shun those rites sad virtue here will bid you run into the midst of armies and through fire
tis she that prodigal thy noble sire thy uncle paulus and the decii down into the lakes of erebus hath thrown while titles to their ashes she proclaims and gilds their tombs with memorable names
yet are their souls insensible what she performs
but youth if thou wilt go with me in a smooth path thy days allow'd by fate shall pass
no trumpet's sound shall violate thy troubled sleeps nor northern frosts nor heat of burning cancer shalt thou feel
nor eat on tables oft compos'd of bloody grass
dire thirst dust swallow'd under casks shall pass by thee and labours undergone with fear
but bright thy days and all thy minutes clear shall run
thou may'st grow old with dainty fare
what mighty things by god provided are

for man's more chearful use what joys hath he

with a hand bestow'd and him to be th example of a quiet life we finde living at ease with an untroubled minde

i'me she that venus near to

simois stream

joyn'd to anchîses whence the authour came of your great race
ev'n am she for whom iove sometimes hath been willing to become a bird sometimes a bull and this advice observe
life swift from mortals runs nor twice can any man be born away time flys and hell's swift torrent swallowing all denies that you if any thing hath pleas'd you here it to the shades below from hence shall bear
and who is he that grieves not at the last too late alass that all my hours are past when she was silent and an end had made of speaking
in what darkness virtue said what cheats of life this youth in prime of age dost thou endeavour flatt'ring to engage unto whom reason by the will of heav'n and a great mind's celestial seeds are giv'n
as much as gods above do men exceed so they all other creatures
for indeed such nature to the earth as lesser gods hath giv'n and hath condemn'd to hell's abodes by fix'd decree degen'rate souls
but all that keep their heav'nly seed's original entire shall enter heav'n
what should tell of great alcides who did all debel or bacchus whose triumphal chariot through the cities fierce caucasean tigers drew after the seres and the indians he had conquer'd and brought home with victory

his ensigns from the east what should say

of those fam'd

twins to whom the pray

in danger or of your quirînus see how god to heav'n hath rais'd man's face which he erect hath made while birds and beasts with all of baser kinde upon their bellies fall
thrice happy and if they the gifts embrace o'th gods to honour born is humane race
do but consider this i'le not repeat too many things by valour now how great is rome become once much inferiour to

threatning fidenae and content to grow

in a poor sanctuary
then behold what wealthy cities luxury of old hath overthrown for not so much the ire of all the gods nor swords nor foes conspire to ruin as when pleasure seizeth on the minde alone
thy sure companion is drunkenness with riot and on thee still with black wings waits infamy
with me is honour praise and with a chearful ey glory with fair renown and victory unstain'd as are her wings
his head with lawrel compass'd me doth triumph lead up to the very stars
my house is chast and on a lofty hill my dwelling's plac't
the way that up the stony cliff doth go at first is rough i'm not accustom'd to deceive and they must labour that intend to enter there
nor doth that wealth ascend with them which faithless chance hath giv'n and can force back again
strait the whole race of man standing above beneath thee thou shalt see and all things contrary to that which she

doth flatt'ring promise must be undergone

you sleepless nights under the stars upon the hard ground lying must endure
you must hunger and cold subdue so strictly just that whatsoever things you take in hand think that the gods as witnesses shall stand of all your deeds
then when your country's or the dangers of the state require for war be you first ready hostile ramparts scale the first let neither gold nor swords prevail upon your minde
robes stain'd with tyrian dye and sweet perfumes in men unhansome fly i'le bring to pass that he who now the land infests with cruel war shall by thy hand be vanquish'd and the libyans quite destroy'd

thy lawrel in

iove bosom shall be lay'd

this sung by virtue from her sacred breast the youth whose looks approv'd what she exprest with these examples joy'd she turns but yet pleasure holds not her tongue but in a heat exclaims
weigh you not at all twill come my time i'me sure will come when easy rome with all her might my empire will obey and unto me alone will honour pay
thus having said shaking her wanton head into dark clouds from them away she fled
but the youth full of precepts and inflam'd with love of virtue so appearing aim'd at mighty things within his heart and then ascends the rostra and while other men so hot a service shun'd desires to bear the heavy charge of that ambiguous war
the minds of all intent upon him were some thinke his father's eys some thinke they there

behold again his uncle's furious look

but yet though with deep silence terrour strook their hearts sad with great dangers with their fears that war's great weight they ponder then his years their anxious favour numbers
but while they these things with their confused murmurs weigh from a cross quarter of the heav'n behold a serpent shining bright with spots of gold seems mong the clouds to pass and through the air rays from the flaming tract diffusing where the clime to atlas tends the pole resounding with the noise descends

iove to the augury adding twice or thrice

a shining bolt the scatter'd thunder flies through all the shaken world
then they command that instantly he take his arms in hand and humbly prostrate on their knees full low salute the omen and now bid him go whither as it appear'd the gods did lead and the path shew'd him by his father tread
and now with emulation such as are joyn'd in affairs and ministers of war together flock and earnest are to share the hardest labours the same arms to bear with him is honour held
then strait to sea goes a new fleet on him ausonia attends and is transported into spain
as when dire wars on the coerulean plain fierce corus makes with hollow floods he heaves

the lofty

isthmos up and with rude waves

forcing at length through groaning rocks his way mingleth th with aegêan sea
stately in arms shines scipio and within the foremost ship to neptune doth begin

thou god of seas through whose deep empire we

are ready now to pass if just it be which intend grant that this navy may go forward father and vouchsafe we pray our labours to assist an holy war it is which now through the ocean bear
this said strait gentle and propitious gales breath out and forward drive the swelling sails
and now the fleet where tyrrhene billows roar had nimbly pass'd from the ausonian shore and by the coast of the ligurians ply'd with speedy prows
when far at sea they spy'd earth the high alpes the stars invading then

massilia walls built by the graecian

with nations proud begirt and whom with rites that cruel are her barb'rous neighbour frights
but hospitable she among those bold and warlike nations still retains the old rites manners habit of phocensian greeks
hence scipio by the ocean winding greeks coast's on at length a lofty hill appears where on her woody top pyrene bears thick forests in the clouds and then he sees

th emporiae that by ancient pedigrees

a grecian people are then tarracho

where the

nysaean fruits in plenty grow

then in a port his fleet secure he lays and quits the toils and terrour of the seas
now welcome night did sleep like death bestow on men when standing before scipio his father's ghost appear'd and thus begun
dear son thy father's safety once dear son thy father's glory after death by thee the land that to these wars gave birth shall be subdu'd if they desire to fight with thee

and all the troops for battel muster'd are

who is it that the triple force can bare of furious men all dubious acts by you must be forborn but better things pursue with diligence
there is a city wall'd and built of old by teucer carthage call'd by tyrians now possess'd and as there is of libya one so of iberia this is the metropolis in wealth excell'd by none or port or situation held as rich as any in her fertile fields and with as active vigour weapons yields

this while the generals are turn'd away

invade no fight so much of fame or prey can give
these counsels by his father were declar'd and still he seem'd advise more near when strait the vanish'd shade and sleep forsook the youth who rising humbly doth invoke his father's manes and the pow'rs that be in stygian groves by name
be you said he our captains in this war and lead us to the city you have mention'd
for you will seek revenge and when iberia have subdu'd due sacrifice i'le pay to you in sarrane purple richly clad and sacred games unto your tombs will add
then hasting on with a swift march his bands he leads away and the lands
so from piséan stables once got loose a metled courser as a conqu'rour goes before his fellows and as if by winde begot runs through the air and leaves behinde the rest so far that not the quickest sight is able to o'retake him in his flight

now th seventh day by bright hyperion flame

arose when sensibly they nearer came to the town's tow'rs whose tops encreas'd as they

approach'd and

laelius at his time by sea

arriving as before the general appointed had his navy to the wall draws up and with his num'rous ships behinde the town invests
carthage by nature's kinde assistance hath high walls which by the sea encompass'd are and tow'rds the rising day a little isle its narrow mouth doth close
but where it looks to phoebus fall it throws up standing pools into a muddy plain which coming tides encrease and ebbs aga
abate
but where it fronts the northern bear standing upon a lofty hill it there steep to the neighb'ring ocean descends and with eternal floods her wall defends
but the bold soldiers as if marching in a plain they conqu'ring ensigns brought begin to climb the hill
arris commanded there in chief and had against them through a fear of some distress himself with aids supply'd and all the hill and castle fortifi'd
a fo the nature of the place doth prove and with small force of those that fought above th assailants tott'ring through the places high and steep are tumbled down and maimed dy
but when the turning tide retir'd again and with a rapid fall into the main the billows fled where tall ships lately plough'd the waves safe passage nereus there allow'd a foot
and this way noble scipio consulting with his thoughts resolv'd to go

draws through the sea his men and suddenly

up to the walls doth through the waters fly
and when with speed behinde they hasten on where arris trusting to the sea the town had left without a guard strait sad to tell his neck in chains the libyan prostrate fell and bade the people all disarm'd to yield
this city titan when he rose beheld circled with camps and captiv'd saw the same

before in western seas he hid his flame

th ensuing morn from earth had chas'd away night's shades when first they altars raise then slay unto the god of seas for sacrifice a bull and so to iove
then equallize rewards to all deserts and gain'd with blood valour her crown receives
here shining stood one with rich trappings on his breast and there another on his warlike neck did wear a golden snake this with a mural crown was honour'd
but then laelius in renown both of his family and valour all excelling is created admiral
besides a gift of thirty oxen and the libyan arms that did in chief command
then spears to some and martial ensigns are to others giv'n as they deserv'd and share of spoils
and when the praise of gods and men was perfected their captive riches then survay'd and prey lay'd up this gold was for the senate and those talents for the war
this kingdom they for donatives design that for the temples of the pow'rs divine is chiefly kept whatever else remains rewards the souldiers valour and their pains

then the iberian king whose

sponsal flame

was fix'd deep in his bones as summon'd came to whom much joy'd his spouse a virgin fair and pure he chearful gave
then free from care their tables spread upon the neighb'ring shore and feasting high with solemn sports before the rest thus laelius
brave general go on ador'd for thy chast minde through all the world to thee the glory and the praise and celebrated in immortal lays the valour of great heroes shall give way

that

captain who a thousand ships by sea

from the mycenae drew and argive arms joyn'd with thessalian through a woman's charms

infring'd his

social league and they beheld

all tents within the phrygian army fill'd with captive beds
a barb'rous maid by thee alone more spotless in virginity is kept then troy cassandra
thus the day in talk they spent till night in dark aray rais'd her black steeds inviting all to rest
in the mean time aemathian broils infest th aetolian land invaded suddenly

by

macedonian ships an enemy

with whom the acarnanian quickly
for then king philip in a league combin'd with libya against the romane name those new commotions had rais'd
the fame of his descent his antient crowns and throne

from the aeäcides and

thetis son

his puff'd him up
now he with fear of's arms by night fill'd oricon and where on the illyrick coast taulentians dwell in small and nameless walls upon them fell

with furious war
thence passing on by sea

tesprotian borders and phoenicia alarm'd with vain attempts he epire view'd then on the coast of anactorium shew'd his ensigns then th ambracian bay and shores of pella scour'd with rapid war his oars beating leucate's chafing waves he streight at actium saw apollo sacred seat
nor left he ithaca laërtes throne untri'd nor sames nor those rocks whereon floods the cephalenians see
and neriton with rocky fields then he to pelops countrey went glad to behold achaian walls and caly of old affected by diana
after these to the caretes and oenis with promise to the greeks gainst italie to use his arms he went then ephyre patrae and princely pleuron he survay'd parnassus and by phoebus made to speak prophetick rocks and though agen often by war call'd homeward sometimes when

sarmatian orestes did infest

his kingdoms or fierce dolopes opprest his countrey yet unwilling to forbear his vain designs the shadow of a war he carried up and down the grecian coast till all his hopes plac'd in the libyans lost by sea and land a suppliant he sign'd

a league with the

dardanians nor declin'd

from them in his own kingdom to receive

the law but then tarentum fortune gave

to italy encrease both of renown· and riches
for at length that treach'rous town

was by old fabius conquer'd and of all

his titles of a wary general the last became
for then his industry gain'd that safe honour that the city he had taken without blood
and when twas known that a sidonian captain in the town burn'd with a woman's love and that through ease a silent treason thence might valour please to his lov'd sister strait her brother who then bore rutulian arms is forc'd to go instructed to subdue the woman's minde with ample promises if she inclin'd the libyan to betray the gates
and thus the libyan overcome old fabius his wish enjoy'd and through th unguarded walls by night into the town the army falls
but who that heard marcellus then was slain in fight would think that sol should joyn again his flaming steeds so turn'd away from rome that noble person that brave breast in whom the god of war inhabited who nev'r in its most horrid shape did danger fear in combat fell in his renowned fall alass how great a blow to hannibal in him thy terrour carthage prostrate lay who had perhaps from scipio born away had but the gods been pleas'd awhile to spare his life the name of finishing the war
which seated then within the daunian land between both camps a little hill did stand
crispinus with marcellus bore like share in cares and honours and the common war pursu'd to whom marcellus thus began
have a minde to view those woods and on

the hill to lodg our men lest first it be

possess'd in ambush by the enemy
would crispinus if you please that you would share in this design for seldom two in counsel fail
when this they had decreed each man contends to mount his eager steed
marcellus when he saw his son among the rest put on his arms and in the throng joyful and brisk thou dost appear more great said he then me by thy admired heat
may this thy early labour happy be such as at syracusa once thee beheld before thine age would thee allow as fit for war engaging with a brow like mine
oh hither come my glory stand close to thy father's side and by my hand learn a new way of fighting
then he lay'd his arms about his neck and briefly pray'd
grant from the libyan gen'ral oh thou king of gods that on these shoulders may bring opimous spoils to thee as here he ends from the clear sky a bloody dew descends and iove the fatal drops had sprinkled on his then succesless arms
scarce had he done his speech when through the straits advancing up the fatal mountain strait a nimble troop of nomades upon them fly and pour their darts as thick as an etherial show'r while from their secret ambush they supply'd the fight with armed troops
on ev'ry side when valour found her self thus close beset and nothing now remaining as a debt unto the gods he onely sought to go with a great name unto the shades below

then at a distance his contorted spear

with all his force he throws now fights more near at hand with's sword and had escap'd perchance that cruel storm of danger if a lance had not transfix'd the body of his son
but then alass the father's hands begun to shake and weak through sorrow loosely bare his hapless arms untill an obvious spear pierc'd through his naked breast by which sad wound he falls his face imprinting on the ground
when hannibal perceiv'd amidst the fight the fatal lance within his bosom light aloud he crys now carthage cease to fear the romane laws the name of terrour here

lyes prostrate and the

column of their state

but that brave hand so like mine own of late shall not obscurely to the shades be sent
true valour's void of envy
strait they went about to build his pyle which to the skies by mighty oaks brought from the woods doth rise
you might believe the libyan general had dy'd then incense cates his shield withall and fasces his last pomp are brought and while with his own hand the taper to the pyle the prince applies eternal praise said he we have acquir'd
for of marcellus we have italy depriv'd
perhaps they may at length now lay down arms
go then and pay to that great soul and to his dust all dues of funeral
never will refuse thee this rome that thou the sepulcher of one whose valour made him great in war with titles may'st adorn and lasting fame among rutulian nephews crown his name

such is your other consul fate whose steed

him breathless to your camp convey'd with speed
such then affairs did in ausonia stand
but not the same in the iberian land was the event of arms
the quick surprize and conquest of terrifies the nations round about
the gen'rals there unless they joyn with social aids despair of safety since young scipio had fought as if he thunder in his arms had brought from italy with so great auspicies that he a fenced town whose height their eys could hardly reach as on an hill it stood had taken in one day and fill'd with blood
while ev'n their warlike hannibal before he overthrew sagunthus that for store of people and for wealth might not appear as equal unto that had spent a year
to his great brother's deeds aspiring still

the next was

hasdrubal who on a hill

encamp'd encompass'd with a rocky wood
here his chief strength fierce cantabrians stood mix'd with rebellious africans and there then the swift moor more swift asturians were
and with as much of majesty did he iberia rule as then in italy his brother hannibal with terrour liv'd
it chanc'd a tyrian solemn day reviv'd their antient honour and the time wherein the walls of carthage they did first begin and a new city of small houses rais'd
his nations rise the general much pleas'd thus to commemorate his ensigns all adorn'd with laurel kept the festival

and th gods appeas'd
loose from his shoulders hung

his brother's gift a mantle which among some other presents as a complement of their strict league trinacria prince had sent a stately robe among aeölian kings
an eagle through the clouds with golden wings snatch'd up in texture hov'ring to the sky a boy
a spacious cave there was hard by which in the purple there the needle made the cyclops house here polypheme was lay'd along and swallow'd bodies dropping gore between his deadly jaws
about him store of broken bones which chewing forth he threw
then for his drink his hand extended to

läertes

son he calls and belching up

crude blood with wine commix'd it in the cup
conspicuous in this robe at altars made of grass the peace o'th gods the tyrian pray'd
when riding in amidst them all behold a scout that hostile arms approach'd them told
the worship of the gods unfinished with troubled minds they from the altars fled
all sacred rites broke off all night they lay encamp'd
but when the dewy morn the day first rais'd a furious fight began and there stout sabbura first felt the thrilling spear of scipio
both armies seem'd to be mov'd with the omen
the first victim we i'th field ye sacred shades to you have slain exclaims the romane gen'ral now again into the fight and slaughter souldiers go as with best captains you were wont to do
this said they all fall on by lena hand falls myconus latinus cirta and

stout maro thysdrus kills and catiline incestuous nëalces doth disjoyn from his own sister's bed
then cartulo a libyack prince is sent to shades below by fierce nasidius
thee likewise thee laelius thou great renown of italy things scarce to be believ'd performing there amidst the carthaginians full of fear pyrene land beheld
nature bestow'd on him all happy things which were allow'd by all the gods
when he was heard to plead at th bar not nestor could in speech exceed or when the fathers and the court did stand in doubt and his opinion did demand he led the senat hearts as with a charm
but when the noise of trumpets did alarm his ears within the field with such an heat he rush'd into the fight and armies that you'd think he had been born for war alone and nothing without praise by him was done
from a stoln life the gala fighting threw

whom mother once by changing him withdrew

from byrsa cruel rites
but quickly all such joys as rise from gods so cheated fall
then murus alebis and draces who with an effeminate cry for life did sue by him were slain
poor draces as he pray'd and beg'd his head cut off the murmurs stay'd in his dissever'd throat
but hasdrubal had not the like desire to fight
not all the extream loss and slaughter of his men him mov'd
but to the woody hills agen and lurking holes of pathless rocks he flies and to the alpes and italy his eys

are turn'd the great advantage of his flight

the signal silently is giv'n and fight quite lay'd aside they are commanded through the woods and hills to fly dispers'd and who· soe're escap'd should to pyrene top ascend their chief and sole remaining hope
all marks of honour as a general then lai'd aside disguised with a small iberian targe first hasdrubal ascends the hills and flying quits his wandring friends
to the forsaken camp the romanes strait their ensigns send
no city captivate could yield more spoils and did their rage withdraw from slaughter as the libyan foresaw
so in some brook surpriz'd when he despairs

of safety from his groin the

beaver tares

the parts that caus'd his danger and away swims from his fo intent upon his prey when thus the libyan had with speedy flight trusting to rocky woods in shades like night himself conceal'd strait back again they go unto a greater war to meet a fo more sure to be subdu'd
but first upon pyrene hill with this inscription

a shield they fix

scipio a conquerour

hasdrubal's spoils unto the god of war
in the mean time beyond the hills all fear now lay'd aside bebrycian people were by hasdrubal soon arm'd who prodigal to purchase hands for aid and ready all prepar'd to thrust into the war with store of gold and silver thither sent before and with long labours gain'd in wealthy lands had rais'd their warlike minds
hence active bands

fill'd the new camp
all mercenary souls

those that where

rhodanus swift billows rowls

delight to dwell with those where arar flows most softly through the fields
and now the snows of winter all resolv'd the year retains a milder face
then through the celtick plains entring a speedy march he goes admires the conquer'd alps and pervious heights enquires the very where alcides trod compares with th adventures of the god his brother's ways
when to the top of all he came and in the camp of hannibal sate down what higher walls said he do rome invest which after these once overcome by my great brother stand yet safe oh may the glory of so brave a hand pray prove happy nor let it the envy be of any angry deity that we the stars approach'd then where a safe descent the hill declining shew'd strait down he went with hasty arms
through all so great a dread not the beginnings of the war had spread
two hannibals they now report and two strong camps on either side and glutted through success with romane blood the chiefs the war joyntly pursue
the armies doubled are and to the walls the fo would quickly haste and sticking on the gates they jav'lins cast from elysaean hands should shortly see
much vex'd at this the land of italy thus with her self
alass ye gods must with so great fury of the libyans ly despis'd who saturn when the pow'rful hand of iove he fear'd conceal'd and in my land

an empire gave now the tenth summer's corn

appears since thus have been sadly torn
and now a youth who wanteth nothing more but to invade the gods the farthest shore o'th world hath left and arms against me bends and the high alps prophan'd with rage descends into my land
how many corps have of slain entomb'd alass how often by my flaughter'd sons deform'd have no trees with pregnant buds his corn the peasant sees yet green cut down with swords the tow'rs of all my villages into my bosom fall and by their ruins is my land defac't
yet now must endure this youth at last by whom my wasted coasts invaded are who seeks the ruthful reliques of the war to burn
then wandring africans may rend my bowels with their ploughs and moors commend the crops which the ausonian furrows yield
unless their troops insulting through the field in one grave interr
as thus she then her woes revolv'd and night both gods and men compos'd to rest to nero camp she went
he with a neighb'ring trench was then intent the libyan from lucanian coasts to keep
the youth here latium image in his sleep accosts
nero thou who art become marcellus lost the greatest hope of rome

the

clausi glory shake off sleep by thee

something of moment must attempted be if thou wilt add unto thy country's fates which ev'n the conquerours when from the gates the foe's repuls'd shall wonder to be done

with shining arms behold

amilcar son

like a dire deluge overruns the plains

where sena still her gallick name retains unless thy winged troops thou thither strait draw out to fight thine aid will come too late to ruin'd rome hereafter
rise be gone have condemn'd metaurus region and all those spacious fields to libyan bones and graves
this said she vanishing at once appears to draw him after her and through the broken gates to drive his troops into the field
with that he wakes and troubled stands with an enflamed heart and then with hands lifted to heav'n he prays the earth and night the scatter'd stars and moon with silent light to be his guides
then choosing proper hands

for such a work through

larinatian lands

coasting upon the vpper and where

hardy in war

marrucine people were

and the strict

frentane that his faith maintains

in social arms where the praetutian swains pleas'd with their labour dress their vines he flyes swift as a bird as lightning from the skies as torrents with hybernal billows flow

or arrows from an

achemenian bow

each man himself exhorts
go on and haste for in thy feet the doubtful gods have plac'd rome safety whether she shall stand or fall
thus crying on they go the general best exhortation being foremost gives while ev'ry one his speed encreasing strives by following to equal him and day and night nimbly march away
but the report of those encreasing ills o'th adverse war all rome with terrour fills

that nero hop'd too much they now complain

that by one wound that life that did remain might soon be lost
nor money arms nor men nor blood to lose there now remain'd
and then who had not strength to deal with hannibal alone in fight should fall on hasdrubal
that now again soon as the libyan saw his arms diverted from the camp he'd draw his forces to their gates
that he was come who in the glory of destroying rome would strive with his proud brother
with one mind thus frets the senate yet in counsel joyn'd to keep their honour and themselves to free from threatned chains and angry gods to flee
amidst these sighs nero protected by an obscure night unto the camp drew nigh where near to hasdrubal within the field

old livy lay
he warlike once and skill'd

in feats of arms flourish'd in former times famous in war but falsly charg'd with crimes by the unequal tribes in discontent his days obscurely in the countrey spent
but when a sadder weight and fears began through nearer dangers to require the man after so many valiant captains slain then to his countrey call'd to arms again his aged valour he had vow'd
but all these plots of new supplies to hasdrubal were known and what the wings of night conceal'd the signs of dust upon their shields reveal'd
besides their hasty running to and fro their horse and men prepar'd and trumpets show as they the signal sound the camp to be commanded by two gen'rals
but said he

if yet my brother live how can they now

their social forces joyn yet till know the truth it onely now remains that the time protract and chance of fighting fly
nor with base fear this poor resolve of flight did he delay
but when from cares the night mother of rest had freed the breasts of men and darkness dreadful silence nourish'd then forth from his camp he breaks and his mute bands to follow with a silent march commands who through the quiet plain protected by the gloomy night all noise avoiding fly
but shaken by a motion so great th italian land perceiving their deceit involves them in dark errours in the place and night conspiring in a narrow space still leads them round
for where with winding waves his crooked banks the flood obliquely laves and through rough creeks returning falls again into it self there toiling all in vain with fruitless wandrings a small circuit they had made and in the errours of their way the benefit of night now lost the light comes on and to their foes detects their flight
with that a furious storm of horse the gates thrown open and a show'r of steel dilates it self or'e all the field
arms yet they none nor hands had mix'd but shafts at distance thrown drink blood
to stop the flying libyans here dictaean arrows fly and lances there like a black tempest and on whom they light they death inflict
and now all thoughts of flight quite lai'd aside about they frighted face and close their hopes in fighting place

amidst them all the gen'ral mounted high

for now he saw their sad extremity on a tall steed his hands and voice extends by all those trophies gain'd by you my friends under the farthest pole my brother's praise make it appear you beseech he says the brother of great hannibal is come for fortune labours now to give to rome sad documents and shew how strong an hand you that have conquer'd the iberian land and at alcides pillars us'd to war on the rutulians turn
perhaps not far from hence my brother to this battel may arrive
oh hasten worthy him pray a spectacle with bodies fill the plain
each general is by my brother slain that might be fear'd in war and now their sole remaining hope drawn from his skulking hole
decrepit livy a condemned head is offer'd to you
oh go on strike dead that general cut off his feeble age gainst whom twere shame my brother should engage
but nero contrary exhorts why are you slow the labours of this mighty war

to end

your feet already praise have gain'd

now crown these high beginnings with the hand the camp you rashly all the bars o'rethrown have left except you perfect what is done by victory
your glory hasten show that your arrival overthrew the fo
but livy in another quarter where his helmet taken off his hoary hair was seen to all cries come my lads and me observe in fight and wheresoe're you see

my sword shall make your way there enter so

the alps too open to the wastful fo shut with your swords at length
unless we quite destroy this army by a sudden flight that of carthage hannibal will soon be here
then who is he of all the gods that us from stygian shades can free then he resumes his cask and instantly his sword confirms his words and age from sight again conceal'd he enters first the fight
him through the thickest bodies of the field breaking through closest ranks who furious kill'd as many as he shafts discharg'd with dread the macae and fierce autololians fled with bands of rhodanus their hair unshorn
mong the prophetick sands of hammon born secure of fate there nabis fiercely fought and mighty trophies as if then he thought the gods protected him to fix at home had vainly promis'd
from the tyrian loom flaming with garamantick gems a vest he wears so shine the stars in heav'n his crest with gems with radiant gold his shield enchac't on's horned cask the hanging fillets cast a sacred dread and honour of the gods a bowe and quiver which with shafts he loads in cerasts steep'd hang at his back and so with poison arm'd to battle doth he go then leaning backward on his horse as he his country's custom us'd upon his knee resting the weight of his sarmatick spear it prone upon his foes he thrusts and there with that vast weapon through his arms and through his body wounded in the consul view

sabellus with loud shouts he bears along

in triumph praising hammon in his song
but the old consul who so great a pride and rage in barb'rous breasts could not abide a weapon lanc'd and both his life and prey a conqu'rour from the conqu'rour took away
hearing the cries of his sad fall amain the libyan prince came on and from the plain as arabus was then about to take his spoils made stiff with gold and gems at back a weapon aim'd and through the chine him strook just as in both his hands in haste he took his prize and left his trembling body bare
he fell and all the sacred garments there and golden threads restor'd unhappy to the dead and dy'd upon his spoiled fo
but canthus owner of much libyan sand where their unconquer'd name unto the land

the fam'd

philêni gave wealthy in sheep

kill'd rutulus where lofty folds did keep a thousand bleating lambs spending his days in easy care
sometimes the sun's hot rays he from his flocks would break in some cool flood sometimes retiring to a shady wood shining as white as snow their fleeces shear'd
or when at night they home again repair'd from pasture was much pleas'd to see the lambs within the flood distinguishing their dams
deceiv'd he fell through his brass target strook and griev'd too late that he his folds forsook
at this the romanes forward press'd and came more furious on
like torrents storm or flame of thunder· swift as waves from boreas fly or hollow clouds run on when to the sky

eurus throws up the ocean briny flood

tall cohorts with their celtick ensigns stood i'th van which with their files their fierce impulse and sudden force they soon disperse and try'd with wandring and the scorching sun and tedious labours they had undergon a native terrour makes them all to fly
the romanes at their backs their weapons ply and with their following shafts so instant are that they no flight allow
strait tyrus there fell with one wound
by more fell rhodanus with arrows pierc'd
a lance thrust morius down to the earth
whom livy that full speed came on as he was falling strook and steed into the troops as they were flying spur'd
there mosa swelling neck he with his sword cut off his head within his helmet bound falling so high shook with its weight the ground while the trunk his steed convey'd frighted into the fight
here cato said for he among the thickest fought if he had first the tyrian youth oppos'd when we in battel lost the alps alass how great an hand from italy had found retreat how many funerals to libyans slain might the sad suffrage of that fatal plain have giv'n but now the armies gan to yield
an universal terrour through the field the celtae fear had spread
the tyrian side declines and victory her selfe apply'd to the rutulian arms
the consul high as in his prime of years triumphantly went on and still more great appear'd to all
but now behold the libyan general

comes on and with him brings a troop all white

with dust and lancing darts exclaims your flight forbear who is this fo from whom you fly do you not blush our troops are routed by an old man's feeble arms
am pray now grown degenerate in war or say are ye grown weary of me me who am of belus race ally'd to dido name
amilcar was my sire in war to all to be preferr'd my brother hannibal to whom the hills lakes plains and rivers yield
am the next to him at carthage held
me baetis in her coasts and nations where my arms have been do ev'n with him compare
as this he spake he rush'd into the fight and soon as with his shining arms in sight the consul came too hastily at him a jav'lin threw which passing through the brim of's brasen shield and at the top of all his entring lightly in its fall his shoulder wounded drawing little blood although the libyan thought it would make good his vain conceits
the romanes were dismai'd at this
when thus the consul to upbraid his weak attempt you might believe that in some womens broils or boys he scratch'd had been cries go my lads and let them understand how great the wounds are that a romane hand inflicts
then suddenly a mighty show'r of darts whose shadow hides the sun they pour upon the fo and all the spacious plain alternate slaughter strews with bodies slain whose heaps encreasing in the river joyn'd the banks
so when diana hath a minde

to hunt in shady groves and sport to shew

to her pleas'd mother and the woody brow of lofty pindus shakes or takes a view of maenalus with arrows charg'd a crew of nymphs about her flock and strait surround the pathless cop'ces
there the quivers sound and loosely hanging all the shafts drawn out leap at their backs while still they beat about the fields
then on the rocks in coverts in the vallies rivers and the dens still green with moss the slaughter'd beasts in plenty ly
then on some mountain with a joyful eye the prey collected pleas'd latona views
but furious nero when he heard the news of livy wound breaks through the thickest and perceiving that the fight did equal stand
what now unto the fates of italy is left said he if you this enemy do not or'ecome how will you hannibal subdue with that as mad amidst them all he rush'd and when he hasdrubal beheld among the foremost troops with fury swell'd
like a that hath long been tost in the vast deep quite void of all repast when mong the waves a fish far off she spies she boils within and then with eager eys pursuing in the flood her swimming prey swallows with fishes mix'd the briny sea
now no delay of darts or words
thou me no more shalt scape pyrene woods said he

shall not deceive me here nor yet with vain

and faithless promises shalt thou again delude as captiv'd in th iberian land with a false league thou once didst fly my hand

thus nero and withall he threw a dart

and not in vain
for in the lower part of's side it stuck
with that on him he leaps with's sword and as with's he keeps his trembling body down if now said he at the last gasp thou dost desire it we unto thy brother thy commands will bear
to whom the libyan replies fear not death make use of this thy victory till to my shade a swift revenger he arrive
but if unto my brother thou wilt bear my last desires then say that now bid him burn the capitol and there mix with the ashes of the thunderer my bones and dust
as more he did desire to add his heart still with ire the conqu'rour pierc'd him with his sword and then cut off his faithless head
with that his men their gen'ral slain are routed and the fight no more pursue and now at length the night the sun and day obscures when they repair with mod'rate food and sleep their strength and bare the way they came their conqu'ring ensigns er'e the day return'd back to the camp for fear shut up
then nero as he did advance the libyan head aloft upon his lance said cannae trebia thrasimenus we with this thy brother's head have now to thee repay'd hannibal
thy treach'rous war ingeminate and hither call from far thy doubled troops
such their reward shall be who the alps cross'd desire to joyn with but hannibal who did his tears suppress by constant bearing made his sorrows less

and vows in time fit sacrifice to pay

unto his brother's shade
then far away his camp removes and so dissembling right his griefs by quiet shuns a dubious fight

but now that vigour which had quite destroy'd ausonia had he other helps employ'd through a base envy lab'ring to retract their mindes at carthage was constrain'd to act without their aid and through the length of time in his affairs to wax more dull

see these are they who once requir'd or'e us so great a pow'r to whom thy sacred race must yield quirinus and the gown give place but to submit to bondage if you are so easy why did you begin the war as this he spake an horsman tidings brought

that

hasdrubal not knowing they had fought

came on with speed to joyn his arms and fate
scipio snatch'd up his ready ensigns strait and when or'ejoy'd he saw the fight so much desir'd approach and troops to death with such

a furious speed advancing to the sky

lifting his eyes no more ye gods do of you this day require since now see this fugitive is drawn to fight said he our other wishes by our valour may be gain'd
then haste companions go pray behold my father here my uncle there with rage upon you call
oh you that are my deities in war our leaders be
i'le follow you assist and you shall see if my presaging minde deceive me not a slaughter worthy of your name
for what shall else give period to our fighting here in the iberian land when shall appear that glorious day when at the fierce alarms of the approaching war and these mine arms carthage thee shall trembling see this said hoarse trumpets with shrill murmurs strait invade the stars with eccho
with fierce clamours then they meet with such a violence as when notus and boreas or fell auster raves by sea and drown whole fleets in swelling waves
or when his deadly flames the dog expires and burns the fainting world with wasting fires
such slaughters their fierce fury by the sword commits the gaping earth could not afford a space the ruins of the fight to hide
no rage of salvage beasts had er'e destroy'd so many in their fatal dens
and now with blood the fields and vallies overflow their weapons all are dull'd the libyans are cut off and the iberi that in war delight
and yet though shatter'd much a band there was that struggled still and kept their

where hasdrubal did with his spear contend

nor had their constant valour made an end that day but that an arrow chanc'd to fall upon his top
the wound though small perswaded him to fly
then strait he quits the fight and on his nimble courser gets to shelter and along the shore by night to the tartessîack ports directs his flight
the next to him in arms and valour there to th fight he the massylian scepter bare for's league and friendship to the romane name

soon after famous

masanissa came

upon his radiant head as tyr'd with flight by night he slept a sudden shining light appear'd to compass with a gentle flame his curled hair and to diffuse the same upon his rugged brow
his servants strait run in and haste the fire that did dilate it self about his breast with water to suppress
but his old mother who foreknew the omens of the gods your wonders cries thus thus still hide propitious deities long may that light abide upon his head neither do thou my masanissa dread those happy wonders of the gods nor fear when bout thy temples sacred flames appear this fire a league with the dardanian race and empire greater then thy father's was doth promise and at length shall give to thee and with the latine fates thy name shall be involv'd
thus spake the prophetess
the minde o'th youth to these clear prodigies inclin'd ner'e thought on honours from the libyan side for great valour
and besides the pride

of hannibal in arms now less became

and ev'ry day the war decreas'd in fame
from the dark heav'ns the morn began to chace the clouds and scarce had the face of the atlantick sisters when he goes to the ausonian camp as yet his foes
where when he enter'd and kinde entertain receiv'd from scipio thus the king began
th advice of heav'n my mother's prophecies and thy great valour to the deities so dear brave romane me have hither brought most willingly from those for whom fought
if gainst thy thunder i've appear'd to stand with courage here offer thee an hand worthy thy name thou son of iove nor me do wav'ring thoughts or vain inconstancy of minde to this invite
treachery and perjur'd from their birth a people fly
and when thou at alcides bars hast made an end the mother of the war invade with me
for him who italy ten years hath now possess'd and bears against the walls of rome you back must bring with fire and sword to libya
thus the king
to whom their joyn'd if glorious we the general replies in arms to thee appear more glorious much we romanes are for keeping faith
then masanissa far thy associates from thy minde remove
thy famous valour hence shall finde a great reward and sooner me subdu'd by arms then overcome in gratitude thou shalt confess
but that which you perswade that we should libya with fire invade

time shall effect
my thoughts are oft inclin'd

to that and carthage fatigates my minde
then to the youth a rich embroider'd cloak and horse which he from conquer'd mago took and had himself his mettle try'd withall a cask and golden cup which hasdrubal us'd to the altars of the gods to bring with sacrifice he gives
then with the king a social league confirm'd he strait employ'd his thoughts that byrsa tow'rs might be destroy'd
the richest king in the massylian land

and valiant held was

syphax whose command

nations and the farthest seas obey'd
his territories vast in these he store of horse and monstrous beasts that are in fight a terrour and choice youth for war possess'd
none him surpass'd in ivory or gold or garments of getulian dy desirous therefore to his side to bring this strength the danger weighing should that king to carthage turn he puts to sea and in his thoughts already doth that war begin
but when at length his ship arriv'd before the port fled thither by the nearest shore in a weak bark was hasdrubal who sought new leagues for his distress'd affairs and brought massylian ensigns to the tyrian side
but when to syphax it was signifi'd that the two generals of two nations who with all their might contended to subdue each to their laws the world into his land were come big in his thoughts he gives command they should be strait conducted to his court proud that his throne was honour'd with resort

so great
then as with joyful eys he ran

or'e scipio face to him he first began
brave dardan fam'd for thy clear soul how thee willingly embrace how gladly see how much i'me pleas'd old scipio face to minde to call thy father in thy looks finde
speak of the herculean gades now when curious to observe the ocean flow and ebb to th erythraean coast came
with kindeness strange at baetis neighb'ring stream those two great captains came to see me where they presents of their spoils the best that were on me bestow'd as arms and which within my kingdom untill then unknown had been bridles for horse and bows with which we may our country's darts compare
besides these they masters of antient discipline that might in order form our scatter'd bands in fight



after your country's manner to me gave

gold and ivory of which we have great plenty in our land on them again would have bestow'd
but all my pray'rs were vain onely two swords which carved ivory ensheath'd they took
now therefore chearfully my palace enter and since hither now the libyan general my fortune through the seas hath brought consider what say with candid thoughts and thou whom all obey at carthage hasdrubal thine ears to me and senses turn
what storms through italy of arms like torrents run and spread the fears of ruin through the land and how ten years sometimes sicanian earth sometimes thy shore iberus hath been drunk with tyrian gore

to all is known now therefore let the war

be lay'd aside and joyntly arms forbare be thou content with italy and thou in libya to contain thy self
and now if to a league of amity you please to turn no mean procurer of your peace will syphax be
as more he would have said scipio no suff'ring him before him lay'd the customs of his country and the will o'th senate shew'd him that the fathers still determin'd such affairs wish'd him to lay all hopes of that design aside
thus they in arguing the day remaining spent and then unto their cups and viands went
the banquet ended ev'ry man repairs to rest and the hard fetters of his cares throws off to night
but when the morn gave birth to a by her first beams on earth and sol his horses from their stable drew unto their yoak himself not mounted to his seat but onely with his early rays then breaking forth enchac'd th eöan seas scipio leaps from his bed and with a fair aspect to syphax lodgings doth repair
he as the custom of his country bred young lions up which lost so tamely fed their native rage and at that very time their and mains while they with him were wanton strok'd and handled without fear their dreadful jaws
but when he came to hear that scipio was at hand he strait puts on his robe and royal ensigns of his throne in his left hand assumes
white fillets ty'd about his temples and to his left side

a sword as was their custom girt he strait

invites him in where privately they sate the scepter'd king and the ausonian guest in equal state
when scipio thus exprest his minde
it was my first and chiefest care so soon as the pyrenean nations were subdu'd by me into thy land to haste most mighty syphax nor which have past could me the cruel seas between retard
now what shall demand is neither hard nor yet dishonourable to thy throne with the ausonians let thy heart be one a firm ally to their successes be not the massylian nations can thee nor territories stretch'd to dang'rous sands nor pow'r of thy great ancestours in lands of vast extent more glory yield then will the romane valour still invincible in faith and honour of the latine name
for not to mention more none that can claim equality with the immortal gods over the dardan arms can compass odds
the king this hearing with a chearful face seems to assent and with a strict embrace let us confirm this happy omen cries and our joynt vows propitious deities assist both horned and tarpeian iove let us invoke
with that they forward move to sacred altars built of turfs of grass where ready for the ax the victim was
when suddenly the bull the altar flies leaps from the broken cords and with loud cries fills the whole temple and his dismal note ingeminating from his bellowing throat

through all the trembling palace terrour spreads

then strait the fillet that adorn'd the heads of his great ancestours without the touch of any falls from the king's temples
such sad signs by heav'n of his declining state were giv'n and heavy omens of his fate
this done returning to the port again scipio with prosp'rous gales arrives in spain
the greedy nations met
pyrene sent her sev'ral people all in complement salute and call him king which the supreme honour of virtue was in their esteem
but with a milde aspect their offers were by him rejected and he did his country's customs and which a noble romane that the very name of kings was odious at rome
again turn'd to that onely care that did remain no enemy now left the latine bands with those which baetis and which tagus sands enrich he convocates and to them thus midst the assemblies speaks
since heav'n hath us so bless'd that from the farthest part of all the world thrown out the libyan should fall or in these plains or from th hesperian lands exil'd should fly to see his native sands
now the fun'rals of my friends desire to celebrate and peace which they require to dearest shades to give
consent pray with me in this and list to what say
when the seventh sun again the skies shall gild whoer'e in arms or in the sword is skill'd or can with art the chariot drive or by swiftness of foot hopes conquest or lets fly

darts that impell the windes let such appear

and for the crown contend with honour here
rewards worthy of the choice of all the tyrian spoils will give
no person shall depart without reward
thus with desires of gifts and praises he the vulgar fires
and now the day arriv'd when all the plain with the vast concourse sounds and with a train well order'd the pretended obsequies scipio with tears obortive in his eyes leads on
all soldiers of the latine name and all th iberian with their off'rings came and threw them on the flaming pyles while he goblets of sacred milk and bowls that be with blushing bacchus fill'd devoutly pours and strews the altars or'e with flagrant flow'rs
then the excited shades he invocates with tears their praises sings and venerates their glorious acts
this done from thence he goes into the cirque where first he doth propose the rapid race of steeds and doth commence the sport
the wav'ring people in the sense and rage of fav'ring sides the bars not yet thrown open fluctuate to and fro and fret like murm'ring seas and still their eyes confine t'observe the horses stand
soon as the sign was giv'n the bars resound and to the skies scarce the first hoof appearing clamours rise with dreadful noise while prone and eager all as those that run they to the chariots bawl and steeds
the cirque with their contention shakes and heat in some from others courage takes
exhorting they drive on and clam'ring loud their horses guide and then a yellow cloud

mounts from the sandy tract into the air

obscuring with its darkness ev'ry where the horses way and drivers pains
here one rails at his steed and this upon the master
some the country's favour some the antient stable's name from whence they come inflames and some with hopes tormented are of the young steeds that harness newly bear
some with old age are pleas'd and praise the steed known for long years
starting with rapid speed callâick lampon through the air before the rest flies out and runs insulting or'e much ground and leaves the windes behinde
they shout and with applause grow hot nor seem to doubt that with the start h'ad gain'd the better part of his desires
but such as in the art and knowledg of the race more skillful were against their clamour at the first declare and at great distance blam'd with vain complaint his pains which made his horses faint
oh whither rashly cyrnus for twas he that drove the chariot whither dost thou flee forbear the whip take up the reins alass his ears are deaf and he doth forward pass still of his steeds secure nor thinks upon the space of ground that yet remain'd to run
at distance from the foremost but the space of's chariot length the next panchates was
asturian born his sire's white ensign bright upon his forehead shin'd his feet all white alike his mettle very great not tall his members and his bodie's grace but small but then he wings assum'd and with disdain of reins runs on with fury through the plain

you'd think his limbs grew greater he more high

his spanish guide shin'd in cinyphian dye
the third that equal with pelorus run afront was caucasus most fierce and one that scorn'd on's flatter'd neck the hand's applause but foaming lov'd to champ with bloody jaws upon the bit
but easier to obey the reins pelorus never from the way the running chariot deviating drew and in the tract went on directly to the mark
his crest was deep and to and fro upon his neck an ample main did flow
no sire he had him harpe when anew in the vectonian meades the zephyrs blew brought forth
this chariot gallant durius in the race urg'd on
on atlas who had been his master long did caucasus rely
him thither then aetolian tyde by tydides built had sent and thought indeed that his descent was from that trojan breed

of steeds which from

aeneas diomed near simois took and home with conquest led
now as almost amidst the race they drive in space enlarg'd panchates fierce doth strive or'etake the foremost horses and to tend yet higher and behinde seems to ascend the chariot that before him went while he striking on the callâick shakes it with his forefeet
but though the last old atlas tow'rds the goal as nimbly past as durius
you might think they peaceful were so equally their fronts and reins they bear but when th iberian who then next him went perceiv'd that the callâick strength was spent

nor as before the headlong chariot leap'd

but with continual violence and whip'd the smoaking steeds went on
as from high hills a sudden storm the lower vallies fills stretch'd to his horses necks and hanging or'e their heads panchates that he should no more delay but bear his reins with good success excites and lashing on doth this express
while thou contend'st shall an asturian gain the prize stir up fly nimbly through the plain
for lampon who as wing'd but lately went in's panting breast declines his breath is spent nor gaping hath enough to bear him to the mark
thus having said the horse anew himself collects as if he newly then had started from the barriers and began the race and cyrnus striving as he pass'd to cross or equal him behinde him cast
heav'n and the cirque with the spectatours cries murmurs while through the air panchates flies and raising his triumphant neck more strong and high his fellows foremost draws along
atlas and durius in the rear their arts in wheeling try
this to the left converts his reins the other to the right doth bend and strives to pass and both in vain contend each other to deceive till on his strength of youth relying durius turn'd at length his reins and headlong drives his chariot on cross atlas which overthrown he weak with age complaining justly cries whither dost go or what mad way is this of running races both my steeds and me to kill thou dost endeavour
thus while he

exclaims the broke upon his face

he falls and's steeds now drawing sev'ral ways run headlong through the champagne sad to see while in the open plain with victory the reins unto his friends pelorus heaves and shakes and midst the sand behinde him leaves atlas endeav'ring there to rise
nor far had he to equal cyrnus weary carr
past whom learning too late to guide his steeds and marching slow with nimble wheels he speeds
his friends with shouts and cries his chariot make to go more swift
and now upon the back and shoulders o'th iberian charioter his mouth the horse had lay'd who full of fear by the strong vapour of his breath and foam soon feels his back oppress'd and warm become while durius ply'd the race and lash'd amain his horses on nor seems to strive in vain on the to reach the steeds before and equall'd them and then transported more with so great hopes cries out
pelorus now that zephyrus was thy sire tis time to show and let them learn that can the pedegree of steeds by name derive how much in thee a breed divine excels
a conqu'rour thou shalt altars raise and off'rings shalt bestow upon thy sire
and if as this he said through joyful fear he had not been betrai'd by his too great success and letting fall his whip perhaps to zephyrus he all his vows had pay'd and altars rais'd
but then as if h'ad gain'd the crown and it agen had tumbled from his head unfortunate his anger turning on himself he strait

across his breast his golden garment rends

and dire complaints most sadly weeping sends up to the very stars
and now no more his lashing ceas'd the chariot as before obey'd his hand but on the horses backs insteed o'th whip the reins he vainly shakes
while now secure of praise panchates came up to the goal and the first prize did claim
the winde with his large main which nature lay'd over his neck and shoulders gently play'd while snatching up his subtile limbs about he praunc'd and triumph'd with a mighty shout
an ax in solid silver carv'd to all alike was giv'n
the rest the general distinguishing with sev'ral honours gave
the first a nimble courser did receive which the massylian king a present made of high esteem
the next in merit had two golden cups o'th tyrian spoils which there in plenty lay and rough with a lion's skin and with like dread exprest a tyrian helmet with an horrid crest
the third in honour in reward the last was atlas who though from the chariot cast pitying the sad misfortune of his fall and his decrepit age the general presented and in's prime of age a slave and bonnet of his country's fashion gave
this done the general the race proclaims a foot and hearts with prizes fix'd inflames
to th first a cask which late upon the head of hasdrubal did pannick terrour spread through all th iberian bands
to him whose speed
next merited a sword there was decreed

which from hyempsal slain his father took

and to the third a bull
the rest forsook the cirque each man and proud that they two darts of native metal bore away
then hesp'ros and tartessos lovely boys at once appear with the propitious voice of all the cirque
of tyrian blood they came from gades
next to whom the river's name

by corduba

was giv'n when yet a childe

in that great contest baeticus was fill'd with joyfull hopes
and then with but with a skin whose whiteness might compare with snow did eurythus with clamours fill the lists
he bred upon her lofty hill was thither sent by setabis and there with trembling piety his parents were
then lamus and then sicoris thy brood warlike ilerda and that drinks the flood which under lethe name with silence laves the hollow banks with its forgetful waves theron appears
and when they all upon their feet stood ready and with bodies prone and panting hearts with heat of praise elate receiv'd signal by the trumpet strait starting through air as swift as arrows by extended nerves enforc'd away they fly
and now the shouts and parties divers are the fav'rours by their fingers hang and where each man affects by name their friends excite while the fair troop speeds through the plain so light their feet leave no impression on the sand
all in their prime in face all comely and all swift of foot all worthy to or'ecome
now eager eurythus the foremost from

the middle tract advanc'd yet foremost past

but a short space when hesperos as fast came up and press'd upon his heels while he conceiv'd it was enough for him to be the foremost
t'other it suffic'd he might yet hope to get before
with that more light their steps they gather and with vig'rous mindes drive on their bodies
while their beauty findes encrease from labour
when with easy pase theron who ran the last of all the race finding his strength sufficient for the course his vigour with a sudden force employs and breaks into the air so fleet you'd think that mercury with winged feet went his ethereal course
now these then those the people all admiring he and lately last now the third victour press'd by his swift steps dost hesperos infest
nor whom he follows onely but the rings prime hope advancing with such active wings amazeth eurythus when fourth in place tartessos vainly toiling if the race the other three pursu'd as they began with fiery theron that betwixt them ran his brother press'd
which theron now no more enduring rais'd himself and got before enraged hesperos
then onely one before him went
and now the goal begun with nearer incitations to enflame the vex'd behinde
when up they furious came and all the force that either toil or fear piercing into their hearts had left while there could any thing be hop'd for in a space so short collect
the foremost two the race

with equal speed pursue and happily

the prizes of a double victory coming together to the mark had won with merit had not hesperos who run close behinde theron and through anger made most cruel seiz'd upon his hair display'd on's milky neck and drawn him back
while thus the youth detain'd triumphing eurythus a joyful victour for the prize appears and the fair present of an helmet bears away
their fix'd rewards the other found and with green wreaths their tresses bound
each had two shafts with native metal steel'd
this done more cruel conflicts stain the field
the sword's drawn hand to hand and a fair war they represent
not such as guilty are nor vitious men are to the sword design'd but such whom valour equall'd and a minde inflam'd with love of praise
a perfect face of their past labours and of mars his race

a worthy

spectacle
among these were

two brothers who what will not princes dare to act what crimes do scepters want engage in a full cirque while the whole pit their rage condemns in single combat for a throne
twas a dire custom in their country known where orphan sons their father's royal seat with hazard of their lives invade
both meet with all the fury that a mad desire of rule affords and both at once expire bearing to ghosts below ambitious hearts glutted with blood and in their inward parts with one joynt thrust their swords push'd on are drown'd and adding railing language to each wound

struggling their angry souls fly into air

nor could their ghosts this enmity forbare for when their bodies were together brought unto one pyle as if they still had fought

the impious flames tis strange asunder fly

nor would their ashes there togetherly
the rest with sev'ral gifts as was their share of courage or of force rewarded are
some oxen that with ploughs impress'd could till the earth some youths mong tyrian spoils with skill accustom'd to explore the dens of beasts some silver plate with wealthy robes and crests rising on shining helmets bore away the spoils and trophies of the libyan prey
then with the dart they honour sought the last of these circensian games and strove to cast beyond the mark
here neighbour to that land where tagus pale becomes with golden sand was burnus famous for his long descent and line with glagus who the windes with his strong arm
aconteus too whose dart in its most speedy course the nimblest hart

ner'e miss'd
with them

indibilis who long

in war delighted now esteem'd among confederates of rome who often slew with his sure shafts the towring fowl that flew among the clouds
and stout ilerdes who could easily surprize the flying doe
burnus who in the mark first fix'd his dart damum receiv'd a maid that mix'd with art the milky fleeces with getulian dye
but who the next was honour'd and that nigh unto the mark a shaft· had thrown with joy ilerdes for reward receiv'd a boy

the third palm brave aconteus had a brace

of dogs that would the boar with mettle chace
but when applause and shouts these honours had approv'd in scarlet laelius richly clad and younger scipio with a chearful look the names and manes of the dead invoke then strait their jav'lins throw delighting so all honour to their sacred dust to show and add that ceremony to the games

at length the

general whose face proclaims

his inward joy when he their pious hearts rewarded had with gifts to their deserts and giv'n a weighty corslet all of gold unto his brother and a pair of bold asturian steeds to laelius rising threw with force his conqu'ring jav'lin and to shew the shades were truely honour'd as it flies amidst the field tis strange before their eyes fix'd in the earth the jav'lin stands and strait with leaves the lofty boughs themselves dilate
but now its shadow wide the growing tree extends the augurs all with prophecy command them on to greater things to go which by those signs the deities foreshow
with this presage the libyans all from spain repuls'd to latium he returns again his house and country both reveng'd while fame the triumph leads
nor other cares inflame the romane breasts then libya to commit and sacred fasces to his youth
but yet

the graver sort who fal'n in courage or

success had wanted in that dubious war opposing his designs as rash with fear their dangers magnifie and as he there

high in the dignity

of consul pray'd

authority of senate to invade and ruin carthage with his arms this grave reply aloud the elder fabius gave
hope need not fear that who am loaden with age and honour who in fame and years abound should by the consul be esteem'd a person that maliciously from his just praises would detract
my name is with sufficient splendour rais'd by fame
nor wants what have done with such success new praise
but while live twere wickedness to my dear country to be wanting or conceal my minde in silence
you the war intend to libya to transferr
for we now want an enemy in italy
nor is't enough that we have hannibal subdu'd
what greater honour can in all eliza land be found but if you are spur'd on by glory what should you debar to reap this harvest thee for deeds at hand fortune hath fit and worthy made
our land ev'n thirsts to drink the blood of hannibal
whither the war or ensigns do you call extinguish first the flames of italy
you plainly quit a weary enemy and at that instant rome must naked stand
but when you waste the syrts and barren sand will not that horrid plague with fury move gainst these known walls invade tarpeian iove depriv'd of arms and men of how great weight is it should you give way and leave the state to the emerited and when we are struck with the thunder of so great a war

must we as fulvius from proud capua thee

from libya coast recall get victory at home and italy that hath with tears deplor'd the funerals of fifteen years absolve from cruel war then take your way to remote garamantians
you may your nasamonian triumphs then design
but italy distress'd must now decline all such attempts
your valiant father he that so much honour to your family did add when consul he was bound for spain himself gainst hannibal who then amain descended from the alps did first oppose his army all recall'd
from conqu'ring foes you consul would retire that so you may from us the libyan withdraw
but say he will secure sit quiet nor pursue you and your arms to libya will not you condemn these blinde resolves when rome shall be surpriz'd or else suppose that troubled he should turn his ensigns and your fleet pursue he the same hannibal will be that you entrench'd have seen before this citie's wall this fabius and the like was urg'd by all the elder sort
the consul strait reply'd
by a joynt death two valiant captains dy'd when spain possess'd embrac'd the libyan yoak
not fabius then nor any that have spoke his sense afforded aid
know tis truth the war's whole fury when but a youth endur'd and to the falling shafts alone my head expos'd and drew all dangers on my self
and then the seniour sort and ev'n this prophet murmur'd that the war was giv'n

unto a boy and blam'd our rash design

but all praises to the pow'rs divine by whom a trojan people we remain with thanks return
that very boy those vain and childish years that scipio who was then unripe for arms to you agen hath giv'n all spain the libyans thence by force repuls'd and following the farthest course of sol to atlas bounds the libyan name expell'd from the hesperian orb nor came with his victorious ensigns home before he phoebus saw upon the romane shore loosing his flaming chariot near the main
the same to you did foreign kings regain
and carthage now remains the last of all my toils
this iove declares
see hannibal old age now shakes or fainting fears doth frame lest to our ruins of such length my name a period should produce
my valour have surely try'd and strength augmented by my prime of years
then seek not to delay but rather suffer that this lot may pursue
this the immortal gods for me have kept to wipe away the infamy of former woes
it is a fair renown for wary fabius not to be or'ethrown and the delayer hath effected all

for us by sitting still
but

hasdrubal

mago nor hanno nor yet

giscon son

had turn'd their backs if we the like had done or idle close entrench'd spun out the war
could a sidonian boy who scarce did bear the down of youth upon his cheeks invade laurentine people walls approach were made

by trojan hands and drink the sacred stream

of yellow tyber and in latium seem by a long war to share and shall we stand thus backward to transport to libya land our ensigns and the tyrian tow'rs destroy their coasts secure of danger openly and all the land a rich tranquillity enjoys
at length let carthage wont to be a terrour learn to fear and understand that though from hannibal th oenotrian land as yet's not free we want not arms
ev'n this man that hath so long in italy till he's grown old through cautious counsels stood

that hath three

lustra largely shed our blood

him fearing cruel things and trembling back to his country that in flames shall ly will turn
the shameful marks of tyrian hands shall rome view on her walls while carthage stands free and secure and hears our misery and wars with open gates the enemy may batter then with their sidonian rams our tow'rs again if first in romane flames they hear not that their country's temples fall
the fathers by this language and the call of fate inflam'd to what the consul said at the same time assent and when they'd pray'd that it to italy might happy prove permit the war to libya to remove

when farr at sea the deity this youth devoutly had receiv'd and to the mouth of thuscan tyber brought the vessel strait a female band succeeds and with its fraight the lofty gally through the river drew with fast'ned cords
then round about them through the air the hollow sounds of tinkling brass with the harsh timbrel's noise contending pass and dancing satyres which inhabit where

chast dindymus two lofty hills appear

and use in the dictaean caves to sport and unto ide and silent woods resort
amidst this noise the sacred vessel known by chearful shouts refusing to go on retracts the ropes and on a sudden stood immoveable and fix'd within the flood
with that the priest as in the ship he stands exclaims forbear with your polluted hands to touch the cords and advise you farr from hence oh farr depart whoever are

prophane nor in this chaster labour joyn

while it sufficeth that the pow'r divine gives this advise but if there any be that in her chaster minde excells if she be conscious to her self her bodie's pure her hand alone this pious task secure

may undertake
here

claudia who her name

from th antient clausi drew by common fame traduc'd unto the ship her hands and eyes converting said mother of deities thou powr divine who didst for us give birth to all the gods whose heav'n and earth

the seas and shades below do rule by

lot

if this my body be without a spot great goddess be my witness and let me by this thy easy bark absolved be
thus having said the cable free from fear she seiz'd and suddenly they seem to hear the lion's murmur and a sound more grave untouch'd by any hand the timbrels gave
the ship advanc'd so fast you'd think the winde had forc'd it on and claudia left behinde though gainst the stream it ran
and hopes that far all else exceed chear up their hearts the war and all their fears at length shall ended be
for active scipio leaving sicily hid with his winged ships the spatious seas but with an off'red bull did first appease the god on whose blew waves the entrails swum
then birds descending from the gods abodes through the clear air in view begin to lead the navy and to shew their course by sea
a joyful augury their cries afford and as they foreward fly

under a liquid cloud the ships pursue

as far as they could keep them in their view and the perfidious coast of cadmus land attain
nor yet did africk idle stand but since so great a storm upon her came a dreadful pow'r under a mighty name against their fury had prepar'd to bring

the arms and force of the

massylian king

libya sole hope and latium onely fear syphax the fields and valleys ev'ry where and shores had fill'd with nomades that scorn their nimble steeds with trappings to adorn who with their singing shafts that as they flie through air like clouds surcharg'd obscure the skie
of the which he had giv'n before and league that he upon the altar swore unmindeful rites of hospitality and feasts that what was done could testifie his faith and trust chang'd by an impious flame of love he had infring'd and's crown became the purchase of his bed
great hasdrubal a virgin daughter had esteem'd by all as beautiful as her descent was fam'd she taken to his bed as if inflam'd with his first nuptial taper suddenly

his forces all to carthage turn'd
the

ty

of amity with rome he violates and to the fo his dotal arms translates
but scipio careful to advise the king bids him be faithful to observe the thing that he had sworn and not to violate the laws of peace but firmly to his state and kingdom stand
to call the gods to minde and deeds that hospitality did binde

that farr his nuptials farr his tyrian bride

would be mong romane arms if he deny'd what they demanded he should quickly finde that weak obedience of too soft and kinde a husband and his bed's so ardent heats should stand in blood
thus intermixing threats

scipio advis'd the king whose

wife before

had stop'd his ears
and when advice no more took place he summons all his swords agen attesting the chast altars of the polluted league and in the war proceeds with various arts
with huts of slender reeds and fenny flags such as the rustick moor selects to thatch his homely cottage or'e the libyan camp was
this he assail'd by stealth and secret flames with targets vail'd scatter'd in dead of night which as they run diffus'd like a contagion and begun with mighty noise through th unctuous food their way to make through all the air their light display and by their active heat the rafters fall
the hostile mischeif like a storm through all the camp goes on and on the arid reeds with frequent cracks devouring vulcan feeds
sad burnings in all quarters rise and some before they could perceiv't excited from their sleep are seiz'd by fire and as for aid in vain they call their faces flames invade
the lemnian god appears in ev'ry place a conquerour and in his dire embrace destroys both arms and men
the plague swells high and through the clouds the camp doth fly in glowing ashes then with dismal sounds and a prodigious leap the fire surrounds

the king's pavilion and had sadly there

devour'd the man had not his guards through fear of danger while amaz'd he much enquir'd him from his sleep and bed by force retir'd
but when within one camp the tyrian and syphax their strength had joyn'd and through the land call'd thither all in arms the youth agen the wounds of that sad night had eased then shame anger and a third pernicious fire his wife into his minde new rage inspire
and now he threatning storms his face should be blasted by burning of his camp that he should naked hardly scape the fo by flight amidst his trembling troops
but in the light in clearer day and less perfidious view of heav'n no mortal syphax could subdue
thus foolishly he rants while fate his pride and breath concluding would no more abide but cuts the thread of this vain swelling tongue for soon as he like floods that draw along whole groves and rocks and like swift torrents go through devious ways and all the banks o'reflow with foaming waves leap'd from his camp he prest his furious courser on before the rest and bids his troops advance
the other side a noble sober army when they spy'd the king far off snatch'd up their arms and strait march on and singly with themselves debate
see there see how this proud massylian king insulting at his army's head doth bring them on and for the combat calls
oh may this my that honour gain to day
the sacred altars of the gods he hath defil'd and hath infring'd his league and faith

with our chast general
oh may it be

sufficient gods that once already he from his escap'd this in their hearts resolv'd they all contending lance their darts
in the nostrils of his steed a jav'lin that surpass'd the rest in speed was fix'd by which the beast erected stood and with his bounding heels his jaws with blood or'eflowing beat the air then backward to the ground he fell and with a spear pierc'd through as ev'ry way he toss'd his limbs betrai'd his rider to the fo who him invade as he in vain endeavour'd from the ground to rise and fly and drawing from the wound the weapon seize him
then the shame of chains and gyves they add while he to all remains a great example never to rely upon prosperity
and now they ty in manacles his hands and he that lately saw so many lands beneath his feet that scepters and the sea that to the ocean bounds extended lay under his nod beheld thrown from the head of all his kingdoms is in triumph led
his strength thus overthrown the libyans are cut off while hated by the god of war
and known for frequent flight that enterprize condemn'd with speed the tyrian captain flies

carthage on one sole man her members all

thus ruin'd now rely'd
and hannibal ev'n with his absent name the frame sustain'd falling with so great noise now what remain'd was that ev'n fainting and distress'd for aid they should invite him home
to this affraid

they all assent when they perceiv'd they were

forsaken by the gods
and strait they are dispatch'd who with the ship the briny main might pass with speed to call him home again and with the senate's mandate thus advise
haste hannibal lest through delay thine eyes carthage in ruins see
oh be not slow t'assist thy falling country and the fo from these our walls repell
thus charg'd away they sail'd and on the fourth ensuing day the brought them to th italian shore where cruel dreams the general minde full sore disturb'd
for as by night opprest with care he slept flaminius gracchus paulus there seem'd with their naked swords t'assault him and together drive him from th ausonian land
with these of dreadful ghosts an army all that did at thrasimen and cannae fall appear to chace him to the sea
while he endeavour'd to the alps to flee
then italy embracing in his arms to it he stuck untill prodigious storms forc'd him to sea and in a tempest sent him home again
thus deep in discontent and with his dreams perplex'd to him they came and their instructions in the senate name with the great danger of the state declare
how the massylian forces routed were their prince his captive neck with chains oppress'd

kept

a new pomp for iove and how distress'd

carthage by hasdrubal not single flight was shaken and how they in dead of night sad to relate had seen both camps conjoyn'd afire while th impious flames through africk shin'd

and that the furious youth while hannibal still kept the brutian coast then threatned all with fire to ruin that the fall drew nigh of carthage
to what country should they fly and his great deeds what slaughters he had made in italy relate when this they'd said and all their woes and fears had laid before his eyes they wept and his adore like some great god
he with a stern aspect fix'd on the ground hears all and doth reflect with silence on their words and weighs with care if carthage of so great a value were
at length he thus reply'd oh envy thou dire fo to man who never wilt allow encrease to things or that great praise should grow unto a greater height
not long ago level with the ground could rome subdu'd have lay'd and captive into servitude have led the nation and on italy our laws impos'd
but while at home to me their general they pay and arms deny nor my troops wasted with success supply with fresh recruits and hanno thinks it good my cohorts to defraud of corn and food all africk is on fire and romane spears push at cadmeian gates
now it appears that hannibal his country's glory and her sole support and now in this ly all your hopes
well homeward turn with speed our ensigns as the senate hath decreed
both my country's walls and hanno thee together will preserve
all this when he had thunder'd out strait from the shore to sea

he lanc'd his fleet and

sighing sail'd away

none durst their backs as they put off invade

or him recal
heav'n seeming to perswade he should of's own accord thus haste away and italy at length be freed they pray for windes and think it is enough agen to see the coast so freed of foes
as when auster doth his impetuous blasts restrain and by retiring calms the foaming main the then not prodigal of pray'rs desireth not so much as gentle airs content that notus should intirely cease and by the sea's smooth course esteems his peace
the tyrian soldiers all their faces bent towards the main
but hannibal intent with fixed eyes held italy in view while silent tears with frequent sighs bedew his cheeks as if he had been driven from his country and had left his dearest home forc'd to some desert lands
but when with sails tack'd close the ships made way with swifter gales and by degrees the hills began to draw their summits down that now he neither saw hesperian mountains nor the daunian coast thus fretting with himself what have lost my sense unworthy to return said he ev'n thus when ever from italy withdraw my self in flames first carthage all should perish and the name of dido fall
was not mad when after cannae field from the tarpeian temples withheld my burning weapons nor the thunderer dragg'd from his throne through the sev'n hills from war now free my flames might have scatter'd then and on that haughty nation brought agen

troy ruins and their fate
but why

should this afflict me who forbids that should now invade them with my sword and go directly to their walls it shall be so and through those very lines returning where once encamped lay will repair to anyo waters by a way to me
then turn your prows for italy and the fleet i'le make that rome besieg'd shall call again her scipio home
but when the god of seas perceiv'd he burn'd with so great rage and that they now had turn'd towards the shore again their shining prows rait shaking his coerulean head he throws ves from the bottom and the swelling main rudes beyond its bounds
then windes and rain with black aeolian storms from rocks arise and cover from their sight with clouds the skies
then with his trident moving all the sea blew tethys from the rising of the day and fall he drives and the whole ocean face distracts
the foaming billows rise apace and make the rocks to snake on which they beat
first auster from his nasamonian seat leaps from the loose sands the water flings and leaves them bare
him on his gloomy wings fierce boreas bearing high a broken sea pursues
then thund'ring in another way with adverse blasts eurus rowls part of the ocean on the cracking poles bellow aloud while frequent lightning flies as if upon the fleet the angry skies would fall
the rage of windes and lightning rain and waves consent and darkness on the main

imposeth night
now coming from a rock

a furious rais'd by notus struck the yards and whistling dreadfully among the shrouds a billow like a mountain flung against the general
his eyes he turning to the sea and to the skies exclaims happy brother hasdrubal and to the gods made equal in thy fall thy valiant hand in fight did thee afford a noble death fate did to thee accord that with thy teeth at least on italy thou dying might'st
but unto me in cannae field where noble paulus dy'd and those renowned souls death was deny'd nor when would have fir'd the capitol could by iove tarpeian thunder fall
while thus he moans with sev'ral blasts impell'd the waves on either side rush'd on and held with their dark heaps the vessel down as drown'd by that rude shock
strait whirling swiftly round the sands rais'd high into the air it flung again where pois'd by th windes on waves it hung
but gainst rough stones and rocks sad to behold notus two gallies with hard fortune roll'd
the prows crack'd with the fall and with a sound of dread the broken barks aloft rebound from the sharp stones
strait over all the sea a various face of things
here helmets they arms crimson crests and capua treasure see and a rich prize with care reserv'd to be a trophy for the gen'rals triumph
there tripods and tables of the gods appear and sacred statues that in vain before the miserable latines did adore

when venus frighted that the ocean so high was mov'd to neptune thus began
this fury and these threat'nings father may suffice for greater things now spare pray thy seas lest envious carthage boast that she a man hath generated not to be subdu'd in war and that to work the fall of hannibal the romanes needed all thy rage and seas
thus venus spoke and strait their fury all the swelling waves abate and tow'rds the adverse camp the navy drive
their gen'ral old in arms and skill'd to give encouragement with praise their mindes inspir'd with anger by these furious words and fir'd their brests with flames of honour
thou to me flaminius bleeding head when slain said he didst bring
know thy hand thou first of all cam'st in to strike at mighty paulus fall and in his bones didst fix thy fatal spear
th opimous spoils of stout marcellus were thy glorious prize and falling gracchus stain'd thy sword
but there behold that valiant hand which with a jav'lin warlike appius who then storm'd the walls of wealthy capua threw dead from the lofty ramparts and here see another of valour he it was who fulvius a name renown'd pierc'd through the breast not with a single wound
stand thou here in the van who didst in arms consul crispinus kill me through the storms of fight do thou attend who the thing remember well pleas'd in thy rage didst bring

at cannae field the

gen'ral head to mee

fix'd on a servile lance
brave youth see

thy burning eys and aspect that hath more

of terrour then thy sword such as before thee when a tribune that in vain withstood crush'd by thy strong embrace i'th cruel flood of famous trebia drown'd did behold
but thou who first didst at the banks of cold ticînus in old scipio blood imbrue thy sword thy former enterprize pursue and the son's blood present me now
shall fear ev'n the gods themselves when thou art by should they come to the battel beheld when thou didst trample on the hills that swell'd to heav'n and o're the highest alps didst go with speed
since by whose sword and hands know

argyripa capacious fields were fir'd

wilt thou more slowly now by me desir'd go on who first of all didst lance a dart against the dardan walls nor willing art to joyn unto our praise must again thee now excite thee who gainst storms of rain thunder and lightning and when did stand iove fury didst as fierce as he command t'endure those vainer storms and wentst before thy gen'ral to the capitol
no more need exhort you now who by a war so fam'd sagunthus overthrew and are renown'd for those beginnings now again as it becomes your selves and me maintain the former praises of your valour
i'th favour of the gods and victory grown old now after fifteen years on you relying to my falling country to those gods that in so long a space of time have not seen to the embrace

of my chast wife and son return again

this the last battel is that doth remain to libya and to rome
this day our sword shall give to the disputed world its lord
thus hannibal
but as their general began to speak the romane soldiers call for battel and the signal nor abide delays of words
all this when iove espy'd his wife at distance in a cloud of air behold and that her eager looks did wear something of sadness to her with this kinde address he goes
what torments of the minde afflict thee now pri'thee let me know is it the libyan captain's overthrow· or care of carthage grieves do but weigh within thy thoughts the rage of libya gainst th trojans fatal pow'r and progeny in violating leagues
say what will be the end of this rebellious people none not carthage more of ills hath undergone or labour then thy self who long hast toil'd for the cadmaean race
thou hast embroil'd the seas and earth and into italy hast sent a furious youth while we might see the walls of rome stand trembling and of all for sixteen years was hannibal the chief
tis time the nation to compose the period is come and we must close the gates of war
the suppliant queen reply'd
nor in that hanging cloud did abide with a design a day prefix'd at all to change nor yet the armies to recall nor war extend but what you can bestow since now all favour towards me is low

and our first love's decay'd gainst fates decree

nothing ask
let hannibal now flee his enemies as you are pleas'd t'ordain and let in carthage romane ashes reign
by th mutual pledges of a double love thy wife and sister this onely iove intreat that my brave captain may survive all dangers and be kept by thee alive
nor let him captiv'd latian fetters wear but let these my dear walls that batter'd are with mis'ries though the tyrian name decline stand and for honour's sake be kept as mine
thus iuno
to whom iove this short reply vouchsaf'd
the walls of lofty carthage will for some time forbear as you desire and grant them to your pray'rs and tears entire to stand
yet know dear wife at what a rate this indulge not long that city's fate endures
for there will come a general

who under the same

name will ruin all

these tow'rs preserv'd
and from this fatal fight escaping hannibal ethereal light at this entreaty may enjoy a while
hee'l seek the stars and ocean to embroil and with returning arms to fill the earth
know his heart still pregnant with a birth

of war
but to this boon this shall remain

a law he never must behold again saturnus empire nor to italy return
from instant death now let him be remov'd with speed lest if i'th open plain he joyn in battel he should not again by all thy pow'r from scipio hand be freed
while thus their fates the thunderer decreed

both to the city and to hannibal

the armies to the fight advance and all with shouts invade the skies
earth in no age before two mightier nations did engage in fight nor greater generals had seen equal in arms contending
while between these two their fam'd dispute's prize was whatsoe're is cover'd with the skies
the tyrian rich in purple bove the rest rais'd his proud head upon his crimson crest a waving plume
a cruel dread precedes from his great name his sword a lightning sheds· to italy
on th other side scipio in radiant robes in scarlet dy'd his dreadful target shews where breathing war his father's image and his uncle's are engrav'd huge flames from his high fly
and thus the hopes of all and victory under so great a force of arms and men stood in the generals alone
and then thus fear or favour as tis often seen suggests
if valiant scipio had been in libya born the empire might have come to agenorean nephews
or had rome giv'n birth to hannibal then doubtless he the world had subject made to italy
now rapid storms of flying shafts brake through the air and with them clouds of horrour drew then to the sword more close each army came and fight it face to face
a dreadful flame burns in their eys and those that in the van contemning danger first the charge began between both armies fell and long before not seen by them the earth drunk native gore

but here in courage hot as he was young

stout masanissa flings himself among the macedonian cohorts and flies round about with's winged darts the champagn ground
so when the painted britain goes to war he circumvents with his carr the thronged bands
a graecian phalanx then in a close body had drawn up their men as was their country's use and firmly stood with intermingled spears to make it good
unmindeful of the compact he had made

after the league these

philip to the aid

of cadmus shaken city sent
and now broken with many wounds the soldiers grow more thin and as on ev'ry side they lay prostrate upon the ground an open way between the weapons leave
then with a stroke of ruin in th ausonian cohorts broke and cancell all their graecian perjuries
archemorus by rutulus teucer dies by stout norbanus in declining age both by their mother mantua sent t'engage in arms
but samjus brave calênus slue and selvis clytuis a pellaean who vainly insulted in his country's name

but alass clytuis twas not

pella fame

that could from daunian darts defend thee here
but laelius with upbraidings more severe

then these the

brutian bands of latine race

destroys
was italy so vile a place that it with tyrian oars you thus said he through the rude seas and raging waves should flee but tis enough that you are fled
will you with latine blood a forein land imbrue

this said he silarus active in the fight

prevented with a shaft that in its flight stuck in the bottom of his throat so hard it flew that it at once the passage barr'd of life and voice
vergilius destroy'd caudînus
by amanus sarris dy'd
their looks and habit of their arms and language that concorded with their own inflam'd their rage
whom when amilcar son perceiv'd inclining from the fight to run he cries betray not thus our nation stand then charg'd and turn'd the battel with his hand
as when a parethonian snake that long i'th garamantian fields was fed among the fervent sands with poison swell'd doth rear his neck and spouts through the infected air the flowing venom to the skies so he herjus that with his spear continually dealt wounds who of marrucian lineage came and in theatè had a noble name more nimble stops and as he something high attempted seeking with his enemy an equal praise with a swift hand quite through his body drives his fatal weapon to the hilts
the wounded falls and as he lies prostrate his brother seeks with dying eyes when young pleminius came on apace and brandishing his sword before his face enrag'd at his sad fall with a loud cry threatning demands his brother
this reply gave hannibal shall refuse no more if you think fit your brother to restore on this condition that from shades below you hasdrubal recall
shall forego

my juster hate gainst such as romanes are

or shall let my heart relent and spare one born on the italian ground then may the ghosts me as a fo from thence where they abide expell then may my brother for ever banish his society in dark avernus speaking thus he ran with all the weight of's shield upon the man and where the earth made slipp'ry with the blood of's brother fail'd him as he fighting stood fel'd and with's sword dispatch'd him on the place while with extended hands in his embrace he prostrate herius held and eas'd his weight of grief by sharing in his brother's fate
the libyan then a body mix'd in fight invades and rushing on his foes to flight turn'd a long way
as when with thunder hurl'd th aetnéan bolts of iove affright the world and his high palace shake a pannick fright makes all to quake th obortive light with horrour shines and iove seems ready by each man at him to let his lightning fly
but in another quarter as if there where scipio fought the onely danger were a bloody fight new forms of death creates in various shapes
a sword this penetrates and down he falls that lamentably groans a stone in pieces crushing all his bones
some basely flying on their faces are through fear precipitated
gainst the war others with valour arm'd their breasts oppose
while the rheteian gen'ral forward goes o're the dead heaps
as when the god of war with slaughter pleas'd shakes his bistonian carr

near frozen hebrus and the getick snow

melts with warm blood and ice by

aquilo augmented with his ratling chariot's weight asunder breaks
now with a dreadful heat looking about he ev'ry valiant name with's sword
there through the world for fame of slaughters known among their weapons falls on ev'ry side the youth that storm'd thy walls sagunthus and a war most cruel in thy miserable ruins did begin
there who the sacred thrasimen with blood had stained and the phaëtontian flood polluted who the boldness had to move their arms to sack the house and throne of iove in one vast ruin fell
there they were slain who did the secrets of the gods prophane and first the alps prohibited had press'd with mortal steps
the army all possess'd with fear in haste discouraged retire
as through a citie's houses when the fire diffused runs and ventilated by a rapid winde the active flames do fly up to the skies struck with a sudden fear and trembling as the city captive were the people run distracted ev'ry way
but scipio now grown weary with delay so to pursue those scatter'd combats or to be detained in so light a war resolv'd his force upon the cause of all those ills and war to turn
for hannibal alone that day surviving it would be no benefit at all to italy should carthage walls be set on fire and all their armies overthrown
but should he fall

alone not all their arms and men would ought

avail the libyans
him he therefore sought and search'd through all the field with busy eyes
then to the thickest of the fight he hies wishing that all ausonia if he there should him encounter the spectatours were
and bold with a fierce voice his fo doth cite upbraiding him unto another fight
which language when affrighted iuno hears lest it should touch the libyan captain's ears sh informs a romane shape which strait th italian prince's shining crest his plumes and shield and spreads his radiant cassock's grace upon his shoulders
then she adds his pace and habit such as him she did behold provoking to the fight and motion bold without a body gives
at length a steed like false and vain she forms that runs with speed through devious ways and offers to the sight the image of a warlike shade in fight
thus scipio fain'd by iuno proudly to the fight advanc'd and brandish'd in the view of hannibal his sword who pleas'd his ey beheld the romane general so nigh and hoping mighty things were then at hand strait claps his heels against his courser and with sudden force a jav'lin at him throws
the winged shade turns back and flying goes quite cross the field beyond the armies
then as if possess'd of's chief desire agen with his steel'd heel th'insulting libyan makes his horse to bleed and still pursuing shakes th enlarged reins
whither dost thou run forgetful that tis our dominion

scipio where now thou fly'st
libya thee

affords no skulking hole
thus proudly he with his drawn sword still follow'd as it fled until deluded by it he was led into another field far distant from the place of battel where no sooner come but the delusive shade to air resolves
what god said angry hannibal involves himself in that dark light to me or why doth he conceal'd within that monsterly is then my glory to the gods become so opposite yet never shalt thou from this hand compel or force my fo said he by all thy arts whatever god thou be who stand'st for italy
with that he wheel'd his nimble steed about and to the field enrag'd returns
when strait with secret dread of sudden mischief shock'd upon his head down fell his courser and by iuno care breath'd from his panting breast his life to air
but then impatient this again said he this is your plot ye gods nor do you me deceive better by the rocks had bin o'rewhelm'd better had been drowned in the waves and seas
was preserved then to this vile death while those unhappy men that have my ensigns follow'd and from me alone receiv'd a battel's augury are slaughter'd and absent understand their groans their voice and words as they demand their hannibal
what stygian torrent is sufficient to wash off my sin as this he spake on's with an earnest ey he look'd enflam'd with a desire to dy

but iuno pitying the man assumes

a sheepherd's face and on a sudden comes from the thick woods and as he thought to dy a death inglorious thus accosts him why so arm'd to these our woods do you repair would you go to that cruel battel where great hannibal in arms the rest subdues of the ausonian armies if you'l choose the speedy and compendious way to go into the thickest of them will show the nearest tract
to this he strait agrees and onerates with ample promises the sheepherd's breast and tells him that the state of carthage would his pains remunerate with large rewards and he would give as great
thus eager hasting o're the next retreat with largest steps the goddess him conveys deceiv'd by intricacy of the ways in circles and her self concealing still gave him unwellcome safety gainst his will
but the cadméan troops forsaken all and full of fear seeing no hannibal nor the known conflicts of their furious chief some think him slain others are of belief that he concluding all was lost withdrew from the sinister gods
and now in view the romane gen'ral like a storm amain came on and chas'd them thorough all the plain
carthage her self then trembled pannick dread through africk by the routed troops is spread
and without fighting as they fly to their extreamest bounds they frighted hie
some to tartessiack coasts dispersed are others to battus lands and nile repair

so when by secret force o'recome at last

vesuvius to the stars his flames doth cast through many ages fed o're sea and land the fire's diffus'd th eöan seres stand amaz'd beholding a prodigious sight

their silken groves with latian ashes white

but now at length the weary general to th neighb'ring hill saturnia brought where all the face and signs o'th bloody fight more near he saw
such as garganus did appear such as the tyrrhen lake and trebia flood and swift eridanus with humane blood o'reflowing he beheld
such a dire face was shown of myriads slaughter'd on the place
then troubled iuno the skie and climbing up the hill the fo drew nigh when hannibal thus with himself though all the fabrick of the heav'ns dissolv'd should fall on this my head and earth should open wide yet shall the fame of cannae iove abide and sooner from thy empire shalt thou fall then in the deeds and name of hannibal the world be silent
nor from this my hand secure rome shalt thou for ever stand
against thee my country's hope will live for a new war
for that thou now dost thrive in fight is cause thy foes sit still
to me more then enough it is that italy and dardan mothers while live will there expect me and ne're lay aside their fear
then with a few that fled away he gets back to the hills and more secure retreats

here the

war's period was
to scipio strait of their own accord they open throw

their gates
their impious rites abolish'd are

their arms he takes away and laws that were engrav'd
their strength in riches and their pride is overthrown and elephants aside their castles lay
at length to libya a dismal sight their fleet is fir'd the sea burns with the sudden tempest and the flame nereus affrights
the gen'ral with a name that equal shall with time for ever stand with the first title of that conquer'd land sure of that empire goes by sea to rome

and in great

triumph to his native home

is born
before him syphax captivate upon a bier his eyes dejected sate his neck in golden chains preserv'd
and here hanno and young phoenician nobles were then macedonian princes next to these the moors with parched skins then nomades

and garamantians known to

horned iove where they the sands survay and syrts that prove

destructive still to ships

next lifting to

the stars her conquer'd hands did carthage go
then the effigies of th iberian land now peaceable with gades that doth stand the period of the earth and calpè that of old alcides praise did terminate with baetis which the horses of the sun is wont to bath in streams that gently run and high pyrenè that gives birth to wars and lifts her leavy head unto the stars

yet nothing more delights their mindes and eyes then hannibal as in the field he flies

my lord

my obligations to your lordship have long since called for such acknowledgement as ought to appear under the title of the noblest subject
had any within the prospect of my fancy been more eminent then this of hannibal had made choice of it as adequate to your merits but none appearing have selected what silius left untouched to

raise out of it this little monument of my gratitude having no other means to express it
confess at first intended to adventure on the third punick vvar which though of less continuance then this second had in it as gallant actions especially in that famous siege of carthage as any history doth mention but conscious of the vveakness of what have already built feared that by raising too many stories it might fall under its own bulk and my self under the censure of ambition in aspiring to so great a vvork
have therefore rather chosen to desist and fix this little piece under your lordship's name as a votive table to testifie to the vvorld how much am

my lord your lordship's most humble and faithful servant thomas ross

a continuation of silius italicus to the death of hannibal the first book

the argument
the romane piety and zeal to pay at scipio return the vows which they in war had made
king syphax captive dies by voluntary famine
the sad cries of carthaginian dames
their citie's quite disarmd parting tears
by night great hannibal his treach'rous country flies sails to cercinna and in sacrifice a day consumes
fearing to be betray'd those whom he by wine asleep are lay'd

now had great scipio brought his trophies home and with loud triumphs fill'd the streets of rome the people to their num'rous altars bring their pleasing off'rings and glad paeans sing
such store of sweets in ev'ry temple smoak as if not libya onely felt the yoak of this great conquest but arabia there her tribute gave and the sabaeans were

their vassals
or as if to prophesie

that all the world in time to come should be by them subdu'd and rome triumphant stand the wealthy of each conquer'd land bulls that with snow for whiteness might contend

wash'd in

clitumnus sacred streams ascend

the capitol their curled foreheads crown'd with flowry wreaths their horns with fillets bound
these all in solemn order round the hill thrice slowly lead the joyfull people fill the trembling air with shouts then enter while the gods seem pleas'd and in their statues smile pleas'd that devotion with success they see so duely mix'd and grateful piety

to pay those holy vows which first arose

from fears of ruin and insulting foes
first to the queen of gods a purple vest whose rich embroid'ry all the art exprest of the sidonian dames and then a crown of gold which hapless syphax overthrown his sophonisba wore the matrons bring and off'ring at her shrine thus pious sing
sister and wife of iove celestial queen whom we so long so full of wrath have seen that rome almost despairing of her fate saw these her walls besieg'd let not thy hate to trojan blood still prompt thee to despise our piety but with serener eyes behold us now and hear us when we pray and our oblations on thine altars lay
why should thy love to libya still enflame thy rage gainst us who from aenêas came let it suffice we to this very time have expiated with our blood that crime

of paris
oh believe him now to be

in us repenting his disdain of thee
be then appeas'd thy mercy will no less then doth thy power thy deity confess and if at length with other gods and fate thou wilt comply to bless the romane state as thou on the supreamest throne above the heav'ns art seated so here next to iove thou shalt be worshipp'd and the world shall come to bring their off'rings unto thee at rome
the flamen while they thus invoke his hands display'd to heav'n at iove high altar stands and thus exhorts
oh may we ever see religion thus to crown thy victory quirinus progeny these pious charms oh rome will force the gods to bless thine arms
then then let thy piety encrease as now when war is ended and thy peace confirm impiety alone the fates

provokes and flingeth open

ianus gates

this said an hundred bulls at once are slain which with their blood an hundred altars stain
their entrails all enquir'd for what's to come promise a lasting happiness to rome that she the head of all the world should stand and next to iove the universe command

the gods thus serv'd they all begin to feast

and in their costly banquets spend the rest o'th day
the senate seated are alone and to great scipio honour one by one a stately goblet quaff of massick wine
his cheeks mean while with modest blushes shine as if they'd fire the laurel on his brow unwilling those just praises to allow

so in the gyants war when heav'n again

was free from fear and mighty typhon slain to mirth themselves the gods dispos'd and round the tables hebè with nepenthè crown'd their cups while all apollo skill proclaim commend his bow his shafts and certain aim by which the gyants fell when they upon the stars had seiz'd and iove celestial throne almost possess'd
but back again to hell struck with these heav'nly arms the rebels fell
the solemn day thus spent the night succeeds inviting all to rest
while syphax bleeds within the trumpet which their triumphs sounds grates on his ears strikes to his heart and wounds his very soul
sometimes he thinks upon

his former

state when sitting on a throne

of native ivory he did command those nations which the aethiopian land and nasamon confines with those that by the carthaginian bounds and hammon ly with all that south dwell near nile and those where the herculean sea gainst calpè throws its foaming waves when he could summon to the war whole myriads of horsemen who on naked steeds did ride and gave them law and between rome and carthage when he saw the world disputed was that he had been the umpire of their quarrel and had seen them both his friendship seek until his flame of love the ruin of his throne became
sad with these thoughts that in his troubled breast swell like a raging tempest and all rest deny at length his sighs that as a winde within the bowels of the earth confin'd

shakes the whole fabrick untill forth it breaks

into the air make way and thus he speaks
is then the birth and title of a king ye gods from whom kings sprung so vain a thing that with one shock of fortune onely must fall so low into captivity as to become their slave to whom of late was a terrour are the laws of fate of so great force that whatsoe're's design'd by them by all must be obey'd must binde the deities themselves alass if so why do poor mortals to their temples go and vainly crave that aid which cannot be confirm'd unless the fates the same decree how oft did before took in hand this war their counsel and consent demand as oft their tripods what ask'd allow'd
and as often to their honour vow'd dardanian spoils
but since am or'ethrown tis not my crime they want them but their own

from them it was that

sophonisba charms

prevail'd and thrust me into arms against that faith which to rome before religiously had sworn
would no more of this complain had we together dy'd
or had not masanissa both my bride

my throne and crown enjoy'd
ye gods you were

if not unjust in this at least severe
else wherefore did not when hostile fire had seiz'd my camp within those flames expire then might to the shades below have gone at least a king
then had onely known the fate of being conquer'd not the shame nor then had rome recorded syphax name

among her captives
nor then had these hands

that shook a scepter o're so many lands been thus bound up in chains
but why do complain of life and not resolve to dy what though they study to preserve me still a living trophy here yet is my will free as the conquerours's and rome shall finde still retain the empire of my minde that stands above her reach where alone will rule and scorn to live but on a throne
this said a sudden silence seiz'd his soul and as deep waters in still chanels roul and murm'ring less into the ocean flow so the resentments of his griefs that grow too great to be express'd through ev'ry part like a swift fever runs till his great heart resolv'd to bear that load no more deny'd nature her common food and starv'd he dy'd
and as a lion that hath long in blood maintain'd his empire in some libyan wood surpriz'd at last in toils and kept to be the pastime of the cirque raging to see his native freedom lost doth roaring round his prison walke and with that dreadful sound was wont all other beasts to terrify and with their flocks make trembling sheepherds fly shakes all about
but when he findes at length that nor his rage prevails nor yet his strength can his escape procure all proffer'd food he growling flies forgets all thirst of blood and in disdain of his captivity resolves in sullen silence there to dy
so that great king to whom not long before rich gems were from the erythraean shore

for tribute brought to whom with lions tame

and towred elephants getulians came and prostrate at his feet obedience pay'd at first in love then war a captive made in a dark dungeon dy'd and the sole fame

that he gainst scipio fought preserves his name

but while at rome their triumphs still encrease at carthage the sad purchase of their peace shews them a face of things which they deplore as much as those deep wounds they had before in war receiv'd and zama fatal plain on which so many libyans were slain and hannibal disarm'd
for now they see that nor in peace nor war they can be free
not all the wealth their num'rous conquests gave nor subjects gain'd by hannibal could save their own at home for while his conqu'ring hand o'return'd sagunthus and the iberian land subdu'd and when his troops pyrenè past the celtae gain'd and italy did waste their victories abroad still calling for recruits as costly prov'd as if the war had been in libya made onely their fear of utter ruin was not then so near
it was not now enough that they had seen those wealthy trophies that had thither been from sicily from the herculean bars and farthest nations in preceeding wars by great amilcar sent transported all to rome and there within the capitol among aegates spoils hung up to be eternal monuments of infamy
their dreadful elephants that had so long against all stranger nations been so strong

a living wall with all the arms which there

since dido first phoenician walls did rear had been stor'd up and had a pannick dread· over the alps and high pyrenè spread are yielded to their foes with trembling hands and conquer'd carthage now as naked stands as when eliza first her walls begun or when enrag'd hyarbas full of revenge her narrow bounds and while her ashes yet were warm upon her pyle fix'd his victorious arms nor can they see by land a period to their misery
earth hath not space enough whereon to lay their chains which now extended to the sea confine the force of carthage that no more it can from africk to europa shore terrour diffuse but melts into a name like troy in ruin onely known to fame

that navy which before the fate of rome prevail'd had brought unvalu'd treasures home which through the seas from east to west had flown and where the romane eagles were not known under its swelling wings sidonian dyes had often born and chang'd for such supplies as meroè and black syenè yields with whatsoe're renowns those spicy fields where ganges flows by which the libyan land though they dire serpents in the barren sand plough up as great a plenty ev'ry where enjoy'd as theirs whose harvest twice a year their garners fills is by this storm of fate contracted to so small a number that they now despair e're more with hostile oars to fright from latian and sicilian shores

the trembling nymphs but must for ever stand

condemn'd as slaves to a parch'd barren land
as some hot plague by a malignant star diffus'd into a universal war first the wide air infects next beasts and then the commons till at last the best of men are snatch'd away by the same cruel fate which none but heav'n knows where t'will terminate so when the romane fury in whose hand alone the fate of carthage seem'd to stand had strip'd them of all force by land and sea and nothing now was left but to obey at length their spirits by a dreadful doom are seiz'd the best of all their youth to rome as pledges of their faith must strait be born and libyan mothers tears become the scorn of latian dames
it had been better they while hannibal in italy did stay had granted been to his bands
they then their country not with fetter'd hands but arm'd had left and might have fighting dy'd nor thus been sacrificed to the pride of an insulting fo whose malice knows no bounds but fed still more insatiate grows
but now the fatal day arrives and fears wound ev'ry breast fill ev'ry eye with tears
the weeping mothers with dishevel'd hair run through the streets and vainly beat the air with loud complaints
sometimes they call upon the gods then strait exclaim that there are none at least that they are deaf else might their tears prevail and their oppressions touch their ears
sometimes the authour of the war and those infernal altars that at first their foes

provok'd they curse
sometimes those men they blame

whose envy without reason to the name of hannibal had fix'd victorious rome in that great height and brought those ruins home which iove himself once fear'd whose onely hand with thunder arm'd could hannibal withstand and keep the capitol
but oh ye gods what boots it now say they that so great ods carthage did once enjoy above the world since from the height of glory she is hurl'd into the depth of shame
but thus you still are prone to give things great yet never will preserve them so
in vain alass the toils of our great fathers have with wealthy spoils enrich'd your temples and with noble wounds the pow'r of carthage stretch'd beyond the bounds of africa and with such dreadful aw her name had spread that all the world their law expected from her hand
but oh how small a shadow now remains to us of all our former glories we are mothers made that by this blessing we might be betray'd to a far greater curse and add more weight unto our ruin and unhappy fate
had these upon your cruel altars dy'd religion might perhaps have satisfi'd our loss and we at least might home return with this content that in their native urn their ashes were preserv'd
but these are born to be the grief of carthage and the scorn of rome whose now they are and not our own nor will they be for such hereafter known but taught their country's manners to disclaim

and bury in the

gown the tyrian name·

as thus they sadly to the gods complain

the winde the romane navy to the main invites
the masters for the captives call while at their feet the weeping parents fall and prostrate thus implore
if yet that ire appeased be that did your breasts inspire at zama field wherein our fates gave way to yours and crown'd you with an happy day now mildely hear our pray'rs and as you are rais'd by the gods to this great height in war that by their blessing you may higher rise be merciful like them do not despise the tears of such as fall their cries the scale of fortune often turn and may prevail with heav'n to break the chain of your success if whom the gods afflict you shall oppress
the bravest souls no longer will pursue their rage then while it serves them to subdue
and when the conquer'd do submit they finde a sanctuary in a noble minde
when therefore our unhappy sons shall come sons not for carthage born but conqu'ring rome within your walls oh be not too severe lay easy chains upon them think they were once free as you so may a better fate your issue bless so may you propagate your lasting names to honour and near crost by fortune keep that freedom we have lost
as thus they plead from their embraces torn two hundred noblest tyrian youths are born away to sea at rome ordain'd to stand the faithful plegdes of their native land
but while all other breasts with grief and care are fill'd and ev'ry one with sad despair

of future liberty resolves the yoke

to bear with patience and no more provoke those arms which after such expense of blood and wealth too late alass they understood superiour to their own revenge puts on amilcar shape and thus by night his son excites to war
hannibal canst thou after the fame of thy so early vow to prosecute this war sit still and see by rome upon thy country's liberty such heavy yoaks impos'd canst thou my son tamely desist from what thou hast begun and see that wealth which from so many lands by our great ancestours victorious hands together heap'd enabled thee to spread thy conqu'ring ensigns o're pyrene head and o're the pathless alps to make thy way become the prize of rome yet thou that day survive at length awake and let me finde thy valour fierce and active as the winde on adriatick seas
let not the tears of trembling mothers or the vainer fears of utter ruin move thee to conspire so much with hanno wish or rome desire
that hannibal should now sit still is more then all the victories they had before those onely did subdue thine arms but this over thy minde a greater conquest is and all that scipio now at rome doth boast where he at zama when the field was lost thee flying shews and afterward regains and thy pale image loads with golden chains as he great syphax led in triumph thou resolving thus to bear it dost allow

nor will the world condemn what hanno saies

while in the senate he upon thee layes the crimes of all these ills records the we once perform'd to hecatè excites the people's while he doth on them call where now is your victorious hannibal where is that arm that could alone defend these walls that durst with fate it self contend where are sagunthus spoils or those which he from spain hath brought or conquer'd italy if yet that arm survive let him from rome rescue our captiv'd sons and bring them home
or if those spoils which he at thrasimen trebia or cannae gain'd remain why then do we for our exacted talents grieve nor rather with that wealth our selves relieve but if consum'd through his ambition we have with our riches lost our liberty why should that guilty head to whom we ow these ruins and the curse of all our wo amongst us still remain and with a pride

great as the conquerours our tears divide

consider this and as infused oil doth heighten flames hence let thy fury boil create more spleen within thee make thee rude as caucasus till thou hast fully shew'd th amazed world thou wert not born to bear the romane yoak
but do what others dare not think and gainst the latine name where're there shall be war do thou in arms appear till fate absolve thy vow and thou shalt be crown'd with a noble death or victory
when thus the fury had her self inspir'd into his soul with night she strait retir'd

to hell
while he now void of all repose

soon as from tithon bed aurora rose to that fam'd stygian temple doth repair where when a childe his father made him swear the war
soon as he comes into the grove strange horrid murmurs round about him move
the goddess call'd to minde what he before had offer'd there and now expected more
then over all the place a cloud she casts which thither calls the night again and blasts the rising day
at length she open throws the while on he fearless goes till at the entrance from her gloomy cell the aged priestess thus bespeaks him
tell what is it that so early hither thee invites and who thou art for well see thou com'st to offer to the pow'rs below and therefore with this horrour they foreshow thy welcome tell me then what is thy name though now thou know'st me not i'me sure my fame said hannibal long since hath fill'd thine ears
am that hannibal who e're my years two lustra had fulfill'd a war before these stygian altars gainst the romans swore the rest the world hath told thee and now in prosecution of that sacred vow am come to know what yet remains by me to be pursu'd and what the fates decree
the priestess thus
know thee now nor can the universe afford another man more dear unto the pow'rs which we adore but we our rites cannot perform before the following night hath finish'd half her reign
now therefore to thy house make haste again

and my advice embrace
for often wo

have of the gods enquir'd concerning thee whose thread of life is twisted with the fate of carthage and in that her better state consists and hence it is imperious rome by her embassadours who now are come will not so much for masanissa plead as joyn with hanno to obtain thy head or cast thee into chains therefore till night returns be wary and prepare for flight and when bootes hath his lazy wain turn'd half about the pole hither again repair and shall then enquire the minde o'th gods and what they have for thee design'd
pensive with this advice strait home he goes and ruminating on his country's woes his chamber enters with a troubl'd face when almost drown'd in tears to his embrace imilcè flys and thus begins what now thy minde disturbs what on thy angry brow creates that cloud which wheresoe're it be discharg'd my hannibal must ruin me
know tis war for such the dire alarms of lost sagunthus snatch'd hee from mine arms
so from my bed before the night was done to meet their sallies thou wert wont to run
while fury arm'd thee and pale death did wait upon thee as upon the hand of fate
but then thou wert protected heav'n did then for thee and carthage fight if now agen the gods would hear our pray'rs and bless thee so how gladly would yield to let thee go but they alass are angry and no more will lend their thunder as they did before

unto thine arm
rome now their ears hath charm'd

against thee and thy fortune quite disarm'd
naked against the world thou now dost stand all have submitted to her conqu'ring hand
carthage is hers nor libya nor spain pyrenè nor the celtae can again

afford thee aid

the macedonian king

who to our fainting hopes appear'd to bring some shadows of relief while he o'reran the bounds of athens and a war began with that sad omen that sagunthus turn'd

to ashes and the

abydenians burn'd

on pyles of their own wealth is forc'd at last to yield to fortune and himself to cast a prostrate at rome feet and peace implore
content with those great acts that he before had done he now resolves at home t'attend his fate and would my hannibal now lend a pity to these tears thou should'st no more that hand of fortune try which thee before in one day thrust from that great height to which the toil of seventeen years had rais'd thee
rich in fame thou art and though all else is gone that's such a treasure that for it alone the world may envy thee and times to come shall put thy name in balance against rome and all her generals
but what of life after such deeds remains unto thy wife and son should be allow'd and if thy breast with thoughts of sworn revenge be still possest since fortune courts the young and thou art now in years to which she seldom doth allow her smiles derive thine anger to thy son instruct him here at home what's to be done

to perfect thy desires and at thy death

into his breast with thy departing breath

inspire my hannibal thy mighty spirit

that so he may entirely thee inherit and live the fear of rome
but if thou fly from hence and leave us to the cruelty of our insulting foes our captiv'd names will strait become the talk of romane dames midst their triumphal feasts or be in scorn suppress'd as if we never had been born
this with a thousand sighs and all the charms of kisses mix'd with tears between his arms speaking she sinks while with that constant face with which he entred in a strict embrace he holds her up and thus replies thy love my dear imilcè is so much above the value of my life that would all those dangers stand which can upon me fall enjoy thee here but this our enemies will not allow
domestick treacheries have now so far above the arms of rome prevail'd that a captive shall at home in peace be made and hence in chains be born snatch'd from thy dear embrace to be the scorn

of second triumphs and when that is done

a pride peculiar unto rome alone shall not dy like syphax from the view of all the world but they will something new for me invent
whatever was by us before inflicted on their regulus will be esteem'd too little shall be in parts divided through all italy and feel in each a death and yet not all their malice satiate when to minde they call

the fun'rals of their friends
but that may

their plots avoid and keep a better way still open to my fall now must fly m'ingrateful country or resolve to dy this day before thine eyes for in this hand of mine alone my fate shall ever stand
nor shall the world believe the life and death of hannibal depends upon the breath of rome
as this he spake she stop'd the rest with kisses and reclining on his brest her drooping head whil'st tears like april into his bosom flow by sighs again dry'd up since so it is said she no more will my hannibal thy stay implore
go and be happy may those gods who thee with such severity deny to me protect thee when alone go happy may thy wish'd return be speedy but pray for what cannot hope those gods who now us separate alass will not allow that we should meet again
as from her tongue these last words fell about his neck she flung her arms and after many kisses past while both contended who should give the last with a long silence for with grief each heart too big for language swell'd at length they part
now night the middle of her course had run between the rising and the falling sun when libya anxious champion at the fane all things prepar'd for flight arrives again there findes the priestess from her hoary head tresses like curling serpents overspread her wrinckled neck a mantle cross her breast in which forsaken dido death exprest

by her fair sister's hand and there bequeath'd

as sacred with the sword she frantick sheath'd in her own bosom fastn'd by a charm on her left shoulder and her other arm quite naked waving round a stygian wand with which by adding words she could command the pow'rs of hell she meets him at the door and leads him in
the sacrifice before prepar'd and she no minutes now delay'd invoking some infernal names to aid the work strait horrid voices rend the air some mornful groans some sighs of sad despair then as if hell were near the noise of chains with doleful cries which their inflicted pains extort
for all the ghosts of cadmus race whom guilt had stain'd frequenting still the place to the altars brought supplies of bloodlike flames which of themselves to rise appear and by their gloomy light and smell of sulphur shew that they were brought from hell
at length the sacrifice was open lay'd whose entrails when the priestess had survay'd she thus the gods declar'd
if hannibal be from his country free he never shall become a slave to rome
his very name shall make the syrian armies own'd by fame and italy once more shall fear lest she by his invasive arms should ruin'd be
scipio shall not more fortunate at rome by th world be held then hannibal at home
one year shall give a period to their breath and each finde satisfaction in his death
in latian ground shall scipio ashes ly on libyssaean hannibal shall dy

with this ambiguous oracle his minde

as great and high as when he first design'd the war as if the gods were still the same away he speeds thoughts of his former fame and victories all present fears allay and with reviving hopes his faith betray to a vain confidence that he alone if arm'd could shake the world and rome unthrone
ambition and revenge think nought too great for their attempt and whil'st he doth repeat the actions which atchiev'd his former fame he counts all easy that's within his aim nor weighs th incertainty of fates to come
those civil factions that before at home weak'ned his arms now undistinguish'd groan under that yoke which rome for him alone so long prepar'd so that ev'n he might boast a victory when envious carthage lost her liberty and captiv'd hanno found no other hand could cure that fatal wound but hannibal alone who now got free would search the world to finde a remedy
thus chearful with the gods misunderstood as a fierce tyger thirsting after blood far from his covert rangeth seeking prey o're the vocanian plains he took his way and through the thapsian fields his course pursu'd where still the gods resolving to delude his thoughts with dubious things he waking dreams of future fates and swiftly posting seems this language from the genius of the place to hear
fly hence fly hannibal apace
let asia no longer now attend thine arm the world's great quarrel to defend

delay the mother is of doubts and fears

and he that long the yoke of bondage bears forgets that he was free and entertains a servile love of safety with his chains
thy presence shall encrease the noble fire in syrian breasts and they at length conspire gainst rome with thee and carthage entertain an hope by thee her freedom to regain
that war which thou didst with so great applause wage as thine own is made the common cause of the whole world and all mankinde is now provok'd to be assertours of thy vow
of blood all seas all lands shall taste

and

thapsus mong the chief in fame be plac't

no sooner did the blushes of the morn the stars extinguish and the day was born when they arriv'd near to that fatal shore where trembling seamen hear the billows roar

against those syrts which moving to and fro

bring certain ruin wheresoe're they go
charybdis nor dire scylla rage so great a danger to sicilian vessels threat sometimes themselves above the waves they heave and stand like promontories to deceive unskilful mariners strait falling back choak up the chanel and prepare a wrack under smooth waters where with all their pride display'd tall ships of late might safely ride
but hannibal less fears the treach'rous sand or raging seas then the more treach'rous land which confident of better fate he quits and to a little bark himself commits
the seas as conscious that he was too great to be their sacrifice their rage forget

the syrts retire and the conspiring gales

pursue the bark and swell her pregnant sails
the careful pilot for cercîna steers scarce knowing that the fraight his vessel bears once balanc'd the whole world yet wonders heav'n in that tempestuous track a course so ev'n allow'd so much the flatt'ring destinies with a smooth vizor of success disguise intended ruin that ev'n hannibal measures from hence what ever might befal himself and while they yet the africk shore on which the fates resolv'd henever more should tread in view retain'd now am free perfidious country both from rome and thee my better fortune now saith he doth stand not in a senate vote but in this hand this hand which maugre thy ingratitude shall thee if me the gods do not delude redeem and thou at length confess that none can breake thy yoke but hannibal alone
now from the flying ship the land withdrew the libyan shore descends no more in view those altars which vlysses once did rear to rescue his forgetful friends appear
unhappy men who in those dang'rous fields

found out those strange delights that

lotus yields

whose taste all other pleasures far exceeds man nothing more to make him happy needs in this all dear delights at once they found and memory of friends and country drown'd
no sooner these were lost but to their eyes cercîna midst the waves began to rise
approaching near the port some ships they found whose carthaginian owners homeward bound

soon as the prince they spy'd upon the shore

haste to salute him and almost adore
the memory of his high deeds within their breasts still liv'd how great he once had been to minde they call and pay unto his name those honours which they know his merits claim though now his state be less for with a cloud o'recast or else eclips'd the sun allow'd to be the same in virtue as before when it shin'd brightest nor was he the more to be neglected cause the borrow'd rays of train at which the common people gaze and great with envy swell aside are lay'd
he still is that fam'd hannibal who made so many barb'rous nations to submit to his commands and native rites forget while fierce massylians with iberians stood in fight revengers each of others blood while rude cantabrians with the celtae came assert his quarrel and beneath his name united liv'd as if one clime their birth had giv'n and nurtur'd them on fertile earth
here all are busy to express their care to entertain him and to such as were inquisitive to know what did invite him thither cunning he reply'd might indeed have gone to tyre another way but none so near judg since this day must in sacrifice to th pow'rs above that what there must prosecute may prove propitious to the state which thither me hath sent and since within this island we few trees for shelter finde let me entreat your sails this day to shroud us from the heat

o'th'scorching sun
no sooner said but all

their hands employ some from the masts let fall the sails some lift them with their yards to land on which extended streight for tents they stand
and now whatever rare the isle affords makes up the feast and round the hast'ned boards lyaeus flows and first to liberty a bowl is crown'd which all as greedily quaff off as if in it they thought to finde their wish and sense of bondage from the minde expel
and as the sparkling liquour warms their blood each man as if he were in arms defies the pow'r of rome now scorns to bear that yoak which in a sober mind his fear would prompt him to imbrace and what before he durst not think he now dares act and more
all former fears are banish'd this exclaims gainst hanno pride and that his countrey blames for want of courage bids the prince again attempt to take away that fatal stain for which as in th inflaming juice he steeps his brains he in a drunken pity weeps
but hannibal whose thoughts were far from thence remov'd and entertain'd a nobler sense of what they suffer'd then themselves mean while looks on their follies with a scornful smile and with repeated cups still feeds the flame untill as he design'd he overcame their strength and while their hands as yet retain'd the blushing bowls sleep all their senses chain'd

a continuation of silius italicus to the death of hannibal the second book

the argument
to hannibal isalces doth relate king masanissa love and the sad fate of sophonisba
rome dreads the report of a new war
in the ephesian court scipio and hannibal are entertain'd and meet as friends
the city temple and its wealth describ'd
great alexander deeds eumolpus sings
whence a discourse proceeds who the best captains past actions are revolv'd
the king resolves upon a war

while thus pretended piety beguiles the vulgar and the glad deceiver smiles at the success secure that none could bear the tidings of his flight before the fear of being stop'd was past to sea again he hastens hoises sail while yet the reign

of night continu'd and the

tyrian star

lent faithful beams to guide the mariner and as well pleas'd with what had past his friends discours'd how much their mirth had made amends for all delays his sure numidian guide who once attended on great syphax bride began
but he inspir'd above the rest to me appear'd who did so much detest and scorn their names who through a shameful dread of dying had submitted to be led in triumph and in chains before they dy'd had tamely sacrific'd unto the pride of roman conqu'rours
how he did declame for this gainst syphax how adore the name of noble sophonisba who did bear a face as chearful as carry here said he and to avoid that shame was seen to drink her death and fall a glorious queen
well observ'd his zeal and confess reply'd great hannibal could little less then weep at mention of so dear a name
but since we onely have by common fame her story heard and you a witness of all that past to us her fate declare
then he
when syphax was o'rethrown and all numidia lost through his unhappy fall false masanissa less ambitiously aspir'd unto his empire then to be successour in his bed and when had gain'd the queen into his pow'r the king enchain'd and kept a trophy to young scipio pride impatient till enjoy'd so fair a bride his minde he thus discovers if the throne of syphax or numidia wealth alone

had been the object of mine arms now

whate're the gods or fortune could allow to my desires possess'd but know my aim fair queen is higher and a nobler flame reigns in my breast the romane general may this perchance an happy conquest call because his eagles now securely fly o're the numidian plains
but nothing have gain'd though this late victory restore whatever syphax did from me before usurp though hammon and tarpeian iove conspire to make me great unless your love this happiness confirm
for this did from libya to the romane ensigns fly knowing no other means to win you from

my rival's arms and since he is by rome thrown from that glorious height and can no more be worthy held of what he did before in you enjoy since none but he that wears a crown and in his hand a scepter bears can merit such a bliss that you may live a queen and what lost carthage cannot give nor sophonisba take but from my hand be still ador'd through the numidian land
accept my love by which you can alone shun romane chains and still possess a throne
to this the queen though an extream disdain of what he offer'd in her soul did reign fearing to be a spectacle at rome more then to dy replies
tis to presume too much upon your victory if you imagine it as easy to subdue this heart as late our arms and though by force you have already made a sad divorce

yet know the memory of syphax name

will in this breast admit no other flame while he survives
but rather then be led to rome in triumph confess the bed of any born of libyan blood may be prefer'd yet if the adverse fates decree that to avoid that shame must the crime of hasty nuptials add a little time me thinks you ought in justice to allow to expiate with tears my former vow
with this reply which neither gave assent to his demand nor yet deny'd her tent he quits advising her to shun delays in her resolve for that e're many days should pass the captives must be sent to rome and her consent would then too tardy come
at these last words as when our libyan darts a tygress strike at first amaz'd she starts and growling stands but when the wounding steel is deeply fix'd and she begins to feel the anguish of a wound she rends the air with cries and lab'ring with her teeth to tare the weapons forth augments her pain then flies to some known covert and there raving dies
struck to the heart as if she then had seen the gorgon head or like amphîon queen congeal'd to marble she stands a while and silent weeps
at length her hands invade her head from which she frantick tears the lovely hair and furiously impairs the beauty of that face which by two kings had been ador'd
at last her self she flings upon her bed and with a mournful cry on her dear syphax calls
which hearing

stept in and found her turning to and fro

her eyes now dry and fir'd with anger so when pentheus scorn'd the trieterick feast agave looks her inward rage exprest
amaz'd a while silent stood till she sighs making way for words at length to me her speech directs
tis not because uncrown'd isalces that grieve a deeper wound my soul afflicts and am wrack'd between two dire extreams
oh had never seen numidia court or had ne're been led by hymen tapers to my syphax bed the world perhaps had never heard that one born of great hasdrubal was from a throne to rome a captive led but must now oh cruel fate renounce my nuptial vow to yield up what my lord esteem'd above numidia throne the treasure of my love to masanissa and in his embrace those sacred ties dissolve or in the face of rome the greatest trophy of the war exposed be and the triumphal car of the proud conquerour in chains attend
ye gods what greater mischief can ye send upon this head your thunder cannot give a blow so fatal if you let me live to see that day
as thus she spake her eyes with sudden streams of tears her tongue surprize
when perceiv'd that masanissa flame though yet an enemy was still the same he had before profess'd hoping the charms of such a beauty might regain his arms to carthage as they syphax had withdrawn from romane leagues after a solemn pawn

of faith before the gods thus begun

had heav'n left any other means to shun the pow'r of rome and that prodigious shame which proudly they on all of tyrian name inflict should resolve whate're it be to share your fortune
but since now you see the conquerour your captive is you may redeem your self and give a better day to your lost country
twas for this alone hasdrubal plac'd you on numidia throne the cause is still the same nor is't a crime which fate necessitates and which in time you may a signal piety avow to all the world
ev'n syphax will allow it such and dy content if you restore entire to libya what she lost before
perswaded thus as when a findes nothing but certain ruin from the windes which on the ocean storm resolv'd no more to trust their fury for neighb'ring shore he steers and to secure himself doth choose upon a sand the lab'ring bark to loose so from rome rage the queen resolves to throw her self for safety on a gentler fo who now approach'd while she puts on a face might move his pity and a god's embrace
so when her memnon dy'd aurora threw over her rosy cheeks a veil of dew through which dissolving chrystal from her eyes day did more sadly yet more fragrant rise
soon as he entred prostrate at his feet she falls and thus now sues his love to meet
if my distracted piety did swell too high if what utter'd did not well

beseem a captive mighty prince here

beseech you pardon me not wont to bear so weighty griefs and since th immortal gods above my syphax fate on you these odds due to your valour and good fortune have bestow'd whatever be my doom crave it may proceed from you
and as you are a king and with my lord did lately share in the numidian name let me not be expos'd to any roman proud decree
as am onely wife to syphax would rather any libyan mercy try then trust a stranger
but withall you know what a carthaginian daughter to great hasdrubal may from a roman fear
if then no other remedy appear within your pow'r here beseech you still by death to free me from the romans will
scarce this with all allurements that could move at once the conqu'rour's pity and his love she had declar'd when he wipes off her tears with fervent kisses and her future fears allays with promise to preserve her free from roman hands
but pleads necessity to be secure that night to consummate their nuptial rites
unwillingly to fate and his desires she yields and at the time her doubtful heart as conscious of a crime calls back her blood then sends it forth again into her cheeks so shines a scarlet stain on ivory asham'd to have it said one day a captive her and bride had made
and now the weary horses of the sun to the tartessiack shore their course had run

when masanissa with all sacred rites

the presence of the marriage god invites
but no good omen shew'd him to be there the fire the incense flies the altars are smooth'rd in stygian smoak a dreadful sound through all the temple runs and shakes the ground· and as from thence into their chamber they retire the holy tapers all the way with sputt'ring flames as if alecto shed sulphure upon them lead them to their bed
all this intent upon his mistress eyes he either did not see or did despise
concluding what he should enjoy would all those miseries that could befal before this fatal night was spent
the fame of masanissa hasty nuptials came to scipio ear he fearing to give way to such a growing mischief soon as day had chas'd away the stars by laelius sends a summons and thus sharply reprehends his levity
tis my belief said he that when we first contracted amity in spain and then in africa when thou didst both thy self and all those hopes which now thou callst thine own to me commit that then something in me thou did'st bove other men worthy that trust conceive
but in none of all these virtues that did prompt thee on to seek my friendship more of glory plac't then in my temperance that with a chast and sober minde could suppress the flame of hottest lust and this then did aim to other thy rare virtues might be joyn'd
for trust me noble prince we cannot finde

so much of danger from our armed foes

as from those stronger pleasures that enclose us round and whotsoer'e repells their dire assaults and can by temp'rance his desire within himself subdue a victory of greater honour gains then that which we o're syphax have obtain'd
those noble things which thou with valour worthy greatest kings hast in my absence done did of late to all of name in arms commemorate with all due praise and still shall keep in minde
but had rather thou on what's behinde would'st with thy self reflect then blush to hear me give't a name
it plainly doth appear to all the world that syphax was or'ethrown and captiv'd by the auspicies alone o'th roman people
whatsoever he possess'd his kingdom wife and people we may challenge as our prize and none a share of right can claim
though sophonisba were no carthaginian born or did not we her father gen'ral of their armies see yet must she who a king that was our friend an enemy hath made and in the end against us drawn to arms be sent to rome and there the senate and the people's doom attend
strive therefore to subdue thy minde shake this lewd passion off so much inclin'd to draw thee into ruin nor the grace of all thy virtues with one vice deface nor by one crime deprive thy self of all those thanks at rome for which thy merits call
struck to the heart as if some sudden flame were darted through his blood the fire of shame

flies to his face yet nothing he replies

but strait retires with sighs and swelling eyes and knowing that what scipio had decreed must stand irrevocable sends with speed for me and with a box into my hand a fatal poison puts with this command bear this to my dear sophonisba say that masanissa was resolv'd to pay that faith to her which kindest husbands ow to their dear wives
but since the fates have so decreed that they now countermand his will to whom it is subjected he is still resolv'd his second promise firm shall stand and that alive into a roman hand she may not fall advise that with her drink she intermix this poison
bid her think upon the general her father and her country think how once she did command the hearts of two great kings to whom sh'hath been in marriage joyn'd and let her dy a queen
the baneful drug to my dear mistress with this harsh message brought
prepar'd to dy and with undaunted minde the worst to bear that fate could add she with attentive ear listn'd to what said and as she took in her fair hand the poison with a look moor chearful then when she a bride was made to masanissa accept she said his nuptial present nor is it to me at all unwelcome since my husband he can nothing greater on his wife bestow but yet withall pri'thee let him know that sophonisba would more pleas'd have dy'd if at her death she had not been his bride

for then my country might upon my tomb

have writ that thus triumph'd over rome
no sooner spoke but to her lips she joyn'd the deadly cup and greedy there to finde a speedy death swallows it all and while we trembling stand about her with a smile which made her lovely ev'n in death her heart recalling now the blood from ev'ry part to its relief she sinks and as she lies upon her couch gives one great sigh and dies
as the numidian this sad story told the day began to rise
they now behold the tyrian coast by which they steer unto that city whence the carthaginians drew their fam'd original when dido from her brother fled
receiv'd as if at home with all the joy that could express the pride they had conceiv'd in being near ally'd to that great hannibal who late the fear of all the world had been when he had there himself refresh'd again he hoists his sails for antioch from thence with prosp'rous gales at ephesus arriv'd where glad to finde the syrian king who with a dubious minde his hate conceiv'd against the roman name pursu'd at length he fix'd and by his fame in arms appearing like a martial star guided his wand'ring thoughts into a war
and now o're all the syrian cities fame her lofty head had rais'd and with the name of hannibal awak'd the god of war when strait the sev'ral nations which from far their tribute to the syrian crown did bring

and gave the title

great unto their king

fly into arms and to th ephesian court

the princes and embassadours resort
all promise aid secure that he was come to stand a bulwark gainst the force of rome and asian tow'rs defend with greater odds then all their arms or tutelary gods
all his great merits plead and fondly raise the value of his virtues with their praise
no errours are allow'd in all that he hath done
so little do the vulgar see a fault where they affect or know to state the reasons of their sudden love or hate
carthage though now in chains unpiti'd stands the gods are prais'd that her ingrateful hands he had escap'd
for his late overthrow and fight they cast not on the publick fo but treachery as not the crime of fortune but the envy of the time
envy which still detracts from greatest deeds and on the ruins of the virtuous feeds which first against the god's rebellious wars had rais'd and made the giants storm the stars
she honour still pursues wheree're it goes wheree're it treads she stygian poison throws that its fair quickly doth deface and raiseth her own trophies in its place
with this applause the court and city ring
some invocate the gods others the king importune to the war
then strait their bands they list and levy troops in sev'ral lands
nor were those aids to syrian bounds confin'd but names and nations to their arms were joyn'd

who when the strength of rome was greater far

the fates decreed should in a

future war

her pow'r though back'd by all the world restrain

and with a consul blood her eagles stain
with those the medes who ev'n on conqu'ring foes their manners and their habit did impose

from whom the persians first tiaras wore

and falling prostrate did their kings adore whose mighty monarchs their imperial throne had fix'd upon the walls of babylon till weak'ned with delights that empire which

a woman rais'd to so admir'd a pitch

by men less valiant lost the prize became of the pellaean youth and crown'd his name
and as if all that asia could prepare where hannibal appear'd too little were attend his fate as if the earth alone too narrow were for him to fight upon
though europe gave her aids and warlike thrace must'ring her chariots did the war embrace cilician and phoenician ports are throng'd with ships for war and those where hero long'd so oft to see laeander from the seas rising like hesp'rus when he sought to please the paphian queen untill returning day reviv'd her fears and call'd her love away
but when the rumour of so great a war so many nations joyn'd though distant far touch'd the italian coast as swift as thought to rome it flies and soon as thither brought fear through all quarters runs in sev'ral shapes affrights their mindes commits a thousand rapes upon their sense and greater prodigies then all before abused fancy sees what ever did portend their former ills seems now again to fright the world and fills

the people's ears
sometimes the alps are said

to tremble while trinacrian flames invade th italian shore as if from aetna womb th infernal gods themselves had threatned rome
etrurian augurs strait consulted are and from these vain reports divine a war while nature sporting to confirm their fears makes lions bring forth lambs and wolves teem bears
then as if carthage had her chains again thrown off and arming her revenge with spain the boii celtae and those nations all that rome had reason still her foes to call did italy invade the roman dames run to the temples and with holy flames the altars crown and thus to heav'n complain
if these our walls yet merit to remain great father iove if sybil prophecies shall be confirm'd and thou dost not despise tarpeian tow'rs ah then why should not we after so many wounds and toils be free was rome exalted to so high a state through so much blood that she might be to fate a richer sacrifice and must she fall by none but by the hand of hannibal rather to those her walls her pow'r confine and with the tarquins let porsenna joyn or to the rage of senones or flames of brennus give us up
let not those names that with such valour have your temples· here so oft preserv'd and were esteem'd so dear to heav'n be now made victims to the hate of one proud man who to accelerate our ruin hath disturb'd the peace of all the world
if fates decree that rome must fall

give her a fo whose virtues may exceed

her own and let our crimes and vices bleed by a more pious hand such as from blame may free your justice with a better name
he perjur'd from those holy altars flies where peace was sworn and doth that league despise which in the name of all the gods was sign'd and now his arms hath with a people joyn'd where we that fate which he at capua found shall undergo where vices will abound as victories encrease and we shall be lost by our triumphs in their luxury

thus will perfidious carthage not by arms

see her revenge on us but asia charms
mean while great scipio who their former fears had drown'd in carthaginian mothers tears whom heav'n to balance hannibal to rome had lent and in his hand had plac'd the doom of all the world with gales from the italian shore to asia sails explore the king's intent
at length he came to that fam'd city where diana name in a fair temple more devotion moves

with gentile rites the

thoantéan groves

no weeping mother here to heav'n complains while her son's blood the cruel altar stains
but the bright goddess under silver shrines as pleas'd appears as when her brother joyns with full reflected beams her radiant horns and more then all the stars the night adorns
in a large plain through which maeander brings his winding waters in a thousand rings to the myrtôan main the city stands first built they say by amazonian bands

that from thermodo~on with shields

victorious march'd through the trachéan fields commanded by an oracle before to build a city where a fish and boar should dying shew the place fate was their guide this way where sitting on the ground they spy'd some busily employ'd their living prey to broil late taken from th adjoyning sea
when strait a fish throws with a sudden leap a burning coal upon a neighb'ring heap of straw which turn'd to flame a sleeping boar beneath it they beheld
earth none before more terrible had bred as big as that which both diana and althaea hate

on meleager drew
but this was there

with better omen found instruct them where the goddess would on earth most pleas'd abide and make fam'd ephesus great asia pride
they all amaz'd his weighty bulk admire and as he grunting starteth from the fire a ready hand a jav'lin throws which in his shoulder fix'd as he arose a deadly wound
but yet awhile he fled and they with shouts pursu'd till falling dead the oracle was by his death fulfill'd and they their city there resolv'd to build
now do the sacred ploughs the walls design and to the stars the lofty turrets joyn their shining tops
the goddess to renown and to immortalize their labours down

from heav'n her

image sent which with it more

of riches brought then if another show'r like that of danâe iove powr'd again upon the place or if to silver rain

the very stars dissolv'd
for soon as fame

the presence of the goddess and her name through asia had divulg'd devotion brings from ganges and hydaspes greatest kings who sweetest spices which their fields adorn cull'd from the bosom of the rising morn with gold and ivory devoutly lay upon her shrine and as their tribute pay all treasures that the womb of asian earth enrich all that the seres at the birth of day could gather from their silken trees what the sabaean or arabian sees dropping from fragrant boughs with whatsoe're from shining rocks or shells the indians bare to eastern kings into the sacred fane are heap'd which now no longer can contain its wealth
and therefore they a work begun then which the rising nor the falling sun none greater view'd whose structure did excell what ever fame of babylon doth tell or pharian pyramids which by one age could not accomplish'd be but did engage succeeding kings who in that work alone employ'd the riches of the syrian throne and puzzled art to finde out waies to show their pious bounty
there as white as snow tall polish'd alablaster pillars shine as purest emblems of that pow'r divine was there ador'd upon whose carved heads an ebon roof the curious builder spreads
this like black night hung or'e the place untill myriads of silver stars the frame did fill and to express her empire in the skies with a full orb a crystal moon did rise

through this as mother to succeeding day

clear light flow'd in and did at large display the temple's glory
there you might behold high altars not adorn'd but built with gold
the hearths were of the bright pyropus made whose flames the sacrifices on them lay'd seem'd of themselves to burn all other fire as vanquish'd by their lustre to retire all gems thus were or beautiful or rare as if their native quarries had been there in greatest plenty shine in ev'ry part so plac'd their value is encreas'd by art their lively figures as exactly stand compos'd of sev'ral stones as if the hand of some rare painter to express his skill in colours did the walls and pavement fill
through a large plain of em'rads with her crue of cretan nymphs diana doth pursue the flying game their arms and shoulders bare their tyrian vests tuck'd to their knees their hair in lovely tresses yet neglected flows upon their backs some arm'd with golden bows some carry darts some spears whose points insteed of steel with diamonds make the beasts to bleed
this wounds a panther that a tyger this a lion kills not any hand doth miss the beast at which it aims and thus with chase of various kindes they beautify the place
above the rest a secret chappel where the eunuch alone permitted were to enter did delight and terrour move
in a fair fountain shadow'd by a grove of varied agats made encompast round with naked nymphs the hart actaeon found

bright cynthia bathing bout her thighs

the purling waters play with fixed eyes at first he peeping stands behinde a tree but curious anon more near to see he farther steps and stepping is betrai'd by rusling leaves
startling the delian maid looks back and spying him anger and shame to be so seen at once her face enflame
as red she looks as when her brother's light

deni'd she doth

thessalian dames affright

and now her rage no longer will delay his fate but strait his form she takes away longer his head and ears upon his brow large horns his arms and thighs more slender grow no more erect but prone t'wards earth he goes in all a beast but yet alass he knows he is not what he was when strait the cry of his molossian hounds perswades to fly
the nymphs all laughing urge them to pursue the chase he flies they follow and in view pinch'd in the haunch to shew diana power he falls and they their master chang'd devour
here his two guests then which the world had none then greater seen whose presence more his throne renown'd then all the trophies he had gain'd the king with chearful welcom entertain'd and to their eyes as to invite his foes to a new conquest prodigally shews his empire's riches
for no king before that had the syrian scepter sway'd did more possess he was of all the richest heir that did great alexander trophies share and that vast wealth not onely kept entire but greater which his conquests did acquire

heap'd on his throne
as if to entertain

those famous heroes fortune did ordain that past and present ages should combine to yield their spoils and in that honour joyn
it was a day when to commemorate the king's nativity th ephesian state with annual rites their loyal joys exprest
the king as custom was a stately feast prepares the nobles all invited come and there the fates of carthage and of rome scipio and hannibal the banquet grace and now meet not to fight but to embrace
so when aenéas fled from ruin'd troy and sought a fore in conquest to enjoy met by tydîdes on th oenotrian shore they laid aside that fury which before reign'd in their breasts which xanthus yellow flood and the dardanian plains had stain'd with blood and with new friendship what they both had done in arms repeat since that sad war begun
they now are glad each others face to know each counts the other worthy such a fo whose constant courage nothing of success in war could heighten nor of loss depress
whose virtue in all fortunes was the same and ow'd its titles to no other name
who in pursuit of honour sought not to destroy a noble fo but to subdue
and when in arms would do what man could dare attempt and after victory would spare the conquer'd blood nor vainly sought to praise his own brave deeds and blast another's bays
such in th ephesian court these heroes shin'd and with as free and strict embraces joyn'd

their valiant hands as if nor trebia flood

nor cannae had been stain'd with roman blood by carthaginian swords nor hannibal so lately had beheld his countrie's fall in zama wounds
nor scipio his fate deprest upbraids nor hannibal his hate at stygian altars sworn discovers now
but sacred concord on each heroe's brow sits as enthron'd and over all the rest her wings display's inaugurate the feast
and now the face of mirth appears through all the court
th'invited in a spacious hall at iv'ry tables sit and richly there their senses feed with whatsoever rare the asian world affords
the seas the earth and air to gratulate so high a birth their choicest tribute send and all that art to heighten nature's bounty could impart was liberally employ'd
amaz'd to see the strange excess of syrian luxury soon cloy'd with diff'rent thoughts the heroes are affected and perpend the future war
the romans pleas'd to think how weak in fight those arms will prove which softned with delight all virtue so disarm'd how easily the roman swords their way to victory would finde where honour led them on and spoils so wealthy were the trophies of their toils
but hannibal more sadly thoughtful calls to minde the fate of capua and the falls of those brave libyan bands that had so far advanc'd his name till a more cruel war of ease and riot at effeminate boards their valour dull'd their conqu'ring swords

blasted those laurels that before had crown'd

their warlike brows and as in lethé drown'd all mem'ry of themselves in these soft charms so lost they quite forgot the use of arms
as thus they ruminate eumolpus brings his iv'ry lute and to the warbling strings accords his voice and chants in smoothest lays the king's descent and alexander praise
how first the horned god his libyan grove and sacred springs for fair olympia love forfook and how from that divine embrace small pella was by a celestial race renown'd and while descending to the earth mong other pow'rs divine assist his birth th ephesian goddess busyed wholly there kept not her famous temple in her care

an impious hand to build it self a name

with sacrilegious flames th admired frame destroy'd
but when lucina care had giv'n to earth a mighty conquerour to heav'n

a future deity and he began

to shew the world that he was more then man by his great deeds to his immortal name as humbly prostrate as to the bright flame of rising day th admiring persian bow'd
to him sabaeans and arabians vow'd their richest gums to him the parthians brought their bowes and conque'rd quivers fraught with fatal shafts him all from ganges shore to those that nile mysterious streams adore their lord obey'd and next the god of wine for wonders done acknowlegd'd as divine
but when he was for earth too mighty grown and summon'd hence to a celestial throne

heav'n that the syrian monarchy might stand

for ever firm into hand the sacred scepter gave
since none but he was worthy to succeed a deity who could himself subdue
an act that far transcends whatever can be done in war and man immortal makes
for who the force of beauty can withstand or can divorce love from his wounded breast may justly more of conquest boast then gods have done before
yet he when by expiring sighs he found those very eyes his pious son did wound that his own souls surpriz'd and that the name

of stratonîca had the hidden flame

reveal'd to shew how much a noble minde bove cupidinean shafts prevails resign'd into his arms his love and rescu'd from the hand of fate a race of kings to come
hence to our royal line this solemn day we consecrate and grateful honours pay
thus the iönian sung and as among the rest the lofty subject of his song the libyan applauds the romane thus to him began
though twixt the gods and us great is the difference yet virtue may raise men to those felicities which they in heav'n enjoy and none so worthy are of that high bliss as those whose name in war hath plac'd them here on earth above the rest of humane race
fate cannot such devest of immortality
for with applause the world adores them and obeys their laws
from these all arts and virtues that the minde of man enrich at first took birth and finde

their just rewards
for when immortal iove had fram'd the world though all the stars above in order plac'd and strugling nature saw all things created here her certain law and times obey yet guided by their will mankinde among themselves a chaos still retain'd
no bounds of justice to repress the hand of rapine vices in excess reign'd in all mindes the names of right and wrong unknown to all the virtuous were the strong
nor then did man to greater good aspire then what seem'd such suggested by desire
but lest a custom in licencious deeds the use of reason and celestial seeds should quite deprave that true promethean fire the breasts of some brave heroes did inspire those monsters to subdue and to compel the too licencious under laws to dwell the ill to punish and the good to crown with due rewards
hence honour and renown the mindes of mortals first from baser earth rais'd towards heav'n from whence they took their birth
but since lyaeus and alcides wars the world with trophies and the heav'n with stars adorn'd who tell me hath the greatest name in arms deserv'd and an immortal fame if such their praise if such their merits are the libyan replies no hand in war so worthy fame so mighty things hath done as the pellaean youth whose valour won more victories then time had years to crown his life allow'd the force of whose renown his laws on farthest nations did obtrude and kingdoms which he never saw subdu'd

for who that heard how great his conquests were

how small his force would not with reason fear compast round

those arms which persia

monarch

with troops so numerous that all the ground twixt tigris and euphrates scarce could yield them room to stand subdu'd in open field
scorning to fortune or to night to ow a victory he in full day the fo assails while god and men together stand spectatours of the wonders of his hand and see each macedonian souldiers bring a nation captivated to their king
but not to speak of battels where his skill and conduct all subjected to his will no town no city though the sea and land conspir'd against his force could him withstand

our tyrian walls alone the glory have

to have resisted well and that they gave a longer stand to th torrent of his rage then all the persian pow'rs that did engage against his arms
no object was above his courage whose example would remove all obstacles that others might deterr and though in great designs he would confer the best he follow'd his own thoughts alone and so made all his victories his own
and may he have the praise for none hath more in arms deserv'd perhaps no god before
next him that noble epirote that came to the tarentines aid the crown may claim
his courage when a youth pantauchus found above his strength though for his strength renown'd
while in two armies view as once before his mighty ancestour on xanthus shore

great hector slew he his proud fo subdu'd

and to the wondring macedonians shew'd all things that they had seen in former times

in their so glorious prince except his crimes

nor were his victories by arms alone where fortune more then virtue oft is known to give the bays
his wisdom conquest findes where his sword could not reach and or'e the mindes of men his triumph gains and thus he drew from romane leagues italian people to his side
they thought themselves more safe within his camp then they in fenced towns had bin under the romane laws
for he first taught that art and camps to their perfection brought
but if a third you seek who hath no less then these deserv'd though envious gods success deny'd me here me hannibal behold who with as early courage and as bold attempts a war against the romane name pursu'd and from the farthest gades came to seek a fo which future times might call most worthy to contend with hannibal
not soft sabaeans or arabians or a people that the rites and toils of war so little knew that charg'd with rich perfume more then with sweat or dust did more presume on numbers then their arms or such whose ease and lusts must prove the conquerour's disease and future ruin
through nations born in war and nurtur'd in it with a scorn of fate and fortune or'e pyrene o're the dreadful alps victorious ensigns bore
and found that fo with whom might contend with greater fame who boast that they descend

from mans himself and to the world no less

appear by their great valour and success

nor was it when some other citie's pride

with rome for empire strove and did divide their scatter'd force but when all italy her strength united to encounter me
shall not open those deep wounds again which then an enemy gave or stain our sacred mirth with mention of each flood whose streams ennobled were with latian blood shed there by me and still perhaps when am nam'd affrighted to their fountains fly i'le onely say more then three lustra there in spite of all the arts and arms that were employ'd against me victorious stai'd and after many towns and cities made my vassals and three valiant consuls fall shook iove himself within the capitol with terrour of my arms and had not rome by a base envy of my deeds at home more then by her own valour been reliev'd our carthaginian mothers had not griev'd to see their sons in chains but had by me been made what romans are at least been free
to this the roman with a smile replies
if thee the glory of thy victories with these immortal heroes thus hath joyn'd pri'thee say what place shall be assign'd to me who after through spain had fought my way and conqu'ring into libya brought the war the greatest of numidian kings subdu'd and captive made and on the wings of that fresh victory tow'rds carthage where but by thy hand alone they did despair

to be secur'd march'd on and in one day

took all thy former laurels quite away
tis true said hannibal but since the fate of virtue is to want an advocate if once deprest think me not vain when those merits plead that are transcended by thy fortune onely
had conquer'd thee the world no other conquerour but me had known ev'n those nam'd their place had lost in fame and rome the triumphs she doth boast
as thus they mutually their merits plead the sun began to hide his flaming head in the hesperian main and the opprest with mirth and wine the night invites to rest
to which when all retir'd the king whose heart was fix'd on war to hannibal apart thus breaks his last
should forget my honour hannibal if what as yet have consulted onely should now delay
the prosecution of thy vow is with my state involv'd and rome shall see tis not thy fortune we embrace but thee
that which through servile fear hath been deni'd by thine own carthage shall be here supply'd by me and since we know how various are the chances and events of dubious war why should we think the fates will favour more the romans now then they have thee before fortune assists the bold and whosoer'e attempteth coldly loseth by his fear
tis therefore now decreed no more shall rome on zama field and nabis fall presume we nations great as any she hath known the parthians medes admired babylon

already have subdu'd and warlike thrace where mars inhabits doth our laws embrace
my better fortune what thy fate hath crost shall give thee and redeem what thou hast lost
this said enjoy the benefits of night they both withdrew but nothing could invite the libyan prince to rest
his thoughts pursue his hop'd revenge and in themselves renew the promis'd war
impatient of delay he counts the minutes and desired day implores
as promis'd nuptials waking keep a longing lover and quite banish sleep untill enjoyment satiates his desire and both gives fuel and abates the fire

perfidiam fugiens infidi regis ad vmbras festinat stigias invictâ mente triumphans

a continuation of silius italicus to the death of hannibal
the third book

the argument
the syrian rome defies both scipio are by choice appointed to pursue the vvar
contagion wasts the roman navy while the syrian fleet's detain'd near venus isle by adverse vvinds
the syrian lords a shore vvith hannibal the cyprian rites explore
the vvinds again invite both fleets to sea
they meet and fight
the syrians lose the day
the libyan captain to bethynia flies vvhere to shun treason he by poison dies

but when the empire of the night was done and sleep the scepter yielded to the sun the ephesian peers as if the sprightful wine had rais'd in ev'ry breast a war combine with hannibal to shake off all delay to hasten on the fates and take away

their fears of peace and strait the syrian kings

defy proud minio to the romane brings

minio sublime in syrian blood then sway'd his master's counsels him the world obey'd nothing above him but the syrian throne he saw all things beneath it were his own
whatev'r was done whatever was design'd was not the king's but haughty minio minde
thus favour'd with high insolence he sold rewards of virtue all things uncontroul'd dispos'd
his greedy avarice supprest all thoughts of bounty in his master's brest the name of merit in that gulph was drown'd and as he pleas'd the suff'ring people found ease or oppression to such mischiefs may a single favorite kings and crowns betray
when he a period to the syrian pride and hopes of carthage as he then defi'd the pow'r of rome had vainly giv'n with rage which nothing but their ruin could asswage the romane prince to the myrtôan main descends and seeks italian shores again
soon as arriv'd the voice of war through all the city flies
the careful consuls call a frequent senate scipio repeats syria vain boast of pow'r and vainer threats of a proud favorite and how the name of hannibal their courage did enflame what aids by land and sea prepared were what carthage thence might hope what rome might fear all which in counsel weigh'd and war decreed twas hard to say what shoulders should succeed

to bear that burthen

scipio was then

debarr'd by law to take that charge agen

a name that so much virtue did include

that hannibal could never be subdu'd without its influence nor carthage cease to emulate rome triumphs and her peace

laelius great virtues through the world were fam'd

and where the noble scipio was not nam'd

deserv'd the bays
the younger

scipio known

more by his brother's actions then his own
desir'd to do as he had done before to vanquish kingdoms and by conquests more

then years to count his age
but some whom fear

of syria force and what cost rome so dear the name of hannibal then mov'd did stand for a more knowing and experienc'd hand
one whose great virtues by his deeds were known
supported by no merits but his own
and such was laelius held by land and sea for whom acilius this important plea assumes
if we rome safety seek and more then private names the publick peace adore whence fathers this dispute whence this delay why should we leave to fortune what we may prevent with reason when distempers are grown great the wise strong remedies prepare
let not those seeds of virtue that appear in younger breasts be valu'd at the fear

of publick ruin

we've already found

what mischief youth not by a single wound may through their heat produce and still do feel the anguish of those wounds the libyan steel through them inflicted which if now again torn open will ingeminate the pain
one errour all our former ills recals and brings the world against us to our walls

for rome alass can boast no strength of friends

abroad but what on her success depends
her virtue onely must her wealth defend her wisdom to employ it her best friend
then let not favour to a private name anticipate your reason
disclaim all envy to those honour'd heads that have enrich'd us with their trophies and that gave new titles to our fasti
may they live still glorious in them and all time survive
but let not us heav'n's blessings so confine as if entail'd upon a single line
our laws have so ordain'd that all that are deserving may in publick honours share
hence libyan some some gallick wreaths have crown'd by sev'ral lands are sev'ral names renown'd
our fathers still the burthen of the state impos'd on shoulders equal to the weight
the greatest heroes ever would contend when prudence more then fortune might commend their deeds
for though the great alcides kill'd serpents in's cradle yet till he was skill'd through many labours how his strength to guide

he never with the

libyan monster tri'd

his courage
let such honours be bestow'd when dangers in a less degree shall threaten us and when these forein storms cannot resist but exercise your arms
what skilful pilot by late tempest tost his vessel torn some sails and tackle lost while still the rude winds rage the billows roar though now he hath in view his native shore will idle too secure of safety stand and trust the helm to a less skilful hand

no let this senate wisdom so provide

that what we want of strength may be supply'd by conduct then if't be decreed the state shall suffer we may not be blam'd but fate
this said his silence a deep silence through the senate struck and on great scipio drew the eyes of all
in him it lay to turn

their choice to votes or fortune of the

urn

this did young scipio laelius that desire

as confident the senate would require

a man whose former actions might commend their choice and rome upon his care depend
after some pause and strugling twixt the names of dearest friend and brother while each claims in his divided soul an equal share thus africanus doth himself declare
should forbear to speak did not see grave fathers that your eyes are fix'd on me on whom a province lies more weighty far then was the burthen of the africk war for there rome fortune with mine own did joyn but this intestine conflict's wholly mine while for my blood l'gainst my soul contend distinguish'd twixt a brother and a friend
a friend whom rome may boast that he was born in her embrace whose virtues do adorn the present and the future age will bless
whom as my better genius confess ever entertain'd his counsels still pursu'd as oracles and never will my laelius from my soul divide
but now ev'n what acilius pleads will not allow that to his conduct we this war assign
this onely to our name the pow'rs divine

reserve
if greater wars shall threaten rome

the honour of command will best become my noble laelius and when war shall cease hee'l be her chiefest ornament in peace
though now the title great the syrian king assumes and to his aid all asia bring yet if the libyan captain be not there too mean a province that for laelius were
the gods their blessings as the stars bestow their influence on men and things below do sev'rally dispense
some fatal are to those that be the most renown'd in war yet by less warlike fall
not to repeat forein examples or to tell how great in arms ev'n by a woman cyrus fell
things nearer to us fathers may compell your wonder
after our best captains slain your scipio undertook the war in spain when scarce five lustra old and all those lands subdu'd where hannibal those dreadful bands amass'd that shook your walls
what since i've done becomes not me to speak whater'e won under your auspicies was the decree of heav'n should onely be atchiev'd by me
nor censure me as vain who arrogate so great a partage in the romane fate to say that where the libyans are your foes you must a scipio to their arms oppose
carthage will ever threaten these our walls

till heav'n our

name unto her ruin calls

then tis not that emulate my friend but for rome safety fathers contend and if the arguments of youth disswade your choice let my maturer age be made

the balance of your doubts my brother's years

mine own exceed when your greater fears allay'd with victory and that again you may the same assurance entertain me his make and fear no more those arms which subdu'd for you before
this said loud clamours with a full assent the temple shook and through the city went
thence through all italy the swift alarms of war excite the active youth to arms
no region from those hills whose frozen heads the stars invade to where blew neptune spreads his frothy arms about the rhegian walls their aid denies
the name of scipio calls the most luxurious from their choice delights and to meet dangers under him invites
all who their country all who honour love his ensigns seek to follow and to prove what fortune and the gods for them ordain
and now with num'rous ships the neighb'ring main oppress'd groans under their vast weight and feels the fate of carthage from their brasen keels
which oft as the rebellious billows rise dash them to pieces while the winde supplies with favourable blasts their swelling wings and to the asian coast the army brings
while rome for future triumphs thus provides envy the plague of courts not reason guides the syrian counsels
what the wise perswade the ignorant reject
the courtier's made the souldier's judg
what he concludes doth finde its influence upon the prince's minde
not all the mighty things which hannibal had done which rome ev'n trembled to recall

to memory could make his sense prevail

to quit the syrian kingdoms and assail

the fo at home
though whosoever so invaded is lends courage to his fo and strength to vanquish him
but strangely blinde to his own fall the syrian king's inclin'd rather on his own people all those ills to bring with which invasive fury fills a miserable land
and strait his fleet is order'd under hannibal to meet

the romane where

iônian billows move

about that island where the wife of iove was born and by the careful nymphs was bred till call'd by hymen to her brother's bed

she although conscious of the fates to come

retaining still her antient hate to rome

her empire of the air with

mischief fills

and on the neighb'ring isles sad plagues distills
th unhappy season with her wrath conspires twas when the dog breath'd his contagious fires on fainting men depriving beasts of food and turning into poison purest blood
th attracted air their entrails scorcheth fills their veins with flames and e're expired kills such hasty fates that time doth scarce know how twixt life and death his minutes to allow
while some whom decent piety invites t'interr their friends for their own funeral's rites prepare and strait from their departing breath infected fall and share a sudden death
the romane souldier whose great valour scorn'd to stoop to foes whose trophies had adorn'd his native house who ne're before had known to yield his arms now weak and feeble grown

let's fall his shield and conqu'ring sword and dies

ev'n in his arms disarm'd
this plague's surprize so sudden is that as the master stands to time with his loud voice the seamen's hands on his he prostrate falls before the word's exprest
extended at the oar the seaman in a lab'ring posture dies not known if dead or rowing as he lies
from this so fatal coast that did afford to death far greater triumphs then the sword the romane navy flying the disease retires and trusts their safety to the seas
but venus fearing lest saturnia hate from this might greater mischief propagate if then the syrian fleet should on them fall thus to her aid the god of winds doth call
great aeolus whose mighty empire lies o're all the vast extent beneath the skies assist me now
ask not that thou make earth tremble and the world's firm fabrick shake nor that her stony entrails thou so wide should'st rend that ghosts below may be descri'd nor that the seas as in the giant's wars thou hurl in wat'ry mountains gainst the stars
iuno for such revenge perhaps may call gainst us t'exalt her single hannibal
onely covet to preserve mine own and to effect the rest let fates alone
she when nor arms nor valour can prevail my race with hell and furies will assail
could she infect the place hold above she'd bring her plagues into the court of iove what's mine on earth her malice doth surround
thou see'st what gloomy vapours from the ground

she draws death hatching in their pregnant wombs

and threatning mischief to all's mine and rome scarse can my power my sacred isles defend

my cyprian my dear paphian temples tend

to ruin and our votaries for fear of dire contagion all our shrines forbear
no innocence is spar'd my birds that from aurora bosom to my lap would come and the refreshments of the choicest springs would billing scatter from their silver wings as to our sacred groves they would repair fall flying victims in the poisn'd air
but this thy power great aeölus can cure and what is now corrupted render pure
then purge infection from this ambient air make it serene and the lost health repair of this once happy clime and neighb'ring isles and thy reward with that she sweetly smiles shall be the fairest nymph of all my train
no sooner said for who can ought refrain when venus pleads but aeölus unbindes from their dark prisons the etesian windes whose active force not onely chas'd away all noxious clouds and mists and gave the day a wholsom face but with a constant gale against all labour of the oars prevail to keep the syrian fleet the more to please

the

cyprian goddess in her neighb'ring seas

twice twenty daies the idle ships before the island lay and anchor'd near the shore
when a desire to see the fam'd delights of cyprian groves the syrian lord's invites and hannibal to land
no place did more indulge to love or venus pow'r adore

the goddess this to all the world prefers

and is best pleas'd when mortals calls it hers all deities that can earth's wealth improve here pay their tribute to the queen of love
the medows flora the fields ceres fills with her rich plenty bacchus crowns the hills
the greedy swains no wealthy orchards rear for nature choicest fruits doth ev'ry where largely bestow the bounty of the soil gives all they can desire without their toil
all other pleasures which affection moves they finde most ample in their sacred groves
eternal shades of trees whose arms above embrace and roots beneath are making love no birds of prey upon the branches dwell or if they there frequent tis strange to tell how soon their cruel nature they forego and kindness to all other creatures show
all in their kinds are pair'd no bird alone no turtles by their mates deserted moan
nothing that mischief breeds can there be found
love onely hath the pow'r inflict a wound
from native grottoes that all art exceed their chrystal fountains sev'ral chanels feed with cooling streams which as they murm'ring pass still verdant keep the lover's seats of grass
all this survai'd their temple's sacred rites to wonder and devotion them invites
the chief was paphos which their senses charms above belief
the goddess there her arms her chariot harness'd doves and whatsoe're on earth she values keeps
her trophies here of such as gainst her pow'r rebell'd the gates adorn their names and fate the priest relates

a priest who yet five lustra had not seen

yet since he three had told her priest had been but must no longer at her altar stand or take the sacred censer in his hand when from his birth twice twenty years expir'd for youth is by the goddess most desir'd such all her votaries and clients are the aged seldom at her shrines appear
these view'd and past to a fair porch they came where miracles the deity proclaim
bodies to other things transform'd by love whose strange originals their change did prove some whose obdurate hearts had made them stone some beasts some birds some trees their figures none had lost but as when chang'd their shapes retain and monuments of her great pow'r remain
above the rest an iv'ry statue stands fair ev'n to wonder
hannibal demands what nymph it was of that celestial form to whom the priest replies
a soul did warm this iv'ry once
the storie's very strange yet this fair city and these walls the change attest
when first pygmalion in this isle arriv'd a votary to venus while our cyprian virgins such a freedom us'd that jealous lovers thought themselves abus'd he flying hymen to his house retires
but still retaining in his breast the fires of love his troubled fancy to divert this statue with more then promethean art he frames and as all parts he wondring views desires of hymen in his breast renews and venus thus invokes
give me he said for wife as beautiful and chast a maid

great goddess and if thou my pray'r wilt hear

a temple to thy name my race shall rear
no sooner said but th object of his love receives a soul and strait began to move
her eyes no more are fix'd but lively raies eject and first on her kinde maker gaze
then on her polish'd limbs which purple veins now warm and soften with their beauteous stains
in brief she lives pygmalion dearest flame and from their nuptial bed great paphos came
who when the fates the borrow'd soul again requir'd his iv'ry mother in this fane vow'd to the goddess plac'd and we still here with holy incense honour once a year
when this with other wonders they had seen

the

adyta they enter which within

no images adorn
but venus stood

alone and kept her altars free from

blood

they tears of myrrha onely offer there and sighs of lovers
the included air is ever warm and wheresoe're they turn they meet soft kisses but no lips discern
amaz'd the strangers stand though strangely pleas'd when them from wonder thus the priest releas'd

the goddess for this secret place alone

this miracle reserves thus made her own
when she her dear ascanius had convey'd up to cythêra and on violets lai'd the sleeping boy her aromatick show'rs of sweetest roses round about she pow'rs
then gazing on his face her former flame her lov'd adonis to her fancy came
scarce could she then withstand his beautie's charms scarce from his dear embrace refrain her arms

but fearing to disturb the boy's sweet rest

her lips upon the neighb'ring roses prest
they strait grow warm and from the place turn'd into kisses fly about her face
the goddess willing that the world should share so sweet a pleasure scatters through the air with a large hand the seed which as from fertile glebe arising breed
but the first born she plac'd within this fane which warm as now you feel them still remain
this said a sudden noise permits no more but summons them abruptly to the shore the wind came fair the busy seamen weigh their barbed anchors and stand off to sea
the time no longer stay will now afford the churlish masters hasten all aboard
torn from delight the syrian nobles are displeas'd and rather wish another war
but hannibal whose great heroick brest a nobler flame then that of love possest with as much joy the fetters of those charms shakes off as towns besieg'd from hostile arms themselves by sallies free and all the woes that threatned them revert upon their foes
honour which noble deeds in war attends exciting his great soul he first ascends his ship and offers to the god of seas warm entrails then at large his sails displaies
loud clamours from his high example through the fleet are spread whil'st all his course pursue
and now the land retires the cyprian shore is lost and all the flames which they before cherish'd are quite extinct in ev'ry breast wholly with thoughts of future war possest

a war wherein rome fortune stood alone

against the world and were there more then one might with them all contend
so great was she till lessen'd by her crims of victory
twice had the sun descended to the sea twice the wing'd hours had rais'd again the day
when they that coast where sida doth obtrude high rocks her strong defence against the rude assaults of raging billows made and there beheld what both their wonder and their fear at once creates
the seamen think they've lost their course and touch upon some coast
or nature from the bowels of the main some cyclas thrusts or floating grove again
but as they nearer came within that wood they saw for fight prepar'd an army stood so numerous they were that what before their wonder was is now their terrour more
their order such as when her borrow'd raies with growing horns the silver moon displaies
but her full glory their guilt brasen prows surpast and gave the morning as it rose a brighter face and where they made their way with a new light anticipate the day

the syrian

navy whether clog'd with fear

or their vast bulk though still they forward steer
went slowly on till hannibal so far advanc'd before that he provok'd the war
at his approach the romane souldiers fill the air with shouts that seem the winds to still and fright pamphylian nymphs while he goes on fearless as if his valour could alone with all their force contend
when a disdain to see him dare so much a rage more vain

creates in a brave rhodian who forsakes

his station and the combate undertakes
both ply their oars both seek to gain the wind
while fortune that in this alone inclin'd to favour hannibal extends his sails with following gusts so that his speed prevails and bears his gally on against his fo with so great violence the barbed proe strikes through his side and with the furious shock shakes his whole bulk as bruis'd against a rock
as from some engine shot the splinters fly through all the ship and one the captain's eye so deeply wounds it sinks into his brain and leaves upon the deck his body slain
with him the courage of the rest doth dy and a base fear perswades them streight to fly
while hannibal pursues with storms of fire from pitchy lamps and darts as they retire
black waves of smoak the flying vessel hide and her sad fate invites from either side
fresh squadrons to the fight
these to maintain their conquest those to take revenge
the main foams with their active oars and the affrighted seek their most remote abodes
fearing the future horrour of the day and bloody seas their safety might betray
both navies now are met proes against proes sides against sides they strike and grapling close so firmly that as foot to foot they stand and with their swords deal wounds as if on land
but where the swelling surges interpose or winds so that the gallies cannot close darts arrows jav'lins flaming lamps they throw and death and wounds in sev'ral shapes bestow

the romanes now the syrians now give way

yet neither fly but equally the day are confident to gain and their retreat like rams doth greater force and rage beget
till scipio to whose fortune syria fate must yield and thence her future ruin date a squadron of italian gallies brought gainst apollonius who too rashly sought so brave a fo
like thunder tearing clouds their meeting vessels crack th· entangled shrouds some that would sink above the waves retain while others to the bottom of the main descend and in their arms the souldiers drown'd finde a sad fate without revenge or wound
but some whose present courage stood above surprize of danger gainst such fortune strove to dy among their foes and leaping on their decks there fighting fall
some backward thrown are lost in the assault others whose skill in swimming and their rage kept floating still attempt to board again
eumenes late a captain who his tyrian gallie's fate a while surviv'd first seiz'd a romane oar by which he nimbly climbing up before perceiv'd the deck had gain'd when strait one hand lop'd off the other still his hold maintain'd untill a second wound took that away yet this sad loss could not his minde betray to want of courage but his teeth supply'd their room until a fauchion did divide his body from his head which still did keep its hold the trunck fell back into the deep
th example of his death made some to burn with rage some chill with fear their proes to turn

and fly
while hannibal their flight in vain

upbraids and hales them to the fight again
but when they saw pamphilius possest with so great terrour that he first the rest forsook no sense of honour could restrain their flight
but scatter'd over all the main the base cilicians spread their sails to fear scarce knowing to what land or coast they steer

but the brave libyan who as much to fly

abhorr'd as those base cowards fear'd to dy with three stout tyrian gallies makes through all the latian ships t'attaque their admiral thinking that act alone would best become his valour when he seem'd t'assault ev'n rome her self and from his conquest or his fall the world might say twas done like hannibal
but fortune the success deny'd and brought a furious war upon him where he fought
where e're he turns their numbers him surround so as besieg'd he stands
no place is found where a brave deed a single arm may boast
all valour in their multitudes is lost
this face of danger his last fury wakes
as when too close pursu'd a tiger takes his stand resolv'd to dy reveng'd he views his foes all wounds receives at length doth chose against that hand to spend his stock of rage that gainst his life most forward doth engage

so a pretorian ship that bove the rest

with show'rs of piles and darts did him infest with a prodigious storm he laies aboard and all the plagues that libya could afford to which her thirsty sands do give a birth upon it throws enclos'd in pots of earth

from which when fall'n and broken on the decks

myriads of serpents rais'd their marble necks
the souldiers in the fight with wonder are surpriz'd as if medusa made the war
their dreadful hiss suppress'd all warlike sounds and when their stings or teeth inflict their wounds strange kinds of sudden death ensue while some whose nerves the deadly poison doth benum like statues fixed stand others beheld their limbs above proportion swell'd till their encreasing bow'ls their bellies burst some seem t'have swallow'd flames and a dire thrist firing their bloodless entrails to allay its rage they headlong leap into the sea
this through one wound sees all his blood to flow his veins soon empty made that doth not know hee's hurt nor feels a wound when death strait creeps into his heart and he for ever sleeps
but though each serpent thus a sev'ral kinde of death inflicts yet to one ship confin'd free from their venemous assault the rest the libyan with all sorts of arms opprest till iuno strugling still with fate resolv'd no romane hand should boast his fall involv'd the day in horrour chas'd the light away before its time and over all the sea the wings of night extends the pregnant clouds discharge their cataracts and from the shrouds the roaring winds the swelling canvase tare the romane ships as if in civil war gainst one another strike and now contend how from themselves they may themselves defend
at length dispers'd o're all the main they flee and by this danger from a greater free

safe to the lycian shore the libyan came

reserv'd by fate to be bithynia shame

but fortune had not thus her aid deny'd

by sea alone unto the syrian side but where by land the king his armies led his ensigns from the romane eagles fled
his thracian kingdoms now no more his law obey'd but the ausonian fasces saw in triumph through their conquer'd cities go and him of late their lord esteem'd their fo
his grecian friends the leagues that they had sworn reject and now his weaker friendship scorn scarce would the syrian cities entertain their flying king at his return
so vain the people's favour and their faith when crost by fortune and his pow'r a king hath lost

this levity the libyan prince revolv'd

much in his troubled thoughts at length resolv'd no more the dang'rous envy of that court to try but to bithynia king resort a king who wanted then so brave a hand against etolians to defend his land
prompted to this by his unhappy fate thither he speeds and findes alass too late the malice of his foes could not extend to reach his death but by a treach'rous friend a friend who to his valour ow'd his crown and by that fatal victorie's renown made jealous rome to hasten on his fall by such an act as all the world may call her infamy
for he that conquer'd foes destroys when he may spare doth honour lose
but to the romane arms all asia now submits and all their laws impos'd allow

no king but basely yields to their demands

no city where they march their pow'r and did most with hannibal sad fate conspire his ruin to accelerate

was that

flaminius whose rash sire before

the libyan arms on thrasimenus shore renown'd a legate to bithynia came and to his base revenge the senate name usurp'd
their peace and amity to all deny'd that should protect brave hannibal
the king consulting with his fears forgets all ties of honour on his safety sets a greater value
those late trophies gain'd by which the libyan prince his throne sustain'd seem to upbraid him with a debt which he cannot discharge by this treachery
those glories that too near his crown dilate their lustre into crimes degenerate
they guilty are whose merits stand above reward in lower sphears men safest move
these thoughts drew on the noble libyan fate whose strong suspicious made him but too late t'attempt escape
the dubious faith of kings which varies with the face of humane things gave him to fear a change and to prepare

strange lab'rinths under ground to shun the snare

but all in vain declining fortune made traitours of nearest friends and he's betrai'd in all that he designs
arm'd troops enclose his house and stop his way wheree're he goes
but his resolved minde bove fortune stands and still reserves his fate in his own hands
though now betrai'd he is and left by all he's still so great that none can hannibal

but hannibal destroy
and to prevent

surprize into a secret place he went where first the gods accus'd and hanno pride that to his growing conquests aid deni'd the syrians folly and base prusias last perfidious act which all the rest surpast in infamy with execrations blam'd the aid of his great father's spirit he claim'd and a dire poison without farther pause more fierce then that which from the raging jaws of cerberus upon earth's bosom fell when great alcides drag'd him chain'd from hell he swallows down
this baneful drug before prepar'd by a massylian witch he wore lock'd on his sword which if that chanc'd to fail might as his surer destiny prevail against all humane force and as he found it seiz'd his vitals by an inward wound he these last words expir'd
now lay aside thy fears rome no more will thy pride oppose but with this satisfaction dy that thus degenerate thy self wilt my revenge effect
not arms but virtue made thy fathers great which since in thee decai'd thy ruin must ensue
they nobly scorn'd by treason to destroy a fo and warn'd

the epirote of poison when he stood

arm'd at their gates and triumph'd in their blood
but me opprest with fortune and my years betrai'd a feeble victim to thy fears a cons'lar legate forceth thus to fly from life,'gainst laws of hospitality and a king's faith
but this vile stain rome more lasting then thy trophies shall become

and when thy deeds in war in future time

the world shall read thy glories this one crime shall blast and all account thee from my fall unworthy such a fo as hannibal
more he'd have said but through his swelling veins death creeps and binds in adamantine chains the spirits of life which with this language ends his soul to other heroes ghosts descends

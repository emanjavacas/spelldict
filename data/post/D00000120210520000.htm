abstersae lacrymae

the poet buffoon'd or a vindication of the unfortunate ladies from the sawcy reflections in a late doggrel satyr against the famous lottery in
by a club of the fair sex for that purpose assembled
veniunt a dote sagittae
london printed and are to be sold by randal taylor

the poet buffoond

at a late lotteries decision among the gaping crowds division much like the losers and the winners one smiler and two hundred grinners a brother of the quill of goose made bold to let some doggrels loose in paltry rhime to make a sally and the fair feminine vent'rers rally
this harmless gall in ink thus blended so much incenst the fair offended that strait a common council call'd to have the sawcy scribler maull'd this weighty cause and high pretension the summons to this great convention th whose tribe wife widow virgin miss all met to dip their rods in piss together flockt for storm like porpus or bacchanals for flogging orpheus bloodier than pilgrims from iago and thus first spoke a fair virago

ladies when first we did convene in dreams of gold twas that sweet scene when tickling hopes swell'd high as bumper for three fair thousand pounds a lumper in one soft hand enough to move the whole machines of life and love

love did say and reason good

tis the great end of flesh and blood
altho we long for procreation tis not for the empty titillation but for th service of the nation in loyal truth and hearty zeal for building props for do we not see the sad fatality of mortality and therefore tis we want the joys of love for raising thumping boys to make recruits of young commanders and rear a nursery for flanders
if fortune smiles know not why but such a simple girl as may nurse up heroes from my veins the mother of some young lorrains
and shall a whifflng scribling cur make all this snappish noise and stir because at fortune's shrine devoutly we paid our orisons so stoutly for the great prize for golden darts loves surest shafts for wounding hearts
we'd have the barking doggrel poet and the whole snarling world to know it in our warm zeal loves joys to crown we lay this glorious maxim down
the itch lies not in tickling placket but in the jerking monsieur jacket

a city matron stood up next and thus held forth on the same text
madam said she to your applause you've play'd the champion of our cause
but curs will bite the fop so witty made some flirts too against the city told me pray'd t'have great prize drawn to keep a spark of nerve and brawn to help my spiny breed
oh ho my dogrel rhimer do so does the dull grubstreet bard poor sot think that small trip a cheapside plot can the false cry he makes so much on lay any bar on my fair scutcheon i'd have him know to bauk his nonsense play the dalilah with a conscience
at lecture turn up white ith morn and kiss my spark at night
to graft my crested husband's horn out of vile wantonness scorn lewdness that crying sin in fashion was always my abomination
ah no to blow my blooming rose twine my arms and spread my toes ith hearty fear of heav'n
ah madam did you know my grief and crying wants that call relief with weeping eyes sadly sing my limberham at home poor thing is that dull drone without a sting

tis therefore that keep a gallant

because wou'd not hide my talent
can have and hold for worse or better of the formal letter be such a dismal yoke and fetter oblige us without sense and reason gainst soveraign nature t'act that treason as to let slip our teeming season goodness such a case we weak backsliding babes of grace those small may give for every thing you know wou'd live
or if a sin tis none of ours it lies all at our fumblers doors and let them look to their damnation enough we seek our own salvation sport at our innocent and choose to heav'n the sweetest way
if they want lurchers for our warren the game abroad is not so barren nor we such fools for reasons twenty to freeze in summer starve in plenty

madam another dame replyed your cause you've amply justifyed have a husband none oth best too and graft him just the crest too
not that i've your high charge to lay mine true is man enough that way
has youth wit humour shape and size so lovely in the female eyes

but his great fault not to dissemble

his heart's no bigger than my thimble and for that cause fork his poll for hate cravens from my soul

hold madam cry'd her mate you run on at too brisk a rate
tis fit we seriously dispute consider first ere we cornute
for cuckoldom and its appurt'nance are things of weight and of importance
not like mushroom shoots should spring up from substantial roots
and by our common crabstock laws should not be grafted without cause
before spouse rid in cuckolds haven had you good proofs he was a craven

good proofs replyed the angry dame ah madam urge no more my shame for oh to talk my wrongs yet lowder yes have witness with a powder
to make his plain out beyond the shadow of a doubt he was in short a member loyal of the disbanded

when the young dames had past their votes and all chirp'd love in several notes at last the toothless beldam grumbled and thus her indignation mumbled
your rascal rhimer with his jeers paid no more reverence to my years

but said pray'd for the great sum

to buy new coral for old gum
young sauce what then is't harm to pray for't or get a when we pay for't what tho with charity we borrow our t'our sorrow lay no foundation for to morrow as out oth verge of propagation love has no superanuation
the female season's never past our dancing days hold out toth last

here a whole general hum went round t'applaud the beldam's sense profound her wisdom politicks and gravity had reacht the depth oth whole concavity
dull men our sex so far unlike we have steels when they've no flints to strike

when several long disputes had past it came toth grand resolve at last after a mess of chat most plenty a nemine contradicente that in th inclosure wedlock grange or cuckoldoms more open range the vein of loves soft titillation was the great work of their creation
besides twas the whole courts opinion that love is perfectly dominion
and as in every other throne whether by twenty fill'd or one

a single soveraign hand it be·

that steers our manag'd helm a lee or a whole brotherhood sit forty stamps t'our one broad seal
that's as our constitutions bear or our love's throne has room to spare
reign long short spouse in peace or strife with drudging scepter for whole life or a more short in play set up for a day whatever to our seat we lift prerogative in love's but gift husband or gallant either way de facto or de jure sway all challenge equal claim divine or in or out of the right line

the settlement of love thus stated and the whole amorous cause debated what has the scribling fop pull'd down from their most dreadful too just frown audacious snarler as to dare thus boldly ridicule the fair for no more fault but bending knee to cupid fortune the blind and the adored perhaps with too warm zeal implored that verial feminine bigottry to draw the lumping prize in lottery only soft talent to improve and lay't out all in hearty love

but now to come toth dismal chapter his penance for poetick rapture some hearty pray'rs were backwards read to pour down vengeance on his head
first if to grace from feminine gender this a pretender may ev'n his best heroicks parrat only to dirty drab in garrat
hanging's a doom too soft to choose him no let the knot of wedlock noose him tie him to some scamper her veins all merc'ry his all camphire as shall his towring freat bedight the monumental mum·glass height
to this in the common curse oth function may the pernassus hungry delver ne're dig up even a rhime to silver
livings and lands be more unknown then the oth frozen zone
not even one foot in's own eutopia but his whole portion cornucopia

the poet damn'd with such dire dudgeon and left to swallow this hard gudgeon strait a new cause was call'd the question was here put round with what digestion after their longings and their shortens they bore their own to blank misfortunes

one damsel op'd her bosome frank and swore that when her lot ris blank

it struck t'her heart so all oth suddain

as made her give the crow a pudding

how says her neighbour is that all had a sadder chance befal
for when sweet expectation crost saw my hopes and longings lost it gave my heart so sad a break vow it made me spring a leak
find my self in that strange taking something's the fault that sleep or waking· in spight of all my best preventives swear i've lost my whole retentives

here a fair maudlin that stood by put finger into lovely eye
name not she cry'd your puny loss compared with my dire
my lots all blank and hopes come not dose of savin half so mortal it struck me so indeed it did alas it made me drop a kid
short of my time full three months scantling miscarried of the sweetest bantling the fairest thumping boy the fathers hope and mothers joy

a fair companion by her side to this sad story thus reply'd
madam tis true your loss was grievous but my hard fortune's more mischievous
your grief has lost one boy no more but mine will lose me half a score

it sticks so close that so beguil'd

fear t'has my whole teeming spoil'd
of all delights t'has so bereft me the very sweets of love has left me
tis true i'have cock oth game be't spoke t'his glory good as e're struck stroke
yet when kind spouse bestirs his stumps meet him in such sad cold dumps from all my once soft twines and hug i'm grown a perfect drone and slug for oh those hideous sorrows seize me that ev'n poor cannot please me so bemoan me and bedole me that not benevolence can console me

here nan the jolly vintners daughter burst out into a downright laughter
oh rome she cry'd it is decreed that miracles are not ceas'd indeed
a grief so mort not taste love's joy woman so sick as past the toy our sexes wonder and confusion know not what's your constitution
for my own griefs i'll boldly say mine workt the clean contrary way
no sooner came the doleful sound i'd drawn in blanks a whole five pound but to cheer up my drooping head took our drawer frank to bed forc'd a kind cup of love to borrow to lighten losses and drown sorrow

right honorable lord

king saul being brought into such a straight that to escape the hands of the vncircumcised philistimes hee laid violent hands vpon himselfe fell vpon his owne sword and died


dauid in his funerall elegies in his lamentations wherewith hee lamented ouer saul and ionathan cryeth out tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of ashkelon lest the daughters of the philistims reioyce lest the daughters of the vncircumcised tryumph


but when a better then

saul

to whom god hath giuen the kingdomes of great brittaine being so brought into the snare of those mightie hunters nimrods vncircumcised in heart the earle of gowry and his brethren that the sorrowes of death compassed him the floods of the vngodly made him afraid

and hee was ready to say with king hezekiah am depriued of the residue of my yeares shall not see the lord in the land of the liuing shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world

was notwithstanding so deliuered out of the snare of those fowlers that not an haire of his head fell to the ground it is a good thing for vs that are the lords praecones

in our panygyrickes that wee speake vnto the lord in the day of the commemoration thereof

to cry it in the streetes in the chiefe places of concourse in the opening of the gates

and in the temples of the lord that both sion hearing of it may reioyce and be glad

and all the daughters of babylon that beare euill will at sion all treacherous zibahs that could find in heart to blow the trumpet of rebellion against their soueraignes

may bee confounded and hang downe their heads for shame
now though my tongue be not as the pen of a ready writer though mine hand want apelles art to paint out this our alexander in his great deliuerance yet haue made bold in mine heart to endite some good matter with my tongue to speake and with my pen to publish the things that haue made touching the king

and albeit it might be said to mee being little both in mine owne and others eyes

what art thou whence commest thou yet haue like hester aduentured to come wth these my raw meditations into the courts of your honors house without calling thither

hoping as dauid shewed kindnes to mephibosheth for ionathans sake

so you will vouch safe to receaue it into your fauourable protection for the subiects sake whereof it intreateth his highnesse happy and wonderfull sauing in whose safety at that time consisted both in generall the preseruation of these two famous kingdomes and also in speciall the continuance of your honours prosperitie and dignitie vnto this day you being one of the foules of the aire that haue their habitation in the branches of this great tree


againe my perswasions are strong that any thing spoken of his maiesties wonderfull deliuerance shall be welcome to him in whom haue bene obserued to meet and be conioyned those seuerall commendations that alexander the great gaue to two of his seruants commending the one craterus to be undefined span alphabet a louer of the king in the things that concerned his crowne and dignitie the other hephaestion to be undefined span alphabet a louer of alexander in a priuate respect affection towards his person and that the basest earthen vessell that bringeth in it any of the heauenly treasures shall finde fauour in his eyes who as it was sayd of sceuola that he was iurisperitorum eloquentissimus of all the lawyers the most eloquent man is undefined span alphabet of our nobles the most skilfull in diuinitie who hath made gods testimonies his counsellers taketh more delight in them then in thousands of gold

and siluer and thinketh it a greater honour to bee a member of the church then a peere of the realme
all which hath made me put on the spirit of boldnesse to dedicate vnto your honorable protection this undefined span alphabet song of triumph wherein the highest note is concerning the mercies of the lord and the faithfulnesse that he hath shewed vnto our dauid his annointed

the barren trees doome
epigraph math
therefore euery tree which bringeth not forth good fruite is hewen downe and cast into the fire
that this parabolicall speech may not bee vttered to vs as vnto them to whom it is not giuen to know the secrets of the kingdome of heauen who seeing do not see and hearing doe not heare nor vnderstand

if with the disciples wee aske the heauenly maister apart concerning this parable undefined span alphabet hee will vnfold and expound it vnto vs

and as hee doth aperire os suum in parabolis open his mouth in parables so hee will aperire etiam ipsas parabolas open the parables themselues

also

if wee consult with the heauenly oracles the light of them will dispell the darkenesse that hangeth on the face of this text nihil enim fere saith saint austin

for the most part there is nothing fetched out of those obscurities which are in the scriptures which we may not finde more plainly spoken in another place
let vs know then that the lord who speaketh of himselfe according to the hebrew prouerbe with the tongues of the sonnes of men and of whom according to that golden rule of athanasius those things which in scriptures undefined span alphabet are spoken according to humane affection are to be vnderstood as becommeth the nature of god is pleased to take vpon him the name and profession of an husbandman whose husbandry his saints are

of a maister of a vineyard

whose vineyard is the house of israel the men of iudah his plants

being a vine noble for generosity

excellent for glory

and pleasant for delectation

and of a gardener whose spouse is a garden inclosed the plants whereof are an orchard of pomegranats with pleasant fruite


now as in the floare of the church there is mingled together chaffe to be seuered with the fanne and throwne into the fire and wheate to bee gathered into the garner

in the field of the kingdome of heauen are tares to bee pulled out and burnt vp and wheate to bee carryed into the barne in their

due season

in the net of the kingdome of heauen are gathered all kinds of things bad to bee cast away and good to bee put into vessels



so in this vineyard of the lords of hosts in this garden of our there are found both trees planted by the riuers of the water of the sanctuary whose leaues shall not fade neither shall their fruite faile

and also undefined span alphabet trees of autumne decaying whose fruite withereth yea without fruite twise dead

as the speech of the holy ghost riseth by degrees in that place
these these trees doth this messenger before the face of the lord being like to purging fire de coelo tangere strike at from heauen and not either totum genus humanum all as some interpreters would haue it

for they are the trees of the forrests

not of the garden of the lord or onely genus israeliticum the people of israel as some restraine this commination


for though this parabolicall speech be specially intended against euill professours of his time by iohn the baptist heere as it is vsed also by our sauiour against euill prophets of the succeeding times

yet communi ratione in a generall consideration all that like the angel of the church in sardis haue a name that they liue but are dead

are vnderstood including herein who bearing not fruite in christ must be taken away

and being barren must be

cut vp that they may not cumber the ground of gods sanctuary


of which trees not to the boughes or body but to the roote is laid already not to be laid hereafter not a knife to prune for such dressing is requisite for the good branches that bring forth fruit

but an axe to cut downe which whether wee enterprete with saint ierome

of the ministery of that most piercing

word which is like as a fire and like an hammer breaking the rockes

and which by denouncing vengeance against all disobedience doth plucke vp roote out destroy and throw downe

for so god heweth by his prophets and slayeth by the words of his mouth

or with chrisostome

to bee the acutissima ira consummationis gods most sharpe anger that will make an end of all with maldonate the diuinum iudicium

diuine iudgement it commeth all to one there being but little difference betweene gods voyce threatning and his hand taking vengeance on them
chrisostome summeth vp the whole hitherto very elegantly nihil terribilius

there is nothing more more terrible then this manner of speaking for hee threatneth not them with a flying hooke nor with the destruction of the hedge nor the treading downe of the vineyard but with a cutting axe yea and which is more terrible with such an axe that is at hand and cutteth euen presently
therefore nihil certius nothing is more

certaine it is a conclusion from the breathe of his mouth who is the god that cannot lie


a tree yea a tree of the vineyard of the garden that no man may build vpon or boast of a plantation without fructification
euery tree that no man may exempt himselfe from the common condition for hee that goeth about to except himselfe doth but deceiue himselfe
that bringeth not forth good fruit that no man may thinke it enough to haue brought forth good fruite

nor place the whole duty of a christian in abstayning from euill
is cut downe not shall be cut downe the time present intimating the presentnesse of the danger and hee threatneth not any slight stroke but cutting downe by all meanes


and cast into the fire that like iudas it might go into his owne place



this second elias then walking in the spirit and power of the first elias doth as it were call for fire from heauen

against these barren vnbearing trees that haue lost the blessing of their creation in christ iesus

to bring forth fruite according to their kinde
but that we may take a suruay of the particulars in their rankes let vs marke

first the certainty of the vengeance denounced therefore it is not a matter nakedly affirmed but strongly concluded like the apostles undefined span alphabet we conclude

secondly the subiect or person capable of this punishment a tree of the garden which least the iudge should shew himselfe partiall is amplified by the generall extent euery such tree


thirdly the mouing cause hereof for farre be it from the iudge of the whole world that hee should not do right

that he should punish any vndeseruedly because it bringeth not forth good fruite
lastly the nature of the punishment standing vpon two feete such a tree is to be hewne downe that it may not cumber the ground and offend other good plants

it must be cast into the fire that it may receiue as it hath deserued for the end of such trees is to be burned the certainty of the vengeance heere denounced standeth in the doore of the text like abraham in the dore of his tent
therefore it is not a bare affirmation which were enough but a demonstratiue conclusion inferred out of his premisses which is undefined span alphabet superaboundant for if the words of gods mouth are mighty and operatiue dixit facta sunt

much more are the counsels of his heart infallible indiuertible the counsell of the lord standeth for euer the thoughts of his heart to all generations

therefore as saint ierome saith well if we beleeue not god when hee speaketh yet

let vs beleeue him when hee sweareth so if we beleeue not god when hee doth nakedly affirme yet let there be a undefined span alphabet a full assurance of faith in vs when hee doth regularly conclude and compell vs as it were by force of argument
as then all the promises of god are yea and amen in christ iesus will not saith hee

falsify my truth will not alter the thing that is gone out of my lips

so all his denunciations of vengeance are stable yea immutable as the lawes of the medes and persians which alter not


moriendo morieris thou shalt surely die the death

was adams doome if hee should fall into sinne the words being doubled because the thing was established as in pharoahs dreame

whether vengeance then come in the morning as vpon the sodomites

vpon whom about the rising of the sunne gehennam coelo misit deus

god sent an hell out of heauen or at noone day as to haman who was caught from his dinner to the gallowes

or at euentide as to ahab who being wounded in warre dyed in his chariot about the going downe of the sunne

or in the night season as to chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him whom abraham ouertooke and smote by night

whether it come serius aut citiùs later or sooner yet certis passibus illa venit it commeth surely without failing the lord that recompenceth will surely recompence know certainly that yee shall die by the sword by the famine and

by the pestilence


and that vision that habecuck saw against the capitall sinnes not onely of his times but also of all times pride couetousnesse drunkennes and idolatry must surely come


therfore not so much for the secresie as for the certainty thereof is vengeance sealed vp amongst gods treasures

yea bound with the indissoluble band of an oath the lord sweareth that hee will haue warre with amalecke from generation to generation

haue sworne vnto the house of eli that the iniquity of elies house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for euer

let no man then when hee heareth the words of gods curses denounced against his euill waies sing a requiem to his owne soule blesse himselfe in his heart saying with the stubborne in heart shall haue peace though walke according to the stubbornnesse of mine heart

with the wicked shall neuer be moued

with the sinners euill shall not come

with the grieuous trespassers euill shall not come vpon vs the prophets are but winde and the word is not in them

with the frozen in their dregges the lord will do neither good nor euill


for as the lord liueth it is his owne attestation if he whet his glittering sword and his hand take hold on iudgement hee will render vengeance on his enemies and reward them that hate him hee will make his arrowes drunke with their bloud and his sword shall deuoure their flesh



but haue many things to say passe from the certainty and come to the subiect or persons

vpon whom this vengeance must bee inflicted a tree
now all trees are not of one sort of one ranke for some are trees of the forrest some of the garden what trees then must this axe hew at not those of the forrest for what hath hee to doe to iudge them being without

but the trees of the garden for them hee iudgeth being within

and in the garden not those flourishing palmes that bring forth fruite still

but those ligna arida dry trees

such as will bee citizens of syon and yet not suffer the lord that reigneth in syon

to rule ouer them

such as will bee in the vineyard yet will yeeld no fruite to the lord of the vineyard

for such chaffe will grow with the wheate

such tares will spring vp with the good seed and such vessels of dishonour will thrust themselues into the great house of gods militant church

though being in the church they are not of the church

no more then the elect being in the world are of the world


those pharisees then of the concision the brethren of the separation which stand apart will not come neere our churches as though they were holier and sounder then they

and which can finde no rest for the soale of their foote but the synagogue of amsterdam are not led with the feruour of zeale but transported with the fury of schisme whilst they leaue gods floare because of some chaffe breake his net because of some baggage of fish depart

out of his house because of some vessels of dishonour and forsake his field because of some cockle non propter malos boni deserendi sed propter bonos mali tolerandi good men are not to be forsaken for ill mens sakes but the ill are rather to be tolerated for the goods sake
doth the oliue tree presently loose his fatnesse or the his sweetnesse because the pricking bramble groweth neere them doth the lillie cease to be a lillie because it is amongst the thornes

hath our mother lost her beauty yea her face it selfe if there bee a spot or scratch vpon it ecclesiam teneo saith saint austin


abide in the church being full of wheate and chaffe amend those that can tolerate those that cannot amend flye from the chaffe least should be it but not from the floare least should be nothing but they being carryed about with euery blast of vaine doctrine

still innouating their positions still new hammering their church constitutions shew themselues to bee but chaffe
tu qui vento tentationis euobasti saith austen thou which art blowne out of the floare with the winde of temptation what art thou wheate the winde would not carry it out of the floare by the place therefore where thou art acknowledge what thou art

but to leaue the pursute of these fugitiues to come neerer to our selues if this must bee done to these drie barren trees

though they want not leaues to couer their nakednes

thogh

they haue a name and place within the walls of gods house

what profiteth it them to rest in an outward profession shew of godlines to want the inward power and life thereof to be painted sepulchres beautifull without loathsome within

foris catones intus nerones outwardly as graue as cato inwardly as wilde as nero and as saint austen speaketh in superficie boni in alto mali in the outside good in the inside euil and to haue our fruit like to the apple of sodome which in the outside hath a shew of ripenesse but in the inside smoaky dust so that vpon the least touch it sendeth out smoke and goeth away in a flying dust
shall the wolfe euer be set on the right hand because hee commeth sometimes in sheepes cloathing

shall not sathan fall from heauen like lightning

though heere hee often transforme himselfe into an angell of light

shall not the fiue foolish virgins that brought with them the lamps of an outward profession onely and wanted the oyle of grace bee shut out of the kingdome

could ahab escape the stroake of the arrow though hee were disguised in his habite

and shall men though they sweare vaine false oathes commit murther adultery and such like wickednesse be deliuered if they come and stand before god in his house

assuredly such halting betweene god and world will make vs pendere inter coelum terram hang betweene heauen and earth as erasmus was painted yea perdere coelum terram loose both heauen earth

the world hating vs because wee are christians so much as in appearance god hating vs double because wee are christians but in appearance

but that none may dreame of any starting corners hope for any lurking holes here that greatnesse may not keepe out of the way cum priuilegio that meanenesse may not thinke to be returned with a non est inuentus let vs cast our eyes vpon the extent it is euery such barrentrer that this axe must doe execution vpon
it is not in foro poli in the court of heauen as it is in foro soli in the earthly courts where the greater flies break through the spider webs of the lawes and escape and the lesser are onely caught and where a dauid that sitteth on the throne findeth some sonnes of zeruich too hard for him so that he cannot reward the doer of euill according to his wickednesse but this iudge of the whole world who iudgeth without any respect of persons

will doe right in giuing to euery such fruitlesse tree the recompence of their cursed barrennesse in destroying vtterly euery enemie that doth euill in his sanctuary

whether iew or gentile

whether naturall branch or ingraffed

whether low or high rich or poore

whether sitting vpon the throne or being captiue in the prison

whether people or priest seruant or maister maid or mistresse buyer or seller lender or borrower taker of vsury or giuer of vsury

and to vse saint austent words in another case quicquid

aliud dioi potest whatsoeuer else may bee spoken according to those innumerable differences whereby men differ one from another from the highest to the lowest from the king to the begger

this ventus vrens scorching winde then of the lords indignation shall not only light vpon or blight the lowe shrubbes the thistle of lebanon

the hyssope that groweth vpon the wall

but also the cedars of lebanon that are high

for their eminency excellent

for their glorie the cedars of god

for their dignity
the voice of the lord the thunderbolt of his wrath breaketh the cedars yea breaketh the cedars of lebanon in peeces

he will prepare destroyers for these chiefe cedars and cast them into the fire
zedekiah an high cedar must be taken in gods nette and brought to babylon there to receiue his iudgement

yea the higher they stand the more frequent the more vehement is the blowing the beating of the winde of gods indignation against them according to that of the

poet
sapius ventis agitatur ingens pinus celsae grauiore casu decidunt turres feriunt{que summos fulgur a montes
with windes is often toss'd the pine tree tall and highest towers with greatest ruine fall and tops of mountains lightnings of tenst smite

horribly and speedily will god appeare to the that be in high places a sore triall shall be to the mightie

he shall cut off the spirit of princes

and is terrible to the kings of the earth


for are not they vnder god as ioseph speaketh of himselfe

and being so vnder god that they are solo deo minores

onely lesser then god they doe soli deo peccare sinne onely against god as dauid said of himselfe

and must giue accounts of their doings at gods tribunal seat only gods anointing being vpon them thought they should hunt after our liues as after a partridge in the mountaines

yet must we not cut off the lappes of their garments


neither on the other side is this day of the lord of hosts onely vpon all that is exalted vpon the cedars of lebanon that are high and exalted and vpon all the of bashan and vpon all the high mountaines and vpon all the hilles that are lifted vp and vpon euery high to wel and vpon euery strong wall super valentissimos vpon those that are most strong and fenced as iunius glosseth the words and vpon all the ships of tarshish and all pleasant pictures super opulentissimos vpon them that are most wealthy and gay

but also vpon the firre trees that is populares quos{que all the people and the forrest of the vintage that is promiscuum numerum tenuium populo the confused number of the poore amongst the people


howle firre tree for the cedar is fallen because all the mightie are spoyled
howle yee okes of bashan for the forrest of the vintage is come downe
the meane man must be brought downe as well as the mightie humbled

for euery man must

beare his owne burthen

euery one giue an account of himselfe to god

and euery man receiue the things that he hath done according to that which he hath done



but what is the cause why so certainly so generally euery such tree must be so dealt withall for gods thoughts are not as mans thoughts his wayes as mans wayes

that he should bate any vn worthily condemne them vndeseruedly
no man can complaine of him as dauid the type and christ the antitype of their haters undefined span alphabet they hated mee without a cause


it is a mans voyce or rather a deuils not gods non amote sabidi nec possum dicere quare loue thee not
sabidius but cannot tell why
as dauid then answered his brother when hee checked him for comming to the warre is there not a cause

so is there not a cause of the lords warre against these trees surely euery tree at his first creation had his blessing to bring forth fruite according to his kinde

and these trees of the garden if they will bee created a new in christ iesus

must haue a blessing to bring forth fruite in him which if with prophane esau

they haue set light by

they are fit for nothing but the axe and good for nothing but the fire being then with the cursed barren

not bringing forth good fruite the lord who is righteous in all his waies holy in all his workes

cannot bee vnrighteous in executing this vengeance vpon them

wee see then the euidence that is heere giuen in against them they bring not forth good fruit

now that wee may not thinke them thus condemned before their cause though it bee not vnheard be well vnderstood that wee may not cry with the eunuch heere how can we vnderstand without a guide

nouerint vniuersi bee it knowne to all that the fruites wherein they faile are the fruits of righteousnesse wherewith they should bee filled

good workes wherein they should bee fruitfull

the fruites of the spirit of god in all goodnesse righteousnesse and truth


now these fruits are not all of one sort are not all subiect to one consideration for some of them are generall growing vpon all the trees of the garden vpon all the branches that are graffed in the true vine such as are those good fruits of the spirit to bee found on euery good tree loue ioy peace gentlenesse goodnesse faith meeknesse temperance

some are speciall particular which euery tree must bring forth according to his kind as being his undefined span alphabet proper fruite whereby hee must bee knowne

in that calling wherein god hath set him
for thus the oliue tree hath his fatnesse the fig tree his sweetnesse

the vine his vinum laetificans wine that cheareth god and man and euery tree planted by the riuers of the waters of the sanctuary bringeth forth fructum suum his owne fruite in due season


as then according to that difference

made by saint austen

a king serueth god after one sort as hee is a man after another sort as hee is a king as hee is a man hee serueth him by liuing faithfully as hee is a king also hee serueth him by ordaining lawes that command iustice and forbid the contrary with conuenient authority
so all the houshold of faith oweth a seruice to god after one sort in the generall fruites of holinesse

and after another sort in the proper fruites of a particular calling and as they are the seuerall members of one mysticall body if heads in ruling if eyes in looking about if hands in working if feete in walking
for thus besides those generall duties of piety which lie equally on euery ones shoulders the princes fruite that sitteth on the throne is to doe equity and rightousnesse

to bee as nebuchadnezzers tree shewed to him in a vision faire and fruitfull hauing meate in it for all making shadow for all the beasts of the field and and spreading its boughes that the fowles of the aire may dwell in it and of which all flesh may be sed

the honorable mans fruite to hold it his greatest honour with iabesh to call vpon the name of the lord

to honor him by whom he is honored to open his treasures and to offer gifts vnto christ


the iudges fruit to execute iudgment truly and vprightly in the gate

the man of warres fruite to do violence to no man to accuse no man falsely and to bee content with his

wages


the pastors fruite to rule well in the house of god to labour in the word doctrine


the rich mans fruit to bee rich in distributing and communicating


the subiects fruit to yeeld obedience to principalities and powers


the seruants fruit to be subiect to their masters and please them in all things


and in a word euery particular mans fruit wherein hee is called therein to walke and abide before god


and as the figge tree cannot bring forth oliues nor the vine figges

so neither ought one of these trees planted in the courts of the lords house bring forth the fruit that is peculiar to another but still euery one according to his kinde
simcon and leui brought not forth fructum suum their fruit when they slew hamor sechem that had abused their sister as a whore

for vengeance is gods

this power to execute vengeance he hath delegated to the gods of the earth tying priuate mens hands therefrom
corah duthan and abiram with their company brought not forth their fruit when being not of the seed of aaron they would come neere to offer incense before the lord vzzah not his fruit when he put his hand to the arke of god and held it

which was the leuites charge and neere to which no stranger might come


vzziah the king not his fruit when he went into the temple to burne incense vpon the altar of incense which pertained to the priests that were consecrated to offer incense


the base bramble not his fruit when he would be

annointed king ouer the trees

for he by whom kings doe reigne

neuer set such trees on the throne
seruants not their fruite when they ride on and cause princes to walke as seruants on the ground


the vagabond iewes not their fruite when they tooke in hand to adiure the euill spirits by iesus whom paul preached

for that iesus who onely could command the vncleane spirits had neuer said vnto them cast out deuils

priute spirits not their fruite when they would reforme temples throw out idoles and put downe either reall or supposed abhominations for their fruite is to keepe themselues from idoles

not to lay hands on idoles to beware of bowing to baal

not to meddle with breaking of baal in peeces to refuse to fall downe before a nebuchadnezzars images

but not to throw it downe
our reformed sisters not their fruite when they climbe into moses chaire and will bee doctors of the law for saint paul hath long since inhibited suspended such excesse of zeale permit not a woman to teach nor to vsurpe authority ouer the man but to be in silence

but to leaue this enumeration of particulars in quibus non tam copia quam modus quaerendus est wherein must not so much seeke for store as keep measure
from this euidence here brought in against these trees that they want good fruit ariseth another case in diuinity whereby wee may bee resolued that it is not enough to bee

harmelesse in forbearing of euill but wee must also be fruitfull in doing of good and that our righteousnesse must not onely bee priuatiue in ceasing to do euill

but also positiue in learning to do well abhorre that which is euill cleaue to that which is good


the curse cleaueth vnto the not because it had figges such as ieremy saw very naughty which could not bee eaten they were so euill

but for want of good figges


and iobs letters of commendation that hee carryeth as it were from god to men runne in this tenour that hee was not onely harmelesse in eschewing euill but also vpright in working of good


and all the sheepe in christs fold must not onely bee innocent in doing none euill but also fruitfull in bringing forth thousands and ten thousands in the courts of his gares
they that haue learned christ are taught by his sauing grace not onely to deny vngodlinesse and worldly lusts but also to liue soberly righteously and godly in this present world

not onely to cast away the workes of darknesse but also to put on them the armour of light


yea euen that pharisie whose praise was of men not of god whose outside onely had a faire shew his inside being full of filthines and whose iustifying himselfe before men made him abhominable in the sight of god

soundeth the trumpet of his owne praise not onely for omission of euill god thanke thee that am not as other men are extortioners vniust adulterrers

but also for the operation of good fast twise in the weeke giue tithes of all that possesse

whose righteousnesse if wee exceed not in righteousnesse wee cannot enter into the kingdome of god


let the oppressour then not onely not the pledge nor spoyle by violence but also giue his bread to the hungry and couer the naked with a garment

yea with zacheus restore to him that hee hath wronged either by feigned cauillation or by horrible extortion

and of the rest giue almes yea sanctifie an halfe in pios vsus to good vses that the whole may bee cleane vnto him


let the swearer not onely vtter no blasphemy but also blesse god with that tongue wherewith he hath blasphemed him the adulterer not onely abstaine from fornication but also possesse his vessell in holinesse and honour


the vsurer not onely loose the bands of wickednesse and take off the heauy burthens

but also breake his bread to the hungry bring the poore that are cast out to his house and couer the naked when he seeth him
the lyer not onely cast off lying but also speake the truth vnto his neighbour

the thiefe not onely not steale any more but also labour working with his hands the thing that is good that hee may haue to giue to him that needeth


and in a word let the wicked not onely forsake his wicked waies

but also turne into the waies of righteousnesse
otherwise if like to that conceit

which atheists haue of god we will neither do good nor euill

our doome shall not bee so easie as to be throwne into that feyned limbus either of the fathers that dyed before christ or of infants that die vnbaptized where we shall neither enioy good nor euill

but as in the omitting of good it is impossible not to commit euill so for our both omission of good and commission of euill wee shall be shut out of heauen where is all good and throwne into hell where is all euill

againe if these trees that bring not forth good fruite bee heere threatned with the fire what shall become of those trees whose fruite like the vines of sodom and gomorrah is as bitter as gall

yea vpon euery branch of which there groweth nothing but rotten stinking and vnsauory fruite and whereof all the members are seruants to vncleannesse and to iniquity to commit iniquity

whose hearts within them imagine mischiefe

whose hands without them execute cruelty vpon the earth and whose right hands are full of bribes

whose feete run to euill and make hast to shed bloud

whose cares are vncircumscised

whose eyes are full of all adultery and cannot cease to sin

whose throates are open sepulchres whose tongues are vsed to deceit vnder whose lips is the poyson of aspes whose mouthes are full of cursing and bitternesse

yea out of whose nosthriles so full hath sathan filled euery member with iniquity commeth out

smoake as out of a boyling pot or caldron like to that leuiathan

and all whose daies are consumed not onely like smoake

but euen in smoake and fumes
and if the rich glutton lie in the torments of hell whose pride of apparell was but in purple and fine linnen

what riuers of burning brimstone shall bee kindled against them who with lucullus haue ducent as vestes purpureas

two hundred purple garments and with nero haue new euery day and throw away the old

and with the princes children are cloathed in strange apparrell

being so variable in their fashions that as it is growne to a of poland by reason of the toleration of men of euery sect and religion there that if any one haue lost his religion he may find it there or no where so it may of them that if any nation haue lost their fashion they may find it amongst them or not at all

if he who fared only undefined span alphabet as saith the originall neatly and delicatly euery day what they who rise vp early to follow gluttony and drunkennesse and continue till night till they be inflamed

yea till all their tables be full of filthy vomitting


if hee who clothed his backe and filled his belly with his owne what they whose backes are clothed with the spoyles of others and their bellies filled with the bread of deceit and rapine if he who would not vouchsafe his crummes to hungry lazarus what they who eate vp the poore as bread

hinc magnopere colligendum saith gregory on these words we

may hence sufficiently gather with what punishment he shall be punished which taketh away another mans goods if he be cast into the damnation of hell which giueth not his owne
and si in ignem mittitur as austen speaketh in the case of the damned


if he must be cast into the fire that hath preyed vpon another mans if hee burne not giuen his owne goods whither shall hee bee sent that hath preyed vpon another mans if hee burne with the diuell that hath not clothed the naked where thinkest thou shall hee burne that hath spoyled him and if they must goe captiue with the first that are not sorry for the affliction of ioseph

shall not they be bound hand and foot and cast into vtter darknesse

that haue caused the affliction of ioseph if folly bee layd to his charge that went but about to lay vp the fruits of his owne grounds

shall not bitter things bee written against them that enter into the fields of the fatherlesse and deuoure the houses of widowes si stultus est qui recondit sua

vos inuenite nomen eius qui rapit aliena
if he be a foole which hoordeth vp his owne finde yee out a name for him that taketh away another mans
an application of the text to the present solemnity of the fift day of august

bvt all this while may say vnto my selfe as the lepers that met with the spoyles of the the host of the syrians one to another

do

not well
this is a day of good tidings and shal hold my peace this is a day which the lord hath made as truly may it be said of our present soueraignes preseruation as of dauids either coronation or exaltation shal we not reioyce and be glad therein

shall not intreat in my speech of the king and of his great deliuerance let the leprosie of these cleaue as inseparably vnto me as euer the leprosie of naaman did cleaue vnto gehezi

if it bee not as ioyfull a thing vnto me to speake of the honour of this day as it was to those foure lepers to publish in samaria the the happy tidings of the syrians flight oh that my tongue were as the pen of a ready writer

that my voyce were lifted vp as a trumpet

to found out vnto you the great works of our god and the mercies that he hath shewed vnto his annointed
and that the words of my mouth may be as words spoken in due season the matter that will vtter shall be built vpon the foundation of this present text
for may be bold to say vnto you that euen this day hath this scripture beene fulfilled in our eares which haue heard of and in our eyes which haue seene certaine trees that budded forth for that they brought it not to maturitie it was the lords doing corrupt rotten abhominable fruit quis potest verbis aequare dolorem cut downe with the axe of diuine indignation and throwne into the fire euen into the fire of hell
what these trees were what their fruit how hewne downe audite obstupescite

behold and in beholding wonder with great maruell
these trees then which as time the mother of truth hath manifested had many spreading branches

were not the thistles of lebanon exalting themselues against the cedar

nor yet the brambles of the wood desiring to be annointed kings

although thistles and brambles for their pricking and piercing for then it had beene easie to haue troden downe such thistles a fire would quickly haue come out of the cedar and haue consumed such brambles but they were a couple of the oakes of bashan so the prophet calleth the mighty men of the land

a paire of brethren a simeon and leui brethren in euill

ioah and abishai sonnes of zeruiah that thought to haue beene too hard for our dauid

neither were they trees of the forrest open enemies against whom there might haue beene either defence or hiding

strangers for nation or religion as egyptians to hebrewes who held it abhomination to eate bread one with another

as iewes to samaritans who meddle not one with another

which yet should not haue touched gods annoynted

for was not the amalekites bloud vpon him for touching of saul the lords annointed though he were a stranger and no subiect

but euen trees of the garden men of the same lip and speech that were in subiection vnder this cedar owing him a seruice in the lord with their goods body yea the sacrifice of their deerest

bloud men worshipping the same god with him after the same manner to whom there was one lord one faith one baptisme with him

who professed as ruth to naomi thy god shall bee my god

and who went together into the house of the same god as companions in the same religion

yea trees so clad in the leaues of an outward seeming zeale that euen this very day the elder of them kept an ahabs fast when naboth must die

and with absolom pretended a vow when he would rebell

came and stood before god in his house

vouchsafing an care to the gospell of peace which hath brought and taught all peace when warre and bloud was in his heart when hee purposed to haue mingled his sacrifice with the bloud of his soueraigne as pilate did the galileans bloud with their sacrifices

so dangerous so pernicious is the deuill when hee is cloathed in white when he commeth in the shape of an angell of light


these were the trees now for the ill friute that onely blossomed budded forth out of them for the most high blasted it that it could not come to maturity as that of rechab and baana who smote king ishbosheth on his bed and slew him

it was the fruit of sedition of rebellion which is as the sinne of witchcraft

of lifting vp their hands with absolom against the father of their country yea of laying violent hands vpon him who was to them and is to vs the light of our israel



and the breath of our nosthrils

whom they should haue feared to haue laid hands on

as being their maister the lords annointed

yea as being a righteous person as dauid aggrauateth the sinne of rechab and baana for slaying a righteous person

one cuius virtutes nullo vitiorum confinio laeduntur as pliny faid of traian whose vertues are impaired with no neighbour vices who neuer was an ahab to spoyle any naboth of his vineyard

nor a manasses to defile the streets of his cities with innocent bloud

so farre is hee from that that hee hath pardoned many railing shemeis bloudy ioabs and rebellions absoloms and would euen with good theodosius etiam mortuos in vitam reuocare wish them aliue that are dead nor an herod to take away anothers wife

one to whom the church of god doth euen owe it selfe not onely for being nursed vp with the milke of his breasts but also for the seruice that hee hath done to sion in publishing apologies in her defence and shewing himselfe to be a defender of the faith not onely in a complementall title but also in actuall performance
one whom the hath found as a nebuchadnezzars tree

a king raigning in righteousnesse and being an hiding place from the winde a couer from the tempest as riuers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rocke in a weary land

and one of whom all his subiects do for his walking in and out before them

eadem secretò quae palam loqui

speake none otherwise in secret then openly
this was their naughty detestable fruite now for the cropping of it in the bud for the hewing downe of such corrupt trees well spake euen wicked iesabell had zimri peace when hee slew his maister

had these men peace when they sought attempted to haue slaine their maister the lords anointed and had so farre gone on in their wickednesse that they had brought him as a bird into the snare of the fowler and had dealt with their soueraigne as the euill seruant with his fellow laid hands on him and taken him by the throate

no but euen when there was but a step betweene his soule and death the lord stirred vp the spirit of some of those mighty men whom this our dauid had

whose hands claue vnto the sword and vnto whom the lord gaue great victories that day

so that they did beate them as small as the dust and tread them flat as the clay of the street



and as they thought to haue done not onely to their brother but also to their maister so were they retaliated so was it done to them life for life bloud for bloud

blessed are they for rewarding them as they would haue serued the lords annoynted although in this case there was great disproportion they seeking his life who was worth ten thousand of the vulgar

yea they found there was no inchantment against iacob no diuination against israel

gowries inchanted

characters wherein he did trust could not keepe his body from the sword nor his life from destruction


and for their casting into fire euen into the fire that neuer goeth out

although we must be sparing in iudging any who haue a maister of their owne to stand or fall to

although maior sit dei benignitas as saith austine quam omnium hominum iniquitas the goodnesse of god be greater then the wickednesse of all the men in the world so that a man may bee receiued to mercy inter pontem fontem betweene the bridge and the brooke yet if rebellion threw adam out of paradise cast the angels downe out of heauen into hell

how shall these rebels these traitors euer escape the condemnation of hell and be saued in the day of the lord nay if iudas in whom there was a kinde of remorse for the holy ghost saith of him undefined span alphabet he was sorry that euer he had done the deed and who tooke the deepest revenge of himselfe that could be for he went and hanged himselfe be yet gone into his owne place

euen hell prepared of old for him whither are they gone who with corah dathan and abiram died in their trespasse

were neuer pricked in heart but stood in defence of the deed died in defence of it and breathed out their last breath with sorrow that they had not the wit

to haue imbrued their hands in maiesties sacred bloud but euen in infernum inferius into the nethermost hell and so euer let his enemies perish let the enemies of

our lord the king and all that rise to doe him harme be as those two brethren but vpon himselfe let his crowne flourish and let the lord speak of his house for a great while

that there may neuer want a man of his posterity to sit vpon the throne of great britaine so long as the sunne and moone endureth
and for our selues let vs praise the name of our god with a song magnifie him with thankesgiuing

who giueth so great deliuerance vnto his king and sheweth mercie vnto his annointed and to his seed for euermore


yea let vs cry with ahimaaz blessed be the lord which hath shut vp the men that lift vp their hands against my lord the king

blessed and thrice blessed be the name of the lord that reserued him in meliora tempera for better times that he might set him on the throne of our israel and make him king to doe equitie and righteousnesse


and let the king himselfe reioyce in the lords strength euen reioyce greatly in his saluation

and praise his god which gaue him not as a prey vnto their teeeh but euen then when there was but a step between his soule and death sent from heauen and saued him from thereproach of them that would haue swallowed him vp

redeemed his life from the very brinkes of the graue and crowned him with mercie and compassion


so that god which hitherto hath saued him from the lyon and the beare will hereafter also for so he may with dauid ex antecedentibus colligere consequentia from the

experiments of gods prouidence towards him gather what wil follow hereafter rescue him fro those vncircu~cised philistims that at any time rise vp against him

and wch hath crowned him here on earth with a corruptible crowne will crowne him hereafter with a crowne incorruptible and giue him a kingdome that cannot be shaken reserued in christ iesus to whom with the father and the holy ghost be glory for euer and euer
amen

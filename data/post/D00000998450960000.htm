[Figure: ¶The complaynte and testament of a Popiniay Which lyeth sore wounded and maye not dye, tyll euery man hathe herd what he sayth: Wherfore gentyll readers haste you yt he were oute of his payne. [leaf motif] Incipit prologus. _ppose had ingyne angelicall ith sapience super salomonicall not what mater put in memory The poetis olde in stile heroycall In breue subtile termes rethoricall Of euerylk mater tragedie and story So ornatly to their hie laude and glory Hath done indite whose supreme sapience Transcendeth fer, the dull intelligence.
Of poetis now in tyll oure vulgar toung For why the bell of retorik is roung By Chaucer Goweir and Lidgate laureate Who dare presume these poetis till impoung Whose swete sentence through Albion bene soung Or who can now the werkes contrefate Of kennedy with termis aureate Or of dumbar whylk language had at large As may be sene in till his goldin targe Quintyne Mer wle Henderson Hay holland Though they bene deed her libellis bene lyuand Whilke to reherse makes reders to reioyse Alas for one whilk lampe was of this land Of eloquence the flowyng balmy strand And in our Inglysshe rethoryk the roise As of rubeis the charbuncle bene choise And as Phebus doth sinthea precell So Gawane douglase byshop of dunkell, Had when he was in to this lande on lyue Aboue vulgare poetes prerogatyue Both in practik and speculation saye no more good reders may descryue His worthy werkes in nomber mo than fyue And specially in the true translation Of Uirgyll whilk bene consolation To cunnyng men to knowe his great ingyne As well in naturall science as diuyne And in the court bene present in this dayes That balletes breuis lustely and layes Whylkes to our prince dayly they do present Who can say more than syr Iames Inglysshe sayes In ballattes farssis and in plesand playes But Culrose has his pen made impotent Kid in cunnyng and practik ryght prudent And steward whilk desiris a stately style Full ornate werkes dayly doth compyle.
Steward of lorn wyll carp ryght curiously Galbrayt kinloch when they lyst them apply In to that art ar crafty of ingyne But now of late is stert vp hastely cunnyng clerk whilk wryteth craftely plant of poetes callid ballantyue Whose ornate werkes my wyt can not defyne Get he in the court auctorite He wyll precell Quintyne and kenedy.
So though had ingyne as haue none wote not what to write be sweit saynt Iohane in all the garth of eloquence nothing lefte but barayne stok and stone The polit termes are pullid euery one Be these fornamid poetis of prudence And seing find none other new sentence shall declare or depart you fro The complant of a woundid papingo.
Wherfore because my mater bene so rude Of sentence and of rethorik denude To rurale folk my dityng bene direct Fer flemit frome the sight of men of gud For cunning men know will sone conclude It dow nothing but for to be deiect And when here my mater bene detract Than shall swere made it but in mowes To vplandishe lassis whilk kepeth kye and yowes Here endis the prologue And begynnis the complant.
Expresse shall that by experience Yf that ye please to here a pituouse tale How a faire bird by fatale violence Deuourid was and myght make no defence Contrary the deth so fayleth naturall strength As after shall shewe you at more length papingo ryght pleasant and perfyte Presentid was to our most noble kyng Of whom his grace long tyme had great delite More faire of forme wote flew neuer with whing This proper bird he gaue in gouerning To me whylk was his semple seruiture On whom did my deligence and cure To lerne her language artificiall To play plat fote and whissill fot before But of her inclination naturall She countrefeted all foulis lesse and more Of her corage she wolde with out my lore Sing like the merle and kraw like the cocke Pew like the gled and chant like the lauerocke.
Bark like a dog and kekill like a ka Blait like a hog and buller like a bulle Gaile like a gock and great when she was wa Clyme on a cord synge laughe and play the fule She myght haue bene a menstrell agaynst youle This blisfull bird was to me so pleasand Where euer went bare her on my hand.
And so befell vpon a mirthfull morowe In to my garth past me to repose This bird and as we were wont afforowe Among the floures fresshe fragrant formose My vitall sprete duly did reioyse When phebus rose and raise the cloudis sable Through bryghtnes of his bemes amiable Without vapoure was well purificate The temperat ayre soft sober and serene The erth by nature so edificate With holsome herbes blewe white reed and grene Whilkis eleuate my spretis frome the splene That day Saturne nor Mars did not appere Nor Eol out of his caue durst not stere.
That day perforce behoued to be fayre By influence and course celestiall No planet pressid for to perturbe the ayre For Mercurius be mouing naturall Exalted was in to the trone triumphall Of his mansion vnto the fyftene gre In his owne souerayn signe of virginye That day did phebus plesantly depart From Gemini and enterid in Cancer That day cupido did extend his dart Uenus that day communed with Iupiter That day Neptunus hid him like a sker That daye dame nature with gret besines Furthd flora to proue hir craftines And retrograid was Mars in Capricorne And sinthea in sagittar assesid That day dame Ceres goddes of the corne Full ioyfully Iohan vpland applesid The bad aspect of Saturne was appesid That day by Iuno of Iupiter the Ioy Perturbynge spretis caused to hold coy.
The sound of birdis surmounted all the skyes With melody of notis musicall The balmy droppis of dew Tytan vp dryis Hanging vpon the tender twystis small The heuenly hewe and sound angelicall Sik perfyte plesure prentid in my hart That with great payne from thens myght depart So still among the herbis amyable did remayn a space for my pastance But wordly pleasure bene so variable Mixid with sorowe, drede and inconstance That founde therin is no contynuance So myght say my short solace alas Was dryuen in dolour in a lytle space.
For in that garth among the fragrant floures Walkyng alone none but my bird and Unto the tyme that had said my houres This birde set apon a branche me by But she began to clymbe ryght spedely And in that tre she did so hie ascend That by no way myght hir apprehend de sayd beware, mount not ouer hye in tyme, perchaunce thy fete may fayle Thou art ryght fat, and not well vsed to fle The gredy glede, drede shall the assayle wyll ascende {quod} she, chaunce what be chaunce me It is my kynde to clym ay to the hyght Of fether and bone, wote wele am wyght So on the hyghest lytell tender twyst With whynges displayde she sate full wantonly But Boreas blewe a blast or euer she wyst Whylk brake the braunche, and blewe her sodeynly Downe to the ground with many a carefull crye Upon a stub she lyght on her breest The bloode russhed out, and she cryed for a preest God wote yf than my hert was wo begone To se that foule flytter amonge the floures Whylk with great mournyng gan to make her mone Now are come sayd she my fatale houres Of bytter deth now must suffre the shoures dame nature pray the of thy grace Lende me leysure to speke a lytell space For to complayne my fate infortunate And bequeth my naturall gere or departe Seynge of all comfort am desolate Alone excepte the deth with his darte With awfull chere redy to perse my harte And with that worde she toke a passion Syne flatiynges fell and swapped in to swowne With sory hert persed with compassion And salt teres distelling from mynt eyne To heare that birdis lamentation did approche vnder a hauthorne grene Where myght here and se, and not be sene And when this bird had swowned twyse or thryse She gan to speke sayeng on this wyse false fortune why hast thou me begyled This day at morne who knewe this carefull case Uayne hope in the my reason hath exiled Hauing sik trust in to thy feyned face That euer was brought to the court alas Had in forest flowne amonge my feres myght full well haue lyued many yeres.
Wyse and true counsell alas dyd refuse Agayne reason vsyng my appetite Ambition did so my hert abuse That Eolus had me in great dispite Poetis of me hath mater to indyte Whylk clam so hye and wo is me therfore Not doubtyng that deth durst me deuore.
This day at morne my forme and fetheren fayre Aboue the proude pecok were prece land And nowe a caytyfe carion full of care Bathing in blode downe from my hert distelland And in my eare the bell of deth bene knelland false world fy on thy felicite Thy pryde, auarice, and immundicite.

Whether was stryken in extasy Or through a stark ymagination But it appereth in my fantasy herd this dolent lamentation Thus dullid in to desolation Me thought this bird dyd discriue in hyr manere Her counssall to the king as ye shall here.

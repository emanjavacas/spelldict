foure centuries the vnfolding whereof layeth open that truth that concerneth saluation

to the christian reader

it is not the words of holy scriptures onely but the sense and meaning beloued in christ which is carefully to be searched after of all those who desire the knowledge of that truth which bringeth to saluation such as endeuour to liue thereafter
this appeareth well by that worthy sentence

of a greeke father affirming

that pietie consisteth not in the sound of the ayre but in the force of things signified whereunto accordeth that of hierom the latin father

the gospell consisteth in the inward marrow of the sense and not in the outward sound of words not in the leaues of letters but in the root of reason
to this purpose as haue heretofore trauelled to lay forth the signification of words in scripture by a short and easie dictionarie already by me published to the world in the kinde acceptance whereof and other my labours haue tasted of thy curtesie to my great encouragement so haue now therevnto added two centuries and more of theologicall rules and aboue fower centuries of mysticall cases and secrets of diuinitie with their resolutions as

good helps and means to bring to light the hidden vnderstanding of the scripture
for certaine it is as humane arts and sciences bee they grammar logick or the rest so neither diuinitie which is the arte of arts and queene of sciences can either bee taught or learned without precepts and rules and as it cannot be practised so can it not bee vnderstood without speciall fit rules to guide vs in the interpretation
for the most of these rules especially such as bee deriued from ancient writers am beholden to flaccius illiricus the rest either collected out of later moderne writers or by my owne obseruation
haue also added an explication of all the rules which bee drawne immediately out of the scriptures to the other which be collected out of ecelesiasticall authors haue for the most part ioyned both reasons

and examples to explane them the better
some of these rules doe further our vnderstanding in the old some in the new testament and some in both
some of them will steed vs in the doctrines some in the words and formes of speeches vsed in the scriptures and some serue to gouerne vs in the studie and practise of the word
whatsoeuer vse or worth they bee of which verily hope will be much and manifold dedicate them to all the faithfull whersoeuer throughout this land dispersed

if any either ioshua or other young man shall out of enuy or iealousie obiect that by this meanes not only eldad and medad but as chrysostome speakes the shepherd and the husbandman and the spinster will bee able to prophesie and know as much as some preachers do
an answer is framed to my hand by moses the

man of god would to god that all the lords people could prophesie and that the spirit of the lord were put vpon them
and by paul let the worde of god dwell plenteously in you in all wisdome
col

if this satisfie not the next answer is that if they who finde fault will labour to doe as much or much more seruice to the church by their painfull endeuours they shall doe it assure them without enuy on my part
as for you beloued in the lord take in good worth beseech you both these my two centuries of theologicall rules and also my power centuries of aenigmata sacra or mysticall cases and secrets of diuinitie annexed of whose vse see their proper preface and improoue them to your greatest spirituall gaine in christ

such as are worldly wise are least capable of heauenly truth

which is

most commonly shewed to such as haue least wit and worldly prudence to rest in and farthest of from opinion of great wisemen and thus it is because god will haue it to be so to confound wise things by foolish

is the god of abraham
the other knowledge is by due deduction and firme consequence when from expresse words some truth is strongly collected as this that abraham isaak and iacob shall liue and rise according to their bodies because god is not the god of the dead but of the liuing this kinde of knowledge is also very certaine but deceitfull is the knowledge which by sophistry and false consequence is drawne from plaine texts
the next rule from hence is this that such truths as by firme consequence are collected from the word must be beleeued as that which is expresly written in the word for it is gods will therfore this consequence that abraham and the saints departed shall rise must bee credited no lesse than that expresse scripture from whence christ drew it

christ and his apostles follow the translation of the septuagint in greek which rendreth the sense and not the words

wee must not bring a sense of our owne vnto the scripture but meekely receiue that which the scripture giueth

in euery scripture there is some thing visible and something inuisible there is a body and a spirit or soule

the letters sillables and wordes be visible as the body but the soule and inuisible part is the sense and trueth wrapt and infoulded in the wordes which are as the barke ryne or bone the meaning within is as the roote and iuice or as the marrow

the scripture deliuers some things of god which may be vttered and inquired into

as that hee is the creator of the world and gouernour thereof the redeemer of mankinde but other things there be which are vnutterable and rather to be adored and beleeued then examined as the vnitie

whose word and voice it is so certified to our consciences by that spirit which indited it and is not deriued from the church whose office is faithfully to interpret and preserue this word in purity by the vse of an holy ministery and so is the piller and ground of truth not a mistris and queene to commande and

examples of this rule abound euery where and offer themselues to the reader that obserues the scripture

the reason is because gods word is perfect so is no other writing of any author whatsoeuer

the knowledge of humane histories written of the persians babylonians graecians and of the romanes especially brings no small light to vnderstand sundry parts of scripture namely the books of daniel and reuelation which conteine historicall prophesies of things to be perceiued by the euents which are recorded in prophane and ecclesiasticall historiographers

the reason is that by varying the manner and forme of speach and teaching not only disdaine and weariness may be remooued but the truth receiueth better impression through such kinde of proceeding

examples whereof amongst many easie to be marked take one or two

similitudes are rather for illustration to make darke things plaine

such is the similitude of the euill steward of a vine ioh
of a king marying his sonne for similitudes are not argumentatiue

the authority of diuine scripture

must not be subiected to humane capacitie august
the reason whereof is

because corrupt reason cannot diue so deep as gods truth and the wisdom of god in his word is infinite our vnderstanding finite therefore they erre which will belieue no more than their reason can reach
and this error hath been the mother of very many errors

whatsoeuer wee read in any heathen or ecclesiasticall author be it father

august

in ireneus we read that christ died at the age of
yeeres
augustine that the communion ought to be giuen to infants
in origen that at length all deuills and men shall be saued and innumerable such like in other authors

the reason is because the scripture conteineth an infallible and perfect truth therefore it must needs be refused as false whatsoeuer in matter of religion and saluation is beside it or against it and whatsoeuer any of the learned fathers do write truly must not be belieued because it comes from them but because it is grounded on scripture or sound reason

certaine precepts are in common propounded to all as the commandements and whatsoeuer precept serues to expound them or illustrate them and some priuat to certain speciall persons as that to abraham of killing his sonne

these three latter as instruments to the two former all doing one thing though not to one end

scriptures do diuers times by the poore and needy vnderstand all gods people poore or rich
the reason is

because howsoeuer the equitie of the things commanded or forbid may

stretch to all sorts wealthy and needy yet there may bee particular reasons why we ought more especially regard the poore and why to that end god would commend his owne peculiar care of them amongst many examples hereof take these few

psal

he shall iudge the poore with equitie but in the next verse this office of gods magistrate is enlarged to all the people hills shall bring peace to the people by iustice

iudges are charged to doe right to poore and needy and to defend them yet it is their dutie to discharge and performe these things to all the people of what condition soeuer deut
againe where vsurie is forbid or taking increase for loane toward the poore exod
deut
this prohibition is extended to all the iewes to whom money or ought else must not be lent with couenant for gaine for the duty of lendings sake which appeares first because hee saith generally to a brother and all iewes were brethren in this sense being all worshippers of one

god
because hee opposeth a brother to a stranger not a poore man to a rich
because the prophets who are the interpreters of moses as moses of the law and the apostles of the prophets haue euer set downe this prohibition without limitation
see psal

ezek
chap
prou
this rule is an halter to strangle all vsurious practises or taking increase for the duty of lending

promises of temporall good things must be vnderstood with exception of the crosse and chastisement

because somtimes to many christians it is better for them to be exercised with afflictions then to be in health and ease
godlinesse hath promises of these

obey me and it shall go well with thee and thou shalt prosper

this particle if is not alwaies a note of doubting but of reasoning and of one which argueth to confirme and strengthen himselfe and others rom
if god bee with vs who can bee against vs

when in the prophets we read this word such like as ioel

who knoweth if he will returne
act

if it be possible then no vncertainty on gods part is noted or inhability to do that which is spoken but a difficulty of the duty sometimes an vncertainty of the thing on mans part yet if is sometimes put doubtingly if thou be the sonne of god math



it is vsuall in scripture to attribute to the instrument that efficacy and force which is belonging to the author and worker

as the ministers are said to saue
tim

verse last

faith to iustifie rom

baptisme to regenerate afflictions to bring patience rom

parents to prolong the liues of children deut

and beget the bodies of their children heb and many such like

the reason why god commits his own worke to the meanes it is to giue more countenance to the meanes if they be good that they may be the more respected the ignorance of this rule caused some heretikes to ascribe diuine operation and vertue to the sacraments which are but voluntary instruments by which being rightly administred and vsed god giueth

grace as himselfe pleaseth

when any sinfull actions are attributed to god as that he hardned pharaohs heart

that hee gaue men ouer to vile affections and a reprobate minde and sendes a spirit of slumber into men and prouoketh others to anger and enuie and turneth their heart that they should hate and the like speeches we may not vnderstand that god putteth into any the poyson of sinne for hee tempteth none to sinne iames
but hee doth it by deliuering them ouer to sathan and their lusts to be hardned as a iust iudgement of a iust iudge who punisheth one sin by another

for this hauing a respect of god in it being the execution of his iustice may be done of god most holily
therefore papists slander vs in affirming that we make god author of sinne whereas we make him onely author of the iudgement

it was the saying of a godly minister that he profited in the knowledge of the word more by praier in a short space then by his studdie in a longer time

any person shall so much more deepely vnderstand the scripture by how much his minde is more intent and fixed vpon them

the reason is because such rich treasures are in euery place of scripture as neede carefull sifting and great intention of minde to finde them out

because such as bee younge and rude cannot be capable of misticall bookes which be of abstruse or hidden sense as canticles daniel ecclesiastes reuelation

this order of page duplicate

reading hould fittest for such as bee simple but for the more learned and namely for students in diuinity wold commend another course out of perkins to beginne with the gospell of iohn and the epistle to the romans after with the prophet esay because these three bookes be as the keyes to open the vnderstanding of the rest

wee may reuerently thinke of the bookes of apochrypha and of their authors but seeing they are not receiued into the number of canonicall scriptures wee may not build our faith on them nor alleage them for confirmation of doctrine but reade them for information and institution of our manners receiuing them so farre as they agree with diuine oracles august

in the new testament written in greeke

what reason then haue papists from these words to collect that the seruice of the church should all bee in a strange tongue

it is the manner of the propheticall writing

first to vse reprehensions and threatnings of iudgement and after to ioyne the promises of mercy by christ to come

it much skilleth not so long as we are resolued in our mindes by the holy

ghost that they come from god
because the authority of scripture dependeth not on the pen man but vpon god the authour

therefore knowing the epistle to the hebrewes to bee inspired of the holy ghost

we receiue it with as much faith and reuerence as those other epistles which haue the secretaries name set before them

the whole scripture is called a bible as if it were one booke
because it is written all by one spirit

also it is called the bible by an excellency because it is the most worthy and necessarie booke as if in comparison of it none other deserued the name of a booke as indeede they doe not considering the author subiect and the ende of it being inspired immediately of god teaching christ and faith in him for eternall life in heauen to the glory of gods free grace toward elect sinners

the scripture sometime writeth future things in the time past rom

whom he hath predestinated them he hath called

whom he hath called them he hath iustified whom he hath iustified hee hath glorified such like speeches there bee

because hebrewes vse so to write also by this forme of words the certainety of the things to come is noted as if they were now done

the title god is in scripture sometime put absolutely and in the singuler number

then it is proper to the creator and noteth his essence or some person sometime it is vsed with an addition

when prophets report visions they do not alwaies mention or infer ought which they saw but doe declare what was said esay

a vision which esay saw

and then followes heare heauen and earth telling words spoken to him not sights shewed him yet are they called visions because god extraordinarily opened the eyes of their mindes to behold his iudgements vpon the wicked and to know most certainely the good promises made to the church

ignorance of this rule as it led the iewes into a conceit of an earthly messiah who should haue an outward monarchie flourishing and ouerflowing in earthly dignity and wealth so it occasioned others to imagine foolishly and falsly that the promises of grace and life euerlasting did nothing appertain to the fathers before christ but that they were no better than swine fed full with the acornes husks and wash of this world

the last six rules do serue to guide vs in the right and full interpretation of the law or commandements
by the ignorance whereof many remaine exceeding ignorant in gods law to their great hurt

legall and euangelicall sentences or promises

must be distinguished not by books but by the nature and condition of promises

for legall promises may be found in books of the new testament as ro

also rom

gal



and contrarily promises euangelicall of grace may bee found in the books of the old testament

as psal

also ierem



therefore they are to be discerned the one from the other in this sort namely according to the rules following

wheresoeuer promises of temporall or eternall good things are made on condition of works as they be the perfect keeping of the law all such promises are legall which no man can lay claime to except he bring an absolute obedience in no point failing which none since adam saue the man christ can do therfore he only hath right to eternall life and to all good things in the strict iustice of the law they which belieue claime by his title conueied to vs by faith in christ

all promises of the life to come or of this life which be made on condition of belieuing or of repenting and working as repentance and workes though vnperfect be signes markes and fruits of faith and faithfull persons all such promises be euangelicall

whereunto euery beleeuer how weake soeuer be his faith but as a grain or may lay claime and challenge through the grace of god freely promising and giuing them christ his sonne and all good things with him

all those and all of this sort and sute are promises of the gospell
the well obseruing this difference between promises of the law and gospell will bring great light both to teachers and hearers and the neglecting of it will trouble and confound both nothing being so dangerous as not to distinguish well betwixt law and gospell
as m.r fox and luther do teach at large

touching such places of scripture

where morall duties be commanded and commended they must be vnderstood

according to these rules following set downe by estay in psal

though no word bee spoken of christ yet it must be vnderstood that he alone is the full cause of euery part of our saluation
act



all morall duties are then commended in any party when the party that doth them is first in christ hauing his righteousnesse imputed to him and his sinnes pardoned through the death of christ
reason is

because all our duties are acceptable to god through christ
pet


and that without faith in christ none can please god heb
lastly because our best duties being vnperfect and full of blemishes must bee purged by forgiuenesse of sinnes therefore the good things done by saul or iudas or proud pharisies or other euill men please not god

all good workes must haue a pure heart for the beginning and gods glory for their end that is they must be done of conscience to godward out of obedience to his word and with

desire and purpose by such obedience to glorifie him for the bare deed neuer please god

thus abell thus abraham moses dauid ezekiah did their works and all the regenerate doe them thus

and thus papists neither do nor can do good works

morall duties

when they haue blessednesse promised to the doing of them are not to be considered as causes thereof that is christ as is said before but as signes which shew to a man that he is faithfull and therefore happy and blessed or as the way which leadeth to blessednesse

these duties must not bee vnderstood in the strictnesse and rigor of the morall law

but expounded of a continuall and vnfained desire purpose and indeuour to doe them sorrowing when wee cannot doe them as we ought asking pardon wherein we faile and setting a fresh vpon them striuing alway to prooue better and better
this rule would preuent scruples and feares which weak ones haue thorow a sense of their owne wants and failings

when the scripture commends any as being perfect or exhorteth any to bee perfect it must bee vnderstood of vprightnesse not of absolutenesse of a perfection in parts striuing to all duties not in measure and degree

for it is impossible for any saint in this world to attaine to a certaine and perfect loue and obedience that is reserued till next life
estay in psalm

this rule would haue preserued familists and papists from conceit of imagined perfection in this life

likewise the scriptures that affirm of the saints that they are worthy must either be vnderstood of the worthinesse of the person accepted as worthy for christ his worthinesse not of the worthinesse of workes or else worthy signifies in such texts no more but meet and fit as math

luk

thus there will be no footing for papists merit in these texts of scripture

in the doctrine of iustification of elect sinners before god where the scripture mentioneth christ onely

without faith there vnderstand it alwaies with reference to faith

see gal


and contrariwise where faith is mentioned withouten christ it hath respect to him as the obiect rom


reason is

because there is a necessary mutuall relation betwixt faith the instrument and christ the obiect and matter of our righteousnesse christ iustifying such onely as haue faith to beleeue in him and faith looking directly and only to the promise concerning christ
the ignorance of this rule bred that absurd and error of actuall iustification by christ without the help of faith

the books of the new testament

speake of the passion of the lord iesus by a synecdoche that is putting a part for the whole the visible sufferings for the invisible

thus vnder his suffering of death be comprehended all the sufferings of his life
also his whole suffering spirituall and bodily is comprehended somtime vnder the offring of his flesh or body as

somtime vnder his stripes esay
and that all both the inward paines of soule properly felt for sin and outward smart of the body went together for the full and whole sacrifice for sinne is very clere by heb
where it is written that by the offering of himselfe hee put away sin
that is his whole manhood was the sacrifice propitiatorie for sinne also the story of his sufferings which mentioneth his soules sorrow ere euer his body was medled withall makes it most manifest math


the reason is

because as man had sinned in the whole and a full satisfaction was to be made to the iustice of god so christ tooke our whole nature to this very end that he might suffer in it and so saue vs wholy

books of the new testament citing authorities out of the old as they looke chiefly to sense not precise keeping the word and take them from canonicall scripture onely so they regard not number of the chap or verse

also

the doctrine of the trinity is more obscurely taught in the old testament before christ his incarnation

the doctrine of gods predestination in electing some and not others

without any respect of mans worthinesse for his owne very good pleasure and will sake to the glory of his mercy and iustice would bee taught very warily and with good cautions first with consideration of the weake that no matter of discouragement be giuen them and of the wilfull and obstinate that no occasion of presumption and carnall licentiousnesse be iustly offered them but as it may comfort the one against dispaire and rouse the other

out of security

that the texts out of which the doctrine is gathered bee faire and full for it without inforcing them

that sound proofes bee brought out of the word to backe euery point that is deliuered and let nothing be taught but that a reason may be giuen out of scripture for it
that it bee expressely affirmed that no man may thinke either himselfe or another to be reprobate for only god knowes who are his and he that is not called today may bee tomorrow but rather to labour for assurance of our owne election and to hope charitably of others which submit to the outward ministery and preaching of the word

that a man aduenture not to teach it others vnlesse he himselfe haue well learned the same and digested it
lastly that the hearers be warned to heare with sobriety and to vnderstand with sobriety desiring to know no farther of this mistery then is reuealed and to referre their knowledge therein not to vaine dispute but to builde vp themselues in the comfortes and duties of christianity

this word heart is commonly in scripture put for the soule

and minde of man
reason is

because the soule though it be in the whole body and in euery part yet keepeth her chiefe residence in the heart as it were in her chaire of estate
secondly as naturall life proceedes from the heart of the body so the beginning of the godly life is from the soule
and lastly to teach that god regardes not outward shewes and deedes vnlesse they come from within

what is proper to one nature in christ is often affirmed of the other or of his whole person

the reason

hereof is the vnity of his person it belonges to the humane nature to bee crucified to shed his bloud yet the scripture affirmeth of his diuine nature that the lord of glory was crucified

and that god purchased his church with his bloud act

touching plaine places this rule is to be followed if the naturall signification of the wordes of the place expounded doe agree with the circumstances of the same place that is the proper meaning of that place as for example rom

it is written a man is iustified by faith without workes the naturall signification of these

words is plaine that euery elect person when he beleeues in christ is absolued from his sinnes and accepted of for iust without merit of his owne workes this sense we presently receiue because it agrees with circumstances of the place and with holy scripture perk

for expounding darke places let this be the rule
if the natiue or naturall signification of the wordes do manifestly disagree with the anologie of faith and other very plaine places of scripture then it must be refused and a figuratiue improper sense is there the true sense

as for example the natiue and proper signification of those words math

this is my body is this that the bread is his body or is turned into his body but this cannot be the meaning of the place because it disagrees with articles of our creede which teach that christs body is made of the virgine by conception of the holy ghost not of bread by the prists consecration also that it is ascended into heauen and shall returne wher he commeth to iudge the quicke and the dead also it disagrees with that manifest

scripture which saith that the heauens must conteine him till the time that all be restored act

perkins

the supply of euery worde which wanteth is fitting enough to the place propounded if the word supplied agree with the anologie of squire of faith and with the circumstances and wordes of the same place

when repentance is attributed to god in scriptures as gen
it noteth only the alteration of things and actions done by him and no change of his purpose and secret decree which is immutable perkins

things spoken as if they were already finished and yet be not so they must bee vnderstood as being in the way to be finished or as being begunne to be

fulfilled

promises must bee vnderstood with condition of faith

holy writers speaking of things and persons which are past and gone

doe vse sometime to anticipate that is they speake of them according to the custome of the place and time in which they wrote as gen


the place named bethel by moses was named luz in abrahams time pet


christ in spirit preached to them in

spirit
so they were indeede in regard of the time when peter wrote this epistle and not of the time wherein noah liued
in genes


moses doth mention canaan who at that time when such things as he writeth of were done was not borne
and sundry other things in order of the story go before which in order of time were done after

in sacred accounts and genealogies either the name or number of yeares how long some prince raigned be left out

the reason is because of the wickednesse of the prince

as saul who raigned farre longer yet is said to haue raigned but two yeeres and an halfe that is lawfully and rightly
also in mach
three kings ahaziah ioas and amaziah are for their wickednesse left out

the parts of time are vnderstood inclusiuely sometime and sometime exclusiuely
in math


it is written

and after six daies iesus tooke whereas luk

it is written of the same thing that it came to passe about eight daies after the reason is because

mathew put exclusiuely those daies onely which went between and were finished but luke puts the two vtmost daies also into the reckoning
moreouer it is vsual in scriptures historicall to take the time spoken of either compleatly as fully finished or vncompleatly as being begun to be in finishing as
kings


king



the last yeeres of the kings of israel and iudah are not fully expired but some of them scarsely conteine moneths in them the rest of the yeers of their raigne being put compleatly

the scripture vseth to call sonnes

which by nature are no sons to them whose sonnes they be called but are

there sonnes legally and by succession
thus salathiel being sonne of neri naturally luk
is legally and by succession made the sonne of iechoniah whom he succeeded in the kingdome as math


after this manner zedekiah is the brother of iechoniah or iehoiakim
chro

and his sonne
chro

his brother by generation his sonne by right of succession
by this rule the two euangelists mathew and luke are reconciled in their genealogie for luke followes the naturall order and mathew the legall order

this word rather is put not alwaies comparatiuely when two persons or things are compared as like or vnlike

but somtime negatiuely as a denying particle in stead of not
as luk

this man went away rather iustified then the other that is not the other but he departed iustified
also ioh

men loued darknesse rather then light that is they loued not light but darknesse

this word behold is vsed not alwaies or only to stirre vp attention at

the report of some waighty and admirable thing but most commonly it signifieth a thing manifest and plaine wherof all do or may take knowledge as psalm


math

and often elsewhere

doing doth somtime import beleeuing as math

but he that doth the will of my father
now this is the will of my father iohn

that he which beleeueth in the sonne should haue life euerlasting
these
rules following are all taken out of luthers works
scripture must be vnderstood not against christ but for christ
precepts presuppose faith as where it is written keep the commandements that is in christ or by faith in christ
also thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thine heart that is in christ or by faith in him
also doe this and thou shalt liue that is doe it in christ
and so in the rest of this kinde

interpretations must be drawne

out of scriptures
these are the supreame and absolute meane of interpretation as the spirit is the principall interpreter

many things are said in scripture by anticipation and recapitulation
negatiue speeches in scripture be more vehement and forcible then affirmatiue
we may not interpret scripture by allegories vnlesse wee be able to auouch the allegoricall sense by some other place of scripture
grammar must giue place to diuinity
reason is because things are not subiect to wordes but contrariwise
he is best interpretour of scripture which takes the sense from it not which brings a sense vnto it
comparison of places one with another the darker with plainer is a good meane to attaine the sense of scripture
literall sense alone of scripture is the whole substance of faith and of christian theologie

without the holy spirit of god no man can vnderstand one iott or title of scripture because of our inbred darknesse
therefore praier for inward illumination must bee ioyned with outward reading and hearing


there can bee but one onely proper true and certaine sense of one place of scripture the rest are to bee auoided as doubtfull opinions

hysteron proteron a placing of things before which should come after some things after which should be before is very frequent in holy scriptures

this is the modell or patterne of all the mysticall cases in this little booke
by london printed by edward griffin for francis burton


to the reader

christian reader be pleased to vnderstand first that this way of propounding probiemes darke questions and parables is no new deuise but very ancient and of great continuance
secondly it is likewise of great vse for it serueth to try the abilitie of mens wits and vnderstandings also to exercise and to whet them also it puts by much absurd brawling and dangerous talke and giues occasion of many wholesome wise and graue sayings
thirdly praises and rewards haue been appointed

and giuen to such as could loose such knots and frame fitting answers
lastly not alone humane and prophane but sacred and diuine stories afford vs examples and presidents of such mysticall questions the truth of all this will appeare in these few things heere annexed and set down

plutarch reports that it was a custome amongst kings of olde times to put questions one to another to make proofe of best wits and that a certaine praise was appointed to him that got the victory

dius an historiographer of the phoenicians rehearseth the riddles and questions that salomon sent to king hiram saying that it cost him very much in that hee could not open them vntill at length he found a yoong man of tirus named abdenan who deciphered to him the most part of

them poets write that sphinix was wont to set forth a reward of freedom and libertie to him that could absolue his riddle

we finde in the booke of judges that sampson put forth a hard question how meat could come out of the eater and sweet out of the fierce an elegant riddle consisting in contraries for he that eateth and he that giueth meat also he that is fierce and bitter and he that is sweet are opposites of contrary natures hee also promised a reward to him that could read his riddle

ambrose as he is cited by peter martir demanded the cause why sampson made his probleme and he saith that because men in feasts when they haue well drunke are wont to be somewhat full of talke and to rebuke others too intemperately which for the most part turned to contention

therefore to auoid that graue men were wont to put forth riddles or problems omitting dangerous talke and turning their mindes to the exposition of things put forth whose example sampson followed and set a reward for him that could open his question to shew that knowledge and sharpnesse of minde ought to be rewarded and contrarily ignorance and foolishnes ought to be shamed and punished thus farre are the words of ambrose

in the first of luke mary the virgin putteth a difficult question vnto the angell which brought hir the message of conceiuing and bearing the sonne of god
how saith shee may this be seeing know not a man that is how may be a mother while am and remain a virgin

lastly through out the gospel

we finde aenigmata and many hard parables christ put vnto the iewes which his owne disciples could not open therefore did aske him apart what they ment

these things doubt not make it euident that this course which take is warrantable and profitable especially if the nature and importance of my doubtfull cases be considered tending to instruct in diuine things which concern saluation and religion and the iniquitie of these times be thought on wherein it is hard to say whether ignorance or malice doe more abound some that would talke of good things in their meetings cannot for lacke of skill to put forth or loose a question wisely others are so wicked and malitious as they deride all wholesome communication now seeing the sharpning of wits is a maine and principall

end of questions for the trying of our knowledge some may muse why would set downe answers to ease men of their owne labour in searching and so take both the praise of the answer from others and hinder the benefit which would come by seeking to this say that had little cause in this draught to aime at my owne praise for many respects but as mooued questions to prouoke some which better can to frame better and more so thought good to frame an answer vnto these that such as could not by their owne knowledge vpon their tryall finde a resolution might haue heere a peece of an answer and satisfaction to giue them some contentment haue put each case and answer together desiring such as can fit and yeeld more pregnant and substantiall answers to set

them downe and to accept in the meane while these my poore endeuours
farewell

mine answer is a slender thing yet rest in it or better bring



aduertisements

first yee shall finde a worde in the margent opposite to each resolution to shew vnto what principle of religion your case and answer doth belong

the cases and answers for the most part doe follow the order and dependance which the principles haue amongst themselues

to the christian reader certaine directions
the vse of these darke and mysticall cases is fiuefold

first to minister occasion of searching and diuing more deeply into the great mysterie of godlinesse

to try and draw out your knowledge as also to increase and confirme it by answers fitly framed according to the word

to bewray the imperfections and wants of your knowledge whiles you sticke in easie things and stumble in the plaine way

to giue light vnto sundry places and passages of scripture opened and cleared

to helpe the practise and exercise of that which you do know

for these purposes your charge and duty is this

first read consider marke your owne answer before yee looke vpon mine

where you sticke be humbled pray for vnderstanding and then take such poore helpe as this treatise affords you

where you see be thankfull to god for your knowledge and labour to profit

who is he that hath vnderstanding and will and yet hath no soule and how that may be the resolution

it is god

of whom it is written that he is vnderstanding

and a god of knowledge

working all things after the counsell of his will

yet hee hath no soule
for hee vnderstandeth and willeth things not by a created faculty

of vnderstanding and will such as is in mens soules whereby they doe vnderstand and will one thing after another by discourse and in measure but god infinitely vnderstandeth both himselfe and all things at once by one act of vnderstanding and willeth infinite things together by an vncreated and infinite power which is in himselfe or rather which is himselfe all thinges which are in god being god

who is he that hath handes and feete and hath no body and how this may be resolution

it is the inuisible god who being a spirit or spirituall substance ioh
he is therefore vncorporeall and properly hath no handes nor feete yet these members are in scripture attributed to him for the help of our weaknesse to signifie vnto vs the mightie workeing of his power whereby hee

doth execute all his owne power counsels as men by their handes doe effect and doe all their workes as it is written the hand of the lord hath done this
againe
the right hande of the lord bringeth mightie thinges to passe
psalm




who is he that causeth all motion yet himselfe moueth not and how this may be resolution

it is the immutable god

who is author and ruler of all motion good and euill as it is a motion it is from god in whom we and all things else which mooue do mooue yet himselfe is immoueable

because hee is vnchangeable for all motion is with some change which cannot fall into the nature of god am iehouah change not


who is that that is all light yet cannot be seene of vs and how this may be resolution

it is the most glorious god who is called light

both for the brightnesse of his glorious maiestie

and for the

perfit purity of his most holy nature hauing in it not the least spot of ignorance or sinne yet because our weake minde cannot comprehend him as he is much lesse our bodily eies be able to behold him therefore it is written that he cannot be seene and dwelleth in a light vnaccessible whom neuer man saw

nor can to whom be honor and power euerlasting



how can one loue and hate grieue and ioy and all this without affection how can one repent and not alter his minde
resolution

god being vnchangeable hee cannot repent by altering his purpose as men doe and being impassible hee is not subiect to ioy or griefe loue hate as the sonnes of men bee yet these things are giuen to him in scripture not by reason of any affection which is in him but of the workes which he doth like vnto men who haue such affections so that his punishing men is his wrath

and blessing men is his loue and the ouerthrow of any of his creatures

or workes is his repenting which is but the vndoing of some thing done

how may one heare and see all thinges and yet haue neither eyes nor eares resolution

god who made the eyes shall hee not see

and shall he not heare which made the eare is there any thing so secret that can be hid from him who is all an eie and all an eare yet because he is no bodily substance hee hath no bodily eye or eare which members being the instruments of vnderstanding are applied vnto god thereby the better to expresse his infinite knowledge to vs who by the things of men must be led to conceiue the thinges of god more readily


what is he that hath all good qualities yet is all substance without any quality and how this may be resolution

it is god in whom euery good qualitie of mercy

truth iustice wisedome

is to be found because he is an infinite perfection yet nothing is in god as a qualitie or accident because he is a most single essence without any composition of subiect or accident of substance and qualitie
therefore his mercy is himselfe so is his truth wise+dome goodnesse patience euery these and all these together as they are in god are that most perfect diuine substance euen that great iehouah according to that is written exod

now in that the scripture giues these attributes vnto god as distinct from his essence or himselfe and amongst themselues it is to helpe our vnderstanding who otherwise cannot conceiue and consider of him

who is he that is no where and yet euery where within the world and without the world and yet neither within it nor without it and how this may be resolution

it is the incomprehensible god

who is no where because hee is not circumscribed in any one place as our bodies be which haue their dimentions

of length bredth yet in as much as he filles heauen earth with his essence and presence therefore he is euery where within the world and without it because of his infinite presence

power and essence yet neither within it nor without it as in a place because of this vnmeasureablenesse and immensitie

aenig

how none is good saue god only yet men and angels be good resolution

god is good essentially his goodnesse is himselfe not by participation

also he is good most perfectly and euerlastingly being cause of all good in others
now angels and men are called good by partaking in his goodnes in a measure and changeably for they may and do loose it when god vpholds not by his grace

aenig

how can god be almighty yet there be many things which he cannot doe as hee cannot die nor sinne nor denie himselfe resolution

he is called almighty

not because

he can doe euery thing for there bee things which if he could do he neither should be god nor almightie
these be things of infirmitie as if god could suffer or die this should argue not his omnipotencie but his impotencie that he were weake and not able to preserue himselfe

things of iniquitie as to sinne to lie to deny himselfe which if he could doe he should neither be most mighty god nor a god at all because these are against the nature of god

things of contradiction or contradictorie as to make things at once to be and not to be a body to be circumscriptible and vncircumscriptible to haue a place and to place which cannot be
for contradictories at once and together cannot be true

but god is called almightie in two respects first because whatsoeuer he is willing to doe that he can doe and none can hinder him but whatsoeuer he is not willing to do that he is able to hinder and none can resist his will rom

hee can resist and ouerthrow the will and purpose of all his

creatures for there is no councell against the lord pro



secondly because he is able to doe more things then euer he will doe for hee could of stones haue raised children vnto abraham

which yet hee did not and haue sent to christ legions of angels to haue defended him against the iewes which yet was not done and could haue made many worlds by his absolute power but by his power limited to his will he can do nothing against that which hee hath signified in his word to be his pleasure for one iott or title thereof must not fall nor faile

aenig

how can any thing bee so good as in no respect to be euill seeing there is nothing so euill but is in some sort good
resolution

god himselfe is so absolutely and infinitely good and holy

as he is good not onely when hee promiseth good things and accordingly blesseth changing and comforting our heart but also when he hardens sinners and deliuers them vp to sathan and to vile

affections when he accurseth and condemneth yet in these respects hee is not euill because he doth these things as iudge of the world who cannot doe vniustly genes

psalm

iames
whereas all other thinges euen they which be most euill as sinne and sathan haue euer some consideration of good seruing for the execution of gods iustice vpon the wicked or for the humiliation triall of the godly which be good things iob

aenig

what is that that sees and knowes all which we doe thinke or speake euen our secrets yet is not god resolution

it is thy conscience which by a power giuen vnto it taketh knowledge of all thy actions as an espiall or watch yea euen of the most secret cogitations thereof to accuse or excuse thee rom
yet it is but a creature and not that god who knoweth not thine alone but all other mens thoughts euen before they be conceiued which the conscience cannot doe psalm


therefore looke to

your thoughts
the deuils by our lookes wordes gestures actions know many of our thoughts therfore walke circumspectly

aenig

how is it that one should not be bound to doe any thing yet doth all thinges vpon necessitie
resolution

whatsoeuer thinges god doth hee doth them vpon and by necessitie

not simple and absolute necessitie as if hee could not haue done otherwise but by a necessitie of supposition that is it being put and supposed which is true that god doth nothing but what he decreed before and as hee decreed it therefore he must needes doe what and as he doth because his decree cannot alter
yet hee was not bound

but most free to haue decreed other thinges and otherwise if hee would psalm

whatsoeuer pleased him that he doth in heauen and earth

aenig

how can he be faithfull and true whose word of promise and threatninge is often broken

resolution

the promises and threatninges of god runne alwaies with condition either expressed or vnderstood and this cleareth god of all vntruth for if hee do not fulfill to the wicked some euill which he threatned it is because the offenders did repent vpon which condition he was purposed to remoue the euill ionah

ierem


likewise if hee giue not his children some good thinges promised it is either because hee seeth the crosse fitter for them or to correct some sinne to teach them better obedience vppon which conditions temporall good things are alwaies promised

though here in this life it oftentimes fareth ill with them that do well and well with those that doe ill yet god remaineth iust both because hee doth it to exercise the patience of the one and to expresse his owne bountie and patience towardes the other also because after this life is ended he meaneth to render vnto euery man according to his workes when it shall go full ill with them that doe ill and full well with them that doe well esay

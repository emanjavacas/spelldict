The Iewel of Ioye. [leaf motif] Philemon, Eusebius, Theophile, and Christofer, talke togither.
SO ofte as call to reme~brau~ce (which for the most part do eueri hour) this commaundemente of our Lord and maister.
Occupy your selues til come, wherbi we are admonished diligently to emploie our tale~t committed vnto vs euery one accordyng to oure vocation in the auauncemente of Gods glory, and in the edification of oure christian brethren, whose health and saluation, not onelye wyth the losse of our temporal possessio~s, but eue~ of our life also, if nede so require we are bounde vnder payne of damnation to seeke, leynge that God as the wyse man testifieth, hath geuen to euery man charg ouer hys neighboure, agayne seynge that accordyng to the doctrine of blessed Iohn, as Christe gaue hys lyfe for vs, so lykewise are we bounde to bestowe oure lyfe to wynne oure Brethren to Christe, forasmuch as we all are membres of one bodye, are co~maunded without dissimulation to loue our neyghboure as oure selfe, and to seke his commoditie profit, furderaunce in al Godlines, no lesse then oure owne, can none otherwise then reproue and accuse myne own sluggishnes, whyche almooste these fyue yeres past haue omitted my butye towarde my neyghboures, not goynge forth as began in my Christemas bankette, in my Potation, in my Nolegaye, and in my Neweyers gyfte to exhort the~ to godlines, to encourage the~ valeauntly to go forth in the same, to perseuer vnto the end, but traneing my life in other exercises, trust not altogither vn+godlye, nor vnprofitable to the christen publique weale, haue neglected the neighbourly office which ought to haue practised toward the~.
Yea feare lest thorow the neglectyng of my dutye toward my neighbours, haue not shewed my selfe an obedient seruau~t in al pointes co~cernyng the dilige~te acco~plishme~te of my Lord maisters precept, whych straightly chargeth me not only to occupye my selfe priuately in vertuous studies godli exercises, but also ope~ly, that his holy glorious co~gregatio~ mai be edified brought to ye true perfect knowledge of his most godly wil. Certes the omissio~ leauing of this my duty toward my neyghbours doth not a little dis+quiet me, seing ye so long tyme haue had no familiar talke with the~ of Godly matters, no nor yet once sene them sence gaue the~ a newe yeres gyfte, beynge vnwillynglye thorowe the furious and Nerolike cruelty of certaine persons (whose tyra~ny sens that tyme God hath not left vnpunished) dreue~ awaye from them to the greate and continual disturbaunce of my minde for lacking the company of so louing neigh+bours, and swete frendes.
But haue sent my seruauntes for them, that may talke wyth the~ after myne olde sorte, renewe our acquayntaunce, and be merye togythere.
For it is a swete thynge when fryndes mete, and mery when olde acquayntaunce flocke togitherward.
feare leste my seruaunte doeth not his message expeditelye, or els that they haue some greate lettynge.
For am well assertayned, that if they once haue knoweledge of my returne into the contrye, no worldly affaires can withdrawe them longe from my companye.
Teares distyll out of myne eyes for very ioye, yet can not withhold my selfe from them, but must nedes wyth mting armes embrace the~ louingly salute them, and swetely kisse the~.
most deare neighbours christen brethre~, so hertelye welcome as herte can thinke.
Blessed be God, which hath preserued vs alyue vnto thys daye, that we maye yet once agayne se one an othere, talke one wyth an other, frely reioyce in the Lord our God.
Let me embrace you, kisse you, once againe did you hertely welcome.
moste true herted frende and vnfained brother, we praise God for your salfe return into the countrye.
This day moste swete neighbour hath replenished vs al wt ioye vnspekeable, forasmuch as it hath offe red you againe to our syght.
deare brother Philemon your reparing into this cou~trie, your sight, your company, your take hath eue~ nowe sodainly so reuiued vs, that we seme to haue put on a certain kind of immortalitie.
And as for all other hys benifites, so likewyse for this 'do we render to the immortal God moste hertye thankes, and wyth voyce we all byd you moste hertely welcome home.
know dere neyghbours your vnfayned loue and readye bent goodwyl towarde me.
And you do not more reioice at returne, then am entierly glade that haue founde you all in good health.
But praye you tell vs of good felowshippe brother Philemon in what parties of ye world haue ye traueyled so long tyme? For neither by letters nor yet by reporte of anye credible persons sence your departure coulde we learne where you trayned youre lyfe.
Wee feared leaste in so perellouse tyme ye hadde bene swalowed vp of the greadye cormorantes, and insasiable Locustes, whyche are neuer satisfied nor fylled wyth the sheadynge of innocente bloude.
Neyther was the libertye of your speache, nor the swyftenesse of youre penne vnknowe~ to vs, which ye swarme of Antechristes secte, sence you fyrste of all traueiled in the Lordes haruest, coulde neuer abyde, but extre~ly persecute, blaspheme and co~demne.
What gentilnes found for my Godly trauailes at the ha~ds of some menne in these parties, ye know ryght well.
Therfore when neyther by speaking, nor by writing coulde do good, thoughte it best not rashly to throwe my self into the raueneynge pawes of these greadye wolues, but for a certaine space to absent my selfe from theyr tyrannye accordynge to the doctrine of the Gospell.
For as there is a time to speake, so is ther a time to kepe scilence When the poore are oppressed and troden vnder the fote, then shal the wyse man, sayth the prophete, holde hys peace, for the time is euyl.
And we haue a manifeste commaundement of oure sauiour Christe, that we shoulde not geue that whych is holy vnto dogs, nor caste pearles before swyne, leste they treade them vn der theyr feete, and they turne againe and al to rent vs.
For ther be some kynde of men so greatly infected wt the nature of Suffenus, and accombred wyth the properties of Menius, two foleish vayne gloriouse Poetes, that they thynke nothynge well spoken, nothynge truly wrytten, excepte they theym selues be the authours doers thereof, they are those same very hypocrites, whych find fault at a little mote in an other mannes eie, but they ca~ not perceiue a great eame in theyr own eyes.
They are those same Pharises, which sparre vp the kingedome of heauen before me~.
They are those same sawiers which take awai the key of know ledge, thet the~ selues enter not in, nether suffer they other yt wolde to enter in.
They are those same Babilonical backslideds, yng childre~, which wyll not heare the lawe of the Lorde, but daily cry, Loquimini nobis placentia Tel vs pleasaunt things, prouide vs of errours, care not for the ryghte way, but away wt the holi one of Israell from oure face, they are those same faulse christians, of whom sainte Paule prophecied, which shoulde be louers of them selues, couetuouse, hye minded, proude, euyll speakers, disobedient to their elders, vnthankeful vngodlye, vnkind, false of theyr promise, false accusers, riatours fearce, despisers of them that are good, traitours, heady, standing in their own conceite, louers rather of pleasures, then louers of God, hauynge an outwarde apperaunce of godlines, but deuyinge the power thereof.
Lyke as Iannes Iambres wythstode Moyses, eue~ so do they also resist the trueth.
Men are they of corrupt mindes and leude as co~ cerning the faieth, but they shall preuaile no lenger.
For theyr foleishnes shall be manifeste vnto all men, as theyrs was.
Where thynges be so ordered, that the truth can beare no place, nor the professours therof be tha~kfully receyued, but rather blasphemed persecuted, enprysoned, and vngentillye handeled: what should men do, but shake of the dust of theyr fete, for a wytnes agaynst th√© at ye dai of iudgme~t depart into some other place wher they may do good, as Christ ye Apo+stles did, quietli to abide ye plea+sure of god, as the prophet saith.
It is good to loke for ye sauing health of the Lorde with scilence After thys sorte dyd appoynte my selfe, and leauyng mine own natyue contrye, traueiled into suche straunge places, as were vnknowen to me, and to them And yet thanke the Lorde my God, whyche neuer leaueth hys seruauntes succourlesse, although an vnprofitable seruau~t in that exile and banishme~t wa~ted no good thynge.
Let the voluptuouse worldelynges take though for the beal, and be carefull for thys present lyfe.
haue learned in that my iorney to cast my care vpon the Lord my God whyche aboundauntlye feadeth so many as trust in him, and depe~d on his liberalitie and goodnes.
For one house, founde. xx. and for one frende, an hundrede.
coulde wysh nothynge for the prouision of thys my lyfe, but had it plentuously, God so afore seynge for me hys vnprofitable and wretched seruaunt.
Euery one, saieth he, that forsaketh house, or brethrene, or sisterne, or father, or mother, or wyfe or chyldren for my names sake, and for the kyngedome of God, that is to saye, for the loue that he beareth toward the Gospell of Christe, he shall receyue an hu~dred folde as much in this presente tyme, and in the worlde to come lyfe euerlastinge, Chri.
Trueth it is, but you haue not yet declared to vs, in what contryes ye haue beene here in Englande sence your departing from hence.
After departed from you and had take~ my leaue of my moste swete mother, of other deare frendes, traueyled into Darbyshere from thense into the Peke, whither appointed my bokes and my clothes to be brought.
Into the Peke? Lord God what made you ther? Phile.
Mine entent was by exercising the office of a schole maister to engrafte Christe and the knoweledge of hym, in the breastes of those scholers, whome God shoulde appointe vnto me, for to be taught.
Not so, co~fesse to you, that fou~d ther very good wittes apt vnto learnyng.
But how fauour they christen religio~ in those parties? Philemon.
Comming into a little village called Alsoppe in ye dale, chau~sed vpon a certaine gentilmanne called Alsoppe, Lord of that vilage a ma~ not onely auncie~t in yeres, but also rype in the knoweledge of Christes doctrine.
By what meanes had ye knowledg of hys Godly disposition? Phile.
After we had saluted one an other and take a sufficient repast for that presente, he shewed me certayne bokes whiche he called hys Iewels and principall treasures.
To rehearse the~ al by name, am not able, but of this am sure that amonge all other there was the newe Testamente after the tran+slation of the Godly learned ma~ Myles couerdale, whyche seamed to be as well worne by the diligente readynge thereof, as euer was anye portas or masse boke amonge the papistes.
rare thynge and almoste a miracle to fynde an olde man namelye in those parties, where Christe thynke as yet was neuer trulye preached, to be so well affected towarde the readyng of the sacred scriptures.
Yea and a gentylman also, For gentylmen now adaies for the most parte delite so much in readinge the worde of God, as a true christian doeth in readynge the Popes decretals, they are all togyther so addict to the vaine pleasurs of this world.
Many thinke it to be an vnsemly thing for a man of nobilitie to be studi+ouse of holy letters, haukes, and dogs dise and cardes (as may speake nothynge of theyr seruise to lady Uenus) is theyr pastime and delectation.
If they reade any thynge, it is some vaine trifle of loue, or when they be beste occupied an history or cronicle.
graunt many ge~tilmen litle answer their vocatio~, nether are they studious of gods word as they ought, notwythsta~dinge (praysed be God for it) know many both me~ wome~ of nobilitie which greatli delite in readi~g the holy scriptures, do not onely loue, but also lyue the Gospel Euse.
For then shall it go well wyth christian religion, when noble men shalbe learned in those bokes, whiche are fountaynes and head sprynges of all true, perfecte, and christian religio~.
Notable is ye se~tence of Plato which affirmeth that the publique weale is mooste fortunate greatly auau~ced, if such as be the gouernours therof be either wyse or studiouse of wysedome.
Therfore doeth the scripture in so many places exhort the ciuile magistrates to be learned in the lawe of god.
But pray you tel vs, had the ge~tilman none other bokes but only ye new testame~t? Phi.
reme~bre ryght wel, yt he had many other godlye bokes, as ye obedie~ce of a christe~ ma~, the parable of ye wicked Ma~ mo~, ye reuelatio~ of Antichrist, the sum of holiscripture, the boke of Iohn Frith against purgatory, al ye boks published in the name of Theodore Basil, wt diuers other learned mens worckes, In these godly treatises, this au~cie~t ge~tilma~ amo~ge the mou~tains rocks occupied him self both dilige~tly and vertuouslye.
would not lightly haue beleued that such a ma~ coulde haue bene fou~de in so barbarouse and rude a cou~try, nor yt so fruitful works had bene placed in so vnlearned a regio~.
Neyther wold the prophete Helias haue beleued yt ther had bene any godly me~ left aliue besides him self, whe~ kyng Achab his wicked wife Iesabel had cruelly murthered suche great numbre of ye Lordes Prophets seruau~tes, til god made him answer said.
haue yet re serued to me. vii. M. me~, whiche haue not bowed their knees before Bal. Whe~ the Papistes Antichristes thynke their kyngdome moste strongest and most lyke to continue, then is it most nighe vnto downe fall, so worcketh God for the auauncemente of hys glorye, and for the profite of hys poore afflicte congregati on.
When the enemies of God burne good men, and consume theyr bokes vnto ashes, then are these martyrs the better credited their doctrine ye more regarded, their bokes both ye more warely kept hold in ye greater reuere~ce.
For ther be certain bokes whose reme~brau~ce hath falle~ away lo~g before this tyme fro~ the mindes of the people, if they had not furiously, and without co~sideratio~ bene conde~pned for heresy.
But whe~ the people saw them conde~ned no cause whye, but plaine tyrannye.
Sic volo, sic iubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas: It caused the~ to haue the more respect vnto the bokes, and when they had read them, perused them compared them wyth the scriptures of God, perceauynge that in all poyntes they did agre with the~, it caused the readers to haue an euil opinion of the aduersaries, and to embrace and safelye kepe the bokes as holy reliques, and precious treasures.
So yt where the Papistes soughte a final destructio~ to the bokes bi burning the~, contrary to theyr expectatio~ they haue made them as it were immortal, won to the authors of them a noble fame, glorious renowme.
Uery truly, is it saied of Solomo~, ther is no wisdome no forecast, no councell that can preuaile against the Lord.
Truth it is, but to returne vnto ye Peke, of what sort pray you are the people co~cerninge christe~ religio~.
Whe~ was ther, al theyr religion co~sisted in hearing mattens, masses, in super sticious worshipping of Saynctes, in hyeringe soule caryars to syng trentals, in pattering vpon beades, and in suche other popeishe pedlary.
The history of the gentylman caused me not so muche to reioyce, as the hearynge of this maketh me sory.
Do ye wonder? What wonder is it? When suche as should lead them in the light of Christes gospel, are the very self darcknes.
The eye, yt is to saye, ye preacher of gods word is ye light of the body, yt is, of the whole co~gregation of Christe.
If ye eye be single, yt is to say, if the curate or preacher be godly learned, then shal al the body be ful of lighte, yt is the christe~ co~gregation shal haue the word of god dwel in the~ plentuously, trulye walke in yt light of Gods most blessed wyll, wtout haltinge on boeth partes.
But if the eye be darkenes, yt is to say, if the preacher be vnlearned, how great the~ shal the dark nes be, yt is, howe ignorau~te and blind shal the grosse tude people be? Is not this the saying of Solomo~.
Whe~ the preaching of Gods worde faileth, the people perish and come to nought.
The priestes are the salte of the earth in dede, but if the salt be vnsauery haue loste his saltnes, what can be salted ther wt? It is afterward good for nothing but to be cast out to be trode~ vnder fote of me~.
can not deny, but yt the priests in yt cou~trey are very baselylearned, in a maner such as are pointed of ye prophet saying.
The curats are blind euery one of the~, thei are altogither wt oute knowledge, they are dombe dogs not able to barke. &c. Euse The priests for the most part vniuersally thorowe ye realme, are suche as Ezechiel crieth oute on saiyng.
Wo be to ye shepheards of Israel which fede the~ selues.
Should not the shepherds fede ye floke? Ye haue eate~ vp ye milke Ye haue clothed you wt ye wolle, the best fedde haue ye slayne, but the stoke haue ye not nourished the weake haue ye not holde~ vp, the sicke haue ye not healed, the brok√® haue ye not bounde togyther, the outecastes haue ye not brought againe, the lost haue ye not sought vp, but churlishly, cruelly haue ye ruled the~ &c. Chri.
Wher suche vnlearned pastours beare rule, no maruell though papistrie be not exiled.
If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the dytche.
The people wher hauetraueiled for the most part are resonable and quiet inough, yea and veri co~for mable to Gods truth.
If any be stobournlye obstinate, it is for fault of knowledge, and bicause they haue bene seduced of blynd guids.
It should help very much vnto an vniformitie in religion, vnto the saluation of christen mennes soules, if there were learned curates appointed in euery parish, if so many ca~ not be founde, the~ to place in euerye cou~try certaine learned godly preachers, which mai go fro~ parishe to parishe, preaching to the people the good wyll, pleasure of god.
And let the other priestes be ministers vnder the superatte~dentes or ouersears, in their abse~ce read to the people ye saide scriptures, the homiles, reuere~tly minister the sacrame~tes, sit the sicke people, make colleccions for the poore, vertuo uslye brynge vp the youthe of the towne.
If this were broughte to passe, what a flowrishing realme should we haue? How shold lear nig vertue prosper? How purely should we honour God? How faithfully should one of vs loue an other? What christia~ workes should issue out of our dayly co~uersatio~ liuing.
doubt not but yt the kinges maiestie wt his most honourable cou~cel will veri gratioussi co~sider these thin ges, yea that wt expeditto~ Chri.
pray you continued you there stil to this returne into the coun trey.
While was in the Peke, learned yt R. Wysdome was in Stafforde shere, ye know the ma~ am sure Eus.
We know him to be a godli ma~ in his co~uersatio~, a faithful preacher in his doctrine, and such one as hathe not bene altogither fre fro~ persecution for the maintenau~ce of gods truth.
He was ye same to me, yt Aristarchus was to Paule.
Desieringe greatly to se him, bad frindes in ye Peke fare well, made hast towarde him.
Whe~ came to him, did not onli reioice to se him in health, but also gaue god tha~kes yt he was so wel placed prouided for.
For fou~d hym in the house of a certaine faythfull brother called Iohn Olde, a ma~ olde in name, notwithstandinge yonge in yeres, yet uncie~te in true Godlines christen life.
He receyued vs ioyfully into his house, liberallye for the Lordes sake, ministered all good thinges to our necessities.
And as he bega~ne, so did he co~tinue a right herty frend, dearly louing brother so long as we remained in ye cou~trie.
Eue~ as blessed Paule wished to Onesiphorus, so wish to him, and wt the same words pray for him, ye lord grau~t to hym that he may fynde mercy wt the Lord in ye day.
After yt we had passed ouer certain daies in the house of yt moste louing brother, refreshing our selues wt the co~forte of ye holy scrip+tures, after so many greuous te~pests, troublous stormes, pain ful labours know not of what frend our deare brother Robert wisdome was called awai bi letters, which was to vs boeth, no smal paine griefe.
Notwithsta~ ding we submitted our selues to the good plesure of God, wt this hope conforte, yt his returne to his olde familiars should make greatly to ye auau~ceme~t of gods glory, and to the quietnes of his christen studies, whereof might spring hereafter no smal co~modi tie to the christe~ publique weale And so we wishinge one to an other the assiste~ce of Gods spirite repentaunce of oure former life, strength of faith perseuerau~ce in al godlines to our last end, de parted, yea that not wt out teares.
Did he write nothing al ye time yt he was in those parties? Phi.
He was euer vertuous occupied, suffered no houre to pas awai wt out good fruit.
He is a ma~ in who~ ye feare of god reigneth vnfainedly.
Besides his other workes, of this am sure yt he hath writte~ veri godly fruit ful expositio~s vpo~ certain Psal. of Dauid, of the whiche also he trau~slated some into english meter very learnedly.
He hath writte~ also many godly learned set mo~s vpo~ the epistles Gospels that are read in ye te~ples on sondaies, part wherof haue both sene read.
Moreouer he hathe trau~slated the postill of Antonius Coruinus and diuers other learned me~s works.
And, which had almost forgotten, he hath made a confutation of those errours which were imputed lat ed to his charge veri vniustly of his aduersaries, a boke farsed wt al kind of godli learning.
These his works are not pri~ted nor comunely published abrode. pHiIe.
They shoulde wtoute doubt bring greate profit to the readers, highly auau~ce ye glory of god.
But pray you, what exercise did you practise in Stafford there after his departure, Phi.
According to my tale~te brought vp youth in knowledge of good litterature instil led into their brestes the eleme~ts principles of Christes doctrine teaching the~ to know their Lord god, to beleue in him, to fear loue him, studiouslye to walke in his holy waies fro~ their very cradels euen to ye yeldinge vp of their last breath.
dout not, but that Christ was so depeli graue~ in their hertes at yt tyme, yt he is not yet worne oute, neither as trust shal be so lo~g as they lyue.
Howe sauoured the people christ his doctrine in those par+ties, whe~ you were ther? phi.
Not altogither vnlike yE people of the Peke, but yt they were not in all points comunli so superstitious they sauoured somwhat more of pure religio~.
This thi~ke came to passe thorow certain englishe bokes yt were amo~g them, thorowe traueilers to fro Lo~don.
Ye shold axe, what of ye mouinge of the mou~tains.
In dede whe~ was ther, they were al massemo~gers appliyng their portasse masse boke very dilige~tly, but the holy Bible verie little.
Were they not as he writteth of men of Crete, euyll beastes, and slowe bealies? Phi.
would wish more learned pastours to be appoi~ted for to fede the flocke of Christ.
For they are not suche priestes, as whose lips kepe knowledge, neither can~ their mouth vtter ye lawe of God, if any ma~ sholde require it of them.
If shold rehearse here to you, ye childish ignorau~ce yt was fou~d in priests at ye kinges maiesties visitatio~, it wold make your hert to blede for to co~sider yt such blind curates should haue the ouer sight charg of Christes co~gregatio~. phi.
Their blindenes is rather to be lame~ted the~ to be derided, notwtsta~ding this must nedes say by the way, wysh wt all my hert that the church of Christ mai be purged of such un+profitable cloddes of the earth, at the lest that they maye not occupye the tome and enteye the uyng of a preacher, they them sel ues being altogether vnlearned and more mete to be taught then to teach.
He that shoulde be a curate after S. Paules rule ought to be a ma~ able to teache the peo ple Gods word, yea such a ma~ as should not onely be able to ex hort, but also to conuince ouercome al such as speake agaynste the trueth.
great faut in thys behalfe is to be imputed vnto the Byshoppes, which admitted such vnlearned asses vnto ye order of priesthod.
The patrons of the benefites are not altogether blameles for geuing the lyuinges to suche ignoraunt men, wether it be for affection or for rewardes, neyther shal theyr punishment, feare, be smal at ye day of iudgme~t.
For if whan the blind ledeth the blind, both faule into ye ditch, what shal we tha~ say of the~, which are the occasio~ that the blind gide wt hys blynd floke faule into ye dich, yt is to saye, into euerlasting da~nacion? Shal not the bloude of them that perishe be required at the Patrons handes in the dredeful daye of iugeme~t? If put a swerde in a mad mans hand, which with the same immeadiatli killeth a nother ma~: am not giltye of the bloude of hym that is slayne? Phi.
Let these thynges passe, for doubte ye not the kyngs highes with his most honorable counsel wil most graciously prouide for the redresse of such abuses.
Dyd you tary praie you cotinually in Stafforde shere vntyl ye returned into youre countrey? Phile.
After that had consumed a yeare in that countrye and some what more in the vertuouse educacion and Godlye bringyng vp of youthe, departed into Warwyke shere, where in lyke maner as afore frelye enioyed the liberallytie of my moste swete deare frende Iohn Olde, whiche impelled by vorgent causes departed into that countrye for to inhabite.
There likewyse taught diuers gentil mens sonnes, whiche truste, if they lyue, shal be a beutie to the publique weale of Egland both for the preferment of true religion and for the maintenaunce of Iustice.
trauailed boeth in Darbye shere, in the peke, in Stafford shere and in Lechester shere, yet Warwyke shere was to me moste dere and pleasaunt.
In Lecester shere (as maye passe ouer the other) had familiarite only wt one learned man a contriman of oures called Iohn Aylmer, a maister of arte of the vniuersitie of cambrige, a yong man singularly well learned both in the latine greke onge, teacher to my Lord Marques Dorset his children, but Warwicke shere ministred vnto me theacqueyntaunce and frenshyppe of many learned me~.
What are their names praye you? For nothynge deliteth me more than to heare of learned men.
Friste commeth to my remenbraunce a man worthey to be loued and reuerenced of all true herted christen menne not only for the puernes of his lyfe, whiche hath alwayes before the world ben innoce~t and blameles, but also for the sinceritie and godlynes of his Euange lyke doctrine, whyche synce the beginyng of hys preaching hath in al poyntes ben so co~formable to the teachynge of Christe and of his Apostles that the veri aduersaryes of Gods trueth wyth all their manachynge wordes and cruell emprisonme~tes could not wyth drawe hym from it, but that so euer he hadde once preached, he valeauntly defended the same before the worlde wythout feare of any mortall creature althoughe of neuer so great powre and highe authoritie, wishynge minding rather to suffer not onli losse of worldely possessions, but also of lyfe, than the glorye of God and the trueth of Christes Gospel shoulde in any poynte be obscured or defaced thorow him.
Hys lyfe was not dere vnto hym so that he might fulfil his course wyth ioye and the office that he receiued of the Lorde Iesu to testifie the Gospell of Goddes fauoure.
He myghte wel saye wyth the holy Psalmographe, spake Lorde, of thy testimonies and ordinauntes in the presence of Kynges, Princes and Rulars, and was not abashed.
muche desyre to knowe hys name tell it vs pray you. phile.
Ye haue hearde am sure of Maister Latimer sometyme By shoppe of Worcester? Chri.
Hys noble fame and vertuouse renoume is more knowen not only in thys Realme of England but also in foren countries a monge boeth learned and vnlearned, than it can be hid.
xx. yeres in the vniuersite of Cambig to whom nexte vnto God am specially bounde to gyue moste hertye thankes for the knoweledge, if any haue, of God and of hys moste blessed worde. phile How so? Chri.
was so~etyme a pore scholar of Cambrige verye desirous to haue the knoweledge of good letters, and in the tyme of my beynge their, thys godly man preached manye learned and christen sermons both in latyn englishe tong, at the whiche al, for most parte was present, and although at ye tyme was but a chylde of xvi. yeres yet noted hys doctryne so well as coulde, partly reposynge it in my memorye, par lye commendynge it to letters as moste faythfull treasurers vn to memory.
was presente whan wyth manifeste authorities of Godes word and argumentes inuicible besides the allegations of doctoures he proued in hys Sermons, that the holye scriptures ought to be read in the English tong of al christe~ people, whether they were priestes or laie men, as they be called, which thynge diuers drowesy dunsers wyth certayne fals fliynge flatering Friers coulde not abyde, but openly in their vnsauery sermons resisted hys godlye purpose, euen as Alexander the copersmyth and Elymas the sorcerer with manye other resisteth blissed Paule and hys Godly doctryne, not wythstandynge he (yea rather God in hym, whose cause he handeled) gate the victorye, and it came to passe accordyng to his teaching.
Neyther was absente whan he inueighed agaynste temptle workes, good ententes, blynde zale, supersticious deuocion. &c. as the payntynge of tabernacles gylddynge of Images, settynge vp of candles, ronnynge on pilgrimage such other idle inuencions of men, whereby the glory of God was obscured and the workes of mercy the les regarded.
remember also howe he was wonte to rebuke the beneficed men wyth the authoritie of Gods worde for neglectyng and not teaching their flocke and for beinge absente from their cures, they them selues beynge idle and mastinge them selues lyke hoggs of Epicurus flocke, taking no thoughte thoughe theyr pore parishners miserably pine a waye, sterue, perishe and dye for hunger.
Neither haue forgotten howe he at that time condemned folyshe vngodly and impossible vows to be fulfilled as the vowe of chastitie, wyshinge rather yt libertie of mariag might be grau~ted to the~ whiche haue so vowed by the highter powres, than so to continewe thorowe single lyfe in all kind of abhominable vncleanes.
howe vehemente was he in rebukynge all sinnes, namely Idolatrie, fals and idle swering couetousnes and whoredome? agayne howe swete and pleasaunt were hys wordes in exhortynge vnto vertue? He spake nothynge but it leafte as it were certayne prickes or stinges in the hertes of the hertes, which moued them to consent to hys doctrine.
None excepte they were stifnecked and vncircomcised in herte, wente a waye from hys sermons, whiche were not ledde wyth a fayethful repentaunce of their former lyfe affected wyth hight detestacio~ of synne, and moued vnto all Godlines and vertue.
dyd knowe certayn men, whych thorowe the persuasion of their frendes went vnto hys Sermons swellynge, blowne full and puffed vp lyke vnto Esoppes Frog, wyth enuye and malyce agaynste hym but whan thei returned, the Sermon beynge done, and demaunded howe they lyked hym and hys doctrine, they answered wyth the Byshoppes and Pharises seruauntes.
Ther was neuer ma~ that spake lyke vnto thys man, so sharppe a two edged swerde is the worde of God (it entreth thorowe euen vnto the deuydynge of the soule and the spirite, and of the ioynctes and the mary) so watchethe God vpon hys worde, so causethe the father of heauen hys worde not to returne vnto hym voyde, but to do what so euer hys good pleasure is, and to take roote and bringeforth fruite in them that are afore ordeined vnto euerlastynge lyfe, in some an hondered fold, in some thre skore fold, in some thir folde.

Neyther do here reherse howe beneficiall he was accordynge to hys possibilitie to pore scholars and other nedye people, so conformable was his lyfe to hys doctrine, so watered he wyth good dedes, what so euer tofore he planted with godly wordes, so laboured he with al maine boeth in word and dede to wyne and allure other vnto the loue of christes doctrine and hys holy religion ther is a como~ sayinge, which remayneth vnto this daye, When Maister Staforde read, and Mayster Latimer prea ched, than was Cambridge blessed.

As maye passe ouer the gyftes of nature and suche goodly qualities, as winne vnto them that haue them the fauoure and commendacion of men, wherwith he was plentu ously endued, this vnfaynedly saye vnto you, he was a man of a verye perfecte lyfe, and if maye so speake, of an Angellike conuersacio~, approuedly learned in the Hebrue, Greke and latine tonges, and suche one as hadde thorowe hys payneful laboures obtained singulare knoweledge in the misteries of gods most blessed worde.
doubte whether he was more bownde to blissed Paule for leauinge those Godly Epistles behynde hym to cusituet and teach the congregation of God, wherof he was a dere member, or that Paulle, whyche before hadde so many yeres been foyled wyth the folyshe fantases and eluyshe exposicions of certayne dotynge doctours and as it were drowned in the dirye dregges of the drowsye dunsers, was rather bownde vnto hym, seynge that by hys industrye laboure, payne and diligence he semed of a dead man to make hym a liue agayne and puttynge a waye all vnsemlines to set hym forth in hys natiue coloures, so that nowe he is boeth sene, reade and hearde not wythout greate and singular pleasures of them that trauayle in the studies of hys moste godlye Epystles.
And as he beutified the letters of blessed Paul wyth hys godlye exposicions, so lyke wyse dyd he learnedlye setforth in hys lectures the natiue sense and true vnderstandynge of the fore Euaungelistes, viuely restoryng vnto vs the Apostls mynde the mynd of those holye wryters, whyche so manye yeares before hadde lien vnknowen and obscured thorowe the dark nes and mistes of the Pharises and Papistes.
He was a faythful and prudent seruaunte, geuinge meate to the Lordes howshoulde in due time He dyd caste awaye profane and olde wyues fables, and as the good seruaunte of Iesu Christe he exersised him self vnto godlynes: He was an ensample to the faythful in worde, in conuersacion, in loue, in spirite, in fayth, in puritie.
He gaue hys mynde to readinge to exhortynge, to doctryne.
He studied to shewe hym selfe vnto god a laudable worke man yt nedeth not to be asha~med deuidyng, the word of truth iustly.
He was gentle vnto euery ma~ and wyth mekenes enformed the~ that resisted the trueth, if God at any tyme would gyue the~ repentaunce for to knowe the trueth, to turne agayne from the snare of the deuyll.
He foughte a good fyght, he fulfylled the course, he kepte the fayeth, therfore is ther layed vp for him a croune of righ tuousnes, whyche the Lord that ryghtuous iudge shal geue hym in that daye, not to hym onelye, but to al them that loue hys com minge.

How like you this Iewell? Is it not boeth goodlye and preciouse? Is it not worthe ye lokynge on as they saye? Is it not a Iewel worthye to be worne of euerie true herted christia~ man? Euse.
It is a Iewel in dede not onely amiable and pleasaunt in aspecte, but also very confortable and holsome to a Christian mannes conscience.
It is no apte Iewell for the wicked worldelinges bellied hypocrites, which lyke to soppes cocke set more by a barly corne, then by all the preciouse stones in the world, of thys sort chiefely.
For if menne estraunged frome the publique weale of the true Israelites, car nallye mynded, vncircumsed in herte, disobedient to the yoke of Christ, not regenerate bi the spirite of God, nor renewed by the holy baptisme, but in all poynts led captyue at the deuilles pleasure wt the affectes of the world, shoulde heare thys aforesayed sentence of the holy apostle recited to them, chiefly of such one as is enprisoned, fettred, bound in chaynes (as blessed Paul was, what tyme he wrote thys Epistle vnto the Phillyppians) which are instrume~tes to the vo luptuouse worldelynges of no gladenes but of sadenes, of no ioye and pastaunce, but of sorow and greuaunce, they woulde no lesse then maruaile at hys fondnes, yea it is to be thought, that they would laugh him to scorne as a person transposed and far set beyond the limites of wyttye reason, and reasonable wytte, seynge he exhorteth vnto yt whiche in so greate stormes and tempestes of troublous aduersitie no herte led wt humaine wisedome can easily approue, so blinde, foleishe, ignoraunte, and of no capacitie, felynge or vndersta~ding in spiritual thynges, is the wisedome of this world, as.

The heade rulers amonge the Iewes, the byshops, the priests, the scribes, the Phariseis, ye Saduces, the Lawiers wyth manye other, whyche were in christes time proue this thing euidently true inoughe, whyche although in theyr owne conceite puffed vp wt the excellent know ledge of Gods misteries, perceyuynge nothynge at all of Christes blessed doctrine, so trulye is it saied of the holy Apostle, The wisdome of thys world is foleyshnes before God.
To knowe Christe Christes doctrine, aright is the singu ler gifte of God, wrought in our hertes by hys holye spirite, as Christe hym selfe testifieth, sayinge.
No man ca~ come vnto me, except the father which sent me, draw hym, and wyll rayse him vp in the laste daye.
It is written in the prophetes, all shall be taughte of God, therfore euerye one yt hathe hearde of the father, and hathe learned, he cometh to me.
In the Gospel of blessed Mathew our sauiour Christ geueth thankes to his heauenly father, bycause he hathe hydden the knowledge of hys misteries frome the wyse and prudente of thys worlde, whyche gloried in theyr owne wysedome, and hath reueyled them to the lyttle ones that is to saye, to theym that be humble mynded, meke in spirite lowly in herte, and euen such as ascribe al glory and honoure to God and not to the~selues.

But thys oure Apostle fayethfull Embassadoure sente from god the father to be a doctour to the gentyls in fayth and veritie, a true citizyn of the newe celestial Hierusalem, abundantlye replete wyth the fruites of ye holye Goste, and plentuouselye endued wyth wysedome from aboue to vnderstand and declare the excellente misteries of Goddes moste hyghe prouidence hid in ye bosome of his diuine secrets fro~ euerlasti~g, now in this last age reueiled published sette abrod to ye great co~fort of al faithful penitent sinners thorow hys son Iesu Christ our Lord.
This our apostle saye, eue~ in ye mids of his chaynes setters writeth to the Philippia~s, and by theim to all other true christians, and exhorteth the~ to be merye, and to reioyce in ye Lord.
He is nothing dismayed, nor yet abashede, of hys bo~des, chaines, and fetters, of his enprifonnyge, lockynge, stockyng, but beyng of a franke courage and lusty stomake, not onely to suffer chaynes, but also death, if the good wil of God so be, he wyth a vehemencye of spirite, and stoutenes of herte commau~deth vs not to be discouraged wyth what so euer kynde of aduersitie we be assailed, but va leantly and vnfainedli to repose fyxe, set the eies of oure mynd on ye Lord, in him, in him alone to reioyce at all tymes.
Reioyce in the Lorde alwaye, sayth he, once againe say reioyce.
Euery man moueth other to delighte in that thynge speciallye, wherin he him self hath reposed his chefe delectation.
The couetuouse man hath his greatyst de lighte in temporall possessions, and as he is only bent to the accumulatynge and heapynge vp togyther of worldely goodes, so in like maner doth he exhorte so many as he tenderlye loueth to set theyr myndes on gatherynge togyther the Goodes of thys world, beynge not vnlike them, whiche are euer criynge, Adfer, adfer, Bringe hyther, bryng hyther, The papist hath hys mind altogither set on papistry, therefore, laboureth he to the vttermoste of hys power to allure other vnto hys pernitiouse da~nable sect.
Therfore the blessed Apostle haueynge hys principall ioye in the Lord our God, exhorteth, moueth, flyrreth vs earnestly to reioyce in the lord, that we may be partakers wt hym of one, the same glorye.
He is not conente him selfe onely to be in the fauoure of God, excepte he haue other also to be in the bowels of Iesus Christe.
In the Epistle vnto the Romayns, he wysheth him selfe to be cursed from Christ, so that his brethren the Israelites, whyche were his kynsmen as pertaynynge to the fleshe mighte be saued.
He disse~ted not much from the maners of Moyses that most excellent Prophet of God, which perceyuyng that God was minded to destroye the chyldren of Israell for theyr abhominable Idolatry in worshyppynge the golden calfe, desiered God very hertely yt he woulde eyther forgeue them that fault, or els wype him oute of the boke of lyfe.

But we shall note that saynct Paule pricketh not vs forwarde vnto the reioysyng in worldlye carnal thynges but vnto a perfecte ioy in ye lord our God, which endureth for euer.
For what thing is comprehended in the whole circle of the worlde, wherein we maye worthely reioyce? Co~sider the ayre aboue, ye earth vnderneth, with the depe waters in the secrete inferiour partes of the world, marke dilige~tlye if in the~ any thynge be co~tayned yt may bring to vs true perfect ioy.
They may delite our fa~seis, moue our affects for a certain space to delectacio~, while we behold, hear, fele or taste them, but how sone doth this carnal delectatio~, worldli ioy vanish awai? yea howe sone are we weary of the~, if measure be exceded? Musicall instrumentes fede the eare with very swete and pleasaunte armony, and for a tyme greatly exhilarate, chere, and co~fort our weried spirites, but in how short space do we loth them, if they be continuallye played vpon or exercised out of time? And though we delite neuer so greatly in the~, doeth not the sownde strayghte waye perysh, we receyue none other commoditie then losse of tyme? Theo.
The wise man saith Like as the Carbuccle stone shineth that is set in gold, so is the swetnes of musike by the mirthe of wyne.
Yea but what foloweth? The best is behynde as they saye.
This se~tence of the wyseman doeth not condemne Musicke nor wyne, so that the vse of them be moderate and excedethe not measure, notwythstandynge it preferreth the loue of wisdome that is to saye, a feruent desire to knowe the wyll of God, and aduaunceth that aboue both wyne and musyke.
wyshe that al men, but cheifely such as be of nobilitie, dyd knowe and woulde practise this afore saied sentence.
For many delyghte in Musike, but fewe in the loue of wysdome Many couet to excel in singyng playng and dauncing, but in the knowledge of Gods worde very fewe.
Many can abide to spende whole dayes and whole nyghtes in musicall exercises, but in hearynge or readinge the holy scriptures, they thynke one holy day in aweke a great matter, whe~ the one moueth vnto vertue, the other vnto vyce, 'the one getteth the fauour of God, the other pro uoketh hys wrath, indignacion and ve~geaunce, the one lifteth vp vnto heauen, the other detrudeth and thrusteth dou~e into hell fire.
To say the trueth, musicke is a more vayne and triefelinge science, than it becommeth a man borne appoynted to mat ters of grauitie, to spende muche tyme aboute it.
And al thoughe haue learned of histories, ye diuers haue exercised minstrelsye both kings philosophers, which thyncke vsed it as a remedy agaynste the tediousnes of there paynefull labours, and to make them the more apt to returne vn to matters of great importau~ce: yet remember well that it was counted a reproche in many.
Kynge Philipe whan he hearde hys sonne Alexander that trium phante conqueroure synge and play very pleasauntly, checkingly rebuked him saiyng, arte thou not ashamed, that thou canste playe and synge so conningely? Meanynge that other artes and sciences are more worthi a king.
An heathen Prince thought that a great faute in his sonne, which Christen rulears counte worthy of hyghe commendacion and singulare prayse.
Sextus Nero the Emperoure, lieynge on hys death bedde greately lamented that he was so excellente in the science of musicke, wyshyng that he hadde spente that tyme in good letters and vertuous exercises, whereby he myghte haue bene made the more able iustelye and truli to gouerne hys realme.
Woulde God that hys repentaunce myghte be a warnynge to all noble men.
Ther haue bene, would God ther were not nowe, which haue not spared to spende much ryches in norishynge many idle singynge men to bleate in their chappeles thinckinge so to do God an high sacrifice, and to pipe downe their meate and theire dryncke and to whystle them a sleape, but they haue not spente any part of their substaunce to fynd a learned ma~ in their houses to preach the word of God, to haste them to vertue and to dissuade them from vyce.
Therfore swarmed their howses wyth pride, ambicion, vaine glorye, couetousnes, whoredome, swearinge, stealinge, polling, pic kinge, enuie, malice, fightinge, flattery, supersticion, Hypocrisie, papistrie, Idolatrie and al kinde of abhominacion, as it must nedes come to passe, wher the word of God is banished thoughe ther be neuer so muche massinge and maskynge accordynge to the say inge of Solomon, whan the preachynge of gods worde fayleth, the people perishe and come to naught.
It becommeth kynges, princes and rulars rather to here the preacher of gods worde and to gyue eare vnto the lamentable voyces and humble upplications of their pore aflict and oppressed subiectes, than to hearken to the sownde of vayne instrumentes, and to delighte in in hearynge the fylthy and trifelinge songes of droncken Musicions, which rather prouoke vnto fleshelye fantascis than vnto vertuous exercises.
Christen mans melodie after S. Paules mynde consisteth in herte, whyle we recite Psalmes, himnes and spirituall songes, and syng to the Lorde in oure hertes, geueynge thankes al wayes for al thynges vnto God the father in the name of oure Lorde Iesus Christe, Al other outward melodye is vaine and transitory, and passeth away and commeth to naughte.
Uayne and traunsitorye is it in dede, notwithstandyng Musicke maye be vsed, so it be not abused.
If it be so berly exercised and reputed as an hande mayde vnto vertue it is tollerable, otherwyse it is execrable and to be abhorred of all good men.
So that ye perceyue, that Musicke is not so excellente a thyng, that a Christe~ ma~ ought ernestly to reioise in it.
It is euident inough, seinge that it endureth not, but pa sseth awaye lyke other thynges subiecte to vanity.
Ther are yt greatly delight in buildinge gorgeous houses sumptuous mansions, but howe vayne is their delectacion? Wha~ they haue spente innumerable riches in erectinge their pleasau~t and fayre houses, what haue thei but a greate heape of stones cou ched one vpon a nother, whiche for a litle season fedeth the eye well, but whan we be once goone what profyte carye we awaye wyth vs? The holye Patriarkes of the olde tyme remembrynge howe vayne it is to delyghte in gorgeous houses buylte them tentes, and in those safely dwelte considerynge wyth them selues that they were but straungers and pilgrimes, and therfore prepared them houses not for thys world but for the worlde to come by couchynge there treasures in the bosomes of poore menne.
To buylde necessarye and conueniente houses for oure vse is not vngodly, as iudge, but to repose oure delyght in them, or so to spend oure goodes on buildynge that the poore people are ye les regarded, socoured, releaued and holpen, thys is wicked, this is vngodly.
Buildynge is the daughter of phansye and maye in a maner be compared to the webbe of Penelope.
For that one setteth vp, ano ther after the disbursinge of many powndes, destroyeth, and buil deth it vp againe with double ex pences the thirde succedeth, and his pha~tasy not fully satisfied, he agayne altereth the buildynge and addeth threfolde charge, so that to build (I spake of to much gorgeous and not necessary houses) is nothyng else than to dalie wyth the worlde and to be led with fansy.
What was in tyme paste more gorgeous than Rome, whan she was called the Ladye and heade of the worlde? What was more sumptuousiye buylt than the te~ple of Solomo~? yea and that at gods commaun demente, as maye passe ouer many aunciente and famous cities? what is become of them? Howe are they decayde? Manye are come to suche and so greate downe faule and to so extreme tuine, so deformed, so destroyed, so co~sumed to death that ther remaineth not somuche as a steppe, neyther is there lefte of them any mencion at all.
Well were it wythe Christen religion, if christen men woulde remember this sente~ce of blessed Paul.
We haue no dwellyng place in thys world, but we lobe for another to come Tha~ should the hea uenly mansion be more desired soughte after.
But nowe manye builde and they knowe not who shal enherite, in ye mios of these their gorgious buildinges ye pore people are not co~sidered nor prouided for.
Woulde God all such as so greatly delite in costu ous buildinges, would somtime set this sente~ce of the wyseina~ before theyr eyes If yu kepeste not thy selfe, sayeth he, in the feare of the Lord continually, thy housse shal sone be subuerted, topled ouer brought to noughte.
Me thinke yt thys curious buyldyng, whych al moste vniuersalli is vsed now a daies among vs is a great toke~ of the daye of iud gemente beinge at hande.
For Christe in the Gospel, amonge other tokens reciteth buildyng to be one of ye cheife wherbi we may learne yt the commyng of the son of man vnto the teribleiudgeme~t is at ha~d as. s. Iames sayth.
perceyue now right ryght wel ye are fully persuaded that no man ought to reioyce in gorgeous buildynges, wherein many delighte nowe a dayes.
The history of the riche man in the Gospell maketh vs afraid, which was a buil der also, and whe~ he had finished hys buildinge and couched hys goods in his faire large houses thinking yt he should haue lyued many yeres, sodenly it was sayed vnto hym, yu fole thys nyghte shal they take away ye life fro~ the, and tha~ whose shal these thinges be that yu hast gathered togither? Phile.
To enioye greate possessions in thys worlde semeth not to a fewe a singulare commoditie high profite, but with how many cares troubles are they acco~pa ned? With what great labour at thei gote~ scraped vp together? With what carfulnes disquiet of mynde are they kept, the hordets vp of them being at al houres in more feare left they should be taken awaie from them either by robbynge, pollynge, pillinge burning, or by some other chau~ce Howe shortly are they consumed and broughte to naught, whiche were not gathered together with out long time and great sweate? So vaine and transitorye be the goodes of the world.
Againe, are not the wordly possessions many tymes lefte to suche heytes, as spende them no lesse prodigally, than their auncitours got them hardely and kept them niggardly? What iuste cause also hath a ny man to reioyce in temporall riches, seing that at the dreadful day of iudgeme~t they shal render a straight acco~ptes of euery farthing to the high euerlastinge.
Iudge Christ, how they haue bestowed them? For God hath not endeued the rich men wyth their possessions that they should spe~d the~ at their pleasure and phansy, but accordinge to hys most godlye commaundemente, wyll and pleasure.
Syluer is myne, and golde is myne, sayeth the Lorde of hostes.
Hereto agreeth the say inge of the Psalmographe, the earth is the Lordes, and all that is contayned in it.
The Lorde hath committed hys goodes to the ritche men, and he wyll cale them to accomptes a gaine to se how they haue bestowed the~, and what thei haue won and gotte~ by the exercise of the~ for the Lordes auauntage, as we maye se in the Gospell.
If ther be fou~d vnprofitable seruauntes, and haue not bestowed them in settingeforth the glorye of God, and in the hel pynge of theyr christen brethren, but haue hid the~ vp in the grou~d that is to saye, kepte them nigardly to their owne vse, or spent them aboute vayne and wycked thynges, they maye be sure to be bound, fete and handes to be cast into vtter darckenes, where shal be weping and gnashing of teth.
that thse thynges were wel co~sidered, pondered weighed in the iuste balance of resonable discression, than shoulde the ryche men of thys worlde haue litle occasio~ to glorie in their terrestrial and worldly possessions, but rather recounte them moste happie, wealthie and fortunat, to whom least is committed.
For euery man shall rendre accountes of the talentes receiued, be they fewe or many.
Blessed is the ryche, which is founde wyth out blemishe, say eth the wyse man, hath not gon after golde, nor put hys truste in monye and treasures.
Where is there such a one? and we shal co~mend hym, and call hym blessed.
Who so is tried and founde perfecte in suche thynges shal be commended and praysed.
Yea hys good shall be stablished, and the whole congregacion shall declare hys almes Make you frendes, sayeth oure Sauiour Christ, of the vnryghtous Mammo~, that whe~ ye shal haue nede, they maye receiue you into euerlastynge habitacions.
To se the inordinate affecti on insatiable desier, whych the more parte of men haue vnto the goodes of ye world, it is a world.
Aunciente Authours complaine of the couetuousnes vsed in their tyme but if they were now a liue they woulde maruell, and wyth hyghe indignacion wete theyre penne, and wright Satyres and Inuectiues agaynste oure couetous worldlyngs.
For theyr coue tous affectes knowe no ende, ney ther ae thei at any tyme saate, be their abou~dau~ce temporal possessions er so muche ouerflowynge and passynge al measure.
Oh good God, good God, howe do oure spiritual men tumble benefice vpon benefice, and prebende vpon prebende? And yet are they led wyth no care of fedynge Christes flocke neyther corporally nor spirituallye.
Christes threfolde Pasce, is turned in to ye Iewes double Tolle.
They fede nothyng, except them selues they tol catch whatsoeuer cach they may, would God they once woulde be obediente to thys co~maundemente of God gyuen by the wise man.
Let not thyne ha~d be stretched oute to receyue, and shut when thou shouldest geue, byshoppe sayth.
S. Paul (he meaneth euerye spirituall ouersear) ought to maintaynehospitalitie.
For therby haue diuers men receyued into theyr houses Angels vnwares.
As euerye manne hathe receyued the gifte euen minister the same one to an other, as good ministers of the manifolde grace of God.
God in the olde lawe greatly tendering the mayntenaunce of hospitalitie, in hys ministers gaue thys commaundement to hys people for paying theyr tythes, saying.
Bringe ye in all tythes into my barne, that ther mai be meate in my house.
Here God commaunded tythes to be payed, but for what cause, that the ministes should spende them in the court or at the vniuersitie? or aboute whoreynge? or in kepeynge of haukes or dogs? or in maynteynyng a sorte of idle valeau~t lubbers, whych do nothing but consume the good fruites of ye earth Nay verely, but that ther should be meat in his house (for the personage or viccarage is Goddes house) For whom? For the couetouse worldelynges and rich me~ whyche haue no nede of it? Nay syr, not so, but for the pore christi ans, as Christe prescribeth saying, When thou makest a diner or supper, call not thy frendes, nor thy brethrene, neyther thy kynsemen, nor thy ryche neyghbours, leste they also byd the agayne, and a reco~pence be made the.
But when thou makeste a feaste, call the pore, the feble, the lame, and the blynde, and thou shalt be happye, for they can not recompence the.
But thou shalt be recompe~ced at the resurrection of the ryghtuous men.
thinke the greatest cause why priests be conte~ned at thys tyme is, yt they neyther regarde their office in preachynge Gods word nor yet theyr dutye in mayntaynyng hospitalitie.
haue made you, ye priestes, to be despised and to be of no reputatio~ amo~g all ye people, bicause ye haue not kepte my wayes, but haue bene parciall in the lawe.
The wayes and ordinaunces of God, whych he hath prescribed to priestes for to obserue, is truly to preach his holy doctrine reuere~tly to minister hys blessed sacrame~tes, and bountuouslye to mayntayne hospitalitie.
If they would do these thyngs, they shold recouer their honoure whych is due to faythfull ministers by the worde of God as, S. Paule sayeth.
The priestes that rule well, are worthy double honour, specialli thei yt labour in worde and doctrine.
If euer heretofore, in this oure tyme speciallie is thys sayinge of the Prophet found true, From the lest vnto the most thei hange vpon couetuousnes, and from the prophet vnto the priest they go al aboute with falshead and lyes.
How ioyne they Lordshyp to Lordeshyppe, manner to manner, ferme to ferme, land to lande, pasture to pasture, house to house, and house for a vantag Howe do the ryche men, and spe cially suche as be shepmongers oppresse the kinges liege people by deuourynge theyr commune pastures wt theyr shepe, so that the poore people are not able to kepe a cow for the confort of the~ and of their pore familie, but are like to starue perish for ho~ger, if there be not prouision made shortly? What shepe grou~d scapeth these caterpillers of the co~mune weale? How swarme they with aboundaunce of flockes of shepe? and yet when was wooll euer so dere, or mutto~ of so great pryce? If these shepemongers go forthe as they begin, the people shall both miserablye dye for colde, and wretchedly perysh for ho~ger.
For these gredy woulues and comberous cormerauntes, wyll eyther sell theyr woll and theyr shepe at theyr owne price or els they wyll sell none.
Oh what a diuersitie is thys in the sale of wolles, a stone of woll somtime to be sold at. viii. grots and now for. viii. s? And so likewise of the shepe.
If the kynge hys maiestie, with hys most honourable councel do not prouide for the re dresse of these thinges, God him selfe wyll surely se a remedye, as he sayeth by the Psalmongraphe for the wretchednes of the nedye and the bewaylynge of the pore.
Agayne he sayeth, Woe be to the that spoillese, shalte not thou thy selfe be lykewyse spoyled? And thou that despiseste the pouertie, shalte not thou in lyke maner be despised? When thou haste made an ende of pollynge and pyllyng, then shalte thou be polled and pilled thy selfe.
And when thou ceaseste to despise other, then shalte thou be despised and nought set by.
Be thou oure defence, yea, and that shortelye, and be thou oure sauynge health in the time of our trouble.
Ryche men were neuer so muche estraunged frome all pytye and compassion towarde the poore people, as they be at thys presente tyme, they deuour the people as it were a morcell of breade.
If anye pece of grounde delite theyr eye, they must nedes haue it other by hoke or by croke.
If the pore man wyll not satisfy theyr couetouse desyre, he is sure to be molested, troubled, and disquieted on such sorte, that whether he wyll, or wyl not (though boeth he, hys carefull wyfe, and miserable chyldrene wyth hys whole familie should perysh for honger) he shal forgo it, or els it were as good for hym to lyue amonge the furies of Hell, as to dwell by those ryche carles couetouse churles.
Ther is no end of enlargynge theyr groundes, neyther are they ledde wyth any feare of Gods indignation, exprest by the Prophet sayinge.
Wo and euerlastyng damnatio~ be vnto theym that ioyne house to house, and couple land to la~d, so nyghe togither, that the pore can get no more grounde.
Shal ye alone dwell in the myddest of the earth? These thynges are in myne eares, sayeth the Lorde of hostes.
Surely sayeth he, many greate and fayre houses shall be made so desert and wast, that no man shall dwell in them.
Wo and euerlastynge da~nation be vnto him, that heapeth vp other mennes goodes.
Howe longe wyll he lade hym selfe wyth thycke claye vnto his owne damnation? howe sodaynly wyll they stande vp that shall byte the, and awake, that shal teare the in peaces? Yea yu shalt suerlie be theyr praye, Seynge thou haste spoyled manye people, therfore shal they that re mayne spoyle the, bicause of me~nes bloude and for the wronge done in the land, in the citie, and vnto all them that dwell therein Wo and euerlastinge damnation be vnto hym that couetously gathereth euil goten goodes into hys house, that he may set his neste on hie to escape ye power of misfortune thou hast deuised the shame of thine own house, for yu hast slaine to much people hast wilfulli offended, so that the very stones of the wall shal cry out of it, and the tymbre that lyeth betwixte the ioyntes of the buildynge shall answere. ce.

These be greuouse threates of Gods vengeaunce againste the couetuouse worldelinges.
They be no lesse true then greuouse, and shall vndoubtedlye chaunce as it is threatened, excepte the couetous worldlynges repent and amende.
For God is fayethfull in all hys sayinges the worde of the Lorde abideth for euer.
He is the selfe trueth, therfore can he not lye.
What so euer he threateneth, he wyl surelye brynge to passe except faythful repentaunce be a meane.
Are not these hys wordes? Wo and euerlastyng damnation be vnto theym that synne, and kepe not my commaundementes, sayeth the Lord, wyl not surely spare them.
Wo be vnto you, ye wycked personnes, which haue forsaken the lawe of the Lorde, that mooste hyghe God.
If ye be borne, ye shall be borne to curssynge, if ye dye, the cursse shal also be youre portion.
Dauid sayeth, vpon the vngodlye, the Lorde shall rayne snares, fyre, and brymestone, storme, and tempeste: thys shall be theyr portion to drynke.
How doeth our sauiour Iesus Christ thonder agaynste the vngodlye ryche in the holy Gospell.
Wo vnto you that are riche saieth he, for ye haue your consolation.
Wo vnto you that are ful, for ye shall ho~ger, Wo vnto you that nowe laughe, for ye shall wayle and wepe.
These be greuouse wordes agaynste the couetouse wordelynges and voluptuous Epicures, but full little do suche thynges syncke into the breastes of menne nowe adayes, the deuyl hath so blinded theyr eyes, that they thynke that God is a childish God, and will be pleased wyth thys apple at ye laste ende.
Good Lorde forgeue me, trust to be saued by Christes passion, and mani good morrowes So longe as they lyue they neuer repente theyr wicked lyuing they go forth dayly more more to prouoke the wrath of God agaynste theim, they heape synne vpon synne, they wallowe all in pleasures like fylthy swyne, they haue not thefeare of God before their eyes, they are wythoute all mercy towarde theyr christe~ brethrene, they greuouslye oppresse theyr neadye neyghbours, they make no ende of rakeynge togither the goodes of ye world, they folowe the lustes of the fleshe as miserable and bonde captiues, to conclude, theyr whole lyfe is nothynge els but a seruynge of the deuyll, how can these menne at the laste ende truely repent conuerte vnto God, leadynge afore a lyfe abhominable, so wycked, so stynckynge, so hatefull both to God and to al good me~? graunte, the mercy of God is great, excelleth al hys workes, but howe ca~ they which haue led theyr whole lyfe altogyther displeasaunte vnto God, be bolde to craue mercye of God at the last ende, whom all the dayes of theyr lyfe they haue so despised by disobeyinge hys moste Godlye wyll and pleasure? Are not these his wordes spoke~ by kinge Solomon? haue called, and ye refused it.
haue streatched out my hand, and no man regar ded it, but all my counsails haue ye despised, and set my correctio~ at nought.
Therfore shall also laughe in youre destruction, and mocke you, whe~ that thyng that ye feare cometh vpon you, euen when the thynge that ye be a frayed of, falleth in sodaynely lyke a storme, and youre miserye lyke a tempeste, yea, when trouble and heuynes commeth vpon you.
Then shall they call vpon me, but wyll not heare, they shall seke me early, but they shal not fynde me, and that bycause they hated knowledge, and recei ued not the feare of the Lorde, but abhorred my councell, and despised all my creation.
If the tyghtuous shal scasly be saued, sayth blessed Peter where shal the vngodlye and the synner appeare? Euse.
Satan thorowe couetuousnes doeth so possesse the hertes of many menne in these oure dayes, that they do not onelye lincke house to house, but when they haue gotten manye houses and tenementes into theyr handes, yea, whole towneshyppes, they suffer the houses to fall into vtter ruyne, and decaye, so that by this meanes whole townes are become desolate, and lyke vnto a wyldernes, no man dwelling there, excepte it be the shephearde and his dogge.
For my selfe knowe many townes and villages sore decayed, so that where as in tymes paste there were in some town an hu~dred housholds there remaine not now thyrty, in some fifty, ther are not now ten, yea (whyche is more to be lame~ted) knowe townes so wholly decayed, yt ther is neyther sticke nor stone standynge, as they vse to saye.
Wher many men hadde good liuynges, and maynteined hospitalitie, able at all tymes to helpe the kynge in his warres, to susteyne other charges, able also to healpe their pore neyghbours, and vertuously to bringe vp theyr chyldren in Godly letters and good scie~ces, now shepe conies deuoure altogyther no man inhabitynge the aforesaied places.
Those beastes whyche were created of god for the nourishmente of man, do nowe deuoure man.
The scripture sayeth that God made both shepe oxen with al the beastes of the field subiecte vnto man, but nowe ma~ is subiecte vnto them.
Wher ma~ was wont to beare rule, ther thei now beare rule.
Wher man was wo~t to haue his liueing: ther thei nowe only liue.
Where man was wonte to inhabite, ther they now raing and grease.
And the cause of all thys wrechednes and beggary in the commo~ weale are the gredy Gentilme~, which are shipmongars grasiars.
While thei studie for their owne priuat com moditie, the comon weale is lyke to decaye.
Sins they beganne to be shepe Maisters and feders of cattel we neither had vitaile nor cloth of anye resonable price.
No maruell, for these forstallars of the market, as they vse to saye haue gotten all thynges so into their handes, that the poore man must either bie it at their price, or els miserably starue for hongar, and wretchedly dye for colde.
For they are touched wt no pitie toward the pore.
It is fou~d true in the~ yt S. Paul wrighteth.
Al seke ther own adauntage, not those thinges which belonge vnto Iesu Christ.
They whiche in times past were wonte to be fathers of the contrie, are now pollers and pillers of the co~trie.
They which in times paste were wo~t to be the defe~ders of the pore, are now becom ye destroiers of ye same.
Thei by whom the comon weale sometime was preserued: are now become the Caterpillers of ye como~ weale, such as seme by their ma ners to haue made a sole~ vowe vt terli to subuert the como~ weale, to procure ye final destructio~ of ye same.
So they maye abound they care no whoe faulle to the grounde.
So they maye be enriched thei care not who enpoue rished.
They are right brothers of Caine, whiche had rather sl his brother Abell, tha~ he shoulde haue any part with him of world ly possessions.
The wyse ma~ sayeth, the breade of the nedye is the lyfe of ye pore, he that defraudeth him of it, is a mansl ear.
Do not these riche worldlinges defraud the pore man of hys bread, wher by is vnderstande al thynges ne cessary for a mans life, which tho row their insatiable couetousnes sel all thynges at so highe pryce, suffer townes so to decaye that the pore hath not what to eat nor yet wher to dwel? What other ar they than, but verye manslears? They abhore the names of Mo~kes, Friers, Chanons.
And yet where the cloysters kept hospitaliti, let out their fermes at a resonable price norished scholes, brought vp youth in good letters, they do none of all these thynges.
They lightly esteme and in a maner contemne Priestes, parsons, vicares, Prebendaries.
So' that nowe they are become in effecte althoughe not in name, very Monckes, Friers, Chanons, Priestes, Persons, Ui cares, Prebendaryes, and at the last what not? and yet how vainly those goodes be spente, whoe seeth not? The state of England was neuer so miserable, as it is at thys presente.
Good Lorde haue mercy vpon vs and put in the hertes of the kinge and of his cou~sel to redres these intolerable pestilences of the common wealth, or els make haste to dissolue thys wreched world by thy glorious commyng vnto the iudgement, where thou shalt render to euery man accordinge to hys dedes, lest if we lo~g remayne in thys to muche wretchednes, we be compelled thorowe pouertye to attempe vnrightuous thinges, and forswere the name of the our Lorde God.
Wel, of these thynges afore sayed trust ye perceiue that no ma~ oughte to reioyse in the rytches of this world, seing they are none of oures but Godes, and we as the treasures and stuardes, of God must at the dreadful day of iudgement render acomptes to the hyghe Iudge Christe of all that we haue receiued, be it much or litel, seinge also they are verye transitorye fitting from one to a nother in so much that he whych is thys daye a Lorde highely in fauoure and a manne of greate possessions is to morowe a traytoure and not worthe a gallye halfe penye.
gayne if they be abused, they are verye entisementes vnto all myschefe and naughties, they plucke our her tes from God to the deuyll, they make vs Idolaters by seruinge that wycked Mammon they pro uoke the vengaunce of God agaynste vs thei make is to be ab horred of God and of all good men, they plucke from oure bodyes reast from our mindes quietnes from our eyesslepe fro~ our face natural colour, and adde to al the partes of ma~ diste~perau~ce, makinge man a slaue vnto that whiche oughte to be obedient vn to him.
For the wyse man sayeth, their is nothynge worse than a couetous man, neyther is ther a more wicked thyng then to loue money.
For such one hath his soule to sel, and yet is he but filthye dunge while he liueth And the Preacher sayeth, he that loueth money wyl neuer be satisfied wyth monye, and whoso delyghteth in ryches, shall haue no profite thereof.
Where as muche rychesse is, there are many also that spe~d them awaye.
And what pleasure more hath he that possesseth the~ sauinge that he maye loke vpon them with his eyes.
labouring man slepethe swetelye, whether it be litle or much that he eateth but thabou~dau~ce of the rich wyl not suffer hym to slepe, yea many times riches are kept to the hurt of hym that hath them in possession.
For ofte times they perishe wyth his great misery, and trouble, and if he haue a childe, it getteth nothynge.
Lyke as he came naked out of hys mothers wo~be so goeth he thither agayne, and caryeth nothynge awaye wyth hym of all hys laboure. &c. Euse.
It were wysdome for the ryche menne, if they tender their owne saluation and be ledde wyth any hope of the lyfe to come, to heare what blessed Paulle wryghtethe vnto Byshoppe Timothe, and earnestlye to folowe that. ys wordes are these.
Charge them whyche are ryche in thys worlde that they be not hye mynded nor truste in vncertayne ryches, but in the lyuynge God (whiche geueth vs aboundantly al thinges to enioy them) that they do good workes, that they be redy to giue and glad to distribute, leying vp in ore for the~ selues a good fou~ dacion agaynst the time to come, that thei may obtaine eternal lif. Phile.
Then shoulde God be their defender in al their affayres, cause both the~ their posteritie longe to enioye then possessio~s wt the fauoure blessinge of al good men, But let vs go forth, and search whither a ny thynge can be founde in thys transitorye worlde wherein we may worthyly reioyse.
Not afewe do greately reioyse in that, magnifieynge them selues because they descende of noble parentage, and in comparison of them selues they greately dispise other.
Why rather do they not consider yt boeth riche pore, noble vnoble, hie or base do co~siste are made of the same eleme~tes, subiect vnto like diseases bond to ye same affectes? Earth we are al dust, vnto earth dust shal we returne.
As we were made to liue so likewise are we al appointed to die.
Ther is no exception amonge vs. Neither hath ani of vs obtained such priuiledge of God, yt we maye escape ye bondage of fraile nature.
Seing tha~ yt as touching our cor poral creacion ther is no differe~ce no prerogatiue, what nobilitie or worthines of bloud, can there be more in the noble personage tha~ in the base slaue.
Twise mad are thei therefore, yt brag of their noble bloud esteme the~ sel+ues ye more worthy because they desce~d of noble parentages, neither do such any other thing tha~ bost of yt which is none of theirs.
King Dauid sayth, what profite is ther in my bloude, seinge go dou~e vnto corruptio~? And ye wise ma~ sayth, why art yu proude, yu earth ashes? We are al earth ashes boeth noble vnoble, We al shal returne vnto corruption, be so co~sumed as co~cerning our bodies, as though we had neuer bene.
The Prophet also saieth, al flesh is gras, al his glori is like a floure of the field, Wher is any me~cio~ made here of noble bloude know, sayth. s. Paule, that ther dwelleth in me, yt is to saye in my flesh, no goodnes, wher is carnal nobilitie tha~ become? Doth not ye same lothsum vilenes come fro~ ye noble, yt isueth out of ye vnnoble? Are not the carcasses of al personages meate for wormes a lyke? Pour the bloud of the vilaine in one basen and the bloude of the gentleman in an other, what differe~ce shal there be proued? Dig vp the bones out of the sepulchers both of ye noble vnnoble, and who can deserne of the sight of them, which was the seruaunt whych the Lord, who was rich who was poore, who beautifull who deformed, which were noble, and which vnnoble? Ther is no differe~ce, as S. Ambrose sayeth, betwene the carcasses of the deade, except paraduenture it be thys, that the deade corps of the rych stincke more greouslye than the pore because it was more den tely fed.
So far as perceiue, they erre greatly, that bost of the kind red, esteme the~ selues the more worthy because they come of wor they parentes, although they the~ selues be neuer so greate dronckardes, glotones, diceplayers, Whoremongers, swerers, fightters, theues, ruffians, pickers of quarels, riotous persons.
For litle doeth it profite a man to des cend of a noble house, if he hym selfe be of base and vile maners and leade a life defiled with wyckednes, yea it rather bringeth vnto hym ignobilitie than nobilitie.
Well is it sayde of our golden mouthed doctor, the nobilite and goodnes of oure kinsefolke auaileth nothyng, except we our selues be good.
For what doethe noble generacion profite hym, whom, hys maners do defile? Or what doeth vile generacion hurt hym, whome good maners dooe garnishe and adourne? Certes he sheweth hym selfe voyde of al goodnes, yt glorieth in his paren+tes To glorie vpon ye nobilitie of other, sayth Petrarche, is a bostinge euen to be laughed at.
And suche as haue nothynge but the badges, counisauces and armes of their Auncestours to set out their nobilitie with al, they differ not much frome Esopes crowe, which decked him selfe wyth other birdes fethers, he hym selfe being altogither blacke vnami able.
The true nobilitye consisteth neither in strength, beautie, nor riches, no nor yet in any other exernall bodely thyng but in the suppressing of vice and embraseinge of vertue.
Uertue is the alone and onely nobilitie, as Antisthenes was wonte to saye thei that are endued with vertue, they haue the true nobilitie, Notably is it sayd of the golde~ mouthed doctor Iohn Chrisostom.
He is a man of great renoume, he is a worthye personage, he is the true noble man, that disdayneth to serue vices, and by no meanes wyl be ouer come of them? And Cocceus Nerua the Emperour sayde that the vertue of a man and not hys kynnered nor hys contrye is to be considered.
Woulde God all menne of nobilitye were perswaded that vertue and godlye conuersation were the alone and onelye true nobilitie.
Than woulde they not repose their glorye in their auncestours, as many very folishely do at thys present, but rather endeuoure them selues so to traine their life in al godlines and vertue, that euen for their owne god ly and vertuous enterprises thei should be co~pted noble and worthy of prayse.
Euen as Solomon saieth, fauoure is deceitefull, and beautye is a vayne thynge.
They are muche ro the course of true reasonne, that reioyse in so fraile a thynge.
For it is more britle the~ glasse, more transitorye than the flowre, more inconstant than the wynde, more vaine than the smoke, and more fittynge away than the tyme.
Beautye is a thousande maner of wayes corrupted and defaced.
Howe doeth one lytle feauer make the fayrest woman in the worlde, the fowlest the must vnpleasau~t in aspect? And to saye the trueth, is beauty anye other thynge, than a litell thine skyne wel coloured? If the inwarde partes myghte be sene, howe greate filthynes woulde there appeare euen in the moste beautifull personne? Neyther is the fayrest bodiein the world any other thing the~ a dunghyl couered wt a clothe as it wer of white and purple coloure.
And what a madnes is thys for anye person to glorye in beautye, seynge that the beholder of it hath more delectation and pleasure in it, as one that hath the vse and fruition thereof, then suche as are endued with the beautie.
leaue of to speake that beauty is a entisement vnto vncleannes, and a very enemy to chaste and pure conuersation, as we reade in diuers histores.
This semeth to be true by the sayinge of the wise man, Loke not to narrowly sayeth he, vpon the beautye of a woma~, lest yu be prouoked in desire toward hir. Againe he saith, Turne away thy face fro~ a beau tiful woma~, loke not vpon the fayrenes of other.
Many a man hath perished thorowe the beautye of women, for thorowe it the desyre is kyndled as it were fyre Hereto agreeth the sayinge of Solomo~.
Let not thine hert lust after the beauty of a woma~, least thou be taken wt hir faire lokes.
What kindled Dauids hert wt loue toward Bethsabe, the wyfe of Urias, caused him to co~mit adultry wt hir, but only hir beau ti? Dauid, saith ye scripture, arose out of his bed, walked vpo~ the roufe of the kinges palaice, fro~ ye roufe he saw a woma~ washing hir selfe, the woma~ was verye beutiful to loke on.
Again how came it to passe yt the. ii. Iudges burned so ferue~rly wt the loue of Susanna Ioachims wife, and soughte all meanes possible to haue defiled hir, but yt they were drowned wt the sight of hir beau ty? The scripture saieth she was a very faire woma~, but ther is a goodli additio~, she was also such one as feared god.
Whe~ beuty ye fear of god are licked togither beuty is not to be disco~me~ded, otherwise it is but a nette, wher wt ye deuil vseth to catch ye folish peo ple.
faire woma~ wtout discrete mauers saith Solomo~, is like a ring of gold in a swines snowte.
And yt we mai be wel ascertened yt it was hir beauty yt moued the~ wtoute shame to prouoke hir to vncle~nes, these words of ye histo+ry declare it manifestli: Susa~na was a te~der perso~ merueylous fair of face.
Therfore the wicked me~ co~mau~ded to take ye cloth fro~ hir face (yt at ye lest they might so be satisfied in hir beuty.
Beauti reigneth in mani, would god it were acco~paned wt ye fear of god, yt the beutiful perso~s might not abuse their beutye, but chuse rather to be stoned wt Susa~, then once to defile theyr hsbandes bedde, Euse.
God sende vs the beautye of the minde, whyche consisteth in Godlye vertues and honeste qualites, for yt is the true beauti, ye other is but fraile, vayne; trau~ sitory, doth not longe endure.
But what sai you vnto galaunt apparell, where of so many brag and boaste nowe adayes? Is it not a thynge, where in we maye worthely reioice? Phile.
Nothing lesse, for the wyse manne sayeth, Glory not in thyne apparaile at any tyme.
Uestures were geuen vs of God to couer oure filthye nakednes, not that we shoulde glorye in them, make them instrumentes of pride.
We ought rather when we put on our garments to lament our mischau~ce our mortalitie and vncleannes, then to reioyce in theym.
For so longe as our gra~dfather Adam continued in the state of innoce~cy, he neded no kynde of apparel to couer his body (for he was altogither cleane, beautiful, good, holye, innocent and perfect) but after he had broke~ the commau~dement of God by geuinge eare to Satans subtile, perswasions, perceyuynge his miserie wretchednes, wherinto he was fallen thorow his disobedience, he was ashamed of hym selfe, and boeth he his wyfe perceiuinge yt they were naked sowed fig leaues togither, and made them selues aprns to couer their fylthye and shamfull nakednes wythall.
Afterward when God droue theim out of Paradise, bicause their feble and mortali bodies, whyche now were subiecte to all kind of diseases, tempestes, and blastes, shoulde not perishe for colde, agayne that they myghte haue, where with to couer theyr filthye nakednes, ye they myghte walke the more honestly, he made them lethern garinentes, and clothed them therwyth.
Here euen from the beginning do we learn both what garments were geuen vnto manne of God, and for what purpose.
Neyther wyth fyne clothe, nor wyth Saten Damske, veluet nor wyth cloth of gold, did God apparayll Adam, neyther dyd he trime and set forth oure grandmother Eue wyth sumptuouse apparayle, of cloth of syluer, or clothe of golde, neyther dyd he set vpon hyr head a french hode wyth an edge of golde besydes pearles and precious stons and suche other trime trames, can not tell what, but he clothed the~ boeth wyth symple garmentes of leather, not that they shoulde reioyce and be proude of theym, but to vse theim as thynges necessarye to couer theyr wretched nakednes, and to defende theim from the cruell stormes fearce tempestes of wynde, raine, snow hayle. &c. Euse.
As in other thynges, so lykewise in apparel is the world at thys presente, wonderfullye fallen frome the first institution of thynges, For if wee shoulde compare the chyldrene wyth the father, meane, if wee shoulde consider what apparell God appoynted vnto Adam, and what is vsed nowe a dayes, a manne shoulde fynde as greate differnce betwene theym, as is betwene the Sunne, and the leaste starre in lyghte and bryghtenes, to beholde the vayne and folish light fashyons of apparayle vsed amo~g vs, it is to much wo~derful.
thinke no realme in ye worlde, no, not among the Turkes and Sarazyns dote so muche in the vanitie of theyr apparell, as the Englyshe men do at thys prese~t Theyr cote muste be made after the Italian fashion, theyr cloke after the vse of the spanyardes, their gowne after the maner of the Turckes, their cappe muste be of the frenche fashion, and at the laste theyr dagarde muste be Scottish wyth a venecian tassel of sylke.
speake nothynge of theyr dublets and hoses, which for the moste parte are so minsed cutte, and iagged, that shortlye after they become boeth torne ragged.
leaue of also to speke of the vanitie of certayne lighte braynes, which bicause nothing should want to the settyngforth of theyr fondenesse, wyll rather weare a Marte~ chaine the price of. viii. d, the~ they would be vnchayned.
what a monster and a beaste of manye heades is the Englyshe manne nowe become? To whom maie he be compared worthely, but to Esoppes crow? For as the crow decked hyr selfe wyth the fethers of all kynde of byrdes to make hyr selfe beautifull, euen so doeth the vaine Englyshe man for the fonde apparelynge of hym selfe, borow of euery nation to set forth hym self galaunt in the face of the world He is an Englishe ma~, he is also a Italia~, a Spaniard, a Turke, a Frencheman, a Scot, a Uenecian, and at the laste what not? He is not much vnlyke a mo~ster called Chimera, which hath thre heades, one like a Lyo~, an other like a Gote, the thyrd lyke a dragon.
passe ouer the lighte and wanton apparel of women now a dayes, partlye bycause it is so monstrous, and partlye bicause haue not bene nor yet am veri muche acquaynted wyth theim, wherby myght be the more able to discribe theyr proude Pecockes tayles, if not at the full, whiche were an infinite, laboure yet at the leste somewhat to set it forth as a painter doth, yr he do lay on colours.
But of thys am certaine, that they obserue not in theyr apparell the rule of the holye scriptures.
S. Peter sayeth, that the apparayll of honest and vertuous women shold not be outewarde wyth broyded hear, and hangyng on of golde, eyther in puttynge on of gorgeous apparel, but lette the hydde man which is the herte be without al corruption, so that the spirite is before god a thyng much sette by.
For after this maner in the olde tyme did the holy women which trusted in God, tyre them selues and were obediente to theyr husbandes, euen as Sara obeyed Abraham and called him Lord, whose doughters ye are as long as ye do well.
Hereto agreeth the sayinge of S. Paul to Timothe, Lette the wome~ aray them selues in comely apparell wyth shamefastenes and discrete behauour, not wyth broyded hear, eyther Golde or pearles, or costelye araye, but as it becometh women yt professe godlines thorow good works.
Speke to the wome~ that they be in such rayment, as becometh holines.
Solomon in the description of an vnhonest woman amonge other proprieties rehearseth sumptuouse and galaunte apparel, callynge it whoreishe apparell fit to deceiue soules, signifiyng that thys to muche costelye and proude apparayle is more mete for whores that lye awayt to allure men vnto theyr loue, then for honest womenne whych professe Godlines.
As filthy, beggerlike sluttishe apparel becometh not christe~ women, if they haue, or ryghtously and wyth honestie maye haue other: so lykewyse is it not conuenient for them to weare to muche sumptuouse, costely, and galaunt araye.
It is inough for chast and pure maydes to weare cleane and simple apparell, as a testimony of the vncorruption cleannes boeth of theyr mynd bodye wythout the flaringe out and coleryng of theyr heare, wtout the payntyng of theyr faces, without the puttyng on of wanton and light aray, wherby they be entised rather to prid whordome the~ to humilitie, shamfast nes, cleannes of life.
It is sufficiente also for honeste maried wiues, that they be so appareled that they please their husbands, they that decke theym selues to please the phanseis of other, and to make theim selues gaseyngestockes to the world, practise rather the maners of whores, then the conditions of honest women There is nothing that doth better adourne, garnishe, and sette forth an honest woman, then sobrietie, shamfastnes, cleannes of life, honest co~uersatio~, integritie of maners, scile~ce, feare towarde God, louyng obedience toward hyr husbande, comely behauour in countenaunce, in lokynge, in goynge, in speakynge, in doyng and at the last to weare such apparell, as serueth for hyr state degre, She that is endued wyth these goodly and Godli vertues atoresayed is a verye fayre and beautifull woman, thoughe hyr face maye tyghte well be resembled to the colour of an Ethiope and she maye saye as it is wrytten in Solomons Balades.
For thoughe she be blacke in colour of face, yet is she beautifull in mynde, And looke howe muche the mynde excelleth the bodye, euen so muche doeth the beautye of the mynde excede the fayrnes of the face.
Hester was a very Godlye and vertuous woman, yet did she weare glorious apparell.
graunt but ye muste consider that she was no priuate personne, nor one of the base sorte, but she was the moste worthy woma~ in the realme, eue~ the kynges wyfe, notwythstandynge howe lyttle she delited in that gorgious apparell, whyche she was compelled to weare for to serue hir state and degre, these hyr wordes do euidently shewe.
Thou knowest, lord saith she my necessitie, that hate the token of preheminencie, and glory or worshyppe, whyche bear vpon my heade, what tyme as must shewe my selfe and be sene and that abhorre it as an vncleane cloth, and that weare it not, when am quiet and alone by my selfe.
Do we not also read, that when she prayed to the Lord, she laied away hyr glorious apparel, and put on the garmentes that serued for sighynge mouninge? Agayne, do we not also reade that when the Iewes at anye tyme dyd humble theym selues in the syght of God, and woulde obtayne any at hys hand, yt they laied asyde theyr galaunte appa rel, put on sack cloth? Laid thei not awaye their precious oyntee~tes scared ashes and dung vpon their heaues? this meante somewhat.
Of thys am sure that holy Iohn Baptist did weare verye homelye apparell.
Hys rayment saith the scripture was of Camels hear, and he had a gyrdle of leather aboute hys loynes.
It is to be thought also that Christe and hys Apostles, which were but pore me~, had not very su~ptuous apparel to weare.
He yt saith that he dwelleth in Christ, ought to walke eue~ as Christe walked.
How can gorgious and galau~t apparel then agre wt christe~ professio~? Is the disciple aboue his maister, or the seruaunte aboue his Lorde? Doeth no Sayncte.
Paule in hys Epistle to the Hebrues declare, yt certaine faithful and godly perso~s walked vp and downe in shepes skinnes gote skinnes were highly co~mended of God? Doth not sainct Iames rebuke the riche men, that haue suche plentie of garmentes, that they be motheeaten? Doeth he not also reproue suche as wyl accepte and make much of the~ that be clothed in goodli apparel, and neglecte the pore, whiche are but homely apparelled? Was it for nought that Christe sayed to the people of Saint Iohn Baptise, what went ye out to se a man clo thed in softe rayment? Beholde, they that weare softe clothynge are in kynges houses.
Is it in vaine, yt Sainct Luke in the discrition of the rich gloton decla reth, that he was clothed in purple and fyne whyte? Do we not reade also, that Kynge Herode was arayed in royall apparrell, whe~ the Angel of the Lord smote hym, so that he dyed a very miserable death? To reherse what the doctoures of Christes churche wryte of the vanitie of gorgious apparell, agayne to declare out of prophane histories how greatly the noble princes and mightie Emperours eue~ amo~g the Ethnyckes abhorred su~ptuous rayment, both time and tong should fayle me.
It is very syttynge and prayse worthy ynough for al degrees of personnnes to weare apparell accordyng to their state and callynge, so that vanitie, excesse and reioysyng therin be banished.
But confusedly euery ma~ or woman to weare as them lyketh, is boeth wythout ordre and greatly disco~mendable, oughte by the higher powers to be redressed.
To be shorte in this behalfe, it shall be conuenient for so many as professe Christ alwayes to set before ye eyes of their mynd thys saiynge of the Apostle, hauyng fode, wherewyth we may be couered: let vs be content.
For we broughte nothynge into the worlde, neither shall we cary any thynge out of it.
And he appareleth hym selfe wel, whiche forgetteth not to cloth the pore according to this co~mau~deme~t of god.
Whe~ yu seest the naked, cloth him as we reade of the noble vertuous woma~ Tabitha, which made cotes garme~tes for ye pore.
If these thynges were deeplye weyghed and considered, they that so greatly delighte in sumptuous apparayle, woulde sone cease from that vanitie, and no more repose their delectatio~ in it.
For these garmentes, whiche we nowe set by verye muche, within fewe yeres we put the~ to vile offices and threwe them away vpon the dou~ghili, so that we haue litel occasion to reioyse in them.
Trueth it is, as these thynges aforesaide be proued to bringe no perfecte felicitie nor true ioye to menne, so lykewyse these that remaine, whatsoeuer they be, make a man nomore truely ioyful than the other.
To pamper the beally and to fare deliciously is reputed amonge the voluptuous Epicures an highe singular pleasure, yet these meates drynkes which are so deraely bought, and wherin many so greatly, delight become afterwarde so vyle and lothsome, that we can neither abyde the syghte nor the smell of them.
What doeth yesterday fasting profit the gredy appetite of ye day folowing? short vaine pleasure.
Thys bealy chere and bancketinge bryngeth no onely to man a transitorye delectacion, and such pleasure as sone passeth away, but it also wasteth a mannes substaunce and pearceth hym wyth the dartes of pouertie, as Solomon sayeth, he that hath pleasure in bancketes shall be a pore man, and who so delyteth in wyne and delicates, shal not be riche.
Agayne he sayeth, keepe not co~pany wyth wyne bibbers and ryotous eaters of fleshe, for such as be dronckardes and ryotous shal come to pouertie.
They shall not onelye come to pouertie, but such as are ryotous perso~s shall get to them selues thorow their diste~perau~ce and excesse of eatynge and drinckinge diuers sickenesses and diseases very harde to be put a way as the same Solomo~ sayth, who hath wo? who hath sorowe? who hath strife? who hath brawlinge? and who hath woundes wtout a cause? Or who hath red eyes? Euen they yt be euer at the wyne, seeke excesse.
Loke not thou vpo~ the wyne, howe red it is, what coloure it geueth in the glasse.
It goeth downe softly, but at ye laste it biteth like a serpent, styngeth like an adder.
Be not greedy in euery eatinge, be not to hasty vpon all meates.
For excesse of meates bringeth sicknes, glotony cometh at the laste to an vnmeasurable heate.
Thorow surfet haue many one perished, but he that dieteth him selfe temperatly, prolongeth his life.
Our Sauiour Christ co~maundeth vs to beware of excesse in eatynge drynckynge, when he sayeth, take heede yt your hertes be not ouercharged with surfetyng dronckenshyp.
Of these holy sentenses maye ye gather yt there is no cause, why any ma~ shoulde reioyse in banckettinge, except he haue a pleasure to procure his owne destruction, which cometh by no meanes soner then by pouertie and sicknesse, which spryngeth out of delicate te, as maye leaue of to speake of other inco~ueniences, yea pestile~ces to mans life, which issue fro~ ba~cketting in like maner.
It is an easy thing to gather out of the ho ly scriptures not only se~te~ces, but histories also, which declare what destructio~ to ma~ ba~ketting, dru~cke~ship, the study of ye bealy brin+geth.
Did not Ada~ Eue thorow eating ye forbidde~ fruite caste not only, the~ selues but al their poste ritie in to damnacion? How was Noe much laughed to scorne eue~ of his owne son wha~ through his drou~ke~ship, he fell on sleape lay naked wyth his priuities? Into what abhominable vncleanes did loth fall thorow droncke~nes, when he co~mitted incest with his owne doughters? Did not ye chil+dre~ of Israel giue them selues to bankettynge and afterwarde fel to the worshipping of the golden calfe committyng most shamful Idolatrie? Was not Holofernes that myghtye and valiaunte captayne in hys dronckennes slayne of a woman? Is not that rich man, whych would haue no pity vpon Lazarus and therfore was after hys death caried into hel fire, described of blessed Luke to fare de~tely euery daye? What shall speake of kynge Herode pages missing] whyche in the mids of hys banketyng was co~tente to graunte that holy Iohn Baptistes head shoulde be striken of? It is therfore conuenie~te for a christen ma~ to remembre in all hys eatynge and drinkynge christen sobrietie and alwayes to auoyde excesse, leste he fal into some of those inco~uenie~ces, wherof is made me~tio~ afore.
Theo, But what say to the fauour of noble me~? maye we not reioyce in that? Philem.
Ther are not a fewe, whych couuet nothyng so greatly as to be in fauour wyth greate men, and to be placed in their houses, thin kynge by thys meanes to auoyd the cruell dartes of fortune, to obtayne wealthy lyuinges, and to haue al thynges at their own wil pleasure, but se not, why any ma~ should repose his chiefe delectation in the fauour of any noble man, seing yt holy scripture sayth.
Put not your trust in prin ces, nor in ye childre~ of me~, in who~ there is no health.
And the Prophet sayeth. be he, yt putteth his trust in ma~, and maketh fleshe his arme.
How vayne a thyng the fauour of great men is, the historie of Ama~ declareth, which was so high in his kinges fauoure, yt he mighte do what he liste, kyl, saue, exalt, depresse, lyfte vp, pluckedowne, as we say co~ mo~ly, binde beares, yet was he not shortly after caste out of fauour on suche sorte, yt he was immediatly ha~ged on the same gallowes, whiche he had newly prepared for an other? Euse.
There is nothyng more vncerte~ tha~ the good wyl of great men.
For who~ they nowe loue, streightwayes they hate, and such as haue done most forthe~, are mani times least regarded, most cruelly entreated.
Howe ha~dled king Alexa~der his most trusty cou~sellers, which so ofte had put their liues in iopardy for him? How tyra~tlike did he slea the~, yet no cause why leaue to speake of Nero ye monster of nature, whiche caused his owne mother to be slaine, suche as had done moste for him.
Who was so much in fauour wyth the Emperour Iustinis Bellisai{us} Narses, which ing most noble warriours sud diuers kyngdomes to the yre, but how were thei Bellisa+rius ye most valiau~t capteine wtout deserte had at ye Emperours co~mau~deme~t both his eyes plucked out, afterward was co~pelled to begge his bread from dore to dore, and at the laste dyed miserably a moste wretched beggarre.
Narses also, if he had not fled, had bene moste vnworthely handeled, so are good men mny tymes recompensed for theyr intollerable paynes, and paynfull seruice.
Whereof we maye learne howe vayne to much folishe a thyng it is to trust in the fauour of noble men, so farre it is of, that any man maye worthely reioyse in it.
can none otherwyse do but marueyle at the madnes of some men, whiche rather chose idlely to spe~d their tyme in great mennes houses wyth thys hope to haue some what at the laste to lyue wyth al (which many tymes chaunceth neuer) then in their youth to learne some honeste occupation, whiche may defende them at all tymes from the bitter stormes of needy and cruell fortune.
Of all creatures are they slaues moste miserable, and for the moste parte come to the most wretched ende.
Ah howe many haue knowne, whiche after twentie yeres seruice haue ben wyth great displeasure dryuen awaye, and so dyed moste wretchedly? And thus is that co~mon saiynge founde true.
Seruing me~ may well be co~pared to Esoppes tothlesse greyhounde, whiche so longe as he coulde hunte wel, folowe get his praye, was muche made of, but when he beganne to waxe olde and coulde catche no more, he was no more loued of his maister, but rather hated, despised beaten.
If these thynges were well pondered, menne woulde not so headlonge and wythout consideration runne vnto seruice, there to spend the flour of their youth whe~ crocked olde age cometh eyther to go a begging, or els to be put in some almes house.
But howe so euer the matter goeth, of thys am sure, yt no man ought to reioyse neyther in men, nor yet in mennes seruices, seinge that nothing is more vncerteyne then their fauour, seing also that cruel fortune doeth oppresse so sodenly noble me~ many tymes, that they being turned to a base state, haue neither to succoure them selues, nor yet to healpe their pore seruauntes.
Well, thus haue we searched the principall thinges, that perteyne vnto man outwardly, wherein the folyshe world doeth most chiefly reioyse, and we haue found among them all not one thynge, wherein we maye worthely glorie and repose oure delectation.
Trueth it is, but what saye you to the inwarde natural gyftes' of man, as wysedome, strength, knowledge and suche other gyftes of the mynde? Philemon.
Let not the wyse man reioyse in his wysedome, nor the strong ma~ in his strength, neither the ryche ma~ in his ryches, but who so wyl reioyse, let hym reioyse in thys, that he vnderstandeth and knoweth me, for am the Lorde whiche do mercie, equitie and rightuousnesse vpon the earth.
Whether we haue respect to the body or to the mynde, if we fynde any good thyng in them, it is the gift of god, as S. Iames sayth.
Euery good gift euery perfecte gifte is from aboue, and cometh downe fro~ the father of lyghtes, and therfore ought no ma~ to glo ry neither in hym selfe nor in the gftes, but in God alone the gyuer, as S. Paul sayth, what hast thou, that thou hast not receiued? If thou haste receyued it wherefore dost thou reioyce and glory as thoughe thou haddest not receyued it? But wherefore do we tary longe before we come to our matter, whyle we labour to shew yt there is nothyng in the worlde, wherein we maye worthily reioyse, seinge that man hym selfe, whiche is the principall creature yt euer God made in thys worlde is but vanitie, and not worthie, wherein any true and perfect delectation ought to be se? Are not these the wordes of the holy scrip ture¬∑ Euery man that lyueth, is altogether vanitie.
What is the body of man, cometh it of neuer so noble house, but earth, duste and asshes? Or as S. Barnard sayeth, a stynckynge sperme or seede, a sacke of dounge and the meate of wormes.
Who wyl re ioyse in such a body? to garnish suche a bodye wyth golde, siluer pearles, precious stons, owches galaunte apparell, sumptuous garme~ts. &c, What other thing is it, then to couer a dunghyl wt clothe of golde? Nowe as towchynge oue inwarde manne, meane the soule, what are we? What haue we receyued of Adam In what case hath he sette vs, before wee be regenerate by Christe? Are we any other thing then flesh, and feshely minded? As Christe sayeth.
And sayth not blessed Paule, that we are the children of wrath? Is not our herte vncleane, lewde, wycked and vnsearcheable? Are not our senses, Imaginations, and thoughts, euen from our infancye, euyll and noughte? Are not al our rightuousnes like a cloth defiled with me~sture? Are we not all hypocrites, liynge chyldren, workers of iniquitie, vnprofita ble seruauntes, synners, vngodly, and of our selues al yt nought is? What haue we then either of oure selues, or in oure selues (I meane before our regeneration) wherof we mai worthely reioyce Chri.
It is conuenient therfore, seyng hitherto we haue found nothing wherin we mai worthely reioice, to sequester our ioye, our mirth, oure delectation, from worldely thynges, and to traunsfer it vnto the Lord our God accordyng to thys admonicion of the holye Apostle.
Reioyce in the Lorde alwaye, yea once agayne saye Reioyce.
But we woulde gladly heare, what earnest occasion we haue to reioyce in God.
My desyre is to declare thys thynge aboundauntly vnto you, if ye will heare.
God in whom we are so instantly mocioned to reioyce eue~ fro~ the begynning, had such fauour to ma~, yt whe~ the Angels for theyr disobedie~t prid, proud disobedience were worthely cast downe headlonge into hell, ther perpetually to remayne in most greuouse intollerable paynes, he wyllynge agayne, to furnishe the celestiall mancions wyth other Creatures, made manne, not lyke vnto other bruite beastes, but accordynge vnto hys owne Similitude, lykenes, and Image, not to be a fyre brand of hell, but heyre of his most glorious and regal palaice, not to perishe for honger, but to enioy all kinde of pleasures most aboundantlye, not to be subdued of other, but as Lorde chiefe ruler vnder God his creator maker to haue ye dominio~ of all beastes fyshes, and foules, of all landes medowes pastures, of al trees herbes flowers, and what soeuer other thynge is comprehe~ded in thys greate and vnmeasurable worlde.
Yea the hygh element, the sunne, the mone, the starres, the daye, the nyghte, the water, the fyre, the colde, the heat the rayne, the wynde, and what so euer other thyng ye canne reken besides, did he make not only to shew forth his glory, might and power, but also for mannes conforte, wealthe, ioye and pleasure.
Haue we not here a greate occasion vnfaynedlye to reioyce in the Lorde our God, and for euer and euer to glorify, celebrate and magnify hys most glorious and blessed name? To make vs lyke to hys owne similitude? to appoynt vs heyers of his moste glorious mansion? to due vs wyth the fruition of so manye goodlye and swete pleasures? to make vs rulers and Lords ouer al hys creatures in the worlde? to prepare all thynges for oure solace, ioye, and conforte? Who is so flynte herted, that melteth not at the hearynge of these thin ges so pleasau~t and swete? Who is so estranged frome God, that he applieth not wt all mayne to embrace so gentle, so kind, so louinge a Lorde, yea suche a Lord as is altogyther set to magnify man, to exalt hym vnto the high heauens, to place hym amonge the holye Angelles, and blessed spirites, to kysse and kull hym as his dear dearling welbeloued heyer? Canne that man reioyce inoughe in his Lorde and maister, whyche of a base slaue maketh hym a man of honoure of a begger a man of greate possessio~s, of a vie condition, a ma~ of hygh noble renoume.
Trulye the goodnes of God towarde man can not be expressed.
Phile Yet are these benifites. whych one man geueth to an other more vyle then dust, if they be compared to ye precious giftes heretofore rehearsed, whiche God gaue to man.
Satan that old subtile serpent perceiuing man to be made of God for this ente~te, yt he should enherite that glory, frome the whyche for hys intollerable arrogancye he was moste worthely deiecte and caste downe, craftelye, subtilly, lyke him selfe wt manye swete proses and faire flaterynge wordes at the laste allured oure grandmother Eue to the traunsgression of Gods commaundemente, and she lykewyse hyr so that by this mes they and theyr posteritie were not onely depriued of those pleasurs and commodities, whyche rehearsed heretofore, but also vtterli da~ned for theyr disobedie~ce.
And al this came to pas thorow the enuy of Sata~, as ye wise ma~ saith.
God created to be vnde stroed, yea after ye image of his own liknes created he him.
Neuertheles thorow enu of the deuyl death entred into the world.
Nowe is man become of the Image of God, the Image of the deuill, of the heyre of glorye, the enheritour of euerlasting paine of immortall, mortall, of good Godly, wicked and deuillishe, of fre, a bonde slaue wyth all hys powers to Satan, sinne, death, hell, desperation.
Nothynge lesse, for God whych is gentle, and the self gentilnes moued wyth louynge compassion, tender zeale and fatherly pity towarde man, forgettyng the displesure yt ma~ had done to him thorow hys disobedie~ce castyng al hys sins behind his backe, enflamed wt no lesse loue towarde ma~ co~cernyng hys saluatio~ (beholde what grace mercy doth) then he was before the traunsgressio~, minding to shew hym selfe of no lesse puissaunce and stre~gth to recouer saue ma~, the~ Satan was to destroy co~de~ne ma~, came into Paradice, sought hym vp, made garme~tes for him to couer hys nakednes, se~t hym into thys world, made him Lord ouer all, and promised hym that the sede of a woman, euen Iesus Christ hys owne sonne borne of Mary the vyrgin, shoulde deliuer him from the power of Sathan, reconcile hym to his Godly fauoure, satisfye for hys wyckednes, make hym a newe man, endue hym wyth hys holye spirite, fynallye, thorowe hys merites and good workes bring him vnto the celestiall enheritaunce from the whyche Satan at that presente had exiled hym.
Thys promise was so fayethfull (for God hym selfe spake it which is the selfe trueth, whyche can not lye, which is iuste in al his wordes agayne so co~fortable, that so manye (I meane Adam hys posteritie) as did apprehend and laye hand on that wyth earneste fayeth, were fre from that miserable thraldome, wherinto they were cast thorow Satans willnes, receyued into fauour, taken as moste deare chyldren, and recounted perfectly rightuous, for the assured perswation and vndoubted faith, yt they co~ceiued in the blessed sde Iesus Christe at the tyme promised of God the father.
So that so longe as they liued in thys present world, they liued in the fauour of God, and when they departed from hence God appointed theyr bodies to reaste in the earth, placed theyr soules where hys good pleasure was vnto the commynge of his sonne, the~ to receiue that blessed ioye and heauenly felicitie, that they had loste thorow their disobedience, Iesu Christ that most blessed sede workynge thys saluation for ma~, no for any good dedes that we had done, but of his own mere mercy and tender pity.

am glad brother Theophilus to heare you speake on thys maner.
After so many pleasures shewed to man, which all thorowe hys owne faulte he so wyckedly loste, after so greate a synne committed agaynste the diuine maiestie, so frelye to forgeue man, so to accepte hym into hys fauoure, so to loue hym, that he promiseth to send downe from hys moste glorious throne hys owne dearly beloued son to make a perfect reco~ciliation euerlastynge agremente betwene hym and man, that they may for euer and euer dwell togyther in ioyefull glorye.
Oh what a feruente charitie, and vnmeasurable loue of God is this? Who canne worthelye either by herte thynke, or by tonge expres or yet by penne sette forth the exceadynge greatenes of Goddes kynde hertye loue towad man? The Kynge of all Kynges, the Lorde of all Lordes, yea, that Lord to whose maiestye al thinges are obediente boeth in heauen, earth, and Hell, so to set his mynd on man beyng but a pore vile, and miserable creature, yea of all mortall Creatures moste synneull, mooste disobediente, mooste frayle, and readye to fal, so to loue and tender hym, that to do hym good, to brynge hym vnto glorye and honoure, he dis dayneth not, but mooste wyllyngelye vowchesafeth to sende downe hys onelye begotten and dearelye beloued sonne, yea and that into thys synnefull vale of miserye here to become manne, to be circumcised, to be made obediente to the lawe, to be baptised, to preache, to worcke miracles, to honger, to thyrst, to watche, to faste, to praye, to suffer all kynde of aduersitie, to be persecuted, to be laied wayte for, to be snatched at, to be blaphemed, to be rayled vpon, to be conuented before worldly tyra~tes, Bishops priests, lawiers. &c, to be scorned md, buffeted, whipped, crow ned wt thorne, nailed on ye crosse, sd, earsed to ye hert wyth a spre, at the last diynge the mos despful shameful death that coulde be inuented of the wycked worldelynges vnto the vtter defaceynge of thys blessed seede Christe, and of hys Godly doctrine, yea, and all thys for the loue that he beareth toward ma~.
Oh what a kindnes is this? what loue, what amitye, what herty frendshyp? Far be it frome vs, deare brethren, to be so stony herted, vngodlye, that we feele not thys tender loue of God toward vs. Chri.
Ther is in myne opinion no fayethful manne, no true professoure of Christe, that doth not earnestly reioyce at the hearing of these most heauenlye benifites promised ma~ of god in this blessed sede Christ Iesu.
Moreouer after the promise made to oure fyrst parents concernyng theyr reco~ciliatio~ to be made by the blessed sde Iesu Christe, whereby they wyth all their posterity were in the meane season wel conforted, enarmed agaynst Sathan, blessed and saued, howe frendelye euer after dealte God wyth man? What be nefit was ther, wherof man was not made partaker? In what kynde of benignite dyd man at any tyme (I speake of the faythful congregation) perceiue the te~ der bowelles of God to be spared agaynste him? What desired he, and obtayned not hys requeste? Howe ofte dyd God familiarye talke wyth man by hys holy Angelles? Was he not so louing to man, that he sente hys Angelles to eat and drinke and to be mery with hym? If anye plage or misfortune were immine~t at hand for the vngodly, did he not declare it to man, and so prouided for hym that he was fre from all daunger? How many victorious battels gaue he to man agaynste his enemies¬∑ How dyd he so acco~ panie him at all tymes, yt he euer found fauoure euen amonge the Barbarous straungers? Howe wonderfully deliuered he his peo ple fro~ the Egiptians¬∑ How mer uilously fed he the~ wt ye meate of angelles fro~ heaue~? How mighte ly did he subdue ye heathe~ Kinges brought his people into ye land of behest a land that flowed with milke and honie, a land full of al plentie pleasure.
But what shal speake of this moste singulare benefite, that he gaue hys law to ma~, yea such a law as is pure, tur neth soules, giueth wisdom to ba bes, maketh hertes mery, lighteneth eies, and is sweter than the hoye and honie combe.
Prophetes also gaue he to man to premoshe and aforeware hym if any mischife were at ha~d, to teach hym his holye ordinaunces, to re newe the promes of sendynge the blessed sede Iesu Christ for mans saluacio~, that he might not waxe fainte in fayth, but wyth valiau~t hope loke for that blessed Sauioure.
And whan the tyme predefined and tofore appointed from euerlasting was come of se~dinge doune this blessed sede and glori ous Messias, howe fayethfully and no les louyngly sent he hym into ye wombe of the most blessed Uirgine Mary thorow the wonderful operacion of the holy gost ther to take very fleshe wythout the sede of man, ther to take on hym humayne nature, and to be come of that holy maide perfecte and true manne, as he was before of god perfect and true God.
Woulde God this thing were no les of all menne truely beleued, than it is in the holye scriptures aboundanlye proued.
The Anabaptistes in thys our time do veheme~tly impugne thys Article of oure fayeth, and affirme obstinately, that Christe. toke no flesh of the blessed virgin Mary, but brought his body with hym from heauen.
Of thys matter, if remember well, taughte vs, Neyghbour Philemo~, in your new yeres gyft.
Phile This Article, that Christ toke na+tural fleshe of Mary the virgin, is so necessarye vnto saluacion, that who so euer beleueth it not, beleue the other in vaine, neither is he of God, but of the diuell, as Saincte Iohn sayeth, derely beloued, beleue not eueri spirit, but proue the spirites whether they be of God for many fals Prophe+tes are gone forth into the world By this know ye ye spirit of God Euery spirit that confesseth, that Iesus Christe came in the fleshe is of God.
And euery spirite that doth not co~fesse, that Iesu Christ came in the fleshe, is not of God.
And thys is that spirite of Antichriste, of whome ye haue hearde that he shoulde come, and he is nowe all redie in the worlde.
And thys most pestilent heresy, which the apishe Anabaptistes haue renewed in these our dayes (as Sa+tan is neuer idle, nor ceaseth in his membres to disquiete the co~gregation of Christ) was holden many hundred yeres paste of diuers heretikes as Marcion, Cer+don, Manicheus, Ualentinus, Apelles, and suche other ofsprin+ges of the deuyll, and was condemned and confuted by dyuers greate learned men.
And because we shoulde not feare to come vnto thys oure Lord and sauioure Iesu Christ, all that euer he dyd, was done in suche humilitie and lowelynes both of outward behauioure and mynde, that it woulde allure any resonable creature in the worlde with highe boldnes and faythful courage to come vnto hym.
He was not borne of a noble Empresse, nor of a deuoute vowee, nor yet of an holy Nunne but of a pore mayd in a pore stable, and porely wrapped in pore cloes.
In stead of a mighti and galau~t garde of mn, he was accompanied with oen and asses.
Thus became Christe poore, whan he was rych and the Kynge of glorye, that we thorow hys pouertie shoulde be made riche.
Moreuer he beynge wythout al synne and Lorde of the law, became subiect to the lawe, and was circumsised accordynge to the lawe.
He was obediente to hys mother Marye and to Iosephe hir husband, and ledde a pore lfe wt them vnto the age of thirty yeres, and wrought diligentely for hys liuynge after the maner of other menne.
At the age of. xxx. yeres he was baptised of blessed Iohn, sonne to zachary the Prieste.
After his baptisme was he led of the holy Gost into, Wyldernes, where he fasted. xl. dayes and. xl. nyghtes, and was greuously tempted of saan Immediatly after humbly low ly at the co~mau~dement of his hea uenli father he toke on him the office of preaching declaringe free remissio~ of synnes to so manye as repente in fayth.
And as he was pore in worldly riches lowly in mind, so did he chose pore hum ble men to be his disciples, yt they might go bare abrod like faith ful ministers ye heaue~ly riches, of his exceding mercy toward man.
For the riche galau~te, and pompous. worldlynges are no fit vessels crye the treasures of the kyngdome of heauen, so vnequally matched are Christe and Mammon, heauen earth, Golde and gods worde, light and darcknes They maye pretend and beare an outwarde fac to the worlde as thoughe they were the Apostles and ministers of Christe, as Iudas, Simon Magus, and suche other dyd, but inwardelye and afore God thy are the Apostls and ministers of Satan, and whan they seme moste of all to talke of Christe, of Christes doctrine of hys glory, than are thei most of all ennemies of the crosse of Christe, seke the condemnacion both of his doctrine and glory, and laboure to stablishe their owne drousy dreames, loweye lawes, croked co~stitutions, diuel lishe decres, Antichristian actes, and al for their God ye belly.
So swete a thynge is it to these false ministers and craftie apostles of Satan, to tomble, and walow in all kyndes of carnall pleasures and worldly riches.
Christe therfore knowynge all suche Bellye goddes to be vnapte for the prea chynge of the Gospell as he was pore and humble him selfe, so did he chose to be hys ministers and Apostles por homble menne, shars, day labourers, tolgatherers, such other vyle personnes abiectes of ye worlde.
These appointed he vnto the office of prea chyng his heauenly fathers wil.
These made he dispensatoures and Stuwardes of the misteries of god.
These commaunded he to goforth and preach the Gospell, the ioyful and glad idings the fauoure of God towarde manne Repentaunce, fayeth, fre remission of sinnes, in his bloud, peace, tranquillite of conscience, euerlastinge lyfe. &c. The.
These your wordes doeth blessed Paul affirme sayeing, the folishenes of God is wiser then me~ ye weakenes of god is stronger then men.
Brethre~ ye se your calling, how yt not mani wise me~, after the flesh, not many mightie, not manye of hie degre, are called: but god hath chosen the folishe thynges of the world to confound the wyse.
And god hath chose~ the weake things of the world to co~ou~d the things which are mightie.
And vile thin ges of the world thinges which are dispised hath god chose~, yea thinges of no reputacion, for to bring to noughte things of repu tatio~, yt no flesh should reioyce in his prese~ce.
Againe, to shewe his humilite lolines, how was he co~tent at euery mans desire to whither thei wold haue him, gladly to do, what so euer they re quested him? Did he not heale ye deseased? Restore ye blind to their sight? The deaffe to their hearig The du~be to their speaking? The dead to their life? Yea ye very Lepers did he not disdaine to purge clse of their leprosie, to touch wt his own handes, who~ the fine Pharises ye lusty lawers, ye sole~ne saduces, ye sawsy scribes, the brag ing byshopes, ye pattering priests wt ye whole rable of ye hypocritish sort disdained once to loke vpon: so far is it of, yt these holy fathers sought any remedy at al to helpe ye pore disseased.
After many tra gedies had betwen Christe the spiritual sorcerers wt ye other po~pouse worldlings for his doctrin miracles wha~ the time came ap poynted of hys heauenly father frome euerlastinge, that he for mans reconciliation, and pacifiyng of the diuine wrath, shoulde offer hymselfe¬∑ a swete and euerlastynge Sacrifice to God hys father, wherby he myght redeme man from the tirany of Satan paye hys rau~some by the price of his dere herte bloude, fatisfie for hys offe~ses, set a perpetual peace betwene God the father and ma~ and by hys death and passion bringe an whole sea of heauenlie treasures to the faythful penite~t sinners, wyth what alacritie and cherefulnes of mynd, wyth what desire and redines went he to his glorious passion? No kinde of payne, Did he disdayne, For to sustayne, To do man pleasure, Hys owne herte bloude, To shed on the rode, It dyd hym good, To make man al pure.
If he had sent downe faythful Abra a~, or any other of the old Patri arches or aunciente holye Prophete~s to haue suffered for mans saluatio~, it had wythout al doubt bene a token of singulare great fauoure toward man: but to send downe hys onely begotten and derely beloued sonne from hys glorious throne, yea and that for his enemies, for their health and saluacion, it is loue passynge all loue, it is charite farre exceading all charite, it is fauoure rather to be depely maruelled at than a ble worthily to be expressed.
The sonne of god to be come man and suffer dath for our sake.
Oh how ca~ we otherwise the~ ernestly and fro~ ye very hert reioyce in ye Lord oure God? Christ.
Truly to much iron herted are all thei, which reioyce not in ye blessed incarnacio~ glorious death of this most ble ssed sede Iesu christ our Lord by whom so many so excelle~t treasures of heaue~li goodes haue fre ly chau~ced vnto vs. Al things eue~ vnto the very death did he for our health, saluation, yea, yt so co~su~mat perfecte, yt ther was no thing left behind vnacco~plished yt might turne vnto our wealth, co~ modite profit co~cerning our rede~pcio~.
Let the turckes bost their Mahumet and reioyce in hym so much as thei list, let Papistes auaunce their pope triumphe in him so much as is possible, let the rich worldlinges magnifie their wicked mamon reioyse in it ful their hertes, let ye glistering hypo crites delight in their god the bel ly eue~ vnto the vttermost, yet let vs, let vs say, yt professe Christ aright only reioyse in Christe, in Christes natiuite, passio~, bloud death, as s. Paul saith, god forbid yt should reioyse in any thinge, but in the death of our lord Iesu Christ.
For so louinge gentle a Sauioure can no wher be found so fauourable liberal a Lord ca~ no where be sought out.
In this sauioure lord therfore let vs re ioyse, in none other.
The papistes can not broke this doctrine yt Christ alone (ye most highe euerlastinge priest) hath by hys death passio~ in offeryng vp his own blessed body a swet smelling sacrifice to God the father so ple~ tuously, so omnisufficiently, so at the ful made satisfacion for oure sinnes, yt we nede none other sacrifice satisfactory to put awaye our wickednesses.
No mar uel, for in defacing the glory ho+nour of ye true onli sacrifice Ie+su Christ, thei set vp magnifie an Idol of their own maki~g whi+che is ye masse presume in yt to offer sacrifice dayly for ye synnes of the quicke and deade, crake that it is of no les price, valoure strength and vertue, than the passion and death of Christis.
Againe, that what so euer christ did for the saluacion of man vpon the altare of ye crosse, they do the very same at the masse.
Whoe euer denied ye Lord that bought them, if these popishe massemon gers do it not? Who iustly may be called the enemies of the cros of Christe, if the mumblynge Massehunters be not the verye same? Whoe at anye tyme hath troden vnderfote the sonne of God, and counted the bloude of the testamente, wherewyth the fayethfull are sanctified, as an vnholy thynge and done dishonour to ye spirite of grace: if these shamelesse sacrificers haue not done it? And yet it is a worlde to se, what a numbre there are not onely of the ignoraunt and vnlearned, but of them also whych bragge boeth of wysedome and learnyng, that cleaue to this Idolatrous masse wyth to the and naile, that defend it to the vttermoste wyth swerd, fyre, and halter, that maintayn it wyth their tyches possessions, that striue for it wyth as stronge reasons, and arguments, as they canne, partely bicause they are afrayed (I speake of the Popeishe priestes) leat thys commune whore theyr masse should be driuen out of the game place, and by thys meanes theyr kitchen shoulde ware colde, and theyr idle beaies be no more fedde with the labours of other mennes handes, prtelye bicause they thynke, if thys abhominable strompet the masse were banyshed oute of the temples (I speake of the rude ignoraunte people) all true religion were gonne, al christen deuotio~ were perished, in so muche that they coulde not tell what to do for to please god, nor yet how to worship him, partly (I speake of the worldly wise) bicause they wyll geue no place to the trueth leste if they should conse~te to the puttynge awaye of thys mooste stynkinge and filthye whore the masse that old baude and gra~dmother of whoredome and abhominations of the earth, they shoulde be compelled to grau~te as they thynke, to theyr greate shame and ignominie, that both they haue bene blynde, and also led other blind these many yeres and so they sholde lose theyr estimation, renoume, and fame, amonge the people, which things they mooste chiefelye hunte and haucke after.
For they loue the praise of men more then the glory of God.
Certes so longe as that Popeyshe Masse shall be continued in the churche and beleued to be a sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke deade: Idolatrye shal beare rule among vs infidelitie shall lye couched in ye hertes of me~, Supersticion shal neuer be exiled frome the bondes of Christianitie, Hypocrisye shall styll fytte in the consciences of menne, the vsurped power of the Byshoppe of Rome, shall not loose hyr strengthe, the fruites of Christes deathe shall neuer be truly knowne, neyther our heauenlye father worthylye thancked for them, the purgyng fornace of the Italia~ bishop shal neuer be que~ched, the idle shaue~ nation of the popeish masse mo~gers shall styl be mainteyned in theyr disolute and beastlye maner or lyuynge, the papisticall sa crificers shall not cease to blaspheme that most swete smelling sacrifice Iesu Christe that most hygh and euerlasting bishoppe, the holye blessed supper of the Lorde, shall neuer be truely frequented and vsed in the churche of Christe, to be shorte, an whole sea of euyls shall raygne, florysh and triumphe in the christen co~gregatio~.
Truly thinke there is no christen herte, whych considerynge these thynges tofore rehearsed lamenteth not to se so greate an euil and pestile~ce as the masse is, to reygne amo~g theim that professe Christ, yea to be had in so hygh price, that it is beleued to be of no lesse stre~gth and vertue the~ the glorious passion of oure Lorde and Sauioure Iesus Christ.
But let vs se, howe thys wycked opinion of the sacrifice of the masse agreeth wyth Gods moste holy worde.
The Papistes affirme that the synnes of the quicke and deade, are put awaye by the sacrifice of theyr masses, whiche they mumble daily.
Against thys deuillish doctrine must we set (as an inuisible bulwarke) thys texte of blessed.
It became vs to haue suche an hye prieste, as is holye, innocente, vndefiled, seperate fro~ sinners, and made higher then heauen, whyche neadeth not dayly (as the other priestes) to offer Sacrifice fyrste for hys owne synnes, and then for the syns of the people.
For this did he, that is to saye, Christe, once for all, when he offered vp hym selfe.
Lette these sacrificers here note, that no prieste can offer any sacrifice for oure synnes but suche a one as is holy, innocent vndefiled. &c. whyche is Iesus Christe alone.
Seyng then that they wante thys holynes, innocency, puritie. &c.
S. Pauls wordes, that they can not sacrifice neyther for the quicke nor for the dead.
Agayne blessed Paule sayeth, that thys euerlastynge priest Ie sus Christe, neadeth not daylye (as the other priests) to offer sacrifice, whyche by one oblation of him selfe hath deliuered for euermore so manye as beleue in hym, from al theyr sinnes.
What wyll they say now? If Christe neade no more to offer sacrifice, muche lesse neede the priestes.
If one oblation of Christe be altogyther suffitiente the~ are the dayly oblatio~s of the popish massemo~gers vaine and vnprofitable.
If Christe offered hym selfe once for al, then canne not the papists offer hym so ofte~ as it pleaseth them.
Whereof it maye be concluded, that they do no thynge in theyr satisfactorye masses but blaspheme the Lord and hys annoynted, seynge they so arrogantly arrogate vnto the~ selfes power to offer sacrifice for the sins of the people, when this one oblation of oure Sauioure and Lorde Christe Iesus is all whollye suffitiente, and thorowlye able in euerye poynte euen vnto the vttermooste to saue all the electe chose~ people of God, yea and yt so abu~dau~tlye at the ful, yt henseforth there nedeth no reiteracio~ nor no renewing therof.
If ther were no mo scripturs to co~demne this wicked opinion of the Sacrifice of the masse but thys one tofore recited, it myght seme to any christen iudgement sufficient to subuert, ouerthrowe tople downe, what so euer the Papists haue builded vpon the sande of theyr owne inuentions these certayne hundred yeres.
What is chaffe in comparison to wheate, sayeth the Lorde? Is not my word lyke fyre, sayth the Lord? and lyke a twibytte cleauynge the rocke of stonne? But lette vs rehearse mo scriptures.
Christ beyng a bishop of good thinges to come came by a greater and a more pefit tabernacle, not made wt hands, yt is to say, not of this maner buildinge, neyther by the bloude of Gotes or calues, but by hys owne bloude entered he once for all into the holye place, and founde eternall redemcion.
Agayne in the later ende of the same chapter, Christe is not entred into ye holye places that are made wyth handes (whyche are but similitudes of true thyngs) but into the very heauen, for to appeare nowe before the face of God for vs.
Not to ofter hym selfe ofte as the hygh prieste entereth into the holy place euerye yere with strange bloude, for the~ muste he often haue suffred se~ce the worlde began.
But nowe in the ende of the worlde, hathe he appeared once for all, to put syn to flyght by the offerynge vp of hym selfe.
And as it is appoynted vnto me~, that they shall once dye, and then commeth the iudg mente, euen so Christe was once offered to take away the synnes of many.
Blessed Paule hath no shyfte of descante, but singeth euer one songe, nothinge lesse the~ pleasaunte to the eares of these Sacrificers.
He affirmeth that Christe by hys owne bloude entered into heauen once for all, found eternall redemption.
Where we maye learne yt Christ is so swete a smellynge sacrifice to God the father, yt by the once offeryng vp of him selfe, he hath founde euerlastynge redemption.
Rede~ption and remission of synnes is so ple~tuously purchased by the deathe of Christe, that it remaineth for euermore.
The papisticall sacrificers do greately erre therfore, whych take vpo~ the~ daily to sacrifice for the sins of the quicke dead, as though Christes sacrifice endured no le~ger and were of no more effecte and vertue.
Againe he sayeth, that nowe in the ende of the world Christ hath appeared once for all to putte synne to flight, by the offering vp of hym selfe, as though he shoulde say, Many sacrifices were offered of the priestes of the olde lawe, but none of theym coulde put synno to flyghte.
Therfore Christe the hyghe prieste in these laste dayes became manne, and was not offered of anye other, but he offered hym self, yea and that once for all for the sinnes of so manye as vnfaynedly repente and trulye beleue, and hys oblation for euer euer abydeth of so greate strength, vertue and power, that that alone none other, chaseth awai, putteth to flight the sins of many both of Iewes ge~tils if thei beleue.
We ar sa~ctified made holi bi ye oblatio~ of christes bodi once for al.
Are not these words plain inough? How oft doth. S. Paul resite the oblatio of Christes body, yea that once for all, stifly affirmeth that by that once offerynge vp of him selfe we are per fectly sanctified and made holy.
What nede the~ haue we of ye sacrifice of ye masse to be made holye, if there were any suche sacrifice, as the papisticall sacrificers faine? It foloweth also in ye same chapter.
Euery prieste is readye daylye ministerynge, and often times offreth one maner of offerynge, whyche canne neuer take awaye synnes.
But thys manne that is to saye, Christe, when he had offered for synnes one sacrifice, whyche is of value for euer, sate hym downe on the ryghte hande of God, and from thenceforthe tarieth, tyll hys foes be made his fote stole.
For with one offerynge hath he made perfecte for euer them that are sanctified: thys one sentence maketh to fall flatte vpon the grounde, al that euer the Papistes haue builded for the mayntenaunce of theyr Missall sacrifice.
Fyrste he sayth that all the sacrifices, whych the other Priestes offer, can take away no sinne.
Seco~dly, ye Christ offred one sacrifice for our syns, whyche is of value for euer, by the whiche one Sacrifice he excludeth all other.
Thirdely ye he sate hym downe on the ryghte hande of God the father, there tarieth tyl the daye of iudgme~te The~ can he be offered and sacrificed no more, what so euer the pedlerlyke Papistes chatter as S. Paule sayeth, Christe raysed fro~ the deade, dieth no more.
For as towchynge that he dyed, he dyed as concernynge sin once, but as towching that he lyueth, he liueth to God.
Fourthlye, that wyth one offerynge he hath made perfecte for euerthem yt are sanctified.
If we be made perfecte wyth one offerynge, whych is the oblation of Christes body vpon the aultare of the crosse, what imperfection remayneth there in vs, that wee shuld haue nede of the missal sacrifice: If one Sacrifice make vs perfecte for euer, what neede wee to haue so manye sacrifices offered daylye in the Popeyshe masses? All these scriptures tofore aledged shew euide~tly, that ye death of Christ is a sacrifice so omnisufficie~te, so perfect, so abso lute, so co~su~mate, so ple~tuous at the full, ye it alone maketh cleane for euer the faythfull from their synnes wtoute any repeticion or renewing.
Curssed therfore are these papistical Sacrificers whyche so arrogantly dare presume to offer and sacrifice Christ agayne, as though the fyrst oblation sacrifice were imperfect.
God amende them, turne theyr hertes, and geue the~ grace to know hys trueth.
For what other thynge is it to set vp a new oblation, then to anulle the olde to make God a lyar, to denye Christe as Sainte Peter ryght well prophesied of suche subtyll Sacrificers.
For he that sayeth, that synnes are forgeuen by the masse, that the masse is a Sacrifice for the synnes boeth of the lyuyng and of the Deade, he muste eyther graunte that the alone Sacrifice of Christe vpon the crosse is not sufficiente for the fayethful, or els that the missal sacrifice is a mockeynge of Christe and a plain scorning of god the father.
Why is Christ called an euerlastynge Prieste, but that hys sacrifice once done on the aultare of the crosse endu reth for euer in ful strength and power for so manye as beleue, though they synne neuer so ofte, if they returne vnto God, seke remission of theyr synnes in the precious bloude of oure alone sauiour Iesus Christ? As sact Iohn sayeth.
If any man synne wee haue an aduocate wyth the father, Iesus Christ the rightuous, and he it is that obtayneth grace for our sinnes, not for our syns onely, but also for the sins of the whole worlde.
What nede we the~ moe oblations? S. Paul sayeth, without effusion or sheadynge of bloude, there is no remission of syns.
If the papistes therfore wyll haue theyr masse a sacrifyce, so is it proued by the pages missing] wordes of the Apostle that they crucifie Christ agayne and shede his bloude Christopho.
What Christen herte can byde to be presente, where such ignominie is done to Christ the lord? Phile.
He that sacrificeth is greater than the sacrifice, so doth it folow that the pristes are greater than Christe the Kynge of glori? He offered vs a sacrifice to God, and go we aboute to offer hym.
Agayne, he that sacrificeth, oughte to be so pure as the sacrifice, and whoe, praye you, can be so pure, as Christe our sacrifice? Whoe is able to saye my herte is cleane, and am fre fro~ synne? To presume to offer sacrifice for the synnes of the people, is it anye other thynge than to, make them selues Christes and sauiours, and to saye wyth that moste proude Angel, as it is writ ten by the prophet, wyll clyme vp aboue the cloudes, and wil be like the highest of al? Do not thei go aboute to shewe them selues equale to Christe, yea Christ hym selfe, which take vpon the~ to offer sacrifice for the sinnes of the people? What other thing did Christ but take awaye oure synne? If our Massemongars do the same are they not Christs in dede? And yet thys prerogatiue haue they a boue Christe, that wher as Christ coulde not obtayne pardonne for our sinnes but by suffering great paines, yea very death, they do it wtout any paynes taking at al.
Christ was mocked scorned thei be praised much made of.
Christ was accused of heresy and treaso~: they be cou~ted good catholike me~ and fulle deuote fathers.
Christe was pricked to the braynes with a crowne of thorne, they haue a bald patch vpon their heades in stead of crownes, some haue on their cappes miters for catching cold.
Christ was stript naked of all hys clothes: they be clad in sylke, saten, damaske, veluet and cloth of golde.
Christe bare hys owne crosse of woode vpon hys shulders whan he went to suffer: they haue crosses of golde and syluer borne before them.
Christ was nayled vnto the crosse: they stande at the altare wyth turne, returne and halfe turne.
Christe hanging on the crosse prayde for his very enemies: thei standinge at the altare praye for such as be their patrones, Founders, Bene factours, and for suche as hyere them for monie.
Christe paciently suffered the blasphemyes and opprobrious wordes yt causeles were spoken agaynste hym, they if any man offende them, streight waies accuse, condeme, cursse and excommunicat them.
Christ with hys sacrifice soughte to do good to other: they wyth their sacrifices seke to brynge men to superstition, to wrap the~ in Idolatry, to graffe in them wycked opinions, but aboue al thynges to enriche Corban, Corban, that they may haue plenteously, wherwith to fede their idle and beastly bellies.
Christe at hys passion had vineger and gall geuen hym to drinke: but thei haue bread of the fineste and wyne of the beaste to eate and drincke.
Christe offered hys owne blessed bodye a swete smellynge sacrifice to God the fa ther for the synnes of the people: they offerre a wafer cake and sponefull of wyne, makynge the people to beleue that it is a sacri fice, whyche they offer pro salute uiuorum et requie omnium fidelium defunctorum.
For the health of them that be aliue and the rest of all the faythfull that are dead.
Consummatum est, Euery thyng is done and pefectly finished, that maketh vnto the saluacio~ of man, yea and that by this my one oblation.
They can not say so, neither bring they any thyng vnto perfection.
For theyr sacrifices are so imperfecte, that they are as redye to offer to morowe as to day, and neuer the bet ter. Christe after the oblacion of hys most blessed bodye, commended hys spirite into the handes of hys heauenly father, and died straight wayes, they after they haue offered their newe founde oblation, faull to bancketynge, drinckynge, gullynge and glossynge, to huntynge, whoring, dis inge and cardynge, and all the dayes of their life they liue dissolutely in moste vayne pleasures boethe of the fleshe and of the worlde.
What feloweshippe and agremente is there here praye you, betwene Christe and the Massemongers? betwene the ob lacion of Christ the popish sacri fice, betwene the Masse and the death of Christe? Ye maie se into what absurdities and to muche inconueniences these pedlerlyke Papistes faulle, whyle they stablish an Idole of their owne makynge.
How saye ye, are they not goodly Christes and pretye sauioures? Theo.
Christes? They are euen suche Christes, as the true Christ hym selfe speaketh of in the Gospell of Sayncte Mathewe.
Ther shal aryse, sayth he, fals Christes and false prophetes.
Here they be called Christes, but ther is added vnto it, False, so that they be false Christes, fayned Christes liynge Christes, deceyteful Christes.
Of suche Christes, Christe gaue vs warnynge and bade vs take hede, saying, if any man shall saye vnto you.
Behold heare is Christ, or there is Christ beleue hym not.
These popishe Masse mongers are the ministers of Sata~, which chau~ge themselues into Angelles of lyght.
These are those men that haue corrupt mindes, which are wythout all trueth, whyche thyncke that luce is godlines.
These are those false Prophetes and false teachers whiche, sayeth Sayncte Peter, shall priuelye brynge in damnable sectes, euen deniynge the Lorde that hath bought them, and brynge vpon them selues swifte damnacion, and many shal folowe theyr dam nable wayes, by whome the way of trueth shall be euyl spoken of, and thorowe couetousnes shall they wyth fayned wordes make Marchaundise of you, whose iudgemente is nowe not farre of, and theyr dampacion sleapeth not.
We haue textes almost innumerable conteyned in the holye scriptures, whyche declare that Christ alone by hys bloude hath perfectely wrought oure re demptio~, satisfied for our sinnes, pacified the wrath of God, and brought vs agayn into fauoure.
But if ther were no mo places of the scripture to conde~ne the sacri fice of the Masse, but thys one, whyche Christe hangynge vpon the crosse, sayed.
For if Christe by his death haue made all thynges perfecte, than lefte he nothynge imperfect.
So doeth it truely folow that the papistical sacrificeynge for the synnes of the quicke and deade is damnable, iniurious and despitful to the blessed passio~ of christe, seinge Christe made all thynges co~su~mate and perfecte by his pre cious death and by that alone ob tayned perpetuall remission for al the synnes of the faythful.
For his glorious death and bytter pa ssion is eue~ now of as ful stre~gth and of as much vertue, as it was what time he suffered, and so shal co~tinewe vnto the worldes ende, as blessed Paulle sayeth, Iesus Christ yesterday and to day, the same continueth for euer.
Therefore is he called an euerlastynge priest, because he doth al thinges perfectly, requireth none other to healpe hym as he him selfe say+eth by ye prohet, am he that tea cheth rightuousnes, am of power to helpe.
Wherefore the~ is thy clothinge red, thy rai me~t like his yt treadeth in the win presse? Christe answereth, haue troden the presse alone, of al peo ple ther is not one wt me.
Neither Abraha~ nor Isac, neither zachary nor Iohn Baptist, neither Mary nor Elizabeth, neyther Peter nor Paulle, neyther man nor Angell hath payde our raunsome by his bloude shedynge, but Christe alone, alone, that moste pure and vndefiled lambe, whyche taketh a waye the synnes of the worlde.
In hym alone and in none other is all oure health and saluacton Neyther is ther any other name giuen vnto me~, wherin thei must be saued, but onelye the name of our most blessed lord and bounte ous sauioure Christe Iesu that Kynge of glorye.
He onelye hath taken on hym oure infirmities borne our paynes.
He was wou~ded for oure offences, smitte~ for our wyckednes.
The chastisment of our peace was laide vpo~ him, and wt his stripes we are healed.
As for vs we haue gone al astray like shepe euery one hath turned his own way.
But the Lord hath heaped together vpo~ him the iniquitie of vs all.
He suffered violence and was euyll entreated, and dyd not yet open his mouth.
He was led as a shepe to be slain yet was he as styl as a lambe before the shearer, and did not open hys mouth.
He was had a waye fro~ presonne, hys cause not heard and wythout any iudgement.
Al thys suffered he for our sake to put awaie our iniquities.
Yea he was cut of fro~ the grou~d of the uing, which punishment dyd go vpo~ him, sayth God, for the transgression of my people, whych in dede had deserued yt punishment It pleased the lord thus to burst hym wyth plages, and to smite hym wyth infirmities, that when he had made hys soule an offerynge for synne, he might se long lastynge seede.
He hath iustified the multitude, and borne awaye their synnes.
These wordes are spoken by the Prophete, whyche teache vs manifestly, that ther is no sacrifice, that deserueth remission of synnes to vs, or pacifieth the wrath of God styred vp agaynst vs thorowe synne, but on ly the death of Iesus Christ.
By the meanes of Iesu Christe, sayeth Sayncte Paulle, ye whyche sometime were farre of, are made nye by the bloude of Christe.
By Christe we haue redempcion tho rowe his bloud, euen the forgeue nes of synnes accordynge to the ryches of his grace.
God hath de linered vs fro~ the power of darck nes, and hath translated vs into the Kyngedome of hys deare sonne, by whom we haue redemtion thorowe hys bloude, euen the forgiueues of sinnes.
It plea sed the father, that in him should all fulnes dwel, and by him to re concile al thinges vnto himselfe and to set at peace by him thorow the bloud of his crosse boeth thin ges in heaue~ thinges in earth.
This is a true sayeinge and by all meanes worthy to be reaceyued of vs, that Christe Iesus came into the worlde to saue sinners.
There is one God and one mediator betwen God and man euen the ma~ Christ Iesus, which gaue hym selfe a raunsome for al men.
Ye know, sayeth blessed Pe ter, howe that ye were not redemed with corruptible thingse (as siluer and golde) from your vain conuersacion, but wyth the precious bloude of Christe, as of a lambe vndefiled and wythout spot.
The bloud of Iesus Christ gods owne sonne, maketh vs per fectly cleane, sayth S. Iohn, fro~ al synne.
Agayne he sayth, Christ loued vs and washed vs from oure synnes in hys owne bloude If these sentenses were truely knowen of the Laye people and vnfaynedly beleued, they would sone geue ouer their popyshe sacrifices, and onely cleaue, as they oughte, to the alone sacrifice of the highe and euerlasting Priest Iesus Christe, which he once for all offered vpo~ the aultare of the crosse.
They woulde leaue to run madyng to ye masking Masse of the papistes, and make more hast vnto godlye sermons and vnto the holye and blessed Supper of the Lord.
Me thincke these Massemongers, whiche make of the Lordes Supper a priuate churlish breakefaste, for as much as they eate and drincke alone, and make th people beleue that in their Masse thei offer Sacrifice for their synnes boeth of the liuynge and of the deade, and boste that their Masse is of as great vertue and strength as the passion of Christ for the satisfaction of our wickednesses, besides their intollerable blasphemies a gaynste the Lorde and hys annoynted, offende greatly against the dignitie and the ryght vse of the Lordes Supper.
For Christe whan he instituted thys blessed Supper to be celebrated wyth breade and wyne and appoynted them to be the holye misteries of hys bodye and bloude, gaue no commaundemente to offer and sacrifice for the sinnes of ye quicke and the deade, but to eate and drinke these holy misteries in the remembraunce of hys death, as he hym selfe sayeth, Do thys in the remembrance of me.
Paule, so ofte, sayeth he, as ye shall eate of thys bread, and drincke of thys cuppe ye shall shewe the death of the Lorde tyll he come.
So that the Lordes Supper was not instituted of Christe to be a sacrifice propiciatorye, satisfactorie, expiatory, and ca~ not tel you what: but onelye a commemoration or remembraunce of that sacrifice, which could not but once be offered, and a certayne confirmacion or seale for the infirme and weak linges, that they be redemed by Christ, bi Christes passion, bloud and death, that hereby they may be assured of the fauoure of God of remission of sinnes, if they sted fastly beleue, that Christe hath sa tisfied for their synnes vpon the crosse, and in thys fayth eate and drincke the misteries of hys bodye and bloud.
For whan so euer the true Christians eate drinke the bodye and bloude of Christe in fayeth and wyth a beleuinge spirite, their synnes are forgeuen them no les than if Christe euen at that presente hadde died vpon the crosse, not for the eatyng and drinckynge, but for the fathers sake in Christes bloude, so mightye in operacion is Christe, and so presente is he at euerye howre vnto so manye as beleue in hym and are gathered togither in hys name.
For he is the eternall god, therefore hath hys death an eter nal euerlastynge fruite.
Ye haue taught vs Neighboure Philemon many goodli and god ly thynges concernyng the sacrifice of Christ which beate downe the sacrifice of the popishe masse euen vnto the grounde, yea they driue it downe euen vnto the pit of hel, from whens it firste came.
Nowe wyll reherse vnto you agayne, what haue redde and hearde of the papistes concernynge this matter, that ye maye se what their opinion was and is of the Masse and of the sacrifice thereof.
The Masse, saye they, makein men holy, yea it maketh them ryghtuous and deliuereth them from sinnes.
The Masse is a sacrifice, and not the sygne of a sacrifice onelye.
In the Masse is the bodye and bloude of Christe truely offered for the quicke and deade.
The masse of a prieste, be he neuer so naughti, is profitable ex opere operato Christ wt his pa ssion satisfied for originall synne and instituted the masse to be an oblacion for the synnes committed dayely, boeth mortall and ve niall.
To heare masse is the hono ringe of God, whither the hearer vnderstandeth it or not.
Missa soundeth sacrifice, ergo the masse is a sacrifice, Missa is deriued of Mitto, to sende, for in the masse the lamb, that is to say, Christ is sente vnto the father to forgeue oure synnes.
The Masse deliuereth sulles from purgatorye, for asmuche as it is a satisfactory sacrifice for synnes.
Not onely the sacrifice of Christ, wherin he offered hym selfe, was a sacrifice for synne, but we also offer for oure sinnes a continual sacrifice in the masse.
The sacrifice of Christ obtayneth mercy onely for original synne, and for the synnes paste.
The sacrifice of the masse euerye daye, is the true sacrifice for synnes.
Althoughe Christ was once offered on the crosse in the open likenesse of fleshe, yet is the same Christe dayelye offered on the altare at masse.
The wordes of con secracion duly spoke~ of the priest there is made a transubstantiacion of wyne into the bloude of Christe and of the bread into hys bodye.
Althoughe Paule calleth the sacramente of the Supper breade, yet maye we not beleue therefore that the substaunce of breade remaineth in the sacrament.
This is my bodye, therefore muste we nedes holde, that there is a transubstantiacion, and that the substaunce of breade is chaunged in to the bodye of Christe.
The bodye of Christe is presente in the Masse so greate and large, as it was, wha~ it hanged on the crosse Forasmuch as Christe that most hyghe maiestie of God is present at the masse, therefore is it verye godly to appointe many ceremonies, that Christ may be entertay ned honorably.
Masse ought not to be sayed but in an holye place and vpon an altare of stone, for Christe him selfe is called a stone The masse amonge al the suffrages for the deade, doeth profitte moste of all for the deliueraunce of soulles out of purgatory.
By hearinge of masse we maye obtayne not onely spiritual goodes but all maner of corporall and temporall goodes also.
The cannon of the masse is godly and catholyke and it was ordeyned of the Apostles.
The masse, ex opere operato, iustifieth and taketh away the giltines of the faute and payne in the~, for whom it is done With ye sacrifice of the Masse the satisfactio~s of the deade are rede med.
The masse, ex opere operato geueth grace, and beyng applied for other deserueth vnto them ex opere operato, forgyuenes of the faute and payne, and obtayneth what so euer we haue nede of in al oure lyfe.
In the olde testame~t ther was a byshop, that offered sacrifices for the synnes of ye people, therefore in the newe testamente muste ther be priestes and Byshoppes to offere sacrifices for sinnes.
The body of the Lord once offered on the crosse for originall synne, is continually offered for dayly sinnes vpon the altare, that by thys meanes the churche maye haue a gyfte, wher wyth they may pacifie the wrath of god.
It is an heresy of the Arrians to holde that the masse is not a sacrifice for the quicke and the deade.
Howe saye ye Neigheboures to thys doctryne of the massekynge papistes? Is it not good stuffe? Theo.
haue not heard more blasphemous doctrine in my life agaynst the trueth of Gods most blessed word, nor more iniurious and dispiteful agaynst the glorious passion of our onely Lord sauioure Iesu Christ.
to much miserable is that realme, where suche doctrine is taught.
Bonde slaues and wreched captiues are they to Satan and to hys Antichristian sinagog, where such tea chers reigne and bare rule.
Oh, whan wyl these papistes cease to speake blasphemies againste the sonne of the liuinge God? The teachers of thys doctryne are ryghte chaplens to that beaste, which had seuen heades and ten hornes, and opened hir mouthe to speake blasphemies agaynste God and hys name and agaynst hys holye congregation wyth so many as inhabite the heauens.
These are those marked Marchauntes, whiche haue committed abhominable whoredomme wyth that fylthey and vncleane stromppette Babylon, and wepe nowe because no man wyll bye their marchaundise nor their ped lary any more, their golde, syluer and precious stones, their pearle raynes, purple and scarlet, their orname~tes, their franckensence, wyne and oyle, their fyne flower and wheate with the bodyes and soules of me~.
haue spent the more tyme in declaringe vnto you the wycked opinion of te papistes concerning the sacrifice of the masse and co~futinge of the same, because ye shoulde reioyce in none other thyng as touching your redempcion satisfactio~ for your sinnes a perfecte atonme~t made betwene God and vs, but onely in the death and passion of oure Lorde and sauioure Iesu Christ, as S. Paule sayeth, God forbid that shoulde reioyse in anye thynge, but in the death of oure Lorde Iesu Christe.
Nowe the sacrifice of the masse beynge reproued, and proued of no force and vertue to put awaye the synnes of the quicke and deade, as the papistes haue falsely taught and made the folishe simple people to beleue for lucrs sake, of what price, praye you, is the masse nowe to be estemed? It agreeth nomore with christes supper, tha~ Christ Belial, light and darckenes, trueth and falshode.
Christe made a sermon before he ministred the sacramente of hys bodye and bloude to hys Disciples: the papistes say masses the deuill and all and yet no sermon at all.
Christ sate at the table and turned hys face to his Disciples whan he gaue them the misteries of hys bodye and bloude: the papistes sequester them selfes from the people, they stand at an altare and turne their backes to the multitude.
Christe reheresed the wordes of the institution of hys supper openly, yea and that in suche a tonge as al hys Disciples vnderstode: ye papistes whisper to them selues playenge silence glome, and vtter althinges in a straung tong that no manne vndersta~deth what is spoke~, nor for the moste parte them selues neyther.
Christe gaue the sacramente of hys bodye and bloud to hys Dysciples for to eate: the papistes gyue nothyng to any man but eate and drincke altogether them selues.
Christe ministered the misterye of hys bodye in com mon breade, the papistes minister printed waferre cakes other wyse not co~monly vsed.
Christ nistered wyne to be a co~memoracion of hys bloude shedeynge to his Disciples: the papistes minister to the people not onely wyne but water also myngled theyr with.
Christe gaue the sacrament of his bodye and bloude into the Disciples handes: the papistes put it in the peoples mouthes, not sufferynge them to touche it wyth their handes for their to muche base filthines.
Christe deliuered the sacrament to his Disciples sittyng at the table, the papistes co~pel ye people to receyue it kneling vpon their kenes.
Christ deliueringe the breade and wine to hys Disciples, sayde vnto the~ take ye: eate ye, and drincke ye, the papistes say, beholde, honour worshippe and reuerence youre maker here.
Christ instituted his supper to be a remembraunce of hys death and passion, whiche is the onely sacrifice for the synnes of the people, the papists affirme that their massekyng Masse is a perfecte sacrifice fo the quicke and the deade, and of as greate vertue and strenght as the blessed passion of our sauioure christ is.
Christe deliueringe the miste ries of hys body and bloude to hys disciples tolde them that his body shoulde be broken for them and hys bloude shead for them and many into the remissio~ of sin nes, the papistes shame not to lie that Christe by hys death satisfied onely for original synne and the synnes paste, as for all oure synnes what so euer they be, veniall or mortal, they be put away by the sacrifice of ye masse.
Christ deliuered the sacramente of hys body and bloude vnder both kin des to hys disciples, the papistes steale awaye from the common people the misterye of Christes bloude.
Christe gaue to hys Disciples the sacramente to be eaten for a remembrau~ce of his death, the papistes holde it vp aboue their heades and commaund the people to worshippe it as God.
Christe ministered the sacrament in suche apparel, as he did customably weare, the papistes put on maskyng apparel, Albes, girdels vestimentes, coopes, subdeacon, deacons, tunicle and what not? Christe playnly and puerly ministered the sacramente to hys Disciples wythout ceremonies: the papistes muste haue sensers, belles, candles, paxes, corporasses Superaltaries altare clothes, cruetres napkins besides their dowkynges and lowtynges, their turnynges and returnynges, their gaspynges and gapynges, their knelynges and winkinges their mockinges and mowynges, their crossinges and knockinges, their kissynges and lickeynges, their noddynges and nosynges, their washynges and wypynges, thir booynges and bleatinges, as may speak nothynge of their prostracions and inclinacions, of their commemoracions and histrionicall gesticulacions, more meate for madde braines and dronckardes than for graue and sober honeste men.
Christe commaunded hys Disciples to receyue the sacramente so ofte as they woulde: the papistes appoynte the common people onely to receyue it at Easter, or whan they be in perell of death.
Christe wylled hys Disciples so ofte as they eate of that sacramentall breade to remember hys death tyl he come, he mea neth vnto the iudgemente: the papistes say they haue hym al redye in there handes and in theyr mouthes, in theyr boxes and in their pixes.
Christe dyd not appoynte anye parte of the sacramente to be reserued after the co~ munion: the papistes reserue it and ha~ge it vp wyth an haltar in the pixe, sence it, carye it about in procession and make a pageaunt of it.
Christ appoynted his sacramente to be eaten in the remembrau~ce of his passio~, the papistes kepe it so long, that it corrupteth waxeth moul, breadeth ful of wormes.
Christe in the institutio of the mistery of hys body, sayed. hys is my body, which is geue~ for you.
The Papistes in theyr consecration, as they cal it, mangle the wordes of Christe, in some place addinge of theyr own to the wordes of Christe, and in an other place leauynge altogyther oute.
In the consecracion of the bread they haue Enim, which Christe hath not, nor anye word for it in the Hebrue tonge.
And herein do they greuously offende agaynste God, whyche commau~deth that nothyng should be added to hys worde.
Agayne they leaue oute thys confortable promis. quod pro uobis datur. which is geue~ for you, wherin our chefe consolacion, ioye and comforte is co~tained.
And here again do thei not a lityll offende agaynste the hyghe maiestye of God, seynge they plucke so many wordes fro~ the institucion of Christe.
They are also verye theues enemies to vs seynge they depryue vs of so swete and confortable promise wherin is co~prehe~ded the misteri of our saluatio~.
Christ in deliuering the cup of the mistery of his bloud spake these words, Drinke ye all of this.
This cup is ye new Testament in my bloude, whych is shed for you and for manye into the remission of synnes.
The Papists rehearse not the words in the consecration of the wyne (as maye go forth to vse theyr terme) in all poyntes, as Christe dyd, but adde moe vnto them, as though there were a certayne im perfection or insuffitiencye in the wordes of Christe.
Thys is the chalice of my bloude a newe and euerlastynge testament, the misterye of fayeth, whiche for yu and many shall be shed for the remission of synnes.
Although in the additio~ of these wordes there is no vntrueth, yet is it not conueniente for any man whych is but fleshe, earth, duste, and ashes, to putte oughte to the wordes of Christe, whyche is the wysedome of the father, and knoweth beste what is mooste expediente for the settynge forth of his glory.
If a ma~ adde anye thynge to the Testamente and laste wyll of any mortall manne, or doe plucke oughte therfro, his faulte is counted very greate, and he hym selfe for euer after discredited bycause he hath so vniustly dealte wyth his neyghboures wyl.
In what estimation then are they to be hadde whyche corrupte the testamente and laste wyll not of man onelye but of God and man also, wherin are bequethed not worldely transitorye thinges, but thyngs heauenlye and perpetuall.
Neyther is thys blessed testame~t sealed wyth waxe, but wyth the preciouse and deare herte bloude of our Lorde and sauioure Christe Iesus, to mancle this heauenlye testamente, to corrupte thys blessed wyll, wherein is bequethed vnto vs, the fauoure of God, remission of al our sinnes eternal lyfe, if we truely repent, and earnestly beleue, is much vnsittyng for any christen man, neyther are suche manckelers, and corruptours, suche theues and robbers, anye more to be beleued of the faithful congregation.
Christe (as may once make an end) after he had fed his disciples with the holy misteries of his bo dye and bloude, gaue thankes to God the father, and so prepared him self thorow earnest praier vnto the death.
The Papistes after they haue once droncke and eate vp all togyther, they gyue no thankes, wherby the co~mune people are edified, excepte it be when they blesse wyth the empty cup, or byd theym go home wyth Itemissa est.
Well thys maye ye easly perceyue, howe greatly the Popysh masse differeth from the true institutio~ of the Lords supper, and that they agre togyther as Christe and Beliall, lyghte and darcknesse, trueth and falsehode. ce. Christo.
It shall therfore be conuenient for all true christian hertes no more to repose the trust of theyr saluation in the Sacrifice of theyr Popeyshe masse, nor in anye thynge apperteynynge to the same, but onely in the blessed passion, in the precyouse bloude, gloryouse death of oure Lorde and sauiour Iesus Christ, which by the alone Sacrifice of hys mooste holye body, hath euen vn to the vttermoste, and at the full payed our raunsome, broughte vs euerlastynge healthe.
Thys is a confortable hea rynge for all fayethfull penitent synners.
But praye you, neighboure Philemon, remayne there no mo causes of reioysyng in the Lorde oure God? Philemon Yesse verilye.
For thys oure Lorde and Sauioure Iesus Christe dyd not onelye boeth wyllyngely and frelye gyue him selfe vnto the deathe of the crosse for oure synnes and wyckednes, and by thys meanes paye oure raunsome to God the father for oure offe~ses, that Satan might haue no power ouer vs, but he al so thorowe the might of his godhead, rose agayne gloriously and triumphantlye on the thyrd day accordynge to the scriptures for oure iustification, as the Apostle sayeth.
He was betraied vnto the death for our synnes, and rose agayne for oure iustification.
For as by the death of Christe oure raunsome is payed, the diuine wrath is pacified, oure synnes are washed away in Christes bloude, a reconciliacion perfect atoneme~t is made betwene God the father and vs, the obligation of oure dette is rased oute, the law is fulfilled, the curse of goddes wrath is take~ away, al thynges both in heauen and in earth are pacified: so in lyke maner by the Resurrection of Christe wee are made ryghtuousse, accepted into Goddes fauoure, recounted for iuste, holye, and vertuousse, sette at libertye, from the tyrannye of Sathan, admitted into the celestiall courte of the newe Hierusalem, and become felowe cityzyns of the houshold of God wyth the Saynctes, and blessed spirites.
inestimable treasures broughte to vs by the gloryouse resurrection of our moste blessed sauiour Iesu Christ.
Yea, lette vs marke thys also by the waye, that as oure moste valeaunt Lorde and Emperoure Iesus Christe by his resurrection, gatte the vyctory ouer Sathan, Synne, Deathe, Hell, Desperation, and all that is enemye to Mannes healthe, so in lyke condicion haue we in hym and thorowe hym goten a glorious victorye ouer Sathan and all hys kyngdome, that we maye wyth a ioyeful voyce saye, death is swalowed vp into victo rye.
death where is thy vyctorye? death where is thy styng? The stynge of death is sinne, the power of synne is the lawe.
But thanckes be to God whiche hath geuen vs the victorye, thorowe oure Lorde Iesu Christe.
what a ioye and comforte is this to a Christen mans herte, to se hys enimies, whiche before so greately soughte hys distruccion, thus vanquished, subdued and troden vnder his fote? This haue we gotten, as ye very truly haue sayde, by Christes resurrection, as Christe hym selfe testifieth sayeinge, nowe is the iudgemente of the worlde, nowe shall the prince of thys worlde be caste oute.
Agayne, be of good comfort, haue ouercome the world By the Prophet Ose he also sayeth, wyl deliuer them from the power of death, yea from deathe it selfe wyll redeme them.
Moreouer by Christes resurrection haue we obtayned not only Iustification victory ouer our enemies, but also resurrection of bodye and euerlastynge immortalitie.
For as oure Lorde and sa uioure Iesus Christe dyd put of the mortalitie of hys bodye, and became immortall at hys resurrection, so by the power of that hys moste glorious resurrection shall we also at the greate day of iudgemente in oure resurrection receyue immortall and incorruptible bodyes, euen lyke vnto the glorious body of oure moste myghtye and valeaunt captayne Iesu Christe.
Oh who ca~ expres the worthines excellency of these heauenly gyftes, whiche we obtaine by the mooste victorious and triumphante Resurrection of Iesus Christe oure Lorde and sauioure? Philemon.
Lette these thynges therefore (dearelye beloued brethren) make you to reioyce in the Lorde.
Lette these thyngs prouoke you to wythdrawe your mynde from transitory thynges and stedfastly to fyxe it on thynges co~staunt and euerlastinge.
Lette these thynges sequester youre Ioye and pleasure frome the swete entisynge moremaydes of thys worlde, and allure to the alone delectation in celestiall treasures.
blessed is that man, to who~me it is geuen frome aboue truely to sauoure these thynges, fayethfullye to beleue theim, and earnestly to reioyce in that Lord whyche is the alone geuer of the~ Sure at man be, that hys name is written in the booke of lyfe.
But lette vs go forthe to declare moe benifites of God towarde man, that oure ioye in the Lorde maye be vnfayned, co~summate and perfecte.
After this mooste noble conqueste and victorious triumphe, whyche oure moste mighty Emperour Christ Iesus hadde ouer Sathan and hys infernall ministers, he taried here in thys worlde, certayne dayes wyth hys Disciples, eatynge, drynkeynge, and talkyng wyth the~ of the kyngdome of his heauenly father, and confirming them in the waye of trueth.
And thys dyd he not only to make the~ stronge in the article of his resur rection, but also by the instruction of them to corroborat, fortifye and strength vs in the same, seekynge no les oure health then the saluacion of them.
For as the Apostle sayeth, if thou doste confesse wyth thy mouth the Lorde Iesus, beleue wyth thyne herte that God raysed hym vp frome the dead, thou shalt be saued.
Cer tayne dayes paste from his resur rection, Christe our Lorde by the power of hys godhede in ye sight of his Apostles asce~ded into heauen God and man.
Haue we no cause to reioyce in this behaulfe? Hath this his marueylouse asce~sion brought no commoditie and profite to vs? Haue we a iuste cause to reioyce in hys natiuitye, preachynge, miracles, good workes, crosse, passion, bloude, death resurrection (whych al are ours) not in hys ascention also? We reade that the Apostles were very sadde, when Christe told theim that he shoulde ascende vnto his father.
But Christe sayed vnto them, tel you trueth, it is expedient and profitable for you that go ascende vnto my father.
Christe tolde the Apostles that it was expediente profitable for theim that he shoulde go vp into heauen.
If it were expedient for them, it is eue~ so like wyse for vs.
For we are saued by ye very same waye, whereby they receyued saluation.
Let vs therfore consider what commodities and profites the Apostles had by Christes ascention, and let vs wt a constau~t fayth and hope loke for the same For there is but one Lorde of all ryche inough for so many as call on hym.
praye you let vs heare, that our ioye maye be ful. Phile.
Fyrste that we maye truely reioyce in Christes asce~tio~, wil labour to shew you some of the co~ modities of it, as we are taught in the sacred scriptures.
go to prepare a place for you, If gooe my waye and prepare wyl come agayne and take you vnto my self, that wher am, ye maye be also.
Here haue we one vrgente cause, whye wee oughte earnestelye to reioyce in Christes ascention.
For of thys aforesayed sentence we learne, yt Christe is ascended vnto hys father to prepare a place for vs in heauen.
Can anye thynge sound more pleasaunt and thanke worthy to oure eares, then to heare that the son of God came downe fro~ hys heauenly throne, became man, suffered death, rose agayne for oure sake, and is nowe ascended very God, and very man into heauen to prepare a gloryous ma~cion for vs in the kyngedome of heauen? What is more co~fortable for a Pilgrime, then after long traueling by straunge contries at the laste to come home to hys owne house, and ther to find all thyngs wel prouided for him Are not we straungers and pylgrimes in thys worlde? Do wee not wa~der fro~ place to place vncertainly, loke for an other ma~cion more quiet mery to come? If ther were not such a dwelling place to be loked for after thys prese~t life, of al creaturs, the true christia~s were most miserable.
But ther is vndoubtedli an heaue~ly palaice prepared for ye faithful, yea and yt bi Christes asce~tio~.
Certise here haue we, co~ fesse, one great occasio~ to reioice in the ascention of Christe, seynge by it he hathe prepared for vs a dwellynge place among the holy sayntes blessed angels, promiseth yt he wyl come againe, take vs vnto hym, and place vs euen there, where he him selfe is.
An other commoditie that we haue by Christes ascention, is the gyfte of the holye Goste.
If go not awaye, the confortoue shall not come vnto you.
But if goe my waye, wyl sende hym vnto you.
By thys confortoure he vnderstandeth the holy gost, whych conforteth and maketh stronge wyth Godly puissaunce, yea and leadeth into al truth, ye hertes of so many as he inhabiteth.
What an inestimable treasure the gyfte of the holy Gost is, no ma~ knoweth, but he that is endued wyth wysdome from aboue.
Whence come al these backe slyders from God and hys worde, but onely of the lacke of the holye Gooste? Whence come so manye Heretikes, scismatikes, anabaptistes sacramentaries, papistes, with al the whole rable of sedicious sectaries, but onelye that thei are destituted of thys co~fortoure, of thys holy spirite, whiche shoulde comforte the~ in fayeth, and leade them into all truethe? Dauid knewe full well, what a singular and greate treasure to a fayethful man the hauynge of the holy Goste is, agayne, what an vtter decaie and extreme destruction it is to yt man, that whanteth thys confortoure, whan he prayde on thys maner. create in me a pure herte, God, and a right spirite renewe thou in my inwarde partes, Caste me not awaye frome thy face, and thy holy spirit take not awaye from me.
Thys holye spirite do the fayethfull receyue from God the father thorowe the ascention of Christe.
Is thys a small gyfte to haue the holy gost geuen vnto vs to dwell wythin oure breastes, and wyth hym all the heaue~ly fruites of the spirite, fayeth, loue, hope, pacience, ioye, longe sufferyng, meakenes, temperaunce, iustice, goodnes, ge~tlenes, modestie, honest behauioure peace, with an whole sea of good thynges mo, yea and at the laste euerlastinge life? Who reioyseth not in thys moste excellente gyft purchaised for vs by the ascencion of the Lorde Christe our God and sauioure? Christo.
That such giftes shoulde be geue~ vnto men of Christe after Christes ascention, it was longe before prophecied of the holye Psalmographe, thou arte gone vpon hye, thou, haste ledde capptiuitye captiue, and receyued gyftes for menne¬∑ Euse.
Of the gyfte of the holye goste plenteously to be geuen after Christes ascencion, God hym selfe speaketh by the Prophete Ioell, sayeinge: it shall be in the laste dayes, sayth God, of my spirite wyll powre out vpon all flesh.
And your sonnes and your doughters shall prophesye, and your young men shall se visions and your olde men shall dreame dreames.
And on my seruautes and on my hande maydens wyll powre oute of my spirite in those dayes, and they shall Prophesie.
Neyther do here cease the commodities and profites that wee enioye by the ascension of Christe.
For besydes the preparacion of the heauenly mansions and the gyfte of thi holy Goste (whiche withoute doubte are moste highe and syngulare treasures) Christe by hys ascension is become oure intercessoure, mediatoure and aduocate.
He sitteth on the ryght hand of God the father makyng intercession for vs.
If we wyl obtaine any thynge of God the father, he is straight wayes redye to be an aduocate and to plead our cause before his father, and easelye obtayneth what so euer he desireth so greate is hys dignitie and excencye.
Agayne, if at any tyme we offende God (as we all do amysse in manye thynges) and by oure offence prouoke the wrath of God vnto vengeaunce, Christ oure aduocate and mediatoure is at hande immediately to pacifie the ie and wrath of God, to reconcile vs vnto hym, to purchaise remission of oure synnes, and to recouer the fauoure that we had loste thorowe oure weake nes, as S. Iohn sayeth, if anye man synne, we haue an aduocate wyth the father Iesus Christe that ryghteouse one.
And he is a mercie stocke for oure synnes, not for oure synnes onely, but for all the worldes also.
For the bloude of Christe is not lyke the bloude of Abell.
For the bloude of Abell crieth for vengeaunce vpon hys brother Cayne, which vniustely slewe him (as the bloude of al innocences and martyrs do in like maner call for vengau~ce against the~, that haue oppressed the~ shed their bloud vniustly) but ye bloud of Christ crieth for grace, fauour and mercy, crieth for pardon, forgyuenes and remission of synnes crieth for ioye, quietnes and euer lastyng life.
God, sayeth Sainct Paull, setteth forth his loue won derfully towarde vs, for if when we were yet synners Christe died for vs, muche more than we beynge nowe iustified in his bloud shal be saued from wrath by him.
If when we were enemies, we were reco~ciled to God by ye death of hys sonne, muche more we beyng reconciled shall be made safe thorowe hys lyfe.
No man can sufficientlye expresse the worthynes of thys co~modite, that Christ is not onely become by his ascen cion a preparer of a heauenli and glorious mansion for vs, againe a purchaser of the holye goste to comforte vs and to lede vs into al trueth, but also an intercessour mediatoure and aduocate, where by he obtayneth for vs all good thynges, and putteth a backe fro~ what so euer shoulde hinder obtaynynge of gods fauoure and the heauenly enheritaunce.
Christe purchaseth for vs of hys father thoroughe his intercessio~ so abou~dantly and so altogether sufficiently, al thinges necessarye for the conseruacion boeth of our bodie and soule, that we nede not to praie vnto any sainct in heaue~ as the papistes haue taughte vs neither vnto mary, Iohn, Peter, Iames, nor any other to be oure intercessoure, mediatour or aduo cate.
It is Christes office alone to be a mediatonree betwene god and vs, as blessed Paulle teacheth vs in his Epistle vnto Timo the.
doubte not neygheboures but so many as are fayethful, are replete wyth exceadynge ioye to consider howe manifolde and diuers benefites, gyftes and graces chaunce to vs by the wonderfull ascencion of Christ our Lord and sauioure.
Who so euer considereth depely in hys minde those thynges that ye haue taughte vs hitherto, shall be occasioned vnfainedly, to obeye thys commaundemente of the blessed Apostle, he that reioyceth, let hym reioyse in the Lorde, so swete and full of all heauenly pleasure are these commodities, whyche wee receyue of God thorowe Christ oure Lord.
But let vs make haste vnto an ende concernynge thys matter, that we maye learne in fewe wordes, what so euer remai neth of gods goodnes towarde vs in Christe, meane so muche as oure wyte can comprehende, and we be taughte in the holye scripture, that we maye earnestely reioyse in the Lorde oure God We haue hearde heretofore manye vrgente and wayghtie causes, why we shoulde of very right and bou~den dutie reioyse and be mery in the Lorde.
Nowe it remayneth orderlye to declare the finall and laste cause, whye wee ought to be glade and reioyse in God.
As Christ was borne for vs, wrought al good thinges in hys manhode for vs, suffered for vs, died for vs, rose againe for vs, ascended into heauen for vs, purchaised the holy goste for vs, prayeth for vs, obtayneth al best thynges for vs, so likewise at the laste daye shall he beynge oure heade come agayne fro~ the right hande of his father to fet vs hys membres, and to enunite vs wt him in the same glori ther euer to remayne.
And althoughe to the wycked he shall come as a ter rible and ryghteous iudge, to revenge and not to pardonne, to punishe and not to forgiue, to co~deme and not to saue, yet to the fayethfull shall he come in hys glorious maiestye and all the blessed Angeles wyth hym lyke a mooste louynge and Gentle sauioure, sayeynge to them on thys manner, come ye blessed of my father, possesse ye the kyngdome, prepared for you from the begynnynge of the worlde.
whooe is able, to expresse what ioye and comforte thys afore sayed sentence shal bringe to the hertes of the fayethfull? But to the vnfayethfull it shall be sayede gette ye hence ye cursed into euerlastinge fire, which is prepared for the deuil and hys Angeles.
that daye shall be to the wycked a bitter daye, a, daye of wrath, a daye of tribulacion and anguishe, a day of calamitie mise ry wrechednes, a daye of darcknes and miste, a day of cloudines boistuousnes, a day of feareful trompettes and shawmes blowynge.
graunte, notwythstandeynge to the fayethefull it shall be a swete daye, a daye of fauoure, a daye of quietnes and peace, a daye of wealth and felicitye, a daye of clearenes and lyghte, a daye of comforte and solace, a daye of heauenly myrth ioye and pleasure.
For as blessed Paulle fayeth, the eye hathe not seene, nor the eare hathe not hearde, neyther canne the herte of manne thynke, what thynges God hathe prepared for them that loue hym.
They shall shyne as the clearenes of the firmament, and as starres for euer and euer.
They shall be counted amonge the sonnes of god, and their lot shal be among the saynctes.
They shall receyue of the Lordes hande an honorable kyngedome and a beautifull diademe.
Thei shalbe be fore the throne of God, and serue hym day and nyght in his temple.
They shal ho~gar and thyrste no more, neither shall the sonne or any heate faul vpon the~ for the lambe Christe, whyche is in the middes of the throne, shall gouerne them, and lead the~ vnto the fountayues of the water of lyfe, and God shal wype a waye euery teare from their eies.
Thei shall dwell in a citye, that nedeth neyther sonne nor mone to shyne in it.
They shall beholde the glorious face of god presently, and hys name shall be written in their foreheades.
They shall eate of the tre of lyfe, whych is in the paradise of God.
To conclud they shal haue a crowne of glory and syt wyth Christe their elder brother in hys throne, euen as he sitteth wyth hys father in hys throne, and shall lyue wyth God and hys holy angelles in al kind of honoure and glorye, ioye and pleasure worlde wythout ende.
what can a Christen man desire more of the Lorde hys God, then these thinges, which haue heretofore rehersed? Come of, tell me nowe praye you, if we haue not many yea and innumerable boeth vrgent and wayghtie causes, why we shoulde reioyse in the Lorde our God.
doubte not, doubte not, moste dere brethren, but by the hearynge of these thin ges ye are nowe so rapte into the loue of God for the moste hyghe and singulare pleasures, whyche thorowe Christe Iesus ye haue allredye receyued, and here after shall receyue a thousand tymes more abound a untlye, that from he~ceforth al worldly thinges shal waxe vile vnto you, and ye shall euen from the verye herte endeuoure youre selues at all tymes to repose all youre ioye, comforts pleasure and felicitie in the Lord oure God alone, alone, so that ye shall reioyse in none, neyther in heauen nor in earth but in hym alone, alone.
Neyghboure Philemo~ we all are kindled with so feruente and so hertye loue towarde God for these hys moste singulare and inestimable benefites, that we do not onely defye the world and all the vayne plea sures of it, but we also are redye for our stedfast loue in God and for the perfecte reioysinge in him gladly to saye wyth the blessed postle, who shall seperat vs from the loue of Christe? Shall tribulacion or anguishe? Or famine? Or nakednes? Or parel? Or persecution? Or swerde? am sure that neyther death nor lyfe, nor angels, nor soueraignties, nor powers, nor thinges present, nor thynges to come, nor strenghte, heyght, nor depth, nor anye other creature shall be able to seperate vs from the loue of God whyche is in Christe Iesus oure Lorde.
am gladde to heare these youre wordes, and am fully persuaded yt thys youre ioye shall encrease vnto an excedynge and perfecte reioysynge in the Lord our god, vnto the great and syngulare comforte boeth of youre bodies and soules.
But ye shall note, that the holye Apostle doeth not onely bydde vs reioyse in the Lorde, but he addeth vnto it.
What meaneth the blessed Apostle by thys worde Alwaye? Phile.
Uerily he wyll that oure ioye and reioysynge in the Lorde be not flittyng, transitory and of small con tinuaunce as the pleasure that is conceyued of worldly thynges is, the ende whereof is bytter and sorowfull, as Salomon say eth, the ende of worldelye ioye is heauines, mornening and lamen tynge) but constante, stedfaste, inmutable, not diminishinge but encreasynge vnto an hyghe perfection of godly mirth, ioye, felicitye pleasure.
For he that conti nueth vnto the ende, sayth Christ shal be saued.
It is not ynoughe to begynne well and to continue in the same a certayne space, excepte we perseuer euen vnto the end of our lyfe.
The wyfe of Lot began well, when she came oute of synfull Sodome, but bycause she dyd not goe forthe, but loked backe agayne vnto it, she was turned into a salte pillar.
The wyse menne that came frome the East parte of the worlde to worshyppe Iesus Christe the newe borne kynge of the spirituall Israelites: were co~maunded of god no more to returne to the mooste blouddy and wycked kynge Herode.
Iudas bega~ well and was one of Christes disciples, very earneste in settynge forthe the kyngedome of God for a certain space, but seynge he dyd not perseuer in that Godly purpose, but became of a preacher a treytour, of a disciple a thiefe, of a minister a murtherer, he is now the sonne of perdition and dampned for euermore.
He is not ye true sonne that promiseth hys father, that he wyll worcke in hys viniyarde doeth not, but he that ma~fully worketh in it indede, so perceue teth to ye ende, he shal inioy ye enheritaunce of his father.
For the kingdome of god shal be take~ away fro~ idle lubbers, geuen to theym that worcke and brynge forth the fruits therof.
Not they whych, whe~ they heare the word fyrst of al, do ioyfully receyue it, beleue it for a tyme, talke of it, in the time of tentation go away, slide backe and become other me~, shall possesse eternall lyfe: but they whyche with greate ioy and gladnes of mynde, heare it, receyue it, beleue it, cleaue faste vnto it in the tyme of persecution, and perseuer in the same eue~ vnto the very last breath.
No man is crowned saith saynte Paule, excepte he fyghte lawefullye, that is, vntyll he haue goten the victorye by resistynge the worlde, the Deuyll, and the flesh thorowe Christe oure Lorde.
No manne that putteth hys ha~d to the plough, and loketh backe, is meete for the Kyngedome of heauen.
Hereto agreeth the sayinge of Saynt Peter: If after they haue forsaken the vncleannesse of the worlde by the knoweledge of the Lorde and Sauiour Christ Iesus, they yet againe beyng wrapped in theym are ouercome, the laste is worsse then the fyrste to theym.
For it had bene better for the~ not to haue knowen the way of ryghtuousenes, the~ after theyr knoweledge to turne away from that holy commaundement, that was geuen theym.
But that it chaunced to theim, that is wonte to be spoken in a true prouerbe.
The dogge is returned vnto his vomit, and the sowe cleane washed vnto the wallowinge in the myre.
Of these thyngs aforesaid maye wee learne that it is not inoughe to begyn well, except we perseuer and continue euen vnto the geuynge vp of the Goste, as they vse to saye.
He that continueth to the ende saieth Christ, shall be saued.
If ye abyde in my worde, truelie ye shall be my Disciples, and ye shall knowe the trueth, and the truth shal deliuer you.
We must abyde in the worde of God, or els we can not be Christes disciples.
We are deliuered fro~ the rule of our enemies, saieth holy zachary the prieste father to that mooste excellente Prophete of God.
S. Iohn Baptiste, that we beynge wythout feare shoulde serue god in holines and rightuousnes before him all the dayes of our life.
Note that he saieth, all the daies of oure lyfe muste we serue God in suche holines and ryghtuousnes as is acceptable before hym.
The holye scripture requireth of vs a continuall progresse and an vnletted perseuerau~ce in ye waye of Godlines.
In consideration wherof the blessed Apostle doeth not onely exhort vs to reioyce in the Lorde, but he addeth vnto it Alwaye, requirynge of vs not a flyttynge and transitorye reioysynge, but a constaunte, stedfast, sure, continual and vnchaungeable reioysynge in the Lord.
It is but a trifle to ioy and reioyce in the Lorde, in hys worde and ordinaunces so longe as prosperitye endureth, and the worlde laugheth vpon vs, but to reioyce in the Lorde, in hys word and ordinaunces when we be assayled wyth troublous aduersitie, whe~ we be visited wyth greauouse sicknes, when we be empouerished thorowe miserable misfortunes, whe~ we be hated, blasphemed, persecuted, oppressed, en prysoned, punished of worldelye tyrantes for God, for hys worde and ordinaunces, thys is a perfecte ioye, and christian reioysing to beare the crosse of Christe, to suffer patientlye all kynde of aduersitie, to cleaue faste to God in the tyme of temptation, to be co~tente so well to abyde troubles as prosperouse thynges, tha~kfully to take what so euer plages or punishmentes God shall laye vpon vs, eyther by hys owne louynge visitation or by the crueltye of the wycked worldelynges, whyche are alwaye enemyes to Goddes trueth, and to al true louers of the same, thys is in mine opinion to reioyce alwaye in the Lorde, and to acknowledge hym to be our most gentil father and louinge sauiour, whether he send prosperitie or aduersitie.
If therefore anye of you at anye tyme be visited wyth sickenes or diseases of the body, murmure not, nor grudg not against God, blaspheme hym not, nor speake not vnreuerently of hym, nor yet wyshe not that syckenes to be taken frome you otherwyse then hys Godlye pleasure shall be, whyche knoweth muche better what is expedie~t or profitable for you, then ye youre selues do, but wyth hyghe patience, most herty thankes geuynge, receyue that louynge visitation of youre heauenlye father, as an holy enplasture holsome salue to heale all those pockye diseases wherwt your soules are infected thorowe the stynkynge corruption of olde synfull Adam.
We are corrected and punished of the Lorde, saith S. Paule, that we should not be dampned with thys worlde.
It is good for me that thou haste thus humbled brought me down full lowe, that may learne thy ryghtuous ordinau~ces.
If thou therfore in thy sycknes shalt fele thy fleshe to be impatiente, disobediente to the wyll of God and at defiaunce wt God for thys hys louyng correction, pleasaunte to the spirite, altogyther bitter to the fleshe for a season, restrayne and plucke hyr backe wyth the bytte of patience and neuer leue to fyght againste the furious and rageynge motions of the fleshe, tyll thou haste made hyr obediente to the spirite wyllyng to suffer what soeuer kynde of aduersitie God shall laye vpon hyr backe.
Laboure in thy syckenes so to ioye reioyce in the Lorde, that with hygh pacience and cherefulnes of mynde euen in the myddes of thy moste bitter vexation, thou maiest saye with.
We are not weried, but though oure outwarde man peryshe, yet the inwarde ma~ is renewed daye by day.
For our tribulation whyche is momenta nye, of shorte continuaunce and lyghte, prepareth an exceadynge and an eternall wayeght of glory vnto vs, whyle we loke not on the thynges, whyche are sene but on the thynges whyche are not seene.
For thynges whyche are sene, are temporal, but thynges whyche are not seene are euerlastyng.
Agayne, we knowe surely, if our earthly mantion, wherein wee nowe dwel, were destroyed, that we haue a buildynge ordeined of God, an habitation not made wyth handes, but eternall in heauen.
And that ye maye wt the more patiente and thankeful mynde receyue all kynde of sicknesses and diseases, wherwith ye are at any tyme vexed, loke that ye perswade your selues and beleue vndoubtedly, that your punishme~tes come not vnto you by chaunce, but by the councell, prouidence appoyntme~te of God, wythoute whose wyll an heare doeth not fall from your heades whych also kepeth al your bones so that not one of the~ shal be brused wythoute the permission and sufferau~ce of that our good god.
We are hys flocke, and the shepe of his pasture, therfore like a moste gentyl shephearde considerynge the greuouse diseases, wherewyth we are already infected or els lyke to be, he prepareth hys tarre and greaseth vs wyth that, that we should be free from all contagious diseases, and be founde whole and sounde, when so euer we shall be searched.
For God doth not visite vs wt syckenes other plages that he might destroy vs, cast vs headlong into hell fyre, damne vs perpetually, but to cal vs to repentau~ce, to prouoke vs to come home agayne vnto the shepefolde, to exercise, proue, and trye oure fayeth, yt by thys meanes he myghte saue vs.
For that Lorde, whyche is the searcher of raynes hertes, perceyuinge how olde Adam beginneth to waxe cruell and fearce in vs, restrayneth plucketh hym backe wyth the bridel of sycknes that he shall not do what he hym selfe woulde, but what the good wyll of oure heauenlye father is, whyche els wythoute all doubte woulde so rage and growe vnto suche licencious ryote, that with hys vayne pleasures and fleshly lustes he would deceiue the most precious and noble soule, and so deceyued throwe it into the dager of eternall damnation.
Of these your words may we ryght wel perceiue that afliction, troubles sycknesses, and diceases be no toke~s of Gods Ire wrath, dispeasure towarde vs, but of much hygh mercy, fauour loue, good wyl, yt he beareth to vs. Phile.
For if this most gentle Sauioure and beste God dyd not seke oure saluation, oure wealth and health euerlastyng: he woulde not wyth so sharpe louyng corrections cal vs home agayne vnto the shepefold, but suffer vs to runne hedlonge into all kynde of carnal voluptuousnes and beastly pleasure, and afterwarde for our dissolute liuing reward vs wyth paynes eternal amonge the bealye Goddes and Epicures.
who is so far estrau~ged from the ryght course of reason, that he had not rather haue hys carnal affectes beastly wyll mortified wyth temporal short sicknesses in thys worlde, then for a little space to tumble and wallowe in all kynde of carnall pleasures accordinge to his fleshly desyre, and afterwarde for euer and euer to be cast into such paynes as are boeth intollerable and euerlastyng, where wepinge and gnashynge of teath is, wher the darcknesses are so great that they maye be felte, wher the fyre shall neuer be quenched, where the worme that shall gnawe the conscience of the wicked shal neuer dye, wher there is a lake and stinckeynge puddell, that burneth continuallye wyth fyre and brymstone, wher nothynge shall be fealte but payne, nothyng remembred but synne, nothyng tasted but bitternes, nothinge sene but our mooste wycked enemyes Satan wyth hys infernal ministers, whoe shall not be greaued and ledde wyth a certayne compassion toward the da~ned for the multitude of the moste bitter pai nes, wherin they shal se the~ most miserablie tormented, but they shall reioyce, yea they theim selues shall neuer cease to minister intollerable punishme~tes to the damned soules worlde wythout ende.
whose herte is so enflamed wyth the fyre of carnall pleasure, that waxeth not colde at the hearynge of these thyngs? Whoe hadde not rather in thys worlde continnally to be shaken wyth hot agues, greaued wyth bone ache, eaten wyth canckars, pyned awaye for hunger, and to suffer any other temporall diseases that can be named, be it neuer so greuouse and bitter to the fleshe, then to fal into those most horrible paynes that you named heretofore? The paynes that are suffered in thys worlde are greate and bitter (I confesse) but they haue an ende, and worcke healthe to the soule.
And in lyke maner: the paynes that are sustayned in hell, are boeth greate and bitter also, but they haue no ende, and bryng eternall damnation to the soule.
what plage can be named lyke vnto thys? Who is nowe so stifenecked and harde herted, that he wyll not say wyth the Apostle.
wyll wyth all my herte reioyce in my infirmities weaknes, that the vertue, power and strength of Christ may dwel in me.
Who nowe is so blynde whyche seeth not, that to be visited wyth syckenes in thys world is to receiue a singuler and hygh benefite of God? Who is so far frome true fayeth, that wyll not be perswaded, ye afflictions, troubles, syckenesses and diseases be playne testimonies, and euident sygnes of Goddes good fauoure towarde vs? as the wise man saieth.
The chastening of God thou shalt not refuse, neither grudge thou, whan he shall correcte the.
For whom the Lord loueth, hym he correcteth, and delyghteth hym selfe as the father in the son Dauid also sayeth, blessed is that man, whiche is vnder the lawe and nourtoure of the Lord, Agayne, It is hyghely, for my wealth, Lorde, that thou haste broughte me vnder to learne thy ordinaunces.
Hereto agreeth the sayinge of the Apostle, my sonne despise not the chastenyng of the Lorde, neyther faynte thou, wh thou arte rebuked of hym.
For whom the Lorde loueth, hym he chasteneth, yea and he scourgeth euery sonne, that he receyueth.
If ye endure chastening, God offereth him selfe vnto you as vnto sonnes.
What sonne is that, whom the father chasteneth not? It ye be not vnder correccion (whereof al are partakers) than are ye bastardes and not sonnes.
Wherefore seeynge we had fathers of oure fleshe, whyche corrected vs, and we haue them in reuerence, shoulde we not muche rather be in subiectio~ vnto the fa ther of spiritual giftes? And they verelye for a fewe dayes nourtered vs after theyr own pleasure, but he learneth vs vnto yt, which is profitable, yt we might receiue of his holynes.
Nomaner of cha stesynge for the presente time semeth to be ioyous but greuous, not wythstandynge after warde it bryngeth quiet fruite of rightuousnes vnto them, whiche are exercised in the same.
Beare not therefore, derely beloued impaciently the crosse of sickenes, whan so euer God layeth it on youre backe, neyther striue ye agaynste the good pleasure of your heaue~ ly father, whiche onelye seaketh your comoditye eternal saluaci on, but pacie~tely suffer and praie, yt his godli wil (which is alwaies best) may be done in you, whether he sendeth sickenes or health euer glorifie hys name, reioyse in him being thorowly persuadid that he wil ha~dle you none other wise, than shall make boeth vnto his glori your saluacion, which to resiste were extreme impietie to much vngodlines.
For as much, lord, as we are thy workma~ship are in thy ha~des eue~ as ye claye is in the potters, do wt vs according to thy most godly plea sure onli giue vs a pacient tha~k ful hert, yt whither yu se~dest prospe ritie or aduersitie, siknes or helth quietnes or trouble, we may at al times praise magnify thy most blessed and glorious name.
Nowe Neyghbours euen as would wishe you to reioyse in the Lorde our God, whansoeuer he visite you with his louing correction and scourge of sickenes, so would gladly also haue you to ioye and reioyse in hym, if he at any tyme sendeth pouertye or losse of gooddes to any of you all.
If therefore it so chaunceth, that ye be acombred wyth anye missortune, grudge not agaynst God, but shewe your selfe co~formable to hys godlye wyll in all poyntes, nothynge doubtynge but that losse of youre temporall possessions shal turne vnto your hyghe commoditye and furtheraunce in obtaynynge goodes, whiche are a thousande tymes more precious, meane gods fa uour, quietnes of conscience and eternall glorye.
Let the brother, sayeth Sayncte Iames, that is poore and of lowe degree reioyse in that he is exalted, and the rich in that is made lowe.
For eue~ as the flour of the grasse shall he vanishe awaye.
The sonne riseth wyth heate, and the grasse widereth, and his floure falleth away, and the beautie of the fashio~ of it perisheth: euen so shall the ryche ma~ perishe wyth hys abundau~ce The goodes of thys world, wher wyth ye be ryghtuouslye endued are gods, if therefore it shall be hys good pleasure at anye tyme to take them from you, grudge not agaynste hym for takeynge his owne, but rather with a tha~full and reioysynge herte saye wyth the paciente manne Iobe, the Lord gaue it, the Lorde hath taken it awaye agayne.
As it pleased the Lorde, so is it come to passe.
Paraduenture God perceyueth, that thy mynde is so muche set on te~porall possessio~s yt yu cleane forgettest ye spiritual riches heauenly treasures of the soule, therfore he mi~di~g to make the his son heire of eternal glo ry of much better more excellente goodes than this beggerly vale of misery can co~prehend, taketh away fro~ the mucke of this world, that yu maiest ye more frely aspire breath forward vnto the getti~g of heaue~ly riches, wher wt the soule bei~g gorgeously decked may after this transitory life sit gloriously in the glorious palace of heaue~.
For what doth it profit a ma~, sayth christ thoughe he win neth al ye world, loseth his sole? Againe, hord not vp tresures vnto you on ye earth, wher rust mothes corrupte, and where theues breake thorow steale.
But hord ye vp treasures in heauen, where neither rust nor mothes corrupt, wher theues breake not vp nor yet steale.
For wher your tresure is, ther wil your hert be also.
And yt ye may bere ye crosse of pouertie wt the more pacie~t mind reme~ber yt though christ was lord ouer al, yet was he so pore fro~ hys infancie vnto his depature out of this world, yt he had not a place, wher once to rest his hed.
His mother al ye apostles wt mani blessed mar+ters, faythfull ministers of gods word other innumerable yt were good me~ derely beloued of god escaped not ye harde dart of pouer ty.
Now sei~g ye haue christ ye lord of lordes king of ki~ges, his ble+ssed mother, wt ye holy Apostles marters &c exe~plars of pouerti to folow and practise, if God at any time do lay ye crosse of necessiti on youre backes, suffer it boeth pacie~tly tha~kefully.
Disdaine not you beynge seruauntes to beare ye burden, which your lord maister refused not to take vpo~ hym.
Ye knowe the liberalitie of oure Lorde Iesu Christe, sayeth S. Paule, that for youre sake he became poore whan he was ryche, yt ye thorowe his pouertie should waxe ryche.
Neyghboure Philemon, althoughe, thankes be to God, we haue oure brestes so well furnyshed and fortressed wyth the weapons and armours of holy scriptures against the viole~ce of all misfortunes, yet some perchaunce not beynge thorowly instructed of Gods liberalitie towarde his creatures, wyll obiect and saye, as the comon prouerbe is, necessitye is an hearde darte.
And honger is a sharpe thorne, howe than can we take pouertye so pacientlye, that we maye reioyse in the Lord our God, name+ly in so greate penurie and scasenes of thynges.
answere wyth the Psalmographe, haue bene yonge, and nowe am olde, yet neuer sawe right tuous man forsaken, nor his sede beggynge their breade on the earth.
If thou therefore be ryght tuouse, that is, fayethfull to God and iuste to thy neyghboure laboringe diligently for thy lyuing accordynge to the vocacion and callynge, as God hath commaun ded the, thou mayste be sure not to wante, that shal suffice nature Who euer trusted in God, and wente awaye succoureles? Caste thy care on the Lord, and he shall nourishe the, sayeth Dauid.
Beholde the eys of the Lorde are vpon them that feare hym, and vpon them that truste in his mercye, that he maye deliuer their liues from death, and nourishe the~ in the tyme of honger.
They which seeke the Lord, shall want no good thynge.
Feare not my sonne, sayeth Tobias, we leade a pore lyfe, notwythstandynge we shal haue plentye of al good thin ges if we feare the Lorde, depart from all synne and do well.
God gyueth vs abou~dantly in al thin ges to enioye them sayeth sainct Paule.
God him selfe sayeth, wyll not fayle the nor yet forsake the.
Who beynge a fayethfull manne, althoughe neuer so muche oppressed wyth pouertye, wyl not reioyse in the lord, which hath promised and wil no les per fourme, that he wyll not forsake so manye as truste in hym.
And that ye may be thorow ly perswaded of hys, faythfulnes concernyng thaccomplishement of his promes, consider, praye pages missing] you, howe frendly and fayethful+ly he dealt in tymes paste wyth his seruauntes, and wyll no les fauorably handle vs, if we haue lyke fayeth in hym.
Dyd he not fede the people of Israell wyth meate from heaue~, and gaue the~ drincke out of the rocke? Dyd he not sende meate twise a daye by the rauens to the Prophet Helias, and so miraculously fed him, wha~ the vnfaythful perished for ho~ger? Did not Christ turne wa ter into wyne at the mariage in Cana Galile? Dyd not Christe wyth fyue barlye loues and two fyshes fede fyue thousande men besydes womenne and children, and yet there of remained baskettes full of the fragmentes? Do not all these histories teache vs to haue fayeth in God, and to beleue that God hath a father lye care for hys seruauntes? page duplicate] page duplicate] What so euer thynges are wryten, are writte~ sayth blessed Paul for oure learnynge, that thorowe pacience and co~forte of the scriptures we shoulde haue hope.
It is not to be passed ouer at thys presente, that Christe hath in the gospel of Mathewe.
Be not care full for youre lyfe what ye shall eate, or what ye shall drincke, nor yet for youre bodye, what ye shal put on.
Is not ye life more worth than meate? And the bodie more of valure than rayment? Behold the foules of the ayer, for they sowe not, neyther reape nor carye into the barnes, and youre heauenly father fedeth them.
Are ye not much better tha~ they? Which of you by takyngr thoughte can put one cubite to hys stature? And why care ye the~ for raiment? Consider the lylies of the felde, howe they growe.
They laboure not, neyther spinne, and yet tel you, yt Salomon in al his rialtie was not arayed lyke vnto one of these.
Wherfore if god so cloth ye grasse, whyche is to daye in the felde, and to morowe shall be cast into ye fornace, shal he not muche more do the same to you, ye of litle fayeth? Take therefore no thoughte sayinge, what shall we eate, or what shall we drincke, or wherewyth shall we be clothed? After al these thynges seake the heathen.
For youre heauenly father knoweth, that ye haue nede of all these thynges.
But seke ye firste the kyngdome of heauen and the ryghtuousnes thereof, and all these thynges shalbe cast vnto you.
Lette the heathen take thought for their liuinge, which knowe not God, as for the fayth full Christians thei haue a lorde whiche wyl prouyde for them abou~dauntly.
Let adulteres forni cators, theues, Dronkardes, swe rers, and suche other wycked par sonnes take care wherewith they shall be fedde and cladde, as for the seruauntes of God they haue an almyghtye Lorde in heauen, whiche wyll sende them plentye of all good thynges.
If ye be louynge and obediente, sayeth the Prophet Esay, ye shal enioye the beste thynge that groweth in the lande.
But if ye be obstinate and rebelious, ye shall be deuoured with the swerd.
For thus the lord hath promised wyth hys owne mouth.
The wicked therfore and not the faythfull shall want and be oppressed wyth famyne.
If God taketh such fatherly care for hys seruauntes, howe than commeth it to passe manye tymes, that those, whyche seeke most of al hys glory, lede in this worlde the most base miserable lyfe, and often are found socourles and destitute of all mannes healp? Whan they whych be vnfayethfull regarde, neyther God nor any thynge that is godly, dis pise hys most blessed worde, persecute the true preachers thereof, oppresse theyr pore neyghboures deale vniustly wyth all men &c, haue ouer flowyng abou~daunce of al thinges, lyue lyke voluptuous Epicures in al kind of pleasure, possesse whatsoeuer theyr hertes can wishe or desire.
Thys thing se we presentely before our eyes, and as it may be gathered of the holye Scriptures, manye good menne in tymes paste haue complayned of this thynge vnto god and almooste, as it were, accused God of vnryghtuousnes.
Are not these the wordes of the holye and paciente man Iobe When consider my selfe am a trayde, and my fleshe is smitten wyth feare.
Wherefore do wycked men lyue in health and prosperite, come to ther olde age and increase in ritches? Their childre~ lyue in their syghte, and their generacion before their eyes.
Their houses are safe from all feare, and the rodde of God doth not smyte them.
Their bullocke gendereth, and that not oute of tyme, their cowe calueth, and is not vnfruiteful.
They send forth their chyldren by flockes, and their sonnes leade the daunce.
They beare wyth them tabrettes and harpes, and haue instrumen tes of musicke at their pleasurs.
The holy Prophet Ie remye maruelynge greatelye at the prosperitie of ye wycked speaketh to God on thys maner.
Lorde thou art more ryghtuous then should dispute wyth the.
How happeneth it, that the way of the vngodli is so prosperous? that it goeth so wel wyth them, which wythout any shame offende and lyue in wyckednes? Thou plantist them, and they take rote, they growe and brynge forth fruite.
Are not these the wordes also of the blessed Psalmographe? truely God is louynge vnto Israell, and vnto suche as are of acleane herte.
Neuertheles my fete were almost gone, my treadinges had welnigh flypt.
And why? was greued at the wicked, do se also the vngodly in such prosperitie.
For they are in no parell of death, but are lusty and stronge.
they come in no misfortune lyke other folke, neyther are they plaged lyke other men.
And thys is the cause, why they be so holden wyth pryde, and ouerwhelmed wyth crueltye, theyr eyes swel for fatnes, and they do euen what they luste.
They corrupte other, and speake of wycked blasphemy theyr talking is against the most higheste.
For they stretche forthe theyr mouthe vnto heauen, and theyr tonge goeth thorowe the worlde.
Therfore fall the people vnto the~, therout sucke they no smal aduauntage.
Tush say they howe shoulde God perceyue it? Is there anye knowledge in the moste hygheste? Lo, these are the vngodlye, these prospere in the worlde, and these haue ryches in possession.
Againe the Apostles of Christe, euen Christe him selfe beinge wyth them, were sumtime so hungry destitute of al kinde of vitaile: yt as they wente by the waye they were co~pelled euen for very hu~ger to plucke ye eares of corne, and to eat it.
And doth not S. Paul in these wordes declare the miserable state boeth of hym selfe, and of hys felowaposties? Euen vnto thys tyme (sayeth he) we hunger, and thyrste, and are naked, and are buffeted wyth fystes, and haue no certayne dwellynge plase, and laboure worckynge with oure handes.
We are made as the fylthynes of the worlde, the ofscourynge of all thynges, euen vnto thys daye.
At the maryage in Cana Galile wher Christe hym selfe was present wt the blessed virgin Mary hys Mother and hys disciples, was there not suche scarsenesse, that they wa~ted wyne before the weddynge feaste was done? And yet it is to be thought, that both they whych were maried and the other ther assembled, were Christes frendes and dearly beloued of Christ.
What shal rehearse the historye of the ryche manne whych was gorgeously appareled fared daintilye euerye day, and of the pore Lazar, whych died for hunger? The riche glutto~ lyued pleasauntly and was dam ned in hel, the pore Lazar lyuing in all kinde of worldelye miserye after the death of his body reigneth in glory with god.
The enemy of God hathe after hys owne carnal luste all thynges, the fre~d of God wanteth, that should suffice the necessary appetite of nature.
confesse that for the mooste parte the wycked in thys worlde haue more aboundaunce of temporall goodes, and lyue a thousande tymes more pleasau~tlye in the face of the worlde, then the true christians do, God thorow his vnsearcheable wisdome so appoyntinge, whyche afore seeth much better then we, what is necessarye for vs. Notwythstandynge thoughe God doeth not customably send to hys serua~tes suche abundaunce of worldelye treasures, as voluptuous world lyngs do possesse, lest theyr mindes snarled wyth the loue of the~ shoulde be withdrawen from the true euerlastynge goodnes (as it cometh to passe in mani) yet ve ry seldon or neuer doeth he leaue theim socourles but se~deth them, what so euer is necessarye for the sustentation of theyr eadye and pore lyfe accordynge to hys promyse, as he sayed vnto hys disciples, When sent you, wythout wallet, and scrippe, and shous, lacked ye anye thynge? And they sayed, No.
Truely no more shall we lacke any necessarye thynge, if we loue God obey hys word The fayethful maye perchaunce sometyme fele the dart of pouertie, yet wyll not God leaue theim socourles and destitute of helpe For God sendeth pouertie sumtyme to the ryghtuousse for to proue hys fayeth, and to styrre hym vp to call on hym whych is the geuer of al good things, that he maye knowe by the exercise of hys fayeth, yt they be the gyftes of God, as the wyse man sayeth.
Good and euyll, lyfe and deathe, pouertye and riches are of God.
For it is an easye thyng in the syght of God, quickely to enriche a pore man.
Disconfort not yourselues therefore (deare brethren) thoughe sumetyme ye fele the crosse of pouerty, but be on a good confort, ioye and reioyce in God.
For God hathe promised, that he wyl not leaue nor forsake you, but gyue you all good thynges abundauntlye for your presente necessitie..
Hys delaye is onelye to proue your fayeth, and to prouoke you to fle vnto hym by teruent prayer, and to require of hym al thinges necessary for your lyuynge.
If ye do thys (so ye be not idle, but worcke accordynge to youre callynge) the earthe shall soner cease to gyue forth hir fruit, then ye shal wa~t your honest necessaries.
Reioyce therfore in the lorde alwai, once again sai reioyce Chr.
The Lord of heaue~ giue vs al grace so to order our life accor dyng to hys holy worde, so to repose our affiaunce in hym, so to call on hys mooste blessed name, in al oure aduersitie, and so to be thankefull for hys exceadynge goodnesse towarde mankynde, that we be not found altogyther vnworthy the recepte of hys benefites.
Fi nallye as woulde haue you to reioyce in the Lorde, when so euer he sendeth you syckenes, pouerty or any other crosse to nurture you, to mortifye olde Adam, to slea your carnal lusts, to make your bodies subiect to the spirite that they maye be a liuynge and holy sacrifice to God, so woulde exhorte you to reioyce also in the Lorde, if at any tyme he rayseth vp tyrants to persecute you for the feruent zeale, and Godlye loue, that ye beare toward the ve ritie and trueth of hys moste blessed word.
For as it came to passe in the tyme of Moyses the prophetes, in ye daies of Christ hys Apostles, eue~ so hathe it bene fro~ theyr tyme vnto thys daye, that the bealyed hypocrites, wicked wordelynges haue euer hated, styl vnto the worldes ende, shall hate the glorious lyght of Gods worde.
Neyther is it any meruel For as concernynge the bealied hypocrites, Gods word condemneth their hypocrisie, superstitio~, fayned holines, newe founde religion, carnall ceremonies, outwarde sanctimonie, and all the whole glitterynge face of theyr popishe solemnitie.
It cryeth out vpon theym, that they are so idle and do not onely not preache the~ selues, but also forbyde other, yt woulde boeth gladlye and frelye set forth ye glory of Christes gospell vnto the exceadynge conforte and greate Ioye of all true christia~s, yea they persecute the~, blaspheme them, enpryson them, burne theim. &c.
It crieth out vpon the~ that haue so greate multitudes of worldelye possessions, and yet make no prouisio~ for the poore people, for the vertuousse bryngynge vp of youthe in good letters and vertuousse maners, but spende it vpon gorgeousse buildinges, lusty horses, delicate fare, idle lubbers, yea vpon haukes, dogges and whores.
It crieth out vpon them, that wheras they ought to be the lyght of the worlde, and to gyue example of vertuouse lyuynge to all menne, they are become of all men most abhominable, moste leude, moste vngodly, moste geuen to idlenes moste drowned in voluptuousenes, and altogyther sworne to do mischiefe.
Howe can these bealygods and swynyshe Hypocrites whose lyfe is ouerwhelmed with the darcke cloudes of syn, abide the gloryous lyghte of Christes gospell? Howe can these gluttonyshe Epicures suffer theyr Hypocrisy and fayned holines to be rebuked of the poore abiectes and vyllaynes of this worlde by the authoritie of Goddes worde? It can not be, it can not be.
For euery one that doeth euyll, sayth Christ, hateth the lyght, neyther cometh he to the lyght, least hys works should be reproued.
Now as co~cerninge the wicked worldlings, thei ca~ fauour no more the truth of Gods word, the~ the bealied hipocrites.
For it conde~neth their couetousnes, theyr ambitio their vain glory, their pride, their whordome, their pollynge, their pillinge, their falshode, theyr oppression, their vnmercifulnes, theyr cruelty, theyr tyrannye, and what so euer ahomination they vse beside.
Howe can it otherwise come to passe, but they whych rebuke these vices, muste neades be hated, persecuted, enprisoned and slayne of the wycked worldlynges for tellynge the~ the truth for rebukynge these theyr most abhominable and outragiousse synnes? as the prophete sayeth.
They hate hym that reproueth them openlye, and who so telleth them the playne trueth, they abhorre hym.
Can lighte and darcknes agre? Can Christ and Beliall be at vnitie? No more canne the worckers of wyckednes, and the rebukers of the same be ledde wyth one consente.
There muste nedes be disse~tion betwen the~, as was betwene Abell, and Cayne, Iacob and Esau, Christ and the byshoppes, the Apostles, and the worldelye tyrantes.
And for as muche as the same impietie and vngodlynes, the same wyckednes and abhomination reigneth nowe in the worlde, that hathe bene vsed in tymes paste, and it ought of veri duti to be rebuked at thys presente wyth no lesse libertye of speache, then it hathe bene in tymes paste, excepte wee wyll wyncke at so greate abhomination, and wyth the wycked worldelynges, and bealied hypo crites syncke downe to the deuyl for oure laboure, it is not to be doubted, but they that shall take vpon them that office, shal proue fynd euen that same gentilnes at theyr handes, that Moyses the Prophetes, Christe and hys Apostles, the holye martyrs and blessed sayntes, receyued of their bluddy predecessours.
Therfore if the waues and surges of cruell persecution shal at any tyme rise againste vs (the good wyl of our heauenlye father so prouidynge, without whole sufferaunce al the hypocrites in the worlde can do nothynge agaynst vs) let vs not despayre nor cast away our hope but styl go forth to reioyce in the Lorde oure God, and manfullye abyde by the veritie of his word, reme~bring yt it is called the word of the crosse, trouble persecutio~ remembringe that no kynde of aduersitie chaunceth to vs, but the same happened in times past to the Prophetes and Apostles, yea to Christ hym selfe that pure Lambe of God, remembrynge yt all, whyche wyll lyue Godlye in Christe Iesus, shall suffer persecution, remembrynge that by the crosse awaye is prepared for vs vnto eternall lyfe.
And that we maye wyth the more free spirite and francke courage reioyce in the Lord, when so euer the crosse or persecution is layed on oure backes for Goddes sake and for hys Gospell, let vs enarme oure selues wyth the co~fortable textes of the holye scripture, and call to remembraunce the hystories of the blessed menne of God, whych also suffred like or greater pains for the glorye of the Lorde, not forgettynge that euen frome the beginyng of the worlde, the wicked bega~ to persecute the godly as we may see in Abel and suche other.
Unto this pacience and the folowing of the prophetes, doeth blessed Iames exhorte vs saying.
Behold the husband man waiteth for the precious fruite of the earth, and hath long patie~ce therupo~ vntyll he receiue ye yarelye later raine.
Be ye also patiente therfore, and settle youre hertes, for the commynge of the Lord draweth nye, Grudge not one agaynste an other brethren, leste ye be dampned.
Take (my brethren) the prophets for an exemple of sufferynge aduersitie, of patience, whyche spake in the name of the Lorde.
Blessed are ye, when men reuile you, persecute you, and shall falselye saye all maner of euyll saying agaynste you for my sake.
Reioyce and be glade, for great is your reward in heauen.
For so persecuted they the Prophetes, whyche were before you.
What pleasures the holy prophetes of God found at the worldes hande, it is not hard to expresse.
Esaie that moste excellente Prophet of God for hys libertie of speache in rebukynge the syn of the princes and of the people, and for prophesyeng of the vengeaunce of god to fal vp+po~ the co~treie and people for not receiuing the word of god, was cut in two partes a su~der wyth a sawe of wode.
The prophet Iere+my was stoned vnto death of his people at Taphnes in Egipte, because he rebuked them of their wicked liuynge and exhorted the~ vnto repentaunce and amendemente of lyfe.
The Prophete Amos at the commaundemente of kynge Amasias for hys preachinge was cruelly beaten and greuously tormented, and at the laste the Kynges sonne Ochosias caused hym to be thurste into the temples of the heade wyth a great naile oftrone, so shortli af ter died.
The Prophet Micheas was cruelly beate~, emprisoned, fed wt breade water, because he spake the trueth, told the king, what should chaunce vnto hym.
The Prophete Helias was greuously persecuted of quene Iesa ble kinge Achabes wife for speakinge agaynste Baall and hys chaplens.
The Prophet zacharie son of Barachias was stoned to death for telling the king truth.
The Prophete Daniell was cast into the denne of lions, because that contrarye to kynge Darius commaundemente he prated vnto his Lord the God Israell.
Which of the prophetes escaped wythout persecution? And as the wicked worldlynges and bellie Hypocrites handled the prophetes of God for telling the trueth, so handled they al other yt obeied not their wickedlawes and filthy requestes.
Were not Sidrach, Misac, Abednago caste into a firie fornace, because they would not worship the golden Image that kinge Nabugodonoser had made, but only ye God of Israel? Was not Achimelech wyth certaine other holy me~ of god slaine at kynge Saules commaundemente, because he she wed kyndenes to Dauid the hertye beloued seruaunte of God? Was not Io sephe caste into prisonne, because he woulde not leane to the filthy requeste of hys Lordes wyfe? Was not Susan that vertuous woman at the poynt to be stoned vnto death, because she woulde not consente to the vnlaufull and fylthy requestes of the two Iudges? Was not Eleazarus miserablye put to death, because at the kinges comaundement would not eat swines fleshe contrarie to the lawe of God? was not a certayne woman wyth her seuen sonnes most cruelly put to death, because they would not obaye the wycked precepte of the most wicked kinge? passe ouer many other of the olde testame~t, which were vnmercifully persecuted and slayne for gods trueth Some, as the blessed Apostle say eth, were tried wyth mockynges scourginges wyth bondes prisonment, some were stoned, some were hewen a sunder, some were slayne with swerde, al were troubled and vexed.
These are they, of whom the wise man spea keth, god proued the~, and founde the~ meete for him selfe, yea as the golde in the fornace dyd he trye the~, and receyued the~ as a brunte offeringe. &c. Phi.
As may at ye last come to the newe testament, to who~ is it vnknowne, that Iesus Christ our Lorde sauioure after mani blasphemies, rebukes slaunders and bitter tormentes, suffred the most spiteful death of ye crosse, so entered in to glorye? Holye Iohn Baptist that blessed priestes sonne for trueth tellynge to king herod for reprouing hym of his abhominable liuing, was cast into prisonne and beheaded.
Iames the brother of Iohn had his head striken of for preaching Christ to be son of ye liuinge god.
Stephe~ was stoned vnto deth, because he prea ched Christ, affirmed that God dwelleth not in temples made wt mans ha~d, What kindnes Peter and Paule wt the other apostles fou~d at ye ha~des of the~, whose saluacio~ they most dilige~tly sought, the histories make mencio~.
Neyther do heare speake of those blissed martirs, which syns their dayes haue died for the confessio~ of gods trueth, so that the Gospel of Christe is not without a cause called of sainct.
For al that wyl lyue godlye in Christ Iesu, sayeth he, shal suffer persecution.
To consider these histories afore rehersed, shall stablishe our fayeth greately, and very much comforte vs in the tyme of oure tribulacion, so that we shall not lyghtely slyde frome God and frome hys holye worde, but reioyse in hym, recou~tynge oure selues moste blessed, fortunate and wealthy, that god hath vouched safe not only that we shoulde beleue in him, but also suffer for hym.
It shall be expediente for vs also to remember that Christe calleth them blessed which suffer persecution for righ tuousnes sake, and sayeth, that theirs is the kingdome of heaue~.
Agayne, that the seruaunt is not greater tha~ hys Lord, but if they persecuted Christ our Lorde and maister, thei wil also persecute vs his seruauntes Disciples.
If they haue called the father of the houshold Belzebub, much more they wyl cal them so, that are of hys housholde.
If we were of the worlde, the worlde woulde loue vs, but for asmuche as we are not of the worlde, but Christ hath chosen vs out of the world, therfore doth the world hate vs.
And did not Christe tel vs afore, that we should lament and wepe that is to saye, be oppressed of tirauntes, but the worlde shoulde reioyse, and that in the world we should haue affliction and trouble? Agayne, are we not taughte yt by many tribulations we must enter into the kingdome of God.
The fleshe abhorreth trouble persecution, namely whan death is like to folow. phile.
The spirite, as Christ sayeth, is redye and of a good courage to suffer al thinges for the glorie of God, but the fleshe is weake.
The outward man is loeth to dye, but the inward man wisheth to be losoned out of this corruptible body and to be wyth Christ.
But if the good wil of our heaue~ly father so be, yt we muste nedes suffer death for Christes sake, let vs set thys saying of S. Paule before oure eies, and stedfastli beleue it: if we die with christ, we shal liue with him.
If we suffer wt him we shall also reigne with him.
And our sa uioure Christ sayeth, whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake and for ye Gospel, he shal kepe it.
Here to agreeth the saying of s. Peter, detelye beloued, maruaile not, that ye are proued bi fire (whiche thyng is to trie you) as thoughe some strau~g thing happened vnto you, but reioyse in asmuch as ye are partakers of christes passion, yt when his glory appereth, ye may be mery glad.
For ye glory the spirite of god resteth vpo~ you.
Againe, if any ma~ suffer as a Christen man, let hym not be a shamed, but let him glorifie God on this behaulfe And let the~ yt are troubeled accordinge to ye will of God, co~mit ther soules to him wt wel doing as vnto a faythful cre ature.
They yt suffer trouble for ye lordes sake for the gospell, shal stande before the glorious seate of God, and before the lambe Christe, and they shall be clothed wyth longe whyte garmentes and palmes in their handes.
They shal euer be in the presence of the seat of God, and serue him daye and nyghte in hys temple, and he that sitteth in the seate, shall dwell amonge them.
They shall honger no more neyther thyrste, neyther shall the sunne lyghte on the~, neyther any heate.
For the lambe whyche is in the middes of the seate, shal fede the~, and lede them vnto fountaynes of liuynge water, and God shall wype awaye al teares from their eyes.
Furthermore it shall be greate comforte for vs also to remember, wyth what wyllynge hertes Christ and al the blissed martires suffered death for the glorye of God.
Christe oure Lorde and sauioure, whan the tyme of hys bytter passion beganne to drawe nyghe, and perceyued that Iudas wente aboute to betraye hym to the Byshopes and priestes sayde, that thou entendeste to do, do it quickelye and out of hand.
And whan the Byshoppes seruauntes came to laye hande on hym, where as he myght haue escaped their cruell handes, he wyllyngely offered hym selfe vnto them, whereby we maye se, that he wente vnto hys death wyth a merye and ioyefull herte.
These hys wordes, which long before his passion he spake to ye Iewes, do also testify and wytnes his redy bente good wyll to suffer for the saluacion of mankynd.
Therfore doeth my father loue me, because gyue ouer my lyfe, that maye take it agayne.
No manne taketh it a+way fro~ me, but gyue it ouer eue~ of myne own good wil haue power to gyue it ouer, haue power to take it againe.
Of the willinge oblacion of him selfe, it was prophecied by the ho+ly Prophetes.
The prophet Esai sayeth, he was offered, because it was his good pleasure.
Dauid also saith in the parson of Christ, wil offer sacrifice vnto the wil+lingly.
Againe Christe hym selfe sayeth by the forsayde Prophet vnto his heaue~lye father as for sacrifice and offerynge thou wouldest none, therfore madeste thou me a bodie.
As for burnte offeringes for synne, thou hast not alowed them.
Than sayed I, behold am at hand In the begin ing of the boke is it writte~ of me, that should do thy wyl God Phile.
As the lord Christ willing+ly suffered for the health of man so likewise did the apostles suffer al kindes of tormentes ioyefully for the glorye of God, for the settinge forth of his blessed worde for the name of Iesu Christe the lord, as we rede in the actes of ye apostles.
They were whipped of the byshopes seruauntes, as S. Luke testifieth, because they prea ched Christ, so sent awaye.
But whan thei came fro~ the councell, they reioysed, yt thei were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for the name of Iesu.
How glad, ioyeful and redie the blessed Apostle S. Paule was to suffer any kinde of torment for Christes sake, these his wordes do abou~da~tly shewe.
Beholde beinge bound in the spirite, go forth vnto Hierusalem, not knowyng what thinges shall chaunce vnto me ther, but yt the holy goste in euery citie doth testifie, sayinge, yt bondes troubles do abide me.
But care not for the~, neither is my life dere vn to me, so that maye finishe my course wt ioye, ye office which haue receyued of ye lord to testifithe gospell of the grace of God.
Againe, whe~ Agabus ye prophet toke Paules girdel, bound hys ha~des fete ther wt, saying, thus sayeth the holye goste, the man, whose girdel this is, shal the Iewes thus bind at Hierusale~, and they shall deliuer hym into the handes of the heathen: and whe~ they that were wyth Paule hearynge these thynges, moste insta~tly desired him, that he should not go vp vnto Hierusalem, the blissed apostle answered saying, what do ye wepyng and troubelynge my herte? am redye not only to be bounde but also to die at Hierusalem for the name of ye Lord Iesu.
The lord Iesu christ was so dere vnto him, yt for his sake for the anauncement of his glorye, for ye setting forth of his most glorious gospel, he feared neither chea nes nor death.
He alwayes had before hys eyes ye short paines of this world ye euerlastinge ioyes of ye world to come.
He euer reme~bred this saying of ye lord Christ, whosoeuer shall lose hys lyfe for my sake for the gospel, he shall kepe it.
He neuer forgat these his maisters wordes, whosoeuer shal be ashamed of me of my sayi~gs in this whorishe sinful generacion, the son of man shal also be a shamed of him, wha~ he shal come in ye glory of his father wt ye holy angelles.
But whosoeuer shal co~ fesse me before me~, shall co~fesse him also before my father, which is in heue~.
We rede also yt the bli+ssed martire Ignatius after many greuous torme~tes was thrate+ned if he wold not forsake christ hys word, yt he shuld be cast vnto wilde beastes, so be deuoured.
But he being nothinge abashed wt those threates but perceyuing his death to be differted, whiche he so greatly desired to suffer for christes name, wrot an Epistle to the Romaines, desired the~ that thei woulde kepe hym no lenger fro~ his martirdome, but wt al expedicio~ bringe to passe yt thei had so long threatened.
In the which epistle amo~g many other wordes which declare hys valia~t fayth mighti courage in god, he wrigh teth on this maner.
Wha~ shall they come? whan shal they be sente out? whan shal they eate my fleshe? would wishe wt al my herte, yt they might be more gredy, wil bid the~ vnto ye deuouri~g of me, praie the~, lest par adue~ture, as they haue done in many, thei feare to touch my bodie.
Yea if they shal make any de lay, my selfe wil brast into the~, offer my selfe to the~.
Gyue me liberty besech you, for know what is expedient for me.
Nowe that beginne to be the disciple of Christ, let fyres, galowes, wild beastes, breakyng of my bones, rackynge of my membres, payne thorowout all my bodye, and all the punyshmentes of the world, that can be inuented by the craft and subtilty of the deuyll be ministered vnto me.
wyll refuse none of theim all, so that maye deserue to obtaine Iesus Christ.
valeant and noble souldi our of our most mighty capitain Christ Iesu.
what a myrrour glasse and spectacle is here offered vnto vs, wherein we maye se and learne not onelye hygh patience, but also an exceadynge desyre to suffer al kynde of tormentes for the glory of Christe.
Not onely the blessed martyre Ignatius shewed him selfe wylling and ioyfull to suffer all kynde of aduersitie, yea verye death for the co~fession of Christ, and of hys blessed trueth, but other holye men innumerable, as we reade in histories.
Whe~ Decius the Emperoure that mooste cruel tyraunte hadde spoyled the blessed martyre Hypolitus of his vestures, bycause he woulde not do sacrifice to false Gods, the ma~ of God spake boldely vnto him, sayinge, thou haste not spoyled me of my garmentes, but thou haste rather begun to clothe me.
And when the aforsayde tyraunt co~maunded that he should be clo thed agayne wt his own accustomed kynd of apparaile, and said vnto hym.
Use thyne olde seruice whych thou hast euer had in our syght, be our frende: the blessed martyre wt a stoute courage answered, my seruyse is thys, faithfully to serue Christe, and by seruyng him, spedly to come vnto a frutefull victory.
Shortlye after the tirant seyng his stedfast and vnshake~ co~sta~cy co~mau~ded him to be depryued of all hys goodes and to be headed wt diuers other about ye nu~bre of nintene, whiche al wyth ioyfull courage suffered death for Christes sake.
The blessed martyre Tiburtius was apprehe~ded of ye cruel iudge Fabia~, and co~mau~ded either to offer sacrifice to ye Idols, or els to go wt naked fete vpo~ the hote burning coles.
He boldly we~t on the~ barefoted hauinge no harme, saied to ye tyrante.
Lay away thine vnfaithfulnes, learne that he is the God alone, who~ we co~fesse to haue power, ouer all creatures.
For thorowe the myghte of my Lorde Iesus Christe, me thynke that goyng vpon burnyng coles walke as it were vpo~ red roses wtout fealynge of anye paine or hurt of my fete.
When the tyraunt sawe that the fyre dyd hym no harme, he commaunded that he should be slayne wt the swerd.
The blessed martyre wente vnto hys deathe wyth a toyfull herte, praysynge God, that he woulde vouchsafe to gyue hym strength for to confesse his mooste blessed name holy word before worldly tyrantes.
S. Cipria~ should be headed, bicause he was an enemy to the Goddes of the Romains, and wold serue none but Christe alone the sonne of almighty God, ye blessed martyre with a lusty courage and me ry hert braste out into these wordes, sayinge.
thanke almyghty God, whyche voucheth safe to losen me from the ba~des of this body.
When Maximianus that moste cruell Empe roure commaunded hys souldiours to worshyppe false Goddes and to slea so manye as professed Christ hys blessed word, Mauricius wt his felowes answered that eyther in worshypping false Goddes, or in sleaynge the true Christians, they by no meanes would obeye the Emperour, We are, sayd they, thy souldidur, Emperour, but yet we frely confesse, that wee are the seruauntes of God, which gaue vs thys our life.
We can not folowe the Emperour so, that we shoulde denye God our maker, yea and thy ma ker also, whether thou wylte or wylte not.
We are christian men, therefore maye wee not persecute such as professe Christe.
We are readye rather to dye, then to kyll suche.
And wee are more desierousse to dye innocentes, then to lyue wycked and synfull.
Know thou that the mindes of thys army by no meanes can be ouercome.
Oure breaste is enarmed wyth the fayeth of Christ, which is oure shylde bucler, and defe~ce agaynste the fyrye dartes of the deuil, of al his souldiours.
Therfore slee thou, kil thou, mur ther thou, minister what kynd of payne thou wylte, we wt a bolde courage offer our selues to suffer for the glory of God.
And shortly after ye holy man of God, wyth a greate nu~bre of blessed martyrs mo were slaine wt the swerd.
These be notable exe~ples worthy to be practised of al faythfull christia~s, if God at any time calleth the~ vnto this conflicte wt the worldely tyrau~tes fained holy hypocrites for the co~fessio~ of hys blessed trueth.
Philem could rehearse many mo godly hystories to declare wt what a readye wyll wyth howe reioysing an hert, the blessed martyrs of Christ suffred all maner of bitter tormentes for the Lords sake, but these at this presente shall suffice.
For hereof maye ye learne to practise thys word of the Apostle Alway.
mean to reioyce in the Lorde our God not onely in prosperitie, but also in aduersitie, be it in sycknes, losse of goodes, pouertie, persecution, or anye other crosse, yt god our father laieth vpo~ vs.
For this the duty of a true christen ma~ to co~ceyue that same fayeth, hope and ioye, in God, when he is assayled in tribulation, that he had before, when all thynges were moste prosperouse to him.
And bycause he woulde haue vs earnestlye to reioyce in the Lorde at al tymes, be it in prosperitie or aduersitie, he doubleth this word, Reioyce, saiyng.
Reioyce in the Lord alway yea once agayne, saye reioyce.
Piththye and full of efficacye is thys sentence of the Apostle, and comprehendeth in it many Godly misteries, as ye haue hytherto partely hearde.
S. Paule desiereth nothyng more, then that we shoulde reioyce in the Lord.
His ioye is altogyther in God, therefore would he, that yours should be so lykewyse.
And vnto thys doeth that princelyke prophet ex hort you also, saying.
Be ye glad reioyce in the Lord, ye rightuous, and al ye that are true her ted, be mery in the Lord.
Agayne Let so mani as trust in ye, lord, be meri, yea, thei shal be ioyful for euer, and thou shalt dwel among them.
And al that loue thy name, shall reioyce in the.
Therefore if we loue the name of God, if wee truste to be saued by hys mercye if we loke for good thynges at ye hand of our heauenly father thorowe Iesus Christ, let vs sequester our ioye frome all worldelye thynges, whyche are but vanitie as ye haue hearde before, and repose it only in the Lord our God Chr.
That Lorde whyche is the father of mercies, and the God of all consolation mought grau~t vnto vs hys most holy spirite to worcke in vs suche a swetenes delectation in spiritual thynges, that what so euer is of the world may waxe vile, vnpleasaunt and bitter vnto vs, and that wee by thys meanes maye vnfaynedlye and euen from the very bottome of the herte reioyce in the Lorde our god alone, alone.
The Lorde myght brynge thys thinge to passe in vs. Philemon.
Nowe accordynge to my promisse haue geuen you this Iewell of Ioye, not so conningelye and worckemanlyke (I confesse) handeled, as some other of better knowledge and more rype iudgme~t in ye misteries of God coulde haue done it, notwythstandynge truely and fayethfully wroughte accordynge to the pure vayne of the holye scriptures.
But what so euer thys youre gyfte is praye you take it to good worthe and accepte my louynge herte towarde you.
Thoughe possibilitte fayleth, yet good wyll shall neuer wante in me, but what so euer the Lord shall geue, at all tymes wyll bestowe it vpon you and vpon hys holye congregation, and by no meanes suffer the talente geuen vnto me of my Lorde God, to lye Idle by me, but for my power wyll so employe that it maye turne to the glorye of God and to the profite of hys blessed churche.
For the hystorye of the vnprofitable seruaunte, whyche hydde vp the money of hys Lord in the ground therefore was co~de~ned caste into vtter darckenes, where wepyng gnashyng of teth shal be, ought to make al me~ afrayed that haue receyued any gyfte at al of God, and to prouoke theim not to be sluggyshe and idle, but to vse theyr talentes accordynge to the commau~demente of God, whyche sayeth.
Blessed is that man, whych so occupieth hys talent, that God therwith is glorified, and hys neyghbouredifted.
Sure maye he be at that great and dreadful day of iudge mente to heare of hys Lord God thys most swete and ioyfull sente~ce.
Neyghbours wyll disease you no lenger, but as haue geuen you a spirituall Iewell, ioyful and co~fortable for the soule, so wyll in like maner at this my co~ming home and returne into natiue contrye bestowe somewhat vpon you, that shall not be vnprofitable for ye body.
And woulde God it laye in my power to gratifie you in both alyke.
But that whych, shall wante in worldely thinges, shall, if lyue be recompensed in spiritual thin ges.
But as maye at the laste make an ende, remember brethre~ remembre, what ye haue hearde of me at thys present.
Remembre that all thynges in thys worlde, be subiect vnto vanitie, yea they them selues are mere vanitie, as the preacher sayeth.
What maruel, whe~ ma~ him selfe, for whose sake al worldelye things were created, is very vanitie.
Reme~ber that the ende ofal worldlye ioye, of al carnall pleasure, of all temporall felicitie, is bitter sorow and greuous payne Remembre that we are borne to dye, prepare therefore for youre laste ende.
Remembre that the goodes of this world are transitorie, ttyng away, and seldome tary longe wyth theyr olde possessour and owner, gather not ther fore treasure togither on earthe, wher rusie and mothes corrupt, and wher theues breake thorow and steale, but gather ye treasure togither in heauen, wher neyther rust, nor mothes corrupt, wher theaues neyther breake vp nor steale.
Make you frendes of the wicked Mammon, that when ye shal haue nede, they may receiue you into euerlastynge dwellinge places.
Remembre that what soeuer ye sowe, that shall ye reape, whither it be of the flesh, corruption or of the spirite, eternal life: If ye on thys wyse iudge both of the worlde, and of worldly thynges, doubt ye not, but that yours hertes shall burne wyth suche an earneste and vnfayned loue towarde God, that ye shall reioyce in hym alone, alone, yea and that alway, that is boeth in prosperitie and aduersitie, at all tymes haue a quiet a mery conscience which of al treasures is the most precious in this world.
And yt ye may do this the more fortunately, consider your vocation, reme~bre youre callynge.
Ye are called christians, expresse Christe youre ord and maister in al your co~uersatio~ liuing.
He that sayeth he dwelleth in Christe, oughte to walke eue~ as Christe walked.
Let your lighte so shine before menne, that they maye se your good worckes and glorifye your father, whiche is in heauen.
The Papistes raile on you, blaspheme you, cal you heritikes, seditious personnes. &c. Ordre so your life, that the aduersaries seynge your Godlye conuersation, maye eyther be wonne to co~fesse the same truth with you, or els be ashamed to speke any euil of you For this is the wyl of God, that wyth wel doinge ye shoulde stop the mouthes of folysh and ignorau~t men, as fre, but not making liberty to be a cloke of noughtynes, but euen as the seruauntes of God.
Ye confesse youre selues to be iustified before God bi faieth alone, prouid that thys youre fayeth be not idle, sluggishe, nor deade, as.
S. Iames sayeth, but iuish, and mighty in operation, and full of all good and Chrian workes.
For in Christe Iesu neither is circumcision anye thynge worth, neyther yet vncircu~cision but fayth, which worketh by cha ritie, and the ende of the co~maun dement is charitie, that commeth of a pure herte, of a good conscience, of fayeth vnfayned.
Ye beleue to be saued by the alone sacrifice of Christes most blissed bodie, co~mit nothinge vnworthy the gentlenes of so kind louing sauiour.
Ye co~fesse to know god, denie him not in your dedes, but be alwayes studious of good worckes.
Ye professe ye doctrine, which requireth of you and of al subiectes fayethfull and hu~ble obeisaunce to ye King his Maiesty, answere to youre professio~, obeye vnfainedly, not onely for feare of nisheme~t, but for co~sience sake For ther is no power but of powers yt be, are d. Therfore whosoeuer resisteth the power, resisteth ye ordinaunce of God.
And they yt resiste, shall get to the~ selues da~nacion.
Neyther thicke, breath, speake or do anything, yt may be preiudicial to the godly doi~ges of ye king his highnes, but be yu alwaye led wt a reuerente feare towarde his grace.
Neither co~sente to any tumult co~motio~, insurrectio~, sedicion, conspiracy &c, neither co~seale any thig, wherby any dishonour to the Kinges Maiestie, any displeasure to hys moste honorab cou~cel, ani vnquietnes to ye que weale may be wrough euermore sette before yo thys sentence of the wyshe the kynge thought, speake no hurte of the noble man in thy priui chamber.
For a birde of the ayer shall betraie thy voice, and with her fethers shall she bewraye thy wordes.
How greuously they haue al waies be punished yt were sedicious walked wtout anye godlye feare toward the ciuille Maigistrates, the histories of Dathan and Abiron, of zambry and Baa sa of Bagatha~ Thares, shewe manifestly.
Neyther haue we wa~ ted experience of thys thynge in these our dayes.
And as vnto the Kinge his Maiestie, so lykewyse submit youre selues vnto the other Rulers yt are sent of him, for the punishemente of euill doers, but for the prayse of the~ yt do wel.
Ye haue a pleasure to heare the preachers of gods worde, reuerence the~ as the ministers of god geuing the~ no les honoure, than the childe gyueth the father, remembring yt they be the Angells of God, the messengers of Christ the light of the worlde, ye salte of the earth, ye dispensatours of the misteries of God, the feders of Christen mens soulles, the comfortours of the weake, the Phisicians of the sicke, the vpholders of the whole, the exhorters vnto the vertue, the fraiers awaye fro~ vice whiche watch continually for the health of oure soulles.
Be not vntha~kful to the preachers, but to suche as minister spiritual thynges to you disdayne not to giue corporal thinges, yt the prea chers may ye more freli giue their mind to ye studies of ye holy scrip+tures.
If we sowe vnto you spiritual thinges, sayeth s¬∑ Paule, is it a great thing, if we reape your carnal thinges? The Lorde hath ordayned, yt they whiche preache the gospel, should liue of the gospel.
Againe he sayth, let him yt is taught wt the word, minister vnto him yt teacheth him in al good thinges.
Moreouer ye yt are maried, loue your wiues, euen as christ loued the co~gregacio~.
Nou rishe, cherish the~ as your owne bodies, reme~brynge that they be your owne fleshe your own bones, se yt by no meanes ye be bit+ter vnto the~, but giue honour vn to the~ as to the weaker vessels, as to the~ yt are felow heires also of the grace of life.
Teach youre wiues to be obedie~t vnto you as vnto ye lorde, to loue you as their owne selues, to be of honest beha uoure, chast, housewifely, good, no euil spekers, but sober fayth ful in al thinges.
Learne them to kepe silence wt al subiectio~ to a raie the~ selues in manerly apparel wt shamefastnes honest behauoure, not wt broided heare, other gold, or pearles or costlye aaie, but wt such as becometh wo men, yt professe ye worshipping of God thorowe good workes yt the hid man of the herte maye be vncorrupte wt a meke quiet spirit, which spirit is before god a thing much set by.
For after this manner in the old time did ye holy we men, whiche trusted in God, trie the~ selues, were obedie~t to their husba~des, euen as Sara obeied Abraha~, called him lord.
Bring vp your childre~ wt the nourtoure informacion of the lord, teach the~ to obeie honoure you.
Do yt vnto your seruauntes, whiche is iust equal, reme~bringe yt ye also haue a maister in heauen.
Exhort your seruauntes to be obediente vnto you in al godly thinges, not with eye seruice as men pleasers, but in singlenes of herte, fearing god.
Loue al men as your selues In few, whatsoeuer thinges are true, whatsoeuer thinges are honest, whatsoeuer thinges are iust, what so euer thynges are pure, whatsoeuer thynges pertaine to loue whatsoeuer thiges are of ho nest report, if their be anie vertuous thing, if ther be ani laudable thing, those same haue ye in mid¬∑ And al things, whatsoeuer ye do in worde or dede, do in the name of the lord Iesu, geuinge tha~kes to God ye father bi him.
So shall ye in this world liue wt a mery co~ science, after this prese~t life ioye reioyse in eternal glory wt god ye father, to who~ wt his son christ Ie su our most precious Iewel, the holy gost ye swete co~fortoure be al honoure prayse for euermore.

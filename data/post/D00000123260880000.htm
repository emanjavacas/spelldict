certaine quaeres propounded and sent by the divines of oxford to the synod now assembled at westminster desiring their resolutions upon them concerning the oath published now to be taken
whether the imposing the second clause in this oath upon a mans consciencc concerning the plot lately discovered doe not very much resemble the damnable inquisition seeing it compels a man to bee his owne acouser ii
what is meant by that equivocating terme namely according to my vocation in the fourth clause iii
wether may lawfully and with a good conscience swear that the two houses have taken up just and lawfull defensive armes whether according to their protestation lately taken they doe endeavour to defend the protestant religion according to the law established seeing that there amongst them some part of it is reviled and scoffed at without reproofe and also a synod of divines called to alter the frame of this church government and using the parliaments owne words to frame it nearer to the discipline of the kirke of scotland iv
whether by taking this oath we do not renounce our former oath taken in the late protestation namely to maintaine his majesties now endangered person his decaying honour and his despised prerogative seeing wee sweare to fight against the company where his person is and against those raised by his authority whether all the kings army be papists or what part of it or where the popish army is that we must see disbanded before we lay downe our armes vi whether the king doe declare himselfe ready to maintaine the popish religion or the protestant religion establisbed by law in this kingdome and why we may not believe him vii
whether the protestant religion now established by law in this kingdome be the true protestant or no and what protestant religion it is that must swear to maintaine viii
whether may lawfully and with a safe conscience swear that clause in the oath that to the utmost of my power will assist all other persons that shall take this oath in whatsoever they shall doe in pursuance of it all these quaeres being fully answered and our consciences being well satisfied by sufficient reason scripture we shal be as willing as any other to take this oath or any other that may conduce to the good and happinesse of this kingdome

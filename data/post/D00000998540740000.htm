saint mary magdalens conversion

of romes great conquest in the elder age when she the worlde made subiect to her thrall of louers giddy fancies and the rage wherwith that passion is possest withall when ielousie with loue doth share apart and breedes a ciuill warre within the harte

of helens rape and troyes beseiged towne of troylus faith and cressids falsitie of rychards stratagems for the english crowne of tarquins lust and lucrece chastitie of these of none of these my muse nowe treates of greater conquests warres and loues she speakes

a womans conquest of her one affects a womans warre with her a womans loue breeding such effects as th'age before nor since nere brought to light of these and such as these my muse is prest to spend the idle houres of her rest

thou blessed saint whose life doth teach to liue intreate that louing and best loued lord of thine that he vouchsafe such liuely grace to giue vnto these dull and liueles rimes of mine that such as read this good though ill told story may be like thee for their offences sorry

when first the worlds creator our dread lord did with his presence blesse iudeae land and to all sortes of people did afforde his gratious fauour and all helping hand restoring by his power omnipotent the lazar deafe blind lame and impotent

amongst the daughters of the sonnes of men shee that did most his gratious mercy proue was mary marthas sister magdalen who loued most and had most cause to loue her wounded soule he cur'de with sinnes opprest natures deffects in others he redrest

shee needed not the ritch mans golden ring that all desires seldome well gott good shee needed not the herauldes deif'ing to make her gentle of vngentle bloud shee needed not the painters white and red nature those colors in her face had shed

her eyes vnto their mistres yeelded light all though her selfe within herselfe were blind shee was nor lame nor deafe nor perfecc'ous store to each lime was asin'de with natures gifts she plent'iously was graced but sinne those ornamentes had all defaced

sinne made her want in middest of her store sinne made her seruile in her libertye of all good graces sinne did make her poore and ritch in nothing but in misery her soule was subiect to a thousand euilles her body combred with as many diuilles

but her dear lord through his grace this monster draue away and those foule fendes who did his workes deface his blessed presence from her did affray he thought not meete that such vnseemely gest should in so faire an arbour build their nest

after her foes were thus disperst and gone
her captiue soule b'inge franchis'de from their thrall and shee transformed by that mighty one from her life best all to celestiall her lord affirmed that her loue was such that shee deserued to bee pardoned much

her lawles lustes shee chaing'de to lawfull loue her many pleasures to one chiefe delighte all other ioyes shee did from her remoue and only ioyed in his blessed sighte who best deserued to bee loued most sauinge her soule from death by sinne b'inge lost

shee hateth nowe what shee had lou'de before shee loueth him to whome all loue was due her former mispent life shee doth deplore and nowe endeauors for to lyue anewe herselfe vnto herselfe did hatefull growe when thus enlight'ned shee did knowe

this holy hatred did true loue encrease shee lou'de the more in that shee hated soe this holy hatred did her false loues cease and howe to loue arighte to her did showe hatred thow are only good in this in all thinges else thow doest worke amisse

like to a monster to her selfe shee seem'ed and of her selfe her selfe was now afraide shee sawe twas otherwyse then shee had deem'ed and loth'de to see how fondly shee had straied shee now perceaues the errors of her life which makes her with her selfe to be in strife

how haue deceaued beene quoth shee with the false shew of counterfeyt delight were these the pleasures this the vanities which now so much my gilty soule affright haue incurr'd the losse of life and fame to purchase sorrow and repentant shame

did for this my fathers house forsake leauing my carefull sister sisterles did for this of frendes me frendles make shaming my kindred through my sinnefullnes did for this leaue sister frends and all and from the seruice of my maker fall

sinne thou art a serpent full of fleyght thy face seem'de not so fowle as now see thou dost bewitch vs with a strong deceipte of seeming good though full of miserye our soules thou woundest with thy poysonus dart and we as senceles neuer feele the smart

thou art the losse of heauen and hels best frend how many like a syren here thee sing how many by in chantment dost thou send to plutoes kingdome ere they feele thy sting but why doe exclaime against thee so when was partner in my ouer throw

gaue consent that thou shoul'dst worke my fall pleased was with what thou did'st suggest was attendant to ech seruill call and basely subiect to thy foule grew a cunning artist in thy trade and with thy charmes haue many soules insnar'de

sinne of sinnes and the worst of euills to poyson others with thy stinking breath no meruaile though was a lodge for deuilles and worthely became a hell on earth wast not enoughe that thou thy selfe did'st sinne but that thou others to the same must winne

my lost soule how foule wilt thou appeare how full of feare in that last dreadfull day when thou shalt bitter exclamations heare of such whome thou did'st guilefully betray what canst thou say what colour canst thou bring excuse thy selfe of this infecting sinne

none at all for am growne there is no sinne but what in me remaines to be a publick sinner am knowne the note of shame which all my kinred staines the blott which would wash of with my bloud to purchase to my selfe the name of good

but haue bin so long sinnes seruingman that men will thinke cannot from him part they will obiect am a publican and by long custome grounded in the arte from custome we another nature take in good or ill shee doth vs perfect make

if to my sister take me shee will reiect me least spott her fame if to my kinsfolkes they will all forsake me through my misdeedes haue incur'de such blame dare not to a strainger showe my face will wounde my soule with wordes of foule disgrace

like to mineruas bird when shee appeares and showes her hated selfe vnto the light eache fath'red foule against her clamors reares and makes her all ashamed take her flight they all pursuing her with and winge and shee as fast away doth from them flinge

so doth it farre with me distressed one when in the peopled streets
chaunce to walke there man nor woman doth respect my moane but all of my losse life doe seeme to talke all seeme to wonder at me a goe and me to their children showe

me thinkes see some from their windowes looke and with their fingers pointing out my shame and some who cannot my foule presence brooke with lauish tounges to publish my defame all handes and tounges conspiring my disgrace whil'st a lothed creature veyle my face

for though it bee a common act to fall and sinne it selfe is too well cherished yet is the sinner hattefull vnto all compass'on now mong'st men is perished the plea of mercie will not hold in lawe eache pettyfogger in it findes a flawe

the begger alwaies for offences bleedes and feeles the hande of grim seueritie the ritch mans gold can cancell out misdeedes and blind the sight of briberie but am ritch in nothing but in sinne that would all forgoe some grace to winne

if in my life had but once misdone then had not such vrgent cause to mourne or to offend if had newe begunne then were there some smale hope of but long sinnes from all this hope bereaues and of their good conceptes me hopeles leaues

much like a crasie boate who hauing all his sayles and tacklinges loste amid the surges of the seas doth floate and too and fro with euerie guste is toste so waues my anxious soule mid'st stormy feares no harbor can shee finde no calme appeares

but since of freindes my sinnes hath me bereft will returne vnto that nazarite who of his pitty hath good tokens left in me for lorne wretched israelite he is for all afflicted and distrest a harbor hauen and a port of rest

a man if may terme him soe or rather god for dowbtles so he is more then a man to bee his deedes doe showe eache eye his acc'ons more then humane fees but how shall bee gratefull to the best when a sinner doe my selfe detest

for beinge good as hee no other seemes as chiefest good he hateth all that's ill like traytors to his crowne he sinners deemes who still oppose themselues against his will nothing in god but sinne can hatred breede how then shall the worst of sinners speede

through his wisedome he doth knowe the passed faultes of my transgressing life how great the woundes haue bin the scarres will showe as yet my sinfull soares are bleeding rife more then all others did him offend lesse cause there is that he should succor lend

what he will say now all men thee reiect canst thou suppose that will thee receaue mee most deseruing thou did'st least respect and for a shadow did'st the substance leaue all that thou hast gaue yet thou vniuste did'st moste offend him who did giue thee moste

did create thee of a different state from other creatures of a lesse respect mighte haue made thee like in forme and shape vnto the monsters of a feirce aspect but did giue thee natures ornament beautie which thou hast lauishlie mispent

gaue thee will for to desire the best and vnderstandinge to discerne the same thou wast not ignorant of my behest for all thy nation inuocate my name if thou had'st beene a gentile thy abuse might haue put on some colour of excuse

but thou did'st knowe what did to me belong and what thy selfe in duty should'st haue done yet thou did'st neuer cease to worke me wrong persistinge alwaies in thine ill begunne sparinge thy deserued punishment expectinge still thy sinnes relinquishment

he that his creditor hath long delay'de with dilatory hopes of payements due hauing made breache of promise grows dismai'de least irefull rigor will his fault ensue his creditors fear'de presence he forsakes tyll due repayement some atonement makes

but thou art farre ingaged in my debt for what hast thou which did not bestowe hou canst thou then newe credite now expect who neuer pai'st but euer seek'st to owe for nowe thou com'st no olde debtes to defray but mercies newe disbursementes for to pray

canst thou imagine my selfe forgette or that calme mercy reuengefull iustice staies although tis true sitt on mercies seate yet my right hand the sword of iustice swaies mercie and iustice are at my dispence to pardon or to punish eache offence

thou hast already tasted mercies store in that did so long thy life sustaine now iustice doth require thou should'st restore thy borrow'd talent with an earned gaine but thou hast mispent the stocke and now asham'd at mercies gate doest knocke

knowe this lord know haue offended and am in debted more then can pay humbly craue that mercy be extended and no more will runne so fare astray teares spent her speach for now shee wept amine and after teares shee thus beganne againe

if thou lord wilt cancell my olde debt and once againe restore me to thy grace if thou wilt all my former wronges forgett and smoothe the wrinckels of thy angery face the remnant of my purchas'd life vowe in thy true seruice wholy to bestowe

here silent griefe supprest her further moane and stopt the current of her flowing teares shee could not speake nor weepe her soule alone the heauy waight of sorrowes burthen beares when outward sences once haue spent their store then inward passions doe offlicte the more

her soule within her holdes a parlament and summons all her powers to appeare and they as ready for to giue content vnto their lady lend awilling eare within themselues they seriously debate how to redresse their mistres troubled state

first memorie the mindes best register telles her of many like her selfe distrest who were reliued by this comforter and had their former euilles all redrest how that the proude he vseth to reiect but allwayes doth erect

here hope conceaueth from examples past a good conceipt that like may now ensue she doth suggest how that his mercies last and are bestow'de on them that humbly sue hope doth perswade her sad contrition will for offences begge remission

now strong opinion doth posses her brest and her ensureth of a good successe and will as handmaide to the rest is now behinde to entertaine such gesse only distrust and feare her springing hapes doe crosse with dead dispayre

they bid her looke aright on her misdeedes and shee should finde twas not as shee suppo'de which chookes in her the growth of hopefulll seede and makes her doubt what earst had beene propos'de as oft as hope her fainting soule imbouldes distrust and feare the same as oft controwles

like to a trau'ler in an vnknowne way who hauing sundrye pathes to passe along is carefull which to take fearing to stray and still he doubts that which he takes is wrong so her sad soule with doudtfull feares opprest knowes not which course to take but wills the best

now hope his wonted pirtie dote relate and then distrust bids her his iustice eye yet fearefull hope at length doth animate her consious soule his mercies doome to trye shee now resolues all feare b'eing lade aside vnder his mercies winges her selfe to hide

and least the vice hatefull to god and man ingratitude that ill repaying sinne should in her brest erect his mansion from forth her store sweet oyntment shee doth bring which shee intends vpon him to bestow that acte her inward loue might showe

shee was not like those iewes in clensed bodies haching leprous soules their nine of them refuse but shee his loue within her brest infoldes and gratefully her precious oyle doth shed on his deuine and far more precious hed

this acte of hers her lord doth so regard that he comaundes it should for aye be knowne and where his lifs true storie should be hearde this deede of hers should there be showne this acte of hers her lorde somuch regarded that he the same with double pay rewarded

what are we lord that thou should'st way our dutious seruice at so high a rate all that we borrow iustice bindes to pay we owe thee all from the we all did take how comes it then that thou so well accep'sts if we discharge the tent'he of our due debtes

what did shee giue thee but a cruse of oyle which now shee had no further cause to vse shee will no more her well form'de visage soile and natures workmanship by arte abuse but thou did'st weigh the loue shee gaue it which made thee graciously vouchsafe to haue it

now shee proceedes and from his head descendes vnto his feete where prostrate shee doth lye for former pride shee faine would make amendes with this deuout vnfain'de humilitie shee loulie setts her at his blessed feete meane while her eyes riuers of teares doe weepe

teares of true sorrowe for offences done her watrie eyes like prodigalles doe spend wherewith the feete of great iehouans sonne for to imbalme shee humblie doth intend those feete of his these teares of hers make faire and being wett shee dries them with her haire

well spent teares you did but clense the spottes which wery iornies and foule waies had maide but you did wash of many thousand blottes wherewith foule sinne her gilty soule had smear'de happy teares and happely bestowed you did defray what ere your mistres owed

after this worke of charity was past her loue was such shee would not from him part no earthly stormes her heauenly loue could blast it was so deeply rooted in her hart with modest silence tempering her loues heate her silent loue by silence growing greate

silence companion of the wise thou surest note of spotles chastitie all our fraile passions thou dost temporise and kindlest holy thoughtes in secresie thou art a vertue rarely found on earth of vertues store there is so great a dearth

in princes coortes thou canst no harbor finde thy seruice there is but of sleighte regarde thou canst not flatter thou art not the winde wherewith ambitious toylinge gestes are rear'de thou canst not fill the sailes of enuies boate nor sett the ship of fame a floate

thou art no tradseman for the citties vse thou canst not harbor manie tounges in one the countriemen with thee haue broken truce and entred league with fell dissention the woodes the babling ecco entertaine which eache worde iterates and makes one twaine

both coort and cittie countrie and the woodes are vnto sylence straingers now vnknowne and shee hath left them to their moodes and to the heauens from whence shee came is flowne shee seldome now doth visite this our coaste far if shee comes shee knowes not where to hoaste

this vertue first possessed maries brest and did dispose her vnto higher grace for where garrulitie doth buylde her nest there modest vertues haue no biding place by this her life was knowne by this hereafter constancie was showne

for when the lord of life our ransome pai'de and by his death gaue life vnto the dead when his disciples fearefully dismai'de from persecutions angrie presence fled shee constantlie attendes him to his passion and feares no threates of her nation

euen at the foote of that tree which cur'de the wounde by former tree receaued shee humblie settes her downe greiuing to see his blessed presence from her thus bereaued in steade of feete shee powres her liberall teares on that dead truncke which now his body beares

this shee imbraceth in her twisted armes mixing her salt teares with his bloude which from his woundes distil'de to salue our harmes like forced streames proceading from some flude which when shee sees it makes her sad soule bleede in strong compassion of so foule a deede

thou my lord my loue my soules delighte thy sighte was earst quoth shee my chiefest ioye to see thee thus it doth my soule affrighte and turnes all former pleasure to annoye to see thee thus how can chose but weepe when for my teares thy bloud doth wash thy feete

how can chose but weepe to see thy head inuiron'de with a crowne of sharpest thorne to see thy louely count'nance palle and dead which once with beautie did the heauens adorne to see the brightest lampes which light the skies obscur'de by bloud and death thy blessed eyes

to see those handes of thine so sauadglie affixed to this woode which with a touch gaue lighte to blindest eyne and alwaies were imploi'de in doing good to see that hart where charitie doth dwell peirced with enuies speare the dart of hell

to see those worne but feete who manie longe and toyle some iorneys made to seeke vs loste and sheepe in the vaste desert of blacke sinne insnar'de now nether going standing nor at rest but to a peece of woode with nayles addrest

to see that body which the purest wombe of an vnspotted virgin once contain'de now to bee fitter for some gastlie tombe by cruell stripes and woundes deform'de and stain'de thy selfe dispised naked and for lorne bereft of freindes and to thy foes a scorne

how can chose lord but weepe and moane in sad remembrance of these dire aspectes how can chose but sigh to heare the grone vnder the heuie loade of our defects was there no other meanes to pay our losse but thou must needes be naled to this crosse

wounderfull effectes of wonderous loue he that of late gaue life vnto the dead
and from possessed bodies did remoue legions of diuelles that his presence fled for them that kills him doth his life bestow and paies the debt which they themselues did owe

you vngratefull iewes allwaies imbr'de in spilling righteous bloode how can you thus this innocent abuse who neuer in the way of sinners stoode what hath he done that you should vse him thus was he not euer mercifull and iust

did hee not feede the hongrie of the lande and cure the sicke through his mighte did hee not make the lame to goe and stande and to the blinde restore desired sighte did not both poore and sicke both lame and blinde through his milde pitty health and comfort finde

you are more in humane men then sauadge beastes in wildest desertes bred they for a good deede still haue gratefull ben and such as did releiue them they haue fed but you do pay the hire of ill desart to him that did all good to you impart

this maks the heauens who earst were bright cleare to chainge their purple weedes to saddest blacke no signes of ioye in heauen or earth appeare because the lord of ioye and blisse they lacke the sonne himselfe doth hide his glorious face lothing to see his makers foule disgrace

the earth doth tremble att this horred deede frighting the ghostes of the infernall deepe her wombe bringes forth straing and vntimelie seede the dead arise which in her bosome sleepe the adamantine rockes doe cleaue a sunder their stonie hartes do rent to see this wonder

but you whose hartes are harder then the rockes you bloody actors of this tragicke sceane you that repay sweete charitie with mockes and seeke his losse who doth your welfare meane you neither earth belowe nor heauen aboue with their vnwonted prodigies can moue

thou sad mother of a sadder sonne thou art spectator too of this great losse thy ioyes are past thy sorrowes whome once the cribe receau'de now beares the crosse vnto his birth the one did harbor tend vpon the other hee his life doth spend

my greeued soule is wounded with remorce to see thy swollen eyes to heare thy groanes the very sight would flinty hartes enforce to take compassion of thy bitter moanes thou art more like the dead or deathes palle wife then to the mother of the lord of life

shall you and deare ladie plight our troth and wed our selues to sorrowes restles bed our loue and ioye is taken from vs both and we are lefte for to bewale the dead wee both lament the losse of him that's gonne a most louing lord thou a blessed sonne

sall wee be take vs to a heremitage in some wilde desert vnto men vnknowne and there weare out the remnant of our age filling the wide woodes with our ceaseles moane lette me take part of this thy heauy cheare and for ech figh of thine ile spend a teare

fellowes in misery lessens sorrowes waight but vnworthy am to be thy mate haue a spotted soule with sinnes full fraight but thou a virgine art immaculate thou art assin'de vnto a virgines keeping will alone betake my selfe to weeping

by that time this her sad complaint was done he that giues life had vanquish'de death by dying and ioseph comes t'interr this holy one which in this weeper breedes newe cause of crying before shee wept to see him so tormented because shee sees him not shee now lamented

for ioseph had newe tane him from the crosse and lai'de him in a sepulchre of stone not his spent life but his dead bodies losse is now the cause of this her second moane shee sees the tree of life of fruit bereft but her soule vncured left

which makes her thus to speake sacred tree his precious bloud hath left thee sanctified thou wert ordain'de an aulter for to bee whereon this offring should bee sacrified since hee is gone who was thy ornament to thee my sad complaintes shall all bee bent

ile sett thee for an obiect fore myne eyes in seing thee shall not him forget who did vouchsafe on thee to sacrifice his owne deare life to pay our sinnefull debt though for my sauiours shame they did thee make yet will honour thee for his sweete sake

with these and such like plaintes the day was spent and duskie nighte had darkened all the sckye which when shee sawe vnto her home shee went and there absentes her from all companye like to a turtle hauing lost her mate so shee without her lord is desolate

this restles night and saboathes rest b'eing past a day of sorrowe and vnrest to her vnto the monument early shee did hast where they his precious body did intier shee doth present the rising of the sunne and takes her iorney ere the day begunne

noe wonted daungers of the fearfull night coulde make her from her enterprise to staye when ghostes and sprites vse to fright when wolues and rauonous beastes doe wach their pray when none but murderrers and theeues did wake then this pilgrimage shee takes

shee might haue fear'de the souldiers cruell garde who did about that holy place attende and night and day his toumbe did watch and warde and from all visitores the same defend but her stout harte these perilles could not touch her loue was more although her daunger much

loue made her strong although herselfe were weake loue gaue swifte winges vnto her quicke desire loue added fire to her former heate of doubtes nor daungers loue doth not enquire powerfull loue thou dost no perilles cast the bitt'rest pilles seeme pleasant to thy taste

by this time loue had brought her to his toumbe which shee findes open by the stones remoue but nought shee sees with in his emptie toumbe but linnen cloths which had inwrapt her loue whome when shee findes not shee doth weep moane imaginning that he was stolne and gone

you profaine and sacraligious theeues who haue quoth shee his sacred corps bereft it is a sinne to rob from him that liues to rob the house of death is dubble theft was not your enuy by his dying past but after death the same must also last

enuy thou art a more blaker sinne then bloudy murder who seekes naught but death his thirstie appetie hath quenshed beene but thou thy killing sworde dost neuer sheath the act being done he often doth relent but thy malice nere is spent

had not long enioy'de his blessed sight but thou did'st take him to the crosse from mee where hauing kill'de him in thy selfe dispite thou seem'dst content that he intomb'de should bee there did thinke should his presence haue but thou hast also taine him from his graue

vnhappie to come no sooner hether might aswell haue come the day before now they haue taine him hence know not whether and am neuer like to see him more the spice and oyntments which with me brought cannot now bestow on him sought

with this two glorious angelles doe appeare to comforte this vncomfortable one they tell her h'is risen bids her not feare
but cease her sad complaintes and heauy moane whilst shee standes doubtfull of this happie newes her louing lord himselfe vnknowne shee vewes

shee takes him to bee gard'ner of that place and gentlie doth bespeake him as dismai'de that if he did his body thence displace hee would enforme her where the same was lai'de hee louingly discouers whome he is shee doth adore when thus her lord shee sees

her humbled body to the earth shee bowes in odarac'on of his dietie meane while her ioyfull soule bestowes in contemplac'on of this misterie of heauenlie ioy shee feeles so sweete a taste that shee forgettes her auncient sorrowes paste

thou that art the heauens and earthes creator thou great dispensor of caelestiall treasure thou that of angelles men and beastes art maker whose profound wisedome hath nor end nor measure how mercifull lord art thou for each good deede thou doest repay vs with a dubble meede

shee wash'de thy feete with teares her eyes had shed to clense her soule thy bloud thou did'st perfuse shee powr'de her precious oyntement on thy hed in her thou did'st caelestiall grace infuse shee for thy absence did great sorrowe take thou with thy presence did'st her ioyfull make

giue grace lord to me vnworthy one to imitate this blessed saint of thine fill thou myne eyes with teares my hart with moane that may wayle those greuious sinnes of myne and if salt teares vnto myne eyes be scant bee mercifull lord for this my want

make me like her all worldlie ioyes reiect and lett my soule bee wedded to thy loue thy louing sweetenes lett me not forgete all other fancies from my hart remoue and if do not loue thee as should haue mercie lord accept of that would

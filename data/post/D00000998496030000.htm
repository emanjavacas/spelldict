[Figure: [Figure: depiction of a galleon] Imprinted at London by Thomas Orwin for Thomas Gilbert, dwelling in Fleetstreete neere to the signe of the Castle.
Don Alonso Peres de guzman, the good Duke of Medina, Sidonia, Countie of Nebla, Marques of Casheshe in Africa, Lord of the Citie Sainct Lucar, Captaine generall of the Occian Sea, of the Cost of Andaluzia, and of this Armie of his Maiestie, and Knight of the honorable order of the golden Fleece.
Do ordaine and commaund, that the generall Maisters of the field, all Captaines, Officers of the Campe and of the Sea, Pilats, Maisters, Soldiers, Marriners, and Officers, whatsoeuer other people for the land or Sea seruice commeth in this Armie, al the time that it indureth, shall be thus gouerned, as hereafter followeth, viz.
it is to bee vnderstood by al the aboue named from the highest to the lowest: that the principall foundation and cause that hath moued the King his Maiestie to make and continue this iorney, hath been and is, to serue God, and to returne vnto his Church a great many of contrite
soules that are oppressed by the Heretikes, enemies to our holy Catholike faith, which haue them subiects to their sects, and vnhappinesse: and for that euery one, may put his eyes vpon this marke, as we are bound, do command and much desire euery one, to giue charge vnto the inferiours and those vnder their charge to imbarke themselues,
being shriuen, and hauing receiued the Sacrament with competent contrition for their sinnes: by the which contrition and zeale to do GOD such great seruice, he will carie and guide vs to his great glorie: which is, that which particularly and principally is pretended.
In like maner, do charge and command you, to haue particular care, that no Soldier, Marriner, or other, that serueth in this Armie, do blaspheme, or rage against God, or our Lady, or any of the Saincts, vpon paine that he shall therefore sharply be corrected, and very well chastened, as it shall seeme best vnto vs: and for other oathes of lesse qualitie, the gouernours in the same ships they go in, shall procure to remedie all: they shall punish them in taking away their allowance of wine, or otherwise, as they shall thinke good.
And for that the most occasions come by play, you shal publikly prohibit it, especially the games that are forbidden:
and that none do play in the night, by no meanes.
And to auoyd inconueniences that might ensue in this Armie and force of his Maiestie, if that the here written were not put for remedie, by these presents do command, that particularly and generally, all quarrels, angers, defiances and iniuries that are haue been before this day, and vntill the publication hereof, of all persons as well by Sea as land,
of greater or lesse qualities be suppressed and suspended, so that none goeth in this Armie for the time that this voyage continueth and lasteth, although they be olde quarels: yet for my expresse commaundement shall breake this truce and forbearance of Armes, directly, or indirectly, vpon payne of disobedience and incurring into high treason, and dye therefore.
that abord the shippes there bee not any thing offered to the disgrace of any man.
Declaring herewithall, that there cannot bee any disgrace imputed to any man for any thing that shalbe offered, nor yet be a reproach whatsoeuer happeneth abord any ship.
And for that it is knowne that great inconuenie~ces and offence groweth vnto God,
by consenting that common women and such like go in like Armies:
do ordaine and commaund, that there be none imbarked nor caried in the Armie: And if that any will carrie them, do commaund the Captaines and Maisters of the shippes, not to consent thereto: who so doth, or dissembleth therewith, shalbe grieuously punished.
The companie of euery ship, one euery morning at the breake of the day, according to the custome, shall giue the good morrowe by the maine mast, and at night the Aue Maria: and some dayes the Salue Regine: or at least, the Saterdaies with a Lettenie.
And forasmuch as it importeth for the preseruation and good successe of this armie, that there be betweene the Soldiers and Marriners much confirmed friendship, and such amitie that there bee not any difference, nor other occasions of murmuring, commaund it to bee published that no bodie do carrie any Dagger, nor thwart one another, or giue any occasions, but that all do obey the superiour Officers: and if any Scandale or offence come, he that was the beginner, shall straightly bee punished.
When the Gallion Sainct Marten, wherein my selfe go, Admirall of this Fleet, doth make a signe with a peece of Ordinance, it shall bee a signe of departure for the whole Fleete, that
sounding their Trumpets shall follow without losing time, and without comming fowell of each other, and cutting sayle shall doe the like: hauing great care of the Sands and Catchops, carrying their Boates Skiffes readie for any thing that may happen.
euery ship shall come to leyward, saluting the Admirall to know what he wil commaund: demaund the word, without going a head the Admiral, either in the day or in the night, but to haue great care to his sayling.
Euery afternoone they shal repayre to their Admirals to take the word,
and to knowe if there be any thing to do.
And for that so many great Shippes, and so great may be, cannot come euery day without bording one another: to auoyde the daunger that may followe, the Generall of each Squadron shall haue particular care, to take the word in time, to giue it vnto the Shippes vnder their charge.
The Admiral shalbe saluted with Trumpets, of them that haue them: if not,
with their Whistles: and the people to hallowe one after another, and aunswering them shall salute againe: and if it be towards night to demaund
the word, and taking it shall salute one another in time, and depart to giue roume to others that follow.
If it happeneth some daies that winde wil not suffer to take the word of the Admirall or Admirals, they shall haue for euery day in the weeke the words following.
And for that it importeth that all the Armies doe go close together, doe commaund that the General and wings with great care, do procure to carie the Squadrons as nigh and in as good order, as is possible: and the Ship and Pinnesses of the charge of Don Antonio de Hartado de Mendosa, keepe next vnto the Admirall, except sixe: whereof, two shall followe the Admirall Don Pedro de Valdezi, and two the Admirall of Martine Bretendona: the other two the Admirall of Ioan Gomes de Medina: the which shall be appoynted presently, and haue great care to repart themselues, without the one thwarting the other: and the Squadron of
nor any that goeth with them shall depart, without my license: And do commaunde vpon payne of death, and losse of goodes, that if by chaunce with a storme any bee driuen to depart before they come to the Cape Finister, that then they followe their course to the sayd Cape, where they shall haue my order what to doe: or else they shall sayle to the Groyne, where they shall haue it.
they shall set their course for Silley, and procure to make the Sowtherside of it, hauing great care of their sounding: And if by chaunce in this course any shippe or shippes doe loose the Fleete, they shall not returne into Spayne, in any manner, vpon payne of death and the losse of goodes, and taken for Traytors, but followe the course, and make to the Southward of the sayd Iland.
And if any such doe thinke the Nauie to bee asterne of him, he shall detaine himselfe in the same height playing vp and downe, and not to depart from his course.
And if it bee thought that the Nauie is a head, then shall you seeke them in Monts bay,
which is betwixt the Lands end and the Lizard, there shall you haue the whole Nauie, or
intelligence what he shall do: and yet for all this, if he do not meete with the Nauie, yet shall he finde Pinnesses with order what shal be done.
In the night there shall be great vigilance for the Admiral, to see if she change her course, or make about.
Before she goeth about, she will shoot off a peece: and being about, wil put foorth an other light vpon the Poope a parte from the Lanterne: who that doth see it, shall aunswer with an other light.
When he doth take away Bonnets, or shorten the Sayles, he shall shewe lights, one in the Poope, and other two shrowed high.
When that for any occasion he shall strike all Sayles, he shall shewe three lights, one in the toppe, an other in the Shrowdes, and the third in the and the rest shall shew it, with putting foorth a light each vpon his Poope.
If any Ship haue any occasion to strike al her Sayles in the night, he shall shoote off a great peece, and put out a Lanterne all night, and those that are nighest vnto him shal shew lights, for that other may procure it, and shall take in the Sayles till day: And if necessitie be great, shal shoot off an other peece, and those
that do see it, shall aunswer with other two lights, making the like boord.
When the Admirall will haue any communication, he wil make a signe,
putting a flagge in the after misne neere the Lanterne, and so they shall repayre vnto him to know what he would haue.
If (which God for his mercie permit not) there happen any Shippe to take fire, the next vnto her shall make from her,
sending first their Boates and Skiffes to succour and helpe, and so shall all the rest.
They shall haue particular care to put foorth their fire in euery Shippe,
the Souldiers shall let them that haue the charge thereof, to deliuer it, so that the sayd Souldiers shall not go downe to take it, nor choose it perforce, as in times they haue done: and for this cause shall bee present the Sergeant or Corporall of the companie or companies where they are, for auoyding disorder, and that timely they haue their portions: so that before night euery bodie may haue supped.
That no shippe nor other vessel of this Nauie, nor of any of those,
my iurisdiction, shall not bee so bold to enter into any Harborough, ancker, nor goe a shore, without the Admirall doth do it first, or with my speciall leaue, vpon payne of punishment hereof.
The Corenalls of the fielde, Captaines, Lieftenants, Ensigne and officers, must haue particular care, that the Souldiers haue alwaies their Armour cleane, readie and in order, for time of necessitie: causing the~ to make them cleane twise euery weeke, and vsing themselues with them in such sort, that they may be expert at the time of neede.
And for that in the way order shal be giuen in what forme euery man shall put himselfe, if we do fight, do commaund that particular care bee had, aduising the Gunners to haue halfe Buts with water and vineger, as is accustomed, with Bonnets and olde Sayles, and wet Mantels to defend fire, that as often is throwne, as to haue the like care to haue shot made in good quantitie,
and that pouder and match be readie for Ship, and Soldiers of the store by waight, measure and length: according to the order that euery Ship hath to deliuer vnto him that hath the charge thereof according to vse and custome.
that all Souldiers haue their roume cleane and vnpestered of Chestes, and other thinges, without consenting in any case to haue Cardes: and if there be any, to be taken away presently: neither permit them to the Marriners: and if the Souldiers haue any, let me bee aduertised, that may commaund them to be taken away.
And for that the Marriners must resorte vnto their worke, tackle and Nauigation,
it is conuenient that their lodgings bee in the vpper workes of the poope, and otherwise the Souldiers will trouble them in the voyage.
The Artillarie must stand in very good order, and reparted amongst the Gunners,
being al charged with their balles, and nigh vnto euery peece his locker, wherein to put his Shot and necessaries, and to haue great care to the Cartrages of euery Peece, for not chaunging or not taking fire: and that the Ladles and Spunges be readie at hand.
to throw to profite in the time of fight on the Decke, or toppes, according to his burden: and shall carrie two halfe Pipes, to fil them with water in the day of Battell, and repart them amongst the Ordinance,
or other places, as shall be thought necessarie, and nigh vnto them olde clothes or couerings, which with wetting may destroy any kinde of fire.
That the wilde fire be reparted to the people most expert, that we haue for the vse thereof at due time: for that if it be not giuing charge thereof to those that doth vnderstand it, and such as we know can tel how to vse it: otherwise it may happen to great daunger.
By the commaundement that no ship shall go a head the Admirall, at the least in the night, none shall tarrie a sterne the and euery one to haue a care to the trimming of his Sayles, according to the charge he hath, and the sayling of his ship: for the much that it importeth that all our Nauie do go close as possible as they may: and in this the Captaines, Maisters, and Pilates must haue such great care, as of them is hope~.
These my instructions are deliuered vnto euery Shippe, and haue their copie firmed by my hand, and regestred by my Secretarie, the which shall be read by euery Purser of euery Shippe publikely, to come to the note of all Souldiers and Marriners, whereby they may not pretend ignorance: and to the sayd
Pursers ordaine and command, that thrice in the weeke they be bound to reade these my instructions publikly, and that they take witnesse of the fulfilling hereof, vpon paine of him that doth the contrarie, shall receiue punishment to the example of others.
All the aboue said, we commaund to be manifested, and bee kept without any breach for the seruice of his Maiestie, none to breake them or any parte thereof in no manner, vpon payne they shalbe seuerely punished, euery one according to his estate and offence: all others reserued to our discretion.

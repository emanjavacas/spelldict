to the high court of parliament of the of england scotland and jreland

the humble petition of poore prisoners in the severall prisons in and about london

sheweth that many of your poore inslaved petitioners suffer miserably their imprisonment being most unjust others of your said petitioners by the late sad accidents of warre and their cruell creditors are utterly undone and although some of your petitioners have more owing them by the state then will satisfie the debts they lye for yet all of us by spending what wee either had or could borrow upon lawyers clerkes and solicitors and in bringing up of our witnesses severall times fifty a hundred or two hundred miles some more by order of the judges and in expectation of relief by the late act are by the severall suspendings of the said act and ordinances brought to a perishing condition having spent much and can borrow no more friends and all weary with delayes of justice forsaking us and many lying upon the bare bords for want of meanes
that many who lye as sureties for other men by the severall suspendings of the act and ordinances as aforesaid their expences having been so great are likewise in much misery whilest the principals executors and administrators of those deceased though able to satisfie contrive meanes to obscure and conceale their estates
that your petitioners their wives children and friends and likewise many of their conscientious creditors suffer much whose cryes if man refuse to hearken too the lord will answer to the punishment of all those who obstruct their reliefe seeing to relieve the poore and set the oppressed free is a worke so acceptable to him
your petitioners humble prayer is that during the vacancie of the expected act the judges suspended or some others may bee againe impowred to continue sitting to relieve the poore who are many and those who are undone by the accident of warre and likewise those who lye for other mens debts who are able to satisfie and that those may not perish for bread to whom the state owes more then will satisfe the debts they lye for
and whereas your petitioners finds the charge of bringing up their witnesses to london to bee so great that they may have liberty either upon good security to goe downe and bee tryed in their owne counties where they reside or that their said witnesses may be there examined by the judges or next justices and their examination being sent up may be accepted of by the iudges heare seeing the poverty of your petitioners is so great that many must lye and perish for want of meanes to bring their witnesses up to london

and your petitioners shall ever pray

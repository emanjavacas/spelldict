my love come to thee

figure

you damsels now of beauty bright it is to you these lines write your cruelty give e'er and do not here like tyrants reign and kill those with your high disdain which doth your charms adore

a young man lately lov'd a maid to whom he often sighing said my dear some pitty show
and yield to me some kind relief or else my heart will break with grief twill prove my overthrow

ten thousand thoughts runs in my head when lying on my restless bed and tears like fountains flow oh let thy frowns to blessings turn for if in love longer burn twill prove my overthrow

figure

will not my sighs some pitty move behold the pleasant charms of love in e'ry vein does slow some comfort to thy servant give without thy love cannot live twill prove my overthrow

the scornful damsel did reply your suit utterly defie pray from my presence go tis strange that love should be so hot your life or death value not or eke your overthrow

each word was like a killing dart which pierc'd the young man to the heart he streight from her did go with a most discontented mind he often sighing said find she'll prove my overthrow

his scorching love straightway did turn unto a feaver which did burn he straight to bed did go from whence he never did arise but often said with sighs and cries love proves my overthrow

now shall never see thee more whom so dearly did adore since you no kindness show i'll dye a martyr for thy sake and with these words his heart did break love proves my overthrow

the maidens reply

now when this damsel she did hear the death of her beloved dear she wept most bitterly to his grave with grief she run and cried out what have done my frowns has murder'd thee

with grief and cares am opprest that night and day take no rest thy ghost methinks see that haunts my person night and day
my love alas what shall say twas that murder'd thee

farewell relations friends and all his bloud doth for just vengeance call kind death must set me free in grave i'll lye down by thy side am not fit to live she cry'd my frowns has murder'd thee

she to her bower did return and never never cease to mourn in tears to that degree that death at length her heart did seize her last and dying words are these my love come to thee

it was her will that she might have a lodging in her lover's grave to which all did agree both their relations thought it fit and on her coffin it was writ my love come to thee

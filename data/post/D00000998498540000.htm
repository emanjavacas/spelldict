portland stone in pauls

e're since the architect of heauens faire frame did make the world and man to vse the same in earths wide wombe as in our nat'rall bed we haue beene hid conceal'd and couered

where many thousand ships haue sailed by

but knew vs not and therefore let vs lye

till at the last and very lately too some builders hauing building worke to doe and time be'ing come we could no longer tarry but must be borne from out our earthly quarry we were discouer'd and to london sent and by good artists tryde incontinent

who finding vs in all things firme sound fairer and greater then are found fitter for cariage and more sure for weather then oxford ancaster or beerstone eyther

did well approue our worth aboue them all

vnto the king for seruice at

where being quickly come as quickly we had welcome to his sacred maiesty and for our humblenesse full many a day were still exalted highest euery way in workes of most perspicuous eminence which in all buildings haue preheminence

as columnes cornish capitals and basis in fillets frise in ornaments and facis in architraues in pedistals and pillars
and as the onely best of our

hi
highnesse now our seruice doth preferre

vnto the church to ioyne and dwell with her

so that from one good montaigne to another and fro our to this we come apace and are preparing aye to cure her euils and her great decay to be her front her bulwarke and defence and also to renue her excellence where hymnes and haleluiahs shall be sung with praises to the lord by old and young from day to day and so from yeare to yeare till christ his second comming doth appeare

happy age wherein such things are done

thrice happy we that now may see the sunne and be vnited to this sacred place a grace to vs beyond all other grace for thus wee know the truth of truest story all that god made he made for his owne glory and at one time or other come to light to doe man seruice and their maker right that very senslesse things may him adore and magnifie his holy name therefore
blessed god preserue our royall iames honor his name among the honor'd names

of best precedent kings that euer stood

renown'd for wisedome and for doing good make him a second salomon a peerlesse iemme in these his kingdomes this his ierusalem lengthen his dayes his treasure still increase and let him liue and dye a king of peace

so blesse lord our high mighty charles and then the names of barons peers and earles· the worthy knights and gentry of this land that to this worke doe set their helping hand
the bishops clergy citie country all and as our duties binde in speciall

this reu'rend bishop for his loue to vs

let him be famous as mavritivs

anno
this church of saint paul was much wasted by fire and worthy mauritius here mentioned then bishop of london beganne a new foundation thereof in manner as now it is vpon arches and vaults of stone for defence of fire
in which worke he continued a constant and a bountifull benefactor for yeares together and then dyed after him viz anno succeeded bishop eaumer who wonderfully encreased the same church for yeares more purchasing at his owne costs the large streets and lanes round about it which he beganne to compasse about with a strong wall of stone and gates

long liu'd as nestor and in euery way

happy and prosperous till his dying day that still he may this famous church aduance in gaining her both coine and countenance till such a noble register be seene of benefactors as hath neuer beene in any age or any worke before and till he say enough there needs no more

and cause no mourning in our streets may be with such as feare demolishment to see
lord for thy names sake let it be thy pleasure the rather to encrease that pious treasure

that euery one may haue some satisfaction

to gaine their prayers in so good an action and that two noble workes together may be brauely done to all true subiects ioy and through the world this fame may euer ring pitty did raigne in bishop lord and king mercy and iustice were so met in one that iustice scarce from mercy could be knowne

so for a nation pittifull and loyall great britaine shall winne praise past all deniall
no man shall need to grieue or to lament for's place of custome or demolishment

and blessings many will the worke attend from the beginning to the very end

but yet though pitty here we doe request that none may thinke themselues too much opprest let such as must depart their houses know no winde so calme or warme did euer blow nor euer was a worke so good as this but that with some it blew or went amisse

then sith herein the wind blowes somwhat ill for such as ioyne to pauls against her will that haue impair'd her strength by vaults cellars to make more roome for buyers and for sellers

let them with patience endure some losse

and for the worke sake beare a little crosse not grudgingly or by pronouncing wrong cause ther's their custom there they liued long or though desire of gaine's a grieuous tempter there is a prouerb bids them caueat emptor
and ne'rethelesse their custome and their trade this house of god must new againe be made

was it not example scurrilous and rude at first to grant that trades should there intrudel nay are they not accursed that did yeeld to make gods courts a merchandizing field

may we not call them beasts euen to their faces

that like bruit beasts defile such sacred places things consecrated vnto pous vses is't fit that they should suffer foule abuses is there no ciuill difference or ods twixt cleane and vnclean things mans house gods shold christians bones be dig'd out of their graues and laid with dogs bones in the fields by knaues that so more roome vnder the church foundation may be for in a beastly fashion no easment but against the no other place to pisse or make laystals

no way to passe with burthens but throgh pauls wher burthend co~sciences shold ease their soules and cause she is materiall as men tearme her is it materiall therefore they should harme her

looke well about thee reader and then see whether such things as these ought so to be and after due consideration had then tell if therewithall god can be pleased well or if there doe belong no curse or woe to such as first gaue way to wrong her so or if it were a credit to our nation at all to grant so base a toleration

for we doe know thou wilt agree with vs

to hold it vile and sacrilegious and all good men that after looke vpon her will say tis to this land a great dishonor

that we had such gifts of tongue and pen as there is giuen to some sonnes of men that by perswasiue reasons we might winne th abusers of gods house to know their sinne that with their soules they might no longer flatter but vnderstand it is a haynous matter and will be punished before mens eyes when all things wronged shall in iudgment rise

but we are blockish yet not past our letters

and being diuine we leaue it to our betters

so now you workmen listen what we say you are so call'd by work and not by play if euer you were masters of your trade make this best that ere you made
tis for the church and therefore doe not spare your best aduice skill diligence and care and as some wayes you stand on reputation so labour now to get the commendation

not for precedency lest then you erre

for alls one here both free and forreyner and as she doth receiue all sorts to prayer so any any good surueyor she may retaine to gaine her reparation as for the church is vs'd in euery nation
and yet we hold it were both sinne and pitty sith liue in this renowned citie good artists honest paying scot and lot if more then others they should be forgot but rather be preferr'd in some degree before a stranger whatsoe're he be

and cause our writer a poore is

we hope these words no man can take amisse for what he write's according to his oath which to infringe we know he will be loath that is the cities honor to maintaine and also to aduance her honest gaine

so once againe we doe reuiue our muse and to all workmen doe more counsell vse learne by the scriptures what you ought to doe let them direct your hands and conscience to

ezra ne'miah chronicles and kings and haggai vvill shew you many things

how iustly men did worke about the temple

which there is registred for your example and with what ioy and loue they did proceed the booke of god will shew you if you reade for happy was that man that could deuise most curious worke to grace that edifice or hee whose purse or person could present ought that might help to make her excellent
lead timber stone brasse iron some men gaue some lyme some sand some glasse to make her braue· and laborers like bees did labor truly obseruing all their times and houres most duly

then if your owne gaine you doe only plod

you are vnworthy for the house of god for if you worke by or by day your pay shall be as iust as ere was pay and therefore tis expected you should bee not sparing in your worke but francke and free

some men there are will maintain to ones face but such we hold both lewd and very base that in a worke for king or church they may trifle the time by loytring and delay

some will be working hard but when d'ee thinke iust when they haue no come or trust for drinke

or when the clocke is neare the stroke eleuen

and say they haue so wrought e're since twas seauen or when some officer they doe espie that otherwise cashiers them presently

some with their rules do fidle vp and downe as if they did more worke then all the towne but mark them wel giue them their due check for one weeks work almost three daies they lack

some spend much time in finding fault and so to picke a thanke will nimbly runne or goe till at the last the seed which they haue sowne brings forth a fruit more fit to be their owne

some haue the gift of working more then some

vntill a holiday or sunday come
but then vvhat they haue got sixe dayes before they vvill consume it if'tvvere ten times more mean while poor vvines children liue ful bare hoping vvhen husbands come of better fare and they returne vvhen all the vvorke is done as poore as iob or as the unthrist sonne

some haue their jobs to doe in other places and so they vvorke like ianus vvith tvvo faces and from that taske that longest vvill remaine they oftentimes an houre or tvvo vvill gaine

but hee that in this worke proues such a lobber

is but a kinde of sacrilegious robber

others at euery one that by them walke will to their fellowes haue some thing to talke while their tongues are tatling tis their course to hold their hands and that is ten times worse

so there are other some· that for a need when hempe is scarce will onely buy and looke about as if nought were their taske but for to answer all that men will aske and thinke it is a colour fit t'excuse the precious time they wrongfully abuse

these like some schollers that are sent to schools

haue a good conscience though not little fooles and make the prouerb true doth stand of euery little thing they take in hand with whom to liue a faithfull clarke ath works as good goe dwell with saracens and turkes
but now we thinke no man will be so rude
and thus in charitie wee doe conclude

finis

pauls merrily yet modestly

if preachers now will speake for me in where they be and all good hearts agree in one then farewell my complaint and moane

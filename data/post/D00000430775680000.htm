sir

have heard men no novices in the world often say that the fals of the wise are oftentimes dangerous unto them if not wholly mortall with much pain and toil they rise and recover themselves if ever at all
wish some reason may be given for it which will bear good colour of probabilitie if not of certaintie
envie and admiration attend notable and transcendent abilities as well as conspicuous and eminent fortunes both strike at them both wound them though severall nay almost contrary wayes envie flies at his throat openly detracting him and therefore is so farre from hurting a prudent and well poysed man that though little thanks to the esteem'd she maketh him more advised and circumspect but admiration claspeth with him and by slights better discovered by the fact done then by the predominacy in doing betrayes a man to himself and holds him a slave within his own doores not permitting

him to walk abroad as formerly and to behold and view the counsels resolutions proceedings reasons and concurrences of other men if not equall yet may be not much cast behinde with the and supporter wheron they may stand which kind of treason is the more to be dreaded by how much the remedie of release is difficult the partie thus enthralled not being contrived by seducement into a peremptory conceipt of the weight of his own sufficiencie or demerits but absolutely possessed with a tantum non mates and ties up his very will from ever inclining to other condition then what he is already in or to other freedome then what he shall think to be so although in the intellectuall eye of all the rest it be most miserable thraldome and the depth of slavery taking no mans dimensions but his own judging and blaming the course of the sunne of other mens judgement by his own diall sir edward sir edward to leave sentencing and to come in honest plainnesse to it fear admiration hath been more your foe then envie the world so doting upon your accomplishments both innate acquired as wel it might set you so idolatrously above others that at last you stepped up above your self scanning the words and conceptions of others if not with a diffident difference yet with a reserved distance expecting that what you either voted or writ should be taken as authorized if not enacted and verily to give you your due not to deprive or deprave you in the least title of what by the court of every honest understanding conscience for almost sixteen moneths worthy deportment and unmatchable heedfull travail amongst those peerlesse worthies for

the good both of israel and sion church and state you may justly challenge you behaved your selfe like a true nathaniel in whom was no guile found or suspected like another apollos with the edge of your powerfull rhetorick with the hammer of your sound and profound arguments wounding and bruising the notorious though mighty delinquerts both of church and state and had surely carried that ever flourishing trophee of neverdying praise and high commendation of a happy procurer the good and endles welfare of gods people here in england and left it as an honor entayled to your family had you but remembred those words of our saviour endure unto the end
sir edward you know full well that perseverance is called regina virtutum
suppose the reason may be this because that though all other vertues may run strive and doe masteries yet onely perseverance is crowned
but alas sir you have made a forfeit of that crown with more willingnesse or wilfulnesse is hard to say your own strength becomming the cause of your fall pray god not of your ruine physitians say that the most dangerous diseases arise from the superfluity of the best humor viz the blood nay that the much abounding of pure and good blood is a disease it selfe and further that the corruption of the purest humour is ever as most perilous so most noysome it is often so seen in the humours
mean qualities and endowments of the mind and wish the world might not bring in yours for instance yours sir edward which are turned from the very best to the very worst by a strange catastrophe if any ever was rather procuring astonishment then wonderment

you have given such president that puting my lord digbie aside trust in that right honourable right worthy and religious assembly you shall never twice be parallel'd that a third should be found amongst them so hypocrising and deluding the expectation of all right honest men that not onely relied but wholly confided themselves as to betray as much as in you both lay the cause both of god the church and the country wheeling and veering about whether some unexpected glance or courtly glimmering happily invited you forgetting wholly what you were and not well resolving with your self what you would be only not content with what the kingdome had appropriated lately vnto your deserts you were ambitious that whatsoever came of it you would administer larger matter of discourse vnto them yea in malam partem rather then none is it possible sir that you who were so vehement yea and the very first so vehement in malignam partem should now after so long personating vpon the stage and in the third act as the world may judge acquit them and condemn your self is it possible sir edward that you who shewed your self not onely so reall but also valiant against the straffordian faction should be poysoned with the dregs of that cup and you that abhorred the brim should now hunt after the lees and shew your selfe for that party at least for those tenents when that they cannot appeare or at least dare not stirre for themselves did you so cordially as it seemed to the whole house adjudge and condemn the lord george digbie for counterfeiting if not disavowing himself and his own actions and are you the next man who is

guilty of the same crime did you at the first sitting down of this happy parliament so parthetically cry out upon the patriarch of lambeth and his mytred brethren protesting that you had rather or at least with as much devotion have been subject vnto tybur as vnto lambeth and is the wind come about so suddenly so vnexpectedly surely then we must not suddenly hereafter for strong pretences cry up men except we may further guesse which is hard what lyes hid within the buttons

but you are adjudged for your misdemeanor vnworthy to be counted a member of that vnquestionable assembly and held for your trespasse that may not say crime worthy of another place whom shall wee blame for this the house or you let others judge as they list but for my part am of opinion that a drop may be more easily corrupted then the whole ocean and that it is more safe if not more wise to condemne particular persons then a general state you that of late have bin so stiffe for supposed vniversals will give me leave in this point to cleave vnto a true one sir not to be longer tedious unto you let me crave pardon to tell you what think of your miscariage which in honest tearms take to be this the hearkening vnto them that had no way to patronize their own foul facts but by the interposing this of yours not any course left to work their own safety but by the drawing of more company misery purchased by bad deserts is often found malitious thinking to raise it self but by sucking in others vnder it judg charitably deeming that your error sprang first rather from suggestion then choice but when you saw your self so far ingag'd

in it that the world taking notice of it you mut either retreat with a peccavi or proceed with a sic volo you rather chose vtter shipwrack then to be voiced to have leaked sir at parting must tell you the truth and you must be content to hear it by this late vnfortunate carriage of yours were it in writings words or both you have lost more to your self wel wishers then ever fear you know how to repaire and thus desiring of god that hee would give you a true sight of it to acknowledge it and in that right honorable assembly an inclination if not totally to remit yet compassionatly to mittigare your punishment for it and to all others yet standing an heedfull and diligent observation to take example by it and with hearty sorrow that a star in all good mens opinion yea and wise mens also so fixed should at last prove if not a meteor yet a planet with affectionate and sympathizing griefe take my leave and remain yours wherein with fair devoyr may serve you

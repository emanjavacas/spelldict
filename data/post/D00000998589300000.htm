and in his examination being demanded of which side he would be whether for king or parliament this examinant answered that he was for both
the lord paulet answered that all the parliament that were for the militia were proclaimed traytors and were rogues and that earle meaning sir walter earle of whom they had had conference before was the wickedest rogue of them all and one of the divels limbs and so they were all and the said sir ralph hopton spake the same and the said other gentlemen spake to the same effect and that they were come thither to keep a parliament themselves and that the king would be there shortly to assist them with a great army and if it had not been for earle and such rogues these tumults and sturres had not been and the said sir ralph hopton further saith that we may see the hand of god to be with them in protecting them being but a small number and they great in number that were against them and that they being shot twice at with many shots and bullets about their eares yet were not touched by one of them and that their company shot but once and killed two men and maimed or hurt fifteen more that those that took up armes for the parliament were bloud sucking rogues and these their words they confirmed with many oaths further sir ralph hopton demanding what strength there was in dorchester this examinant answered there were

six great gunnes the said ralph replyed that those gunnes did belong unto them and they would have them and would cut off all the in the land

thought fit to let you understand in what posture sherburne stands in the lord marquesse of hartford and his two sonnes and his brother the lord seymor the lord paulet and his two eldest sonnes and of somerset knights hopton stowell and rodney and of the gentry iohn coventry and the rest who accompanied him at wells yet keep with him and the two lunsfords and are fortifying

the castle at sherburne their strength not exceeding six hundred horse and foot against whom are marching the earle of bedford with his six hundred horse and about eighteen great pieces of ordnance from bristoll besides twenty thousand horse and foot at least out of somersetshire and great companies out of dorsetshire who promise to bee at sherburne at a dayes warning which causeth the lords and cavaliers to droope and to desire a free passage and it is thought they will endeavour it this day
yesterday the marquesse sent a letter to my neighbour master harby one of the deputy lievtenants for the militia desiring his assistance and advice he desired to be conducted to poole and from thence by sea to his owne house as is conceived
what will bee the issue wee know not yet our country men are angry they took him not at wells who then visited the bishops pallace where they did not hurt but to his wine pictures organs
purpose god willing to stay here and expect the issue
